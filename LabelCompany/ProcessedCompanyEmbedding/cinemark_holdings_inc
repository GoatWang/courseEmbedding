founded while they claim they started in  and previously claimed they started in  online records show cinemark might have started as late as  with the opening of the movies  texarkana in  cinemark began building theaters with colorful interiors and large video game arcades the following year cinemark introduced its front row joe mascot this animated cat appeared in policy trailers and on kids concession products the mascot was retired in  when cinemark had begun to open art decostyle theatres however it was revived in  and is still used today though in recent years they have winded down

mitchell worked with the company as an executive until leaving in  to found showbiz cinemas united states department of justice lawsuitsedit in the s cinemark theatres was one of the first chains to incorporate stadiumstyle seating into their theatres in  several disabled individuals filed a lawsuit against cinemark alleging that their stadium style seats forced patrons who used wheelchairs to sit in the front row of the theatre effectively rendering them unable to see the screen without assuming a horizontal position the case was heard in el paso district court as lara v cinemark usa where a judge ruled that the architecture of cinemarks theatres violated the americans with disabilities act the ruling was later overturned by the fifth circuit court of appeals which ruled that cinemark only had to provide an unobstructed view of the screen and that since handicapped patrons view was only awkward and not actually obscured cinemark was not violating the law in response the united states department of justice filed their own suit against cinemark while appealing the appellate courts decision the doj argued that while cinemark was not technically violating the ada it was nevertheless discriminating against handicapped patrons by relegating them to the worst seats in the auditorium cinemark responded by filing a lawsuit against the department of justice alleging misconduct on the dojs behalf cinemarks lawsuit was thrown out and the department of justice proceeded with its lawsuit cinemark ultimately agreed to settle out of court before the court came to a ruling agreeing with the doj that it was in the companys best interest to end litigation before a ruling was issued per the terms of the settlement cinemark agreed to renovate all existing theatres to provide wheelchairbound and other handicapped patrons access to rows higher in its theatres and also agreed that all future theatres would be constructed so as to allow handicapped patrons better access to higher rows in turn the department of justice agreed not to bring further litigation against the company in relation to the architecture of stadium seating as it applies to the ada political causesedit in  ceo alan stock donated  toward the successful passage of californias proposition  an initiative restricting the definition of marriage to oppositesex couples and overturning the

in a century theater in aurora colorado killing  people and injuring  others the gunman later identified as james eagan holmes who was believed to be acting alone entered the theater dressed in protective clothing set off tactical grenades then opened fire with multiple firearms on the theatergoers counting both fatalities and injuries the attack was the largest mass shooting in terms of number of casualties in united states history at the time the theater was reopened on january   the theater was sued by victims families who alleged the theater may have taken greater measures to prevent the shooting after years of legal battling a jury took three hours to deliver a unanimous verdict that the theater chain was not liable to any degree for the tragedy that transpired and the judge allowed the theater company to submit a bill of costs to recover expenses imposed on it due to the litigation as colorado state law allows for prevailing parties the theater chain has a pending motion in state court for certain cost reimbursements in the amount of  a separate group of victims were also dismissed in federal court when us district judge r brooke jackson ruled that killer james holmes’ own ‘premeditated and intentional actions were the predominant cause of the plaintiffs’ losses’ legal analysts cited in news outlets opined that the theater company will likely refrain from seeking costs from the plaintiffs and argued costs may have been submitted to dissuade appeals from being filed by the plaintiffs’ attorneys which would further prolong the tragedy see alsoedit list
