fernandez grades his first  months on the job  billboard billboard cbs radio chief andre fernandez grades his first  months on the job  by phyllis stark facebook twitter email me print comments john paul filocbs  andre j fernandez while working for general electric in mexico and brazil andre fernandez relied on local radio to help him become fluent in spanish and portuguese not to mention developing his passion for bossa nova music so it’s fitting that as president of cbs radio he now oversees a group that encompasses 7 stations in  markets sadly he notes with a laugh none play bossa novaat just 7 fernandez has already held senior executive positions at telemundo united technologies corp ge and most recently journal communications where he served as presidentcoo until taking the helm of cbs radio in april  in his first  months on the job fernandez says he has worked to create “more of a culture of innovation and risktaking” something he thinks the radio industry as a whole needs considerably more of that helped earn him a spot on billboards recently published  power  listno  andre j fernandez  billboard power as the diversity of his résumé can attest fernandez believes in reinventing himself professionally every so often “i’ve had to do that many times in my career” he says “i’ve worked in a lot of different industries and a lot of different countries and companies and settings and that requires that you’re constantly making adjustments and taking risks and having to — in a way —recreate yourself over and over again it certainly gets tiring but it probably allowed me to get to this point at this age in my career and it’s exciting and challenging”raised in brooklyn as the son of a professional musician father and dancer mother fernandez earned an economics degree at harvard before launching his career on wall street first as a banking associate with brown brothers harriman in new york and then as assistant vp for merrill lynch working in both new york and london he currently resides in connecticut with his wife and their three childrenwhat is the biggest issue facing the radio businessthis industry needs to continue to innovate when i look at a lot of the streaming services and a lot of digital development i’m actually surprised sometimes that more hasn’t been done or developed by traditional overtheair broadcasters … they need to invest more in rd and to experiment and for some reason they don’t or they haven’t … companies need to have the courage to plow profits back into rd and if they do i think they can ensure their futurethat’s probably the biggest issue that i see having come from ge a large industrial company where research and development and what we used to call “npi” — new product introduction — are just so key to your business and where many millions of dollars are spent every year i just don’t see that as much or at times at all in this industry and i think the industry needs itwhat is one industry prediction you have for i wouldn’t be surprised if eventually you saw a merger among the streaming companies or an acquisition or a merger between a pure streaming company and a traditional overtheair broadcaster the streaming companies have gotten very creative in innovating things digitally that overtheair broadcasters probably should have done but certainly could learn from so i wouldn’t be surprised if you saw either a merger among streamers or some overtheairstreaming combinationsis that something you’re looking to do at cbsi don’t think so because i’ve been very pleased with our digital efforts there was a decision some six or seven years ago at cbs to combine the digital efforts of local television and our radio business in a single group and that’s our cbs local digital media so my digital efforts sit between tv and radio and they’re two or three hundred people strong they’re some of the most creative people that i’ve ever worked within most markets or nearly all in which we operate we’re clearly the digital leaders because of that step years ago … i feel like i’ve been handed something very valuable here we are very far ahead in terms of our digital effortsif you could rate yourself on the first  months on the job what are some things that you are most proud of having accomplished at cbs so farthere are a lot of things that i needed to focus my time on inward to make us a better business those things included improving certain processes making sure that we had a better overall operating rigor that there was bettercommunication among the different team members and constituents on the team better transparency faster decisions clarity of decisionmaking i also think that we’ve got a clear more concise business strategy too there’s now a culture where people can express their point of view take some risks take chances is there more of that to come or will the next year shift your focus from looking inward to looking outwardthere was a lot of that in the beginning that needed to get done now we can shift externally and execute more on our strategy … it frees me up to be much more externally focusedwhat is one of your leadership philosophiesso much depends on your reputation guard it with your life i work and lead by the highest standards of ethics and honesty and i expect that of my team i got some of the greatest compliments at my last company journal when we were sold to the ew scripps company and a number of board of directors members told me when i was leaving “you were always true to your word and we never felt nervous or had any surprises with you because you always did exactly what you said you were going to do the company performed always how you said it was going to perform and because of that we always felt that we were in good hands”is there anything you collect as a hobbyi’m at a phase of my life where i’m uncollecting i want more simplicity i think in this era people just amass too many things i actually don’t think it’s healthy you spend so much of your time in your life collecting and managing and caring for the things you’re collecting i wonder if that’s really time well spent this article first appeared in billboards country update  sign up here facebook twitter email me print comments comments
