the development of sustained release drug delivery products for treating eye diseases today announced that the us food and drug administration fda has approved iluvien® for the treatment of diabetic macular edema dme it is indicated for patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure iop a single injection of the iluvien microinsert provides sustained treatment of dme for  months approximately  people in the us are estimated to have clinically significant dme the most frequent cause of vision loss in individuals with diabetes and the leading cause of blindness in young and middleaged adults in developed countries iluvien is expected to be commercially available in the us in early  fda approval of iluvien entitles psivida to a  million milestone from its licensee alimera sciences psivida will also be entitled to  of the net profits from sales of iluvien in the us fda approval of iluvien our third fdaapproved product for retinal disease provides an important treatment option for dme patients in the us the majority of whose dme despite antivegf intraocular injections as frequently as monthly is not optimally managed iluviens clinical trials showed that iluvien can actually reverse vision loss in many dme patients another advantage of iluvien over existing therapies is that a single injection provides sustained therapy for three years said paul ashton phd president and chief executive officer of psivida the  million milestone will help finance our ongoing product development program including medidur™ for posterior uveitis and tethadur™ for the sustained delivery of biologics added dr ashton psivida is independently developing medidur an injectable sustained release microinsert of the same design and delivering the same drug as iluvien for the treatment of chronic posterior uveitis the third largest cause of blindness in the us the company plans to seek fda approval of this product on the basis of its ongoing single phase iii clinical trial enrollment of this study is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of calendar  iluvien is already commercially available in the uk and germany and has received or is pending marketing approval in seventeen other eu countries for the treatment of patients with the chronic dme insufficiently responsive to available therapies we are very pleased that the fdas approval of iluvien is not limited as in the eu to the subset of patients with chronic dme patients who have failed other therapies or patients who have had cataract surgery continued dr ashton iluvien is an injectable microinsert that provides sustained treatment through continuous delivery of a submicrogram dose of the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide for  months current standardofcare therapy requires antivegf injections into the eye as frequently as monthly and studies show that over  percent of patients are not optimally managed with this treatment fda approval was based on clinical trial data that showed that at month   percent of patients receiving iluvien experienced an improvement from baseline in their best corrected visual acuity on the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study etdrs eye chart of  letters or more this improvement in vision was maintained through  months the end of the trials about iluvien® iluvien® fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant  mg is a sustained release intravitreal implant approved in the united states to treat dme in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure each iluvien implant is designed to release submicrogram levels of fluocinolone acetonide fac a corticosteroid for  months corticosteroids have a history of effective use in treating ocular disease inflammation iluvien is injected in the back of the patients eye with an applicator that employs a gauge needle which allows for a selfsealing wound in the fame™ study a phase  clinical study of iluvien the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions included cataract development and increased ocular pressure iluvien important safety information iluvien contains a corticosteroid and is indicated for the treatment of dme in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure intravitreal injections have been associated with endophthalmitis eye inflammation increased intraocular pressure and retinal detachments patients should be monitored following the injection use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts increased intraocular pressure glaucoma and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria fungi or viruses the implant may migrate into the anterior chamber if the posterior lens capsule is not intact in controlled studies the most common adverse reactions reported were cataract development and increases in intraocular pressure patients are advised to have followup eye examinations at appropriate intervals following treatment with iluvien full prescribing information will be available at httpwwwaccessdatafdagovscriptscderdrugsatfda about dme diabetic macular edema the primary cause of vision loss associated with diabetic retinopathy is a disease affecting the macula the part of the retina responsible for central vision when the blood vessel leakage of diabetic retinopathy causes swelling in the macula the condition has progressed to dme the onset of dme is painless and may go undetected by the patient until it manifests with the blurring of central vision or acute vision loss the severity of this blurring may range from mild to profound loss of vision the wisconsin epidemiologic study of diabetic retinopathy found that over a year period approximately  percent of people with diabetes studied were diagnosed with dme all people with type  or type  diabetes are at risk of developing dme as the population of people with diabetes increases the annual incidence of diagnosed dme is expected to increase as well duration of diabetes is the greatest risk factor for increased retinopathy and is associated with an increased prevalence of dme the appearance of retinopathy is associated with an upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor vegf causing an increase in permeability of vessels leading to leakage of fluid as retinopathy worsens an upregulation of multiple cytokines inflammatory factors takes place corticosteroids offer a broad effect on down regulation of multiple cytokines associated with dme that persists about psivida corp psivida corp headquartered

noninfectious inflammatory disease affecting the posterior segment of the eye often involving the retina which is believed to be a leading cause of blindness in the developed and developing countries it affects people of all ages producing swelling and destroying eye tissues which can lead to severe vision loss and blindness in the us posterior uveitis affects between    people  today patients with posterior uveitis are typically treated with systemic steroids but over time frequently develop serious side effects that can limit effective dosing patients then often progress to steroidsparing therapy with systemic immune suppressants or biologics which themselves can have severe side effects including an increased risk of cancer the results of the second phase  study confirm the efficacy and safety profile of the durasert threeyear insert demonstrated in the first phase  study  consistent durable control of chronic posterior segment uveitis is a critical goal of treatment  the threeyear durasert insert has the potential to be the first product approved to help prevent the recurrence of this devastating condition for up to three years with a single intravitreal injection commented dr jyotirmay biswas professor of ophthalmology and director of uveitis  ocular pathology department sankara nethralaya ophthalmic center tamil nadu india and primary investigator of the study chronic posterior uveitis is challenging to treat as the disease tends to wax and wane over time  durasert threeyear insert is a singleinjection officebased treatment that can last  years therefore it addresses the need to help prevent recurrences over an extended time period rather than to treat them episodically and may represent an exciting new approach to manage these patients
