objections you may disconnect at this time all participants will be in a listenonly mode until the questionandanswer session of the call i would like to turn the call over to ms kathy guinnessey treasurer and investor relations officer ms guinnessey you may begin kathleen m guinnessey  treasurer and investor relations officer thank you good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today with me on the call this morning are bob carrigan our chief executive officer rich veldran our chief financial officer and josh peirez our president and chief operating officer heres what you can expect on the call today following my brief remarks bob will provide an overview of our first quarter results and an update on our strategy then rich will come on and take you through the highlights of the quarter after that well open the call for your questions to help our analysts and investors understand how we view the business our remarks this morning will include forwardlooking statements our form k and q filings as well as the earnings release we issued yesterday highlight a number of important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from these forwardlooking statements these documents are available on the investor relations section of our website and we encourage you to review the material we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements now from timetotime we speak about deferred revenue as a reminder deferred revenue is a liability that refers to revenue that has not yet been earned and represents products and services that are ode to our customers as the products or services are delivered over time it is recognized as revenue in the income statement deferred revenue is important to management because it provides insight into the health of our future revenues when we refer to the change in deferred revenue we mean before foreign exchange and acquisitions unless otherwise noted during our call today we will be discussing a number of nongaap financial measures which we call as adjusted results as thats how we manage the business for example when we discuss revenue growth well be referring to the nongaap measure revenue growth as adjusted which is revenue adjusted to eliminate the effect on revenue due to purchase accounting fair value adjustments to deferred revenue and also before the effect of foreign exchange when we discuss operating income operating margin and eps these will all be on a nongaap basis which we call as adjusted additionally our as adjusted results exclude the results of discontinued operations when we discuss free cash flow this will be on a nongaap basis excluding the impact of any legacy tax matters potential regulatory fines associated with the ongoing china investigation and potential payments for legal and other matters you can find the reconciliation between these and other nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable gaap measures in the schedule to our earnings release they can also be found in the supplemental reconciliation schedule that we post on the investor relations section of our website we do not provide guidance on a gaap basis because were unable to predict with reasonable certainty the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of noncore gains and charges acquisition and divestiture related expenses and purchase accounting fair value adjustments to deferred revenue these items are uncertain and will depend on several factors including industry conditions and could be material to dun  bradstreets results computed in accordance with gaap later today you will find a transcript of our prepared remarks on our investor relations site with that ill now turn the call over to bob carrigan robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director well good morning everyone and thank you kathy this morning im going to address our first quarter results and provide an update on our overall business im pleased to report that our first quarter results were a little better than we expected on our call in february we told you that we expected organic revenue to be slightly down to flat for the quarter due to the timing of several large contracts that shifted to later in the year in fact organic revenue for the first quarter was flat which was at the high end of our expectations and overall company revenue was up  you might recall that we said that operating income could be down by as much as the midteens as we continue to invest in our strategy instead operating income came in much better than expected down  this improved performance was due to the organic revenue performance and some costs shifting between the first and second quarters so we feel good about the first quarter and  is starting out about as we expected we are on track to deliver our guidance for the year revenue growth between  and  operating income between flat and up  eps between minus  and plus  and free cash flow of  million to  million and with that ill give you an update about whats been going on in the business at dun  bradstreet last quarter i spoke with you at length about all of the execution changes we undertook toward the end of  and early this year to improve sales performance specifically we elevated josh peirez to the role of president and chief operating officer last fall and we put all customerfacing operations under him to unlock the full potential of our multichannel sales organization coming into this year we changed the compensation structure in our sales force to incent new business development for every sales rep we also restructured the organization to reduce friction and to make sure our salespeople and alliance partners are all selling the same way leaving the option of how to buy up to our customers we made some key personnel changes to upgrade our sales force and we made structural changes to remove layers and align incentives to drive new growth this represents a lot of change in a short amount of time and im pleased to say that were starting to see a higher level of cooperation between our direct alliances and emerging businesses channels and customers are benefiting from our multichannel approach to the market we are also seeing successes in product areas where we have focused our strategy let me talk to you a little bit about a few key areas back in january we launched our new cloudbased credit decisioning tool db credit and early reception has been good were seeing customers begin to upgrade to the new platform from dnbi and were getting nice pricing lifts on those conversions we have also started to bring in new customers it is still very early and as we said on our last call we dont expect to see any real movement on the revenue line until late in the year one of the key benefits of launching a cloudbased platform was our ability to upgrade the product easily we are adding new functionality and putting out new releases every few weeks the other big benefit of the cloud is our ability to have a truly global platform db credit is currently available in the us and canada and we are on track to bring it to europe this summer in other areas of risk management we saw nice growth in our supplier risk solutions supplier risk is an area where the global reach of our data gives us a unique advantage meeting new customer needs by leveraging our core capabilities like linkage and identity resolution we help companies monitor downstream supplier risk the job of a chief procurement officer is changing significantly their responsibilities were historically focused on optimizing their supplier base and we help them monitor financial risk and supplier diversity we provide a deeper understanding of who their suppliers are and give them negotiating leverage and we help manage the multiple layers of their supply chain to identify concentration risk but the cpos role has expanded to managing larger strategic risks including preventing business interruption and protecting and enhancing their companys brand and values our supplier risk solutions help customers manage this full spectrum of risks today cpos have a fastgrowing need in what we call responsible business analytics to help them guard against regulatory and reputational risks we help them as they comply with government diversity requirements and monitor global band entity lists as well as meeting their social responsibility commitments like funding suppliers with sustainable business practices and meeting bestinclass ethics standards further the nature of a globalizing economy has magnified newer risks throughout the supply process one area where we have recently focused is human trafficking nearly  million people are victims of forced labor around the world generating an estimated  billion in illegal profit every year according to the international labor organization millions of businesses around the world have accepted the responsibility to shine a bright light on human trafficking and ensure the ethical procurement of goods and services but doing this is a challenge to help companies address the risk we have taken our existing global proprietary content and leveraged public data from the us state department and labor department to create an index to assess a companys risk of being associated with goods and services potentially tied to human trafficking dun  bradstreets human trafficking index is an innovative new use case for our data that fills a need for our customers to address supply chain risks while also helping them to be responsible corporate citizens and its a great example of how we leverage our company linkage capabilities through the duns number to create an integrated view of companies and how theyre all connected which is really important to understand for a modern procurement manager now let me shift over to sales and marketing and specifically the digital advertising market ive spoken in the past about the trend we are seeing in this marketplace where marketers are employing more science than art to engage with new and existing customers we are seeing companies leveraging digital capabilities and data to drive sales and marketing effectiveness in fact the bb digital ad targeting and realtime personalization market has grown to about  billion within this area is programmatic advertising marketers are using data to target their audience more effectively and this is a trend thats moving quite aggressively in the bb arena dun  bradstreets products in the space which we call dun  bradstreet audience solutions are really starting to gain traction as global businesses turn to programmatic advertising to attract new customers marketers have long relied on dun  bradstreet for the best company data to manage their customer information and to target prospects as marketing moves to digital marketers need company data optimized for the digital world the company data alone is not enough thats because companies dont surf the internet read an email or answer a sales call people do we are working to make sure that our customers can access data that tells them what companies to target and just as importantly the right people at those companies to engage with thats where our professional contact data comes in our acquisition of netprospex is paying off in this area allowing us to meet a clear need in the marketplace we are working to onboard our data to move it from offline sources to online solutions to deliver our data in new ways to help our customers identify online target companies most likely to buy their products and services our contact data coupled with our company data onboarded for the digital world and matched to online cookies helps our customers get their advertising in front of the right target and the right decision maker at that target at the right time and by organizing around the duns number our customers can finally connect their offline customer management data with their online advertising campaigns creating that vital bridge between ad tech and marketing tech armed with this complementary company and contact data we have built nearly  unique audiences or segments that our customers can use to target their sales and marketing programs these segments are built off of a variety of anonymized attributes from basic data such as company size revenue industry or job function to more advanced insights such as propensity to buy certain products or even the viability to qualify for a loan or company credit card our multichannel sales strategy is a real advantage in reaching customers with dun  bradstreet audience solutions through our alliances channel weve made our standard customer segment available on the most popular ad tech and data management platforms from oracle adobe google xaxis and nielsen our customers can access the data through the platforms that they are accustomed to using without any need for direct involvement from our sales team and we also offer our customers the ability to create bespoke segments through our global direct sales channel for a more specific customized targeting our supplier risk and audience targeting solutions are great examples of our strategy in action were taking our crown jewel assets and core capabilities and bringing new use cases to market to help our customers deal with new challenges in a rapidly changing global marketplace while we are pleased with the traction were building in these areas there are areas where we want to do better specifically our business in europe was weaker than expected in the quarter over the past few quarters we have talked about the positive momentum we are getting in the compliance space in europe and that continues our pipeline is strong and considerably higher than at this time last year however the sales cycle for compliance products is proving to be longer than we anticipated in most of these cases we have essentially sold the product and the commercial terms if the regulatory and legal issues our customers face internally that is taking the extra time as you know the regulatory environment in financial institutions has become much more complex ultimately we expect to get these deals closed as the end user is anxious to get rolling but getting through their internal approval process is causing nearterm delay so in summary when i look at the entirety of our business we had a good quarter relative to our expectations and were starting the year off on the right foot more importantly im pleased with the changes weve made to our organizational structure and the early traction on innovative new use cases for our data the decisions weve made have us on course to deliver our full year guidance i will now turn the call over to rich veldran who will discuss our first quarter results in further detail rich richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks bob and good morning everyone as bob said our first quarter results were at the high end of our expectations as we said on our last call we expected first quarter organic revenue to be flat to slightly down due to the timing of some large contracts we delivered flat organic revenue and  growth in total revenue our americas segment had revenue of  million which represented  of revenue in the quarter total revenue was up  and organic revenue was up  within the americas risk management was up  in the first quarter due to the inorganic contribution from credibility corp organic rms revenue was down slightly as strong revenue growth in other enterprise risk was offset by declines in trade credit other enterprise risk grew  in the quarter as a reminder the inorganic creditonself revenue from credibility corp is in this category organic revenue in other enterprise risk was also strong due to growth in the lowteens the organic performance was driven by supply management solutions and our dataasaservice solution db direct for risk trade credit was down  in the quarter dnbi declined  which was a little worse than last year although the primary reason for this difference was some shift in customer spending between dnbi and other trade credit solutions the results in overall trade credit were consistent with our performance last year sales and marketing revenue was up  in the quarter with more than half of that growth organic advanced marketing solutions was up  both on an organic and at total basis as a reminder we acquired netprospex in the beginning of january last year so results are now in the organic base revenue from netprospex alliances and audience solutions drove the growth prospecting solutions grew  during the quarter due to the inorganic contribution from credibility corp organic revenue in prospecting was down slightly primarily due to decline in hoovers and mdr shifting to nonamericas revenue was  million in the first quarter which represented  of revenue for the company nonamericas revenue declined  in the quarter there were two primary reasons for the decline first we decided to end our relationship with a competitor in europe who is buying our data as weve talked about before we have some longstanding contracts with companies that have become competitors over time and weve decided not to continue to sell data to one of them the second reason for the decline was due to a few large projects that helped drive growth in the quarter last year that were not repeated this year project revenue can be lumpy and due to the size of these contracts can swing results from quartertoquarter deferred revenue was up  for the company before acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange in the americas deferred revenue increased  and that does not include committed sales with our alliance partners that would have added another point to the balance turning to profitability operating income in the quarter was down  which was better than we expected due to the organic revenue coming in at the high end of our expected range and the timing of some spending that shifted between the first and the second quarters eps declined  in the quarter to  per share eps was impacted by lower operating income and higher interest expense partially offset by a lower tax rate in the quarter in  our full year tax rate was  and we expect the rate in  to be about the same we generated free cash flow of  million during the quarter free cash flow was impacted by higher cash restructuring payments during the quarter that were related to actions that we took in the second half of  as well as higher interest expense and capex all of which was factored into our full year guidance turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with  billion of debt including about  billion of fixed rate senior notes and  million of floating rate debt our cash balance was  million for net debt of approximately  billion so overall we started the year pretty much as expected with some shifts between first quarter and second quarter operating expenses as with previous years we expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first for the second quarter we expect the growth rate for organic revenue and operating income to be about the same as the first quarter before a nice acceleration in the second half and as bob said we are on track to deliver our full year guidance well now open up the call for your questions operator questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of jeff meuler from rw baird jeff your line is now open jeff p meuler  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah thanks just first a clarifying question are you saying organic revenue and operating income about the same on a yearoveryear basis as q and q richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yes thats about the same that is correct jeff p meuler  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thanks and then the partner in europe i guess anything else you can say about that im talking about the competitor that was buying data that youre discontinuing the relationship was this factored into the original guidance range i guess why now how long do you think it takes you to kind of backfill that with better organic results because youre competitively stronger et cetera richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah ill take the first part which is your question about the guidance range so yes that was factored into our guidance range let me ask josh to talk a little bit about the situation and how were thinking about them joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer hey jeff when we got started on this a couple years ago we did look at the portfolio review and really look at where we are able to be most competitive and have the most success in selling our data we identified a few areas primarily in europe where we had longstanding arrangements with competitors and wanted to end those and you saw some of that effect last year on some of those decisions that we made as well and this one was something we knew about well in advance of setting our plan and our guidance and plan for but in the quarter it does have an effect jeff p meuler  robert w baird  co inc broker okay and then on db credit is that included in the dnbi minus  for the quarter and if you could just generally talk about whats the selling motion for db credit especially for an upgrade to an existing customer and whats the implementation look like for them joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer sure hey jeff its josh so let me start with the selling motions we launched a product at the end of january as you know and weve been rolling the product out through a series of free trials in q and also through upgrades with customers who had renewals coming up where we thought that they were a good candidate for us as first movers on to the product so its something where we can approach both new customers and existing for an upgrade we had sales of the offering from both upgrading customers as well as in the new customer acquisition space so far this year were pleased with the customer feedback its been very positive and we continue to release on the product every three weeks adding functionality and planning for a rollout in europe in the summertime we have a good pipeline for the product and the emerging business segment in particular where we think theres a sweet spot for the current version of the product is just ramping up their sales this month so we expect to see even more traction on that beginning late in the second quarter so were very encouraged but its still the early days and given the ratable nature of the product we dont expect to see material impact until very late this year which gets to your question theres a nonmaterial impact from db credit in the dnbi numbers in the quarter jeff p meuler  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thanks josh operator your next question comes from the line of peter appert from piper jaffray peter your line is now open peter p appert  piper jaffray  co broker thanks good morning richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president morning peter peter p appert  piper jaffray  co broker bob or josh can you talk about the economic implications then of the shift from dnbi to db cloud do you have a thought in terms of average price lift you might see as the result of the conversion robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director yeah hey its bob look as i said were just getting going with the launch and the goal is to get an upgrade from our customers and were seeing a nice pricing lift from those early customers that are moving from dnbi to db credit so again weve rolled out in parts of north america weve got our emerging businesses group really starting in earnest just last week really kicking off and then well be in europe by the summer and our ambition is to absolutely delight our customers with this new cloudbased version but it is a little too early to tell as we get going here exactly how successful well be in getting folks to continue with the price lift that were seeing with some of the early customers but that certainly is our ambition and were seeing some really good positive response from our customers in this area and so were really excited to have this in the marketplace and its really great for increasing our competitiveness and just giving a fresh modern global solution for our customers peter p appert  piper jaffray  co broker okay thanks bob rich the shift in expenses from q to q could you give us some further granularity on that and you then went on to say that the – i think you said the second quarter growth dynamic is going to be similar to the first quarter so it doesnt seem like the shift in cost is necessarily having a significant impact on q results do i have that right richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president well yeah heres the story peter its probably about  million id say of cost that shifted out of the first quarter into the second quarter we expected the first quarter to be weaker you may recall coming in so it improved to the detriment to a degree of the second quarter and really all of it was stuff we planned on spending during the course of the year some of the investment spending took a little longer because it sometimes does but we expect it to hit in q we also tightened the belt in a couple of areas but we will spend that money in the second quarter so nothing really changes if i take it up to the full year peter p appert  piper jaffray  co broker got it understood and then im just wondering given the – you sounded – bob you sounded pretty upbeat in terms of your starting commentary im wondering given your upbeat view and the first quarter outperformance maybe at this point youre more comfortable with the higher end of the guidance range robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director good try there peter p appert  piper jaffray  co broker thats a trick question robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director yeah look were feeling good we certainly are reaffirming our guidance for the year look im excited about some of the newer use cases taking hold im excited about the changes weve made in the organization as we continue to optimize it for serving our customers across multiple channels and so i certainly see us achieving our guidance metrics for the year and i am confident about that peter p appert  piper jaffray  co broker okay great thanks bob robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director sure operator your next question comes from the line of shlomo rosenbaum from stifel shlomo your line is now open shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc good morning thank you for taking the question robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director hi shlomo richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president hey shlomo shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc hey can you go over the commentary on q i just did not get it clearly about exactly what youre signaling is the growth yearoveryear the same as it was in q or youre talking about being flat yearoveryear if you can just go over those comments richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah so this is rich if you look at our first quarter we had a flat organic right and we had  decline in op income around that range so flattish in q right and op income a little bit down right thats what wed tell you so similar as we saw in the first quarter the real acceleration will happen in the back half of the year as it usually does but as you know we also had some contracts that shifted out of the first quarter but actually a lot of that comes into the second half of the year as well so all the more reason that the second half will be a lot stronger this year shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thanks and then other enterprise risk management in the americas region you talked about some supplier risk over there is that the kind of thing that its a seasonal thing was that something that youre expecting it was just really strong and im just trying to understand is this hey something where you guys have gotten traction and youre off to the races how should i be thinking about that joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer hey shlomo its josh i think that were excited around a lot of our use cases and suppliers one of them is we identify when we talked about setting up our different lines of business and one of them being around supply the needs of our customers in the space are growing so were well positioned to provide that to them this can show up ratably it can also show up as projects where a customer needs to do a full check against the supplier base so it can be lumpy but it is something that were excited about the growth potential and we do expect it to be a grower for us shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc so is that the kind of thing that theres a big pipeline and we should expect that there should be good growth in each of the quarters of this year im just trying to get underlying whats work and whats not in the business joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer right so yes shlomo we do have a good pipeline we do expect it to be a grower for us yearoveryear but in any given quarter there can be some variability so i cant give you the quartertoquarter answer but overall we do expect it to be a driver of growth shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay great and then in each quarter of last year there was a commentary that alliances would have added two points to the deferred revenue growth and then this quarter were hearing the commentaries that alliances would have added  points deferred revenue growth can you just comment on whats going on over there with alliance sales richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president sure this is rich couple things in play one obviously the base is getting larger so the contribution on the aggregate gets a little bit reduced by that but the reality is its  point difference it was slightly under  this year which rounds to  but a little bit over  last year which rounded to  so its essentially a nonchange shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay so is there any difference in the cadence of those sales or are there more things  richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah i mean couple of things were seeing – if you take up to the higher level of alliances some of the newer alliances contribute to deferred some dont so for instance if you look at audience solutions that does not contribute to the deferred because you book the revenue on that as it goes so it really does depend on the nature of the alliance if you go to our americas alliance growth in the first quarter as youll see in our release it was up  very very strong some of its in deferred some of its not shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc got it okay and then if we think out over the course of the year for the db credit the cloud solution if we look out and you have success over there should we expect that dnbi line to have accelerating declines as you start migrating them or how should we be thinking about this joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer hi shlomo its josh i think first you should think of the trade credit line as a whole as the best indicator of the health of our core trade credit business and right now were consistent yearoveryear for the first quarter as we accelerate into back half to be honest we are looking as we grow that exactly where those revenues will go and rich could have more commentary but you should see the overall trade credit line get healthier later in the year richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah i mean quite frankly we havent decided yet it may make sense for us to just combine trade credit and just give you color or commentary on the moving pieces because it will be a lot harder to actually track at the client in dnbi and then in a lift in the new trade credit solutions so we may just go to reporting total trade credit but we havent made that decision yet we wanted to do whats easiest and best for you to understand the business as we go forward shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and i was just going to squeeze one more in in the emerging businesses can you just talk a little bit about the growth of the credibility business that you bought and also the impact that its had on hoovers in the last two quarters or three quarters you talked about it being helpful to hoovers were still seeing declines in hoovers i know its your pretty big task given the trajectory that business was on but maybe you can give us a little color around both of those items robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director yeah shlomo its bob look emerging businesses is doing quite well it had a good quarter and in fact weve moved some of the inside sales activity in europe weve added to the portfolio of responsibility for emerging businesses so that was an area that has also been in some decline and so we like what we see from emerging businesses what theyre doing in the americas and so theyve taken on even more responsibility in europe and again we just are getting going with db credit with that important channel and with regard to hoovers thats an area where we havent frankly quite addressed the core product reimagination so to speak we havent redeveloped that yet its on our roadmap weve obviously got – db credit was a critical priority and we want to focus to get that right given the size there we have done some innovation around adding concierge services to hoovers so were innovating around the edges of that but we havent addressed the core product as of yet but thats on the roadmap and well get there shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thank you so much robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director sure operator your next question comes from the line of andre benjamin from goldman sachs andre your line is now open andre benjamin  goldman sachs  co thank you good morning robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director good morning andre richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president hey andre andre benjamin  goldman sachs  co my first question really just on europe i know thats the area that you have focused on turning around in terms of execution in the past you touched on some of the reasons for the deceleration and international organic growth being kind of onetime in nature as well as the end of the data relationships so i was just wondering if you can help us kind of compartmentalize how large the onetime piece is versus the customer relationship versus maybe other things so we can figure out how  that business robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director yeah hi andre its bob so look there were a couple of factors at play as we said we did make the strategic decision to not renew a deal with a company that has become a competitor over time in the market and that carries some shortterm pain but it was the right move for us over the long term we also had a couple of big projects in q  that were onetime in nature and made the comp a little tougher we have a pretty healthy pipeline around our compliance offerings particularly in the area of fatca but those deals have been a little slower to close due to the regulatory and legal scrutiny that we talked about i referred in my last answer to the inside sales channel in europe which has also had some compression and so moving that into emerging businesses i think will hopefully be the antidote there and help us to get that back to a place of growth so look we – its a mix of some onetime things but we do need to execute better and i made this very much a key area of focus it remains a priority for us and all those things together weve a real focus around this to get that – to get europe on track andre benjamin  goldman sachs  co you said the relationships with competitors was something started evaluating sometime ago and started to kind of really pushing through renegotiating some of those deals i guess last year are there any other material ones that we should be mindful of that could end up being a shortterm impact on numbers robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director nothing material that i could see on the horizon look were trying to get more competitive in the market this is all part helping our game and improving our performance and we felt like were confident enough that we could make this move which again is the right move for the long term but i dont see any other big competitors that were working with in the near term that were going to have to deal with in this regard andre benjamin  goldman sachs  co a last quick one if you could maybe talk a little bit about the level of contribution to both revenue and growth from the alliances that are focused on sales and marketing versus those that are not i know the  latter was an area of focus to continue to add some alliances over the last couple of quarters richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah id say the bulk of the contribution really on the quarter was still in sales and marketing we have some alliances in the compliance space those are taking a little bit longer as we talked about to close the cycle on there were some revenue in the quarter but by and large weve seen a lot in the sales and marketing space andre benjamin  goldman sachs  co okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of manav patnaik from barclays manav your line is now open manav patnaik  barclays capital inc thank you good morning guys so robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director good morning manav patnaik  barclays capital inc rich maybe just a little bit more comment on the overall deferred revenue growth if you could i mean especially in the americas it sounds like that slowed down sequentially i dont know again if its just comps or whats going on there richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president look a couple things manav as you know in the first quarter our business always tends to slow down in terms of growth rate it is the seasonal pattern that we see so we saw it on both revenue deferred revenue which was still up  for the company  for the americas  was up less than last year but if you go back to last year it was actually down a couple percent in the first quarter so seasonal patterns still exist the line is shifting up which is good but youll see – as you always do youll see a very strong second half manav patnaik  barclays capital inc got it and then on this compliance product you were talking about in europe maybe just a quick refresher what that is and what is the – i guess im just trying to understand your comment on  you sold – or you signed the commercial agreement but the customer cant implement it for regulatory reasons im just trying to understand whats really going on there joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer hey manav its josh so two different things the first is the primary solution that were referring to but not the only one is for the fatca solution which helps banks outside of the united states to comply with the us tax law requirements on disclosing entities that might have a tax liability in the us so that is the use case were seeing a lot of the traction from the latter part of last year into this year on the pipelines but we are also seeing traction with know your customer onboarding products and the like the fatca products are also now expanding to cover similar regulations in various european markets where there are common reporting standards being required so those are giving us addon opportunities into those tax compliance situations the commentary that rich had around the timelines for closing these  we are not – its not – we have not signed the agreements but we do have agreement on business terms with business owners however these are complicated deals for the financial services given the number of parties internally who are involved in making sure that theyre in compliance with these various new regulations so theres a long internal approval processes at the banks that have to happen before we are able to actually sign those deals you could think about it as a kind of work that went into sox  compliance when that was first launching and so until we get all those internal signoffs we cant actually sign the contracts and book the revenue the agreement is on business terms but not in a signed contract yet manav patnaik  barclays capital inc and is there any way to size this i guess this backlog that you have that could be signed down the road joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer yeah we obviously dont give pipeline metrics manav its baked into our guidance and our expectations for the year in terms of the sales as well as the revenue manav patnaik  barclays capital inc okay and then last one bob maybe for you is just you highlighted the credit cloud supplier risk and then the digital advertising sort of new opportunities or at least update on these opportunities maybe the digital advertising is a little bit more on the new front maybe you could help us just understand how big of a business that could be for you guys robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director yeah hi manav so look its – the opportunity i think is pretty big thats a growing market were seeing marketers use data and technology in new ways and in the area of advertising they are looking to target the right customers and a lot of the data that theyve been relying on is largely behavioral data and inference data so weve taken our deterministic dun  bradstreet data and weve onboarded it for the digital world and were able at scale a scale that you typically dont see in the bb world to be able to serve the ad tech and marketing tech environment and so look as with a lot of things it starts in bc and it moves to bb that whole programmatic wave its all moving to bb right now and were starting to see some really nice uptake because were available through all the major buying platforms as i said but were also selling direct licenses to marketers as well and obviously weve got a portfolio already of sales and marketing solutions this is a really nice complement to that and were trying to catch this wave and really deliver scale in a market thats highly fragmented so were pretty excited about this its a great example of leveraging our core data in a new use case and its a great place for us to be manav patnaik  barclays capital inc all right thanks a lot guys robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director sure operator your next question comes from the line of bill warmington from wells fargo bill your line is now open william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc good morning everyone robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director good morning bill richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president bill william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc so i was going to start out by asking if you could review for us the value proposition from a clients standpoint from going from dnbi to the db credit upgrade joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer sure bill its josh ill take that one so there are a number of different propositions that to some extent it will depend on which customers youre talking about but the first is that by moving the customers into this cloud offering were releasing new functionality and new features every three weeks in a rapid cycle thats something theyll continue to see value from as we move forward were able to standardize their views across multiple geographies which we were not able to do and still not able to do on dnbi thats one core value prop another core value prop is that as we innovate on things like our new scores and new analytics or new data sources were able to rapidly deploy those into the product since it is a cloudbased product and we can just push that new information into the cloud data platform which will feed it right into the products so thats a second major benefit the third major benefit for those customers who have departments that need to use this product in multiple geographies around the world is that they can be on a single product globally as we roll the product out across multiple markets because today dnbi is geographically limited to each market in which its launched so the us has its own version canada has its own version and then theres a version in the uk those products are not compatible today so if you have a trade crediting department that is global or multinational youre not able to use the same product in dnbi well be able to move them into the same offering in db credit and then the final benefit that we have articulated in the past is that we have many markets today where we actually dont really offer a subscription product for the trade credit space and customers must buy from us transactionally this allows us to offer the subscription service in all markets around the world including to our worldwide network partners and from that we do expect to see benefits for those customers in those markets who today cant get any subscription version of dnbi william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc okay the second question for you on the – to revisit the deferred revenue question i understand that the business is seasonal but were looking at a yearoveryear growth in the deferred revenue so that ought to adjust for the seasonal aspect meaning that q is weak every year and so if we look at the deferred revenue being up  in the december quarter and it being up  in the first quarter especially if its up against a minus  comp in q  i just wanted to understand whats going on there because i think youre making the case that the business is getting stronger and the momentum is improving and im just trying to tie that to that number which in the past has been a decent forward indicator richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah so look good question and as we told you going into the year we thought the first quarter would be weak in general right william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc yeah richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president so obviously from a – both from a sales standpoint a little bit weaker than youll see in the second half things pick up a heck of a lot in the second half of the year and we did have some contracts as we talked about that move some of those had revenue component some of them actually had a deferred component as well so all factored into our guidance nothing that gives us any concern and we still feel really excited about where we are at this point in the year william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc okay and then on the cash just a housekeeping question how much of the  million is offshore richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president the vast majority of its offshore unfortunately once you get the cash overseas its very difficult to bring back and we dont – if you think about the fact that i have a shortterm revolver right i really have debt in the us so its really overseas cash william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc yeah okay no no its richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president  william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc we see that in a lot of our companies this is the same situation richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president im looking for a way to bring it back william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc and so a final question for you just wanted to ask for an update on a couple of products that havent talked about in the past specifically db compliance check and db custom analytics just to see how those are doing in the quarter and how the pipeline looks for those two joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer sure bill its josh i can take that so were seeing actually very strong growth in our pipeline for compliance check especially as we start to look at some midmarket opportunities as well so we are seeing those opportunities continue to benefit us over the course of the year again these can be very lumpy in terms of where they would hit or show up in particular revenues so we dont really talk about individual performance for these in any given quarter but we do continue to expect those products to be growth drivers for us william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc well thank you for the insight joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer sure thanks bill operator our next question comes from the line of judah sokel from jpmorgan judah your line is open judah sokel  jpmorgan securities llc hi thank you good morning thanks for taking my questions first question is on dnbi i was wondering you discussed that the decline minus  in the quarter which was a little bit worse than last quarter was due to some mix shift from other trade credit products i was wondering when we would – when should we expect dnbi to stop declining when would we start seeing that product hit a vacuum contributing to growth joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer hey judah its josh i think as we discussed earlier in the call we actually do see dnbi moving to db credit over time and we havent yet decided where we would actually be reporting all that so i think rich gave a little bit of commentary that we may actually just be combining the various categories within trade credit and you would see that trade credit category start to improve it is a ratable product and its a product that we just launched in the end of january so its something we really would expect later in this year into next year to see those trajectory shifts start to occur on the revenue line you do see consistent performance in q of this year to what we saw last year in the trade credit category overall so our commentary on the shifting was merely that you might see something in the dnbi line that could be misleading if you really look at the trade credit line thats a better indicator of the underlying health of our core trade credit business thats consistent yearoveryear judah sokel  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for that clarification i appreciate it just another question about – so the op income beat was a combination of about  million of pushed out cost and then some better than expected organic revenue growth which just back of the envelope seems like its probably in the  million to  million range so first of all could you just confirm maybe that number being around the right range to think about the better than expected revenues compared to what youre expecting and also maybe you could just give a little color on the type of revenues that those better than expected revenues were should we expect them to see them recurring in future years or were they maybe more oneoff types of revenues or some sort of combination thank you richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah so your range is pretty close and i would call it  million to  million in that range on the revenue side a big part of it was a little bit more usage than we expected because that can hop around the other piece though is the very strong alliances revenue in the quarter that did exceed our expectations and that all came in the quarter itself so we feel good about where our alliances is heading the usage piece that was just more timing judah sokel  jpmorgan securities llc got it i appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of shlomo rosenbaum from stifel shlomo you may begin shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi thank you for squeezing me back in i just had a question on the alliances you signed a lot of alliances last year and i believe the strategy this year was to try to monetize them which one of the alliances do you feel is really starting to pick up some of the newer ones that you could talk about that were signed last year maybe bob you can highlight a little bit about whats going on there robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director yeah so look we have a portfolio strategy with alliances and so for sure well have some winners and well have some that dont do as well and look were seeing like in the area of audience solutions which we discussed we have both the direct and an alliances approach and were starting to see some traction with the alliances part of that were available on a lot of the major data management platforms oracle adobe google xaxis nielsen et cetera so were starting to see some nice uptake there and look were putting a real focus on activating all the alliances that we announced last year and were really pleased with the portfolio but we also have to put a focus on making sure that we drive those solutions and weve been talking a lot about europe as well part of our compliance strategy in europe is also involving an alliance partner and that alliance is actually going quite well so weve got alliances across multiple use cases and its a great way to expand the opportunity for dun  bradstreet and were putting a real focus around making sure that we activate these and get them growing across the board shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc so should i think about this year the focus is on getting the ones you signed last year going and maybe in future youre seeing another flurry like what we saw last year with announcements robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director well look we keep – we have a pretty healthy pipeline of potential alliance partners so were not going to give up on bringing on new alliances but you also have to put a focus around getting them growing and getting them going and so its – were leaning a little bit more in that direction this year activating these things and getting them going but theres no dirt of potential partners out there and this trend of dataasaservice embedded in this increasingly asaservice delivery of software and thats a great trend for us and we want to continue to ride that trend shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thanks and then rich just i wanted to check my math here is the cost shift to q provide  to the first quarters eps and then the better revenue like another  to  is that the way to think about it richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president hang on let me do the math for it shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc it just seems like absent those items you guys would have come in a little bit  richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah thats about right yeah thats in the range thats in the range shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president and then the  operator and our final question comes from the line of jeff meuler jeffs calling from rw baird jeff your line is now open robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director hello again jeff operator oh i think jeff may have disconnected now i turn the call robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director okay its okay operator theres no further questions so i turn the call back over to the presenters

dun  bradstreet if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time all participants will be in a listenonly mode until the questionandanswer session of the call i would now like to turn the call over to ms kathy guinnessey treasurer and investor relations officer ms guinnessey you may begin kathleen m guinnessey  treasurer and investor relations officer thank you good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today with me on the call this morning are bob carrigan our chief executive officer rich veldran our chief financial officer and josh peirez our president and chief operating officer heres what you can expect on our call following my remarks bob will provide an overview of our  results and an update on our strategy including our outlook for  then rich will come on to take you through the highlights of the fourth quarter and after that well open the call for your questions to help our analysts and investors to understand how we view the business our remarks this morning will include forwardlooking statements our form k and q filings as well as the earnings release we issued yesterday highlight a number of important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from these forwardlooking statements these documents are available on the investor relations section of our website and we encourage you to review the material we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements so from timetotime we may refer to sales which we define as the value of committed customer contracts this term is often referred to as bookings or commitments by other companies in addition we speak from timetotime about deferred revenue as a reminder deferred revenue is a liability that refers to revenue that has not yet been earned and represents products and services that are owed to our customers as the products and services are delivered over time it is recognized as revenue on the income statement deferred revenue is important to management because it provides insight into the health of our future revenues when we refer to the change in deferred revenue we mean before foreign exchange and acquisitions unless otherwise noted during our call today we will be discussing a number of nongaap financial measures which we call asadjusted results as thats how we manage the business for example when we discuss revenue growth well be referring to the nongaap measure revenue growth as adjusted which is revenue adjusted to eliminate the effect on revenue due to purchase accounting fairvalue adjustments to deferred revenue and also before the effect of foreign exchange when we discuss operating income operating margin and eps these will all be on a nongaap basis which we call asadjusted additionally our asadjusted results exclude the results of discontinued operations when we discuss free cash flow this will be on a nongaap basis excluding the impact of legacy tax matters potential regulatory fines associated with the ongoing china investigation and potential payments for legal and other matters you can find the reconciliation between these and other nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable gaap measures in the schedule to our earnings release they can also be found in the supplemental reconciliation schedule that we post on the investor relations section of our website we do not provide guidance on a gaap basis because were unable to predict with reasonable certainty the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of noncore gains and charges acquisition and divestiturerelated expenses and purchase accounting fairvalue adjustments to deferred revenue these items are uncertain and will depend on several factors including industry conditions and could be material to dun  bradstreets results computed in accordance with gaap later today you will also find a transcript of our prepared remarks on our investor relations site with that ill now turn the call over to bob carrigan robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director well good morning everyone and thank you kathy this morning im going to address our fourth quarter and full year  results the progress weve made against our strategy and our  guidance ill start with the fourth quarter last night we announced that total company revenue was up  for the quarter and organic revenue grew  our revenue ramped in the fourth quarter similar to our pattern over the past several years operating income was up  for the quarter if you recall in  operating income declined  in the first half of the year and ramped in the second half which was what we communicated when we laid out our guidance in the beginning of last year and we expect this pattern to continue in  rich will give you more detail on this in a few moments eps was up  in the quarter so we had a strong fourth quarter and i am pleased that we hit all of our guidance metrics for the year the quarter also continued the trend of strong growth in deferred revenue our deferred revenue balance had the highest growth weve seen in about five years while we had seen a flat to declining deferred revenue balance since  we saw a meaningful  increase in deferred revenue this year before acquisitions and fx which represents about a point of full year organic revenue growth and thats also before adding committed sales from strategic alliances which would have added an additional point to the company deferred revenue balance the increased deferred revenue is driven by an improvement in underlying sales of our subscription and usage based products where revenue is recognized over time this includes our newer cloudbased products like db direct and optimizer for contacts in fact in  organic revenue was up  but organic sales were up  now when we talk about sales we mean the value of committed contracts signed by customers were providing you with our annual sales growth figure because it will help you understand our true underlying performance against the strategy going forward we will provide actual organic sales growth on an annual basis as i discussed on our last quarterly earnings call deferred revenue growth is a good sign for our business as it is proved that we are upgrading existing products and launching new ones that better meet our customers needs for ondemand data solutions our new asaservice and cloudbased data solutions are where the puck is headed as more and more customers look to get our data embedded in their workflows so im pleased with the progress weve made and im confident that were heading in the right direction with accelerating sales momentum sales had been flat for several years before we launched our strategy in  but in  organic sales grew approximately  and accelerated to about  in  which was about two points higher than our growth in organic revenue the fact that sales are accelerating gives us confidence that we are investing in the right places with our continued growth in newer products we expect sales to continue to grow at a higher rate than revenue contributing to a growing deferred revenue balance in  and while a growing deferred revenue balance is a good thing it does put pressure on nearterm revenue another sign that the strategy is working is in our large strategic customer base where sales grew in the midsingle digits last year this growth came despite a tough year in our government channel sales in government can be somewhat spiky due to the timing of large contracts for example government sales grew in the teens in  but only low single digits in  and based on our pipeline we expect our government sales to return to strong growth in  were also making significant headway in bringing on new alliance partnerships that are intended to drive future revenue growth we entered into  new alliances with a number of bluechip partners last year revenue from alliances grew double digits in  this year we will be focused on monetizing the new partnerships weve established and we expect strong revenue growth again in  as many of our new alliances are brought to market now let me talk about another area of our strategy small and medium business now as you know we acquired dun  bradstreet credibility corp in may of last year and merged our small to midsized business channel into them creating the new division dun  bradstreet emerging businesses led by the team from credibility if you recall underlying sales in our former smb channel had declined  to  consistently over the last five years while we saw the team at credibility double the size of their business since acquiring it from us in  so its great to have them back in the fold and running the entirety of our smb business sales in that channel have already shown a significant improvement over prior years in fact since the credibility team took over sales in our former smb channel have actually reversed their decline and begun to grow the integration of credibility corp has gone even better than expected and were confident that we can turn what has been a drag on growth into a driver of growth now lets talk about the other acquisition we made last year netprospex the integration of netprospex is on plan and has generated immediate results we were able to quickly deliver our new contact data from netprospex to the dun  bradstreet sales force in fact our sales force generated about  million in new crosssell sales of netprospex related content in  importantly the dun  bradstreet netprospex team is also moving the needle on innovation and is taking the lead in the development of new sales and marketing solutions across the entire company in new areas for us like programmatic advertising dun  bradstreet netprospex of course is not the only area where were innovating weve told you in the past that dnbi had not had a significant update in several years last month we announced the launch of db credit which is our new stateoftheart cloudbased trade credit solution db credit is a powerful nextgeneration risk intelligence platform that can help todays finance professionals maximize cash flow through smart credit management and the fact that it is now available in the cloud gives us flexibility to make the product more sophisticated we now have the agility to offer more varieties of the product than we could before and to do so on a global scale its a great example of our commitment to modernize the way we deliver our solutions to our clients and we are now in the process of upgrading dnbi customers and attracting new customers to the platform we launched the new db credit platform on time in the americas and we are on track for a staged rollout in europe starting this summer the last update i want to give you about our strategy is that we have really upgraded our entire marketing operation weve modernized our brand which we talked about last year and that has put wind in our sails in the marketplace because it has been so wellreceived by our customers the next step in our modernization been around creating a marketing engine to help us be more effective in generating leads and deploying accountbased marketing practices to generate more pipeline for our sales team were doing this across all of the personas that were targeting from the chief risk officer to the chief marketing officer to the cfo and the credit analyst marketing across all of these constituencies is key to our ability to realize our share of the much larger  billion market opportunity that we see for dun  bradstreet weve redefined our brand more broadly across all these use cases and were targeting the right buyers with purpose which will help drive growth into the future so weve made a lot of big changes at dun  bradstreet that are generating positive results but as with any largescale transformation we encountered a few bumps in the road so weve redoubled our efforts to remove impediments to growth in  as you may recall we elevated josh peirez to the role of president and chief operating officer of dun  bradstreet in october and we put all customerfacing operations under him to unlock the full potential of our multichannel sales organization which is centered around three key areas our global direct sales channel alliances and our emerging businesses division so since then weve changed the compensation structure in our sales force to incent new business development for every sales rep weve also restructured the organization to reduce friction and to make sure our sales people and alliance partners are selling the same way leaving the option of how to buy up to the customers in other words allowing us to sell our solutions to customers in ways that are channel agnostic and quite frankly we had some people who are not the best equipped to take us forward in this new multichannel world so we needed to make some personnel changes and in the end we have upgraded our sales force removed management layers and aligned incentives to drive new growth and we made these changes while still delivering a strong fourth quarter weve accomplished quite a lot in a short period to set dun  bradstreet on the path to sustainable growth weve completed and successfully integrated two major acquisitions reorganized and upgraded both our marketing and sales organization launched innovative new products and signed new alliance partners all while accelerating sales growth im really excited about where dun  bradstreet is headed which brings us to our guidance ranges for  we expect revenue growth between  and  as a reminder we acquired netprospex on january  last year so its now in our organic base the credibility acquisition in midmay of last year so we realized about almost  points of inorganic growth from that acquisitions in  operating income flat and up  eps between minus  and plus  and id like to note that our eps guidance includes a higher interest expense yearonyear primarily due to last years acquisition and free cash flow of  million to  million so as we enter the third year of our strategy there are things working better than i thought and things that needed more transformation than i originally anticipated last year i said that we thought we would be in a position to achieve mid singledigit organic revenue growth in  at which time we would see flat to expanding margins while i can see us getting to that level of growth in terms of organic sales in  were not quite there yet in terms of organic revenue growth still im very encouraged by the progress were making to set dun  bradstreet up for sustainable longterm growth and with that i now will turn the call over to rich veldran who will discuss our fourth quarter results in further detail rich richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks paul and good morning everyone in my comments this morning im going to discuss our fourth quarter results and then ill talk a bit about our fullyear guidance and how we expect it to play out in our results over the course of the year as we expected and consistent with prior year the fourth quarter was our fastestgrowing quarter with total revenue growth of  and organic growth of  this was on the top of  growth in the fourth quarter of  and  in  the reason for this pattern of strong fourthquarter growth is that as yearend approaches our largest customers are planning their strategies for the following year and they want to ensure that they have the freshest and most complete predictive data that is available this is particularly true in sales and marketing with products like optimizer and db direct you can see in our reported results that our advanced marketing solutions became a much bigger part of our mix in the fourth quarter now let me we give you more detail our segment performance the americas had revenue of  million which represented  of revenue in the core revenue grew  and organic revenue was up  within the americas risk management or rms was up  in the fourth quarter due entirely to the inorganic contribution of credibility corp organic rms revenue declined low singledigits as growth in other enterprise risk was offset by declines in trade credit other enterprise risk grew  in the quarter as a reminder the inorganic creditonself revenue from credibility corp is in this category organic revenue in other enterprise risk was also strong with mid singledigit growth in the quarter the organic performance was driven by data and analytics projects as well as our dataasaservice solution db direct for risk trade credit was down  in the quarter dnbi makes up about  of trade credit and declined  for the quarter and for the full year dnbi retention was again in the low  with price increases in the low singledigit as bob discussed we just launched db credit which is our new cloudbased workflow tool for credit decisions like dnbi the new product is subscription based so it will take a little while to have an impact on a reported trade credit results were very encouraged by the reception from customers that are already using it the decline in other trade credit was primarily due to shifts to other more valueadded risk solution sales and marketing revenue was up  in the quarter with more than half of that growth organic advanced marketing solutions was also up  with organic growth in the high singledigit revenue from optimizer alliances and db direct for sales and marketing drove the strong organic growth the inorganic growth came from netprospex prospecting solutions grew  during the quarter due to the inorganic contribution from credibility corp prospecting was down in the low singledigits organically primarily due to continued weakness in hoovers now shifting to the nonamericas revenue was  million in the fourth quarter which represented  of revenue for the company nonamericas grew  in the quarter driven by strong increases in our partner markets in both asiapacific and europe in our owned market we continue to see growth in china and india partially offset by weakness in europe particularly benelux however in benelux we did see improved underlying sales in the quarter due to growth in compliance products that growth will be recognized throughout  now as bob mentioned deferred revenue was up  for the company before acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange this is the second consecutive quarter of strong growing deferred as our overall sales growth continues to outpace reported revenue in total organic revenue grew  for the year as we reported however organic sales or bookings grew  overall our sales were greater than our revenue in  and this difference goes into deferred revenue as we look forward to  we expect this trend to continue with sales growing faster than revenue on an organic basis turning to profitability operating income in the quarter was up  driven by the higher revenue eps increased  in the quarter for  per share the increase was due to the higher operating income and a lower tax rate in the quarter partially offset by higher interest expense into the acquisitions and a higher average borrowing rate in  for the full year our tax rate was  compared with  in the prior year turning to the balance sheet we ended the year with  billion of debt including about  billion of fixed rate senior notes and  million of floating rate debt our cash balance at yearend was  million for net debt of  billion net debt increased by  million yearoveryear due to the net impact of ma activity in  now before we open the call for questions i want to give you a little more color on our  guidance as we enter the third year since the strategy launch were seeing sales growth accelerate particularly in areas that were the initial focus of the strategy such as alliances and large strategic accounts and were very pleased with the progress that were making in emerging businesses through the credibility acquisition as this was an area that had been a drag for several years in  we expect revenue to improve over  and with it operating income but as you can infer from our guidance ranges were not yet at that tipping point where we expect the margins to expand we believe our strategy is working and well continue to invest behind it in  this year we expect new investments of  million to  million weve mentioned in the past that we expect margins to expand when we reach mid singledigit organic revenue growth and this is still true with the business model centered on data our incremental margins are high and that level of growth will afford us the opportunity to expand margins even while continuing to invest in the business were just not quite at that point yet in  now consistent with the seasonal pattern that we see yearafteryear in our business we again expect a relatively slower start to the year followed by a strong second half with a particularly strong fourth quarter when we see significant increases in advanced marketing solutions and other enterprise risk as customers prepare their businesses for the year ahead q is always a slow quarter for us and well be impacted this year by the timing of several large contracts that have shifted to later in the year we currently expect organic revenue to be flat to down slightly in the first quarter in terms of operating income the first quarter is always our seasonally smallest for example in  first quarter operating income was  million out of a total of  million for the year against this small base the potential dip in organic revenue as well as our q investment spending will have a disproportionate impact on our operating income growth rate so while we expect operating income to be flat to up  for the year in the first quarter we expect operating income to be down in the midteens percentage range these quarterly trends in both revenue and operating income are consistent with the historic seasonality of our business and are taken into account in our fullyear guidance with that well now open up the call for your questions questionandanswer session operator the first question is from peter appert with piper jaffray your line is open peter p appert  piper jaffray  co broker thanks good morning robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director good morning peter peter p appert  piper jaffray  co broker so rich maybe – hi could we dig a little further into the guidance because i guess im just not following it the target is mid singledigit revenue growth to get the margin leverage you are forecasting  to  which sounds like mid singledigits so it seems like a disconnect in terms of the revenue acceleration and the lack of margin leverage richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah let me talk a little bit about that peter ill give you some of the details on it but again i want to start with the strategy is working and were continuing to invest we havent changed our investment plans even though the revenue is a little behind where we thought wed be as weve said many times when we get to mid singledigit organic revenue thats where we see the margin expansion begin so if you kind of disaggregate the year ahead im going to take the midpoint of the range just to kind of put some numbers around it and hopefully this will make a little bit clear but if you take the midpoint of the range of  to  thats about a  growth call that about  million half of that about  million is the inorganic contribution from credibility that comes in with around a  margin so a little lower than the rest of our business and weve also got some integration costs so netnet as a result of that half of the revenue im expecting about a point of op income accretion right so give or take if you look at the rest of it the other  million or so of revenue is really being offset by the  million to  million of investment that i mentioned before now as you know we always every year go through our business we save a lot of money were very prudent with the way we spend things  all the savings that were doing this year are really going towards dealing with inflationary pressures as well as some onetime items if i go back into last year for example weve said many times we were a little behind our expectations so some of our variable comp a little bit lower last year that gets restored to normal levels this year i also had a number of other onetime things that im dealing with increases in pension costs that kind of stuff all of that were taking care of through cost savings so does that at least give you a flavor for where we are peter p appert  piper jaffray  co broker yeah understood thank you and then in terms of the incremental  million to  million of investment spend can you give me some color on how thats being directed in terms of product areas et cetera richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah let me talk a little about that and a lot of that – the seasonality is a little different this year as well normally weve ramped up to a degree this year a lot of these investments were really begun at the tail end of last year and they are continuing its on things like the db credit rollout continued work on that weve ramped up a lot of new alliances some of the work in the early part of this year was on activating those alliances and getting them moving and then there is a number of other new product areas such as compliance and programmatic advertising that we think are going to really make a big contribution down the road and you need to spend the money upfront to get those things moving so those are a lot of the areas that youll see the spending hit peter p appert  piper jaffray  co broker got it okay thanks very much operator the next question is from jeff meuler with baird your line is open jeffrey meuler  robert w baird  co inc broker thank you i guess how do you think about managing the investment spend and i ask that from the standpoint that you took a pretty big stepup in  i think a more modest stepup in  its continuing to ramp i know sales are starting to ramp as well but if revenue is more towards the lower end of the full year guidance range i think organic thats about  or  do you feel like you need to continue to increase initiative spend in  to continue to try to jumpstart revenue growth or at what point do we stop seeing the increases in initiative spend i guess robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director yeah hi this is bob so as rich said its been our plan to continue to invest in the strategy and as we grow revenue our incremental margin affords us the ability to continue to invest and as we grow were a little behind in terms of organic revenue but were seeing the sales acceleration in all the right areas so we know that our investments are working certainly we need to continue to spend in db credit and areas like dataasaservice things that are really contributing to our sales momentum and will increasingly over time so for us the model is very much allows us to invest at the appropriate level on a goforward basis and were still in that original investment plan where we laid out a couple of key areas where we needed to drive the business we see those areas are working and again being a little bit behind in revenue and the fact that were spending on – its not ramping through this year were a bit frontended in this year compared to last year and how the investments  from last year those are all the contributing factors but the headline is we are investing in the right areas were seeing accelerating sales against that and as the revenue increases with increasing sales it affords us plenty of room to be able to invest at the right level to continue to drive the strategy forward jeffrey meuler  robert w baird  co inc broker okay so is this more a function of youre spending at about the level that you expected to in  but because youre a little bit further behind where you were hoping to be on revenue growth that it comes out of margins instead of being supported by the revenue growth thats the right way to think about it the spend levels kind of where you thought it would be robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director yeah thats exactly right i mean look we want to – weve got a good thing going here and we want to – after many years of lack of investment here weve been very focused on building and investing in the right areas and we dont want to let up on that and i know that puts a little bit of pressure on us in the nearterm but its the right thing for the long term and thats why were in this were all about longterm sustainable growth and the potential for dun  bradstreet in this market is tremendous we see again that  billion market opportunity to do that we needed to invest in a couple of key areas again we like the progress were making against these things weve got this issue where sales is outpacing revenue thats one of the reasons we wanted to be a bit more transparent on the sales this year just so you can see that we are growing sales and if we continue to do that all good things will happen on the organic revenue side as well jeffrey meuler  robert w baird  co inc broker okay and then just finally from me you had a comment about  sales and i think you said its possible or something along those lines to hit mid singledigit but if you could just clarify your comment and im assuming youre stopping short of providing formal sales guidance and then related to that just given the impact that bookings leading revenue should have on free cash flow are there offsetting factors that we dont see a better yearoveryear free cash flow number in  richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah let me take the second part of the question first and then kind of bump up back on the first one couple of things this year that do hold us back a little we did do more restructuring as youll see in our reported results at the end of last year we actually pay for that in the year ahead so a little bit more of a downward push on free cash flow this year ive also got higher interest expense this year for example so thatll hold me back a little bit but you are correct as i sell – and thats recognized down in front of  revenues that actually helps my free cash flow because we bill at the time we sell solutions so even though i may recognize that revenue across the year im actually collecting the bulk of the money upfront people dont pay as you go with this thing they pay us for the solution well give them a little bit of term but we collect that money and then we just recognize the revenue later robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director yeah and to your question around sales in  just to again repeat a little bit what i said in my remarks organic sales have been flat here for many years prior to us launching this strategy in our new gotomarket in  sales reached about  of growth and in  were at  and so you could see that were trying to drive this up into the right and what i said was that we certainly can see us getting to that midsingledigit organic sales in  thats certainly what were focused on were actually focused beyond that as you can imagine but we are building in the right direction jeffrey meuler  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thank you guys operator the next question is from shlomo rosenbaum with stifel your line is open robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director hey shlomo shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi good morning thank you very much for taking my questions hey can you hear me robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director yes we can kathleen m guinnessey  treasurer and investor relations officer yes sir shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay all right thanks rich can you just do the math for us what is the organic constant currency revenue growth implied in the revenue guidance just what is it straight out richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president well obviously its  right from inorganic its  to  shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc  to  okay great thank you richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah we always guide constant currency shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc right okay and then can you just go over the interplay of deferred revenue to actual revenue in how much of the businesss revenue is going into deferred revenue in other words you have an improvement in that and some of that is moving the business from kind of one time contracts into some of this stuff thats a little bit more subscription based and i just want to know how much is that indicative of the growth of the underlying business richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president i understand the question entirely so let me break it out in rock terms so things that i would consider more upfront recognition the optimizers of the world roughly across our business thats about a third of our business today right the other twothirds is ratable and usage usage has been picking up off late so today about three quarters of it or so is ratable of that remaining twothirds with the rest in usage but usage has been picking up off late and thats where you get a little more variability that pushes us even later in the year because what were finding is that a lot of the usage in those contracts again although we get paid upfront the customer is tending to use that stuff a little bit later in the year little bit less say in the first quarter just less of an activity based quarter than youll see as you get closer to yearend shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc so how much of the company if you – of revenue how much of the actual revenue that you recognized during the year initially started out the year as – or at some point in the year was deferred revenue richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president well ill give you an example i mean if i go into to this year my deferred balance is around  million so ive got about  million or so sitting on my balance sheet today thats going to flow into revenue in the year ahead shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc so should i think about that  to  of revenue goes into deferred richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah and then thats up from where it used to be right shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay yes thank you then how about giving us if youre talking about sales a lot of other companies give like an annual contract value or something like that does it make sense for you guys to start talking about that if youre moving more in that direction youre talking about sales richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah look were sort of easing our way into it so our bookings our sales we did give you a figure now were planning to at least talk about it annually weve debated putting it out as another metric as the – its a little more volatile because we have so many big contracts that tend to move around quartertoquarter so you dont get a perfect view when you look quartertoquarter you do get a very good view when you look yearoveryear because of the time and particularly when you think about the government contracts and that shift around during the year you still end up selling them you may sell them in different quarters so weve debated whether thats actually going to help or hurt if we start putting out a quarterly metric for that shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc right richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president but it is something were going to talk more about as we go in certainly were going to talk about it on an annual basis shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you then bob can you talk a little bit about the clouds – dnbi cloud solution i think it started to rollout in january is it enough time for you to talk to get a good sense about the appeal to the market robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director well its rolling out its starting to rollout in north america in january but weve been working with customers that have been using the beta version and getting a lot of feedback from them so weve been at this for quite some time the product was really informed almost entirely by our customers so maybe early feedback has been good just rolling it out to the teens and so as you can imagine our sales folks are excited about having a new solution a new product after many years of not having this and we are the leaders in this market so its a terrific opportunity and josh do you want to add any other color joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer yeah shlomo i would just add that weve actually had our first sales both new business and upgrading of existing customer and we also have inmarkets and free trials where we have a number of customers who have chosen to take advantage of that thats a new approach for us to get customers on the product using it where theyre then signed up to continue at the end of the trial so were actually getting pretty good feedback in market our sales force is also very excited and its something that while were early in market we like what were seeing we also like the fact that were releasing every three weeks so we can add enhancements and changes in accordance with what we hear from customers pretty quickly given the cloudbased nature of the product robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director yes shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay great and last one from me if you can just go into a little bit more detail of what the restructuring charges in the quarter were for they were pretty high and is that part of the kind of the sales force alignment that you guys talked about richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah we did do a fair amount of realignment within sales and within a couple of other areas related to that so that was the primary set of changes we wanted to make sure that when we did the walk around the gotomarket strategy we did it quickly and we did it well and you see that reflected in that fourth quarter shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you operator the next question is from andrew steinerman with jpmorgan your line is open andrew charles steinerman  jpmorgan chase  co hi i wanted to talk more about the launch hi its andrew i wanted to talk more about the launch of db credit is this a product that mostly would be sold to existing customers or upgraded to existing customers during the renewal cycle that we just went through in december and january and so in terms of traction of these products isnt it more kind of like a year away at this point joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer hey andrew its josh so first of all we see  a very strong opportunity for new customer acquisition particularly in the emerging businesses segment as were able to launch many different versions of the product in microsegment consistent with the strategy that jeff discussed and how they approach the business so we actually do see nca opportunity there in terms of upgrade our intention is not only to upgrade customers at the time of renewal and in fact many of the conversations were having in market today are about getting those customers on to the higher value of the new products sooner and locking them up into longerterm arrangement earlier so we do anticipate that however given the ratable nature of the product and the timing you will see that show up towards the latter part of the year and into next year but youll see it showup in the deferred balance sooner so we dont expect it to be a year away but we do expect it to be later in the year where you would see the material movement were also in market testing many different pricing and packaging options to make sure that we maximize the value for our customers and ourselves so as we nail that well accelerate our efforts andrew charles steinerman  jpmorgan chase  co josh could you go a little more into that last point of how you see the value realization joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer sure so were – in the previous versions of dnbi we generally sold an allyoucaneat package price for customers pretty much consistent across the board and then we added module sales on top of that for those customers who wanted that higher value here we actually have a number of different offers in market that were testing that actually are different from one size fits all pricing model and we think its allowing us to move up the demand curve and be able to really target what customers need from the product so one example is in the past while we had unlimited versions of dnbi international data was actually limited and you had a package of amount of international data you can buy it was actually one of the biggest dissatisfiers we had on the product today we have a version for db credit of unlimited global data for those customers where that has value were testing out the price points for that in market to see exactly what that value has and as we nail that sweet spot well be able to accelerate its pretty standard way that you would go into pricing on a new product versus our historical method which has been to fix a price and then just how the sales people see what they can get for it andrew charles steinerman  jpmorgan chase  co that sounds right thank you robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director sure operator the next question is from manav patnaik with barclays the line is open manav patnaik  barclays capital inc yeah good morning guys robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director hi manav manav patnaik  barclays capital inc hey how you doing so first question is it sounds like from your commentary you guys are making a lot more progress than what the market is clearly giving you credit for and with the stock down  over the last year why isnt buyback something you guys are doing especially since you got a steady free cash flow you got  million of cash leverage should not be an issue so why isnt that something as part of the strategy richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president hi manav this is rich so our leverage should not be an issue in the eye of the beholder i suppose for us as you know weve been very keyed on remaining investment grade after the acquisitions that we did last year and after the significant repurchase program weve done in the past were at the lower end of investment grade its very important to us so our uses of cash in the nearterm are really geared towards reducing leverage manav patnaik  barclays capital inc okay fine and then bob just one question i mean i think you obviously inherited the tough task here but just around the talent pool that you referred to earlier just maybe could you elaborate a little bit more just around the sales force and other areas i mean you had i guess two of your hires that you had highlighted when you first joined leave the company for different reasons but just trying to understand like how comfortable you are there do we just see a lot more turnover going on there or how should we think about that robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director well weve been very purposeful in how we – and the changes that weve made and so with the acquisitions we made particularly with credibility and forming that focus around the smb area with emerging businesses all the new alliances that we launched we kind of said okay the best way for us to gotomarket was around these three distinct channels so global direct sales emerging businesses and alliances and this year was a year where i felt confident that we could make some pretty big organizational changes and we have – and look i talked to a lot of you guys over the years my few years here about the historic issues around our gotomarket and sales and i got to tell you we took some pretty big actions in the latter part of the year i think we turned over almost a quarter of our sales team a lot of that was again part of the organizational change but also we want to up our game we want to get the right people in the right areas focused on serving customers and this year we felt like we were in a position to be able to do to do just that and im really pleased with the talent weve been able to attract and by delayering a bit and putting people closer to the customers this has been a good thing for us it helps us to be more agile and i believe that thats exactly what needed to happen and so i think weve made those moves the bold moves im really pleased that it happened and i certainly give josh a lot of credit who took over in q but we did a lot of this in a big quarter for us were able to still come in with a strong quarter and build sales momentum so i think these changes were necessary theyre the right thing for our business over the longterm and im really pleased with the talent and the organizational structure that we have right now manav patnaik  barclays capital inc okay and then just last question rich i think you said  to  was constant currency so whats the i guess how should we think about what the estimated fx impact would be at maybe current rate richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah look at current spot im expecting just about a point or so hit on the topline a little less than a point on the bottomline and thats factored into – on the bottomline certainly factored into my guidance manav patnaik  barclays capital inc okay so the  to  should be i guess  to  reported then richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president if you thought about it as afx  yes thats what youd see right  on constant currency yes manav patnaik  barclays capital inc all right thanks a lot guys robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director sure operator the next question is from bill warmington with wells fargo your line is open william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc good morning everyone robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director good morning william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc so i wanted to start out just by asking about the renewal fees i know you do – most of the renewals come in sort of the december january timeframe talk a little bit about how those renewals have been going and maybe some comments around retention and price increases joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer hey bill its josh i think we had a good season you see it reflected in the performance in the quarter as well as in the deferred balance our ranges in terms of renewal rates and price increases stayed the same for dnbi for example low s and lowsingle digit price increases so really pleased that we saw that be consistent while then having good performance in some of our newer products which drove a lot of the growth so it was a good season william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc okay in terms of the quarterly progression going from q to q were there any contracts or renewals that got moved from q into q that might account for the particularly weak q richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president there was nothing significant the bigger moves that were seeing are moving later into this year there may have been one contract of less than  million or so that was early but the real driver was things that are moving a little bit later in the year and dont forget q is always big because you get a lot of the optimizer work you get a lot of the data services work and that stuff pretty much renews in fourth quarter because thats when theyre getting their work done you dont get that much movement say in and out of q because of those needs that customers have william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc okay and how – what was the – i think you might have mentioned the revenue – in terms of modeling the revenue in q in terms of the organic growth that quarter richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah for q were expecting it to be flat to slightly down its been pretty flat for the last three years its always a light quarter for us a little light william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc yeah richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president activity driven a little more ratable driven as ive mentioned we do have a couple of things that we do know will really go to  in the year william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc okay and then richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president so its all in the guidance william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc i was going to ask for – well if you look at the organic growth and again correct my figures because again im looking at it from the outside i dont have your level of precision   in constant currency organic  looks like  the guidance for   to  and if you look at the fourth quarter it looked like fourth quarter of   in the quarter that we just did  so my point is that the – were looking at an acceleration no matter how you slice it and i was going to ask if you could kind of walk through the components of what were going to help you deliver that acceleration richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah yeah so look during the course of the year what we typically see – well  just frame it sales have been moving faster than revenue in general right because more stuff is coming to  right william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc yeah richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president all right so as you think about this year well start – and as we typically do youre starting off the year relatively slow you have a little more of the ratable business in the beginning of the year as the year progresses youll begin to see the impact of some of the newer products this year of some of the deferred that came in from last year because a lot of thats usagebased right so wont necessarily be used in the first quarter but it will be used throughout the year and then youll also see an impact from the alliance work that were activating this year the big quarter is always the fourth quarter we expect that again this year the largest customers tend to do optimizer data services lots of work to prepare their portfolios we do more and more with these we have very strong relationships with these customers we do a lot of work with them and they spend more with us because were giving them more value every fourth quarter as theyre getting their years ready so once again we expect a pretty big pop in the fourth quarter we do have that  million incremental deferred that you saw last year that we know is going to flow in this year thats already a point of revenue in the year not as much if it hits the first quarter i said the rest of the year though william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc got it richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president so that give you some color for the ramp and again its not that dissimilar from the ramps weve seen in the past except we have a little more strength going into the year because of the increase in deferred and we have a lot more in terms of what we expect from activation of alliances and newer products that we expect to come on as the year progresses william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc okay so last question is just to ask given the turmoil that youre seeing in the capital markets the question thats coming up a lot is are you seeing any change in customer behavior on either the marketing side or the credit side thats the question joshua l peirez  president and chief operating officer hey bill its josh we havent seen major impacts as we mentioned europe had been a little slower for part of last year and the current economic climate is factored into our plans and our guidance but in terms of what were seeing hearing from our customers out there were expecting to be within our ranges we did have a stronger q as we saw even with the climate and we just – we see that as within the range of our guidance william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc thank you very much i appreciate it operator the next question is from andre benjamin with goldman sachs your line is open andre benjamin  goldman sachs  co thanks good morning robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director hi andre richard h veldran  chief financial officer  senior vice president hi andre andre benjamin  goldman sachs  co first question is beyond the partnership with salesforce youve done a lot of alliances is there any color that you could provide on which one of those is next material in terms of materiality sorry and how those return over the next couple of years and how big they can get relative to the salesforce deal robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director yeah hi andre its bob so yeah weve had a lot of success in the alliance area in the crm space and as we got into the second half of last year we started to gain some traction in some other areas like the mdm space compliance starting to ramp in the programmatic advertising area with a number of relationships with some of the data management platforms and trading desks so were starting to gain some traction in those – i would say in those buckets in particular our focus as i said in  is going to be on monetizing these relationships its a portfolio you have – we had  new alliances on top of the alliances we already had and so our goal is to do our best to get most of these growing in a good direction with the portfolio youre going to have some that are going to do better than others but our focus is on really activating and driving these relationships in  andre benjamin  goldman sachs  co and to followup i believe manavs question about the sales force i apologize if i missed it but any update on the challenges that you were previously facing in europe i remember that was an area youre particularly concerned and then any thoughts on hiring a new chief sales officer or are you going to just continue to cover those responsibilities as a committee robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director yeah so weve talked a bit about some of the challenges weve had particularly in the benelux region where we had a particularly acute competitive situation and we didnt have some of the solutions that we needed to compete effectively in that market the good news there is that weve actually launched some solutions there specifically in the compliance area and thats kind of a hotbed area for that and we saw some really strong sales – some of our biggest compliance deals happened towards the end of last year and well start to realize the revenue benefit of that in  so i think weve addressed a lot of those issues obviously were all over it and these are all in the context of the larger changes that weve made around our multichannel approach again focused on global direct sales emerging businesses which has been a historical challenge for us the smb area and then alliances selling through bestinclass partners ive put all of that under josh peirez and that in addition to focusing on some key use cases that weve got particular traction in like compliance our sales and marketing solutions analytics supply trade credit these are all areas of real focus for us so i like the focus of our structure going forward and were often running and were starting to see accelerating sales in that new structure andre benjamin  goldman sachs  co thank you operator we have no further questions at this time robert p carrigan  chief executive officer  director okay kathleen m guinnessey  treasurer and investor relations officer great well thank you everyone for your attention and well talk to you next quarter operator ladies and
