confusing accounting trading at  yieldmay  about stonemor partners ston grey owl capital longshort equity long onlygrey owl capital managementsummarywe believe ston has  upside to unit based on current dividendliquidation value of at least unitrecent missteps and complicated accounting provide the opportunitythe company stonemor partners lp nyseston operates  cemeteries and  funeral homes in  states and puerto rico the company provides a complete range of funeral merchandise and services sold both at the time of need and on a preneed basis the company manages more than mm in trust assets that ensure the delivery of merchandise and perpetual care of burial plots and vaults in the twelve months through september  the company performed over k burials and over k funeral service calls ston went public in  and has since acquired  cemeteries and  funeral homes at multiples between xx ebitdai summary ston has an excess of investment red flags dividend cut in half recent financial restatements with qualified letter from auditors one quarter behind on sec filings and counting and both the ceo and cfo have left within the last three months in addition the business economics are masked by some of the most unique and confusing accounting we have seen yet we think the stock is worth upwards of unit compared to a current price of   upside in addition we think the downside is protected by liquidation value of at least unit  upside finally investors get paid a current yield of  we believe ston is not a ponzischeme it does need access to capital markets to fund both growth capital and working capital because it finances preneed sales and has legal requirements to fund merchandise trusts it does not raise equity and issue debt to fund distributions see appendix for detailed analysis ston likely attempted to grow too quickly with two major acquisitions in  and an illfated attempt to optimize salesforce productivity these actions were likely inspired by a new majority owner of the gp who benefits from growth via rising distributions and increased share of distributions all of these issues can be solved with improved execution they are not structural the dividend cut the qualified auditor opinion for s k the late  k filing and the ceos likely forced departure all appear to be symptoms of the same poor execution the cfos resignation is bad optics but appears to be nothing more than unfortunate timing ston has enough capital to cover both the new lower distribution and any working capital needs from new preneed sales through the end of  we are assuming a modest ramp in salesforce numbers and productivity from the lower  levels a faster ramp could require outside funding for working capital we also think that ston has enough capacity on its current line of credit to fund working capital needs in  efforts are well underway to cure the poor controls cited by deloitte  touche in the revised  k and efforts are underway to reset the salesforce a temporary accounting workforce is in place we are told over  people at individual cemeteries to clarify the detailed numerous s of small contracts some of which are in paper files that led to the restatement late  filings and citation for poor controls the new vp of sales has been in place since october  and monthly sales reports released publicly by ston show progress several quarters of covering the dividend getting current on  k and q  filings removal of qualified auditor opinion naming new ceo and cfo and improved salesforce productivity should act as catalysts to drive the unit price higher in addition we are pleased that ston is exploring multiple angles to improve its financial profile a land sales with cushman and wakefield to raise additional capital and b the use of insurance to minimize the need to contribute cash to the merchandise trust longerterm we think the business will be able to resume distribution growth and could grow beyond our unit price target ston  structural basics first one needs to understand the general mlp structure gp incentives and the specific working capital needs of ston the mlp structure mlps are unique structures that distribute almost all of their earningscash flow to grow mlps need to raise external capital and they need to grow because they trade based on both current yield and expected growth critics argue that the structure is inherently flawed because access to external capital is not always available and often is least available when one needs it most supporters argue that the need for external funding is a continual check that ensures good capital allocation whether the mlp structures benefits no corporate taxes on qualifying income and a higher multiple due to the investor bases yield focus outweigh the issue of continually having to raise external capital is open to debate mlp gp incentives the gp of an mlp has an incentive to grow the common unit or lp distributions as these distributions grow the gp gets a larger and larger share incentive distribution rights or idrs these should align the interests of the gp and the lp but it does incentivize the gp to grow quickly maybe too quickly this could be part of the issue with ston where the two  acquisitions were just too big for ston to effectively swallow stons working capital needs not only does ston need external funding for growth capital it needs external funding for working capital to feed ongoing organic growth a portion of stons revenue is derived from preneed sales of funeral services and merchandise ston provides financing for the vast majority of these sales and thus grows accounts receivable in addition a significant component of the cash ston does take in is placed into a legally mandated merchandise trust this fact is the source of claims by many short sellers that ston is a ponzischeme we think there is zero evidence to this claim and we will demonstrate that below however the accounting is very confusing and thus ston is very susceptible to the ponzischeme claim accounting and economics the most important numbers from an economic standpoint are the cash flow numbers investors get confused by the gaap accrual accounting we compare  tables below to illustrate the gaap income statement a contains historical preneed sales revenue and expenses that are not cash the gaap cash flow statement b places what are from an economic perspective financing items accounts receivable and merchandise trust contributions in the operating section of the cash flow statementi this creates confusion and leads to the ponzischeme charge finally ston previously reported an adjusted ebitda and distributed cash flow table c this is a far more accurate depiction of the current years cash economics we like to also include accounts receivable and merchandise trust below the line to see the full picture of that years operations see our proforma table below the key metrics to follow are the current sales levels including all current preneed sales and expenses operating income or adjusted ebitda cash charges for interest and maintenance capex plus the funding needs for accounts receivable and the merchandise trusts we detail those for  below along with our expectations for    we believe that there are three critical variables to understandmodel when looking at the cash flow economics of ston preneed sales the level of preneed sales is the main variable determining revenue and operating earnings we expect atneed cemetery sales funeral home sales and trust income to be relatively stable and grow at a slightly faster pace than gdp given aging demographics with the salesforce rebuild well underway we expect  to be a trough year with modest salesforce growth in  and faster improvement in  and  we detail a sample preneed sale below to explain the flows net flows into the merchandise trust our model is below net flows into accounts receivable our model is below we also model modest about mm net of corporate savings after reduction in force legal contract rationalization savings and new salesforce and audit expenses preneed sales economics the following table details a representative preneed sale as explained to us by ston based on the above table preneed sales are clearly profitable however because the vast majority of preneed sales are financed at  over a year period and the merchandise trust must be funded immediately new preneed sales are cash flow negative at the same time a portion of the historical buildup in balance sheet values for deferred sales revenue noncash deferred selling and obtaining costs noncash merchandise trust cash and accounts receivable are all released each year if preneed sales are greater than the past few years average cash flow will likely be negative if preneed sales are lower than the past few years average cash flow will likely be positive merchandise trust when a preneed sale is made cash must be deposited into a merchandise trust to fund the purchase of merchandise much of this cash can come out of the trust prior to death but certain requirements must be met eg a vault must be installed in the ground and a headstonemarker must be engraved and placed with a thirdparty storage company we reviewed the last four and three quarter years of detailed merchandise trust disclosure to ascertain the rate at which we should expect contributions to flow into the trust  depleting cash flow we believe the contribution rate is approximately  of that years preneed sales rounding from the  average in the table above this is an imprecise number and will depend on product mix sold and the distinct legal requirements for the state in which the merchandise was sold this matches the merchandise trust contribution in the preneed sample ston shared with us the rate at which we should expect distributions to flow out of the trust  increasing cash flow and from the restricted merchandise trust account into the unrestricted cash on stons balance sheet we believe distributions leave the merchandise trust at about  of the prior years trust balance this assumes about  of the trust can come out within five years of a preneed sale how much cash is realistically trapped within the merchandise trust given the  that can come out per year and the lower rate of distribution in   and the beginning of  we think there is mm in trapped cash this is in the ballpark of the more conservative number ston has communicated per the companys guidance we assume mm in trapped cash is released during  derivation of these figures is detailed in the following model these assumptions are then factored into our proforma financial model while market gainslosses will clearly have an impact on trust asset levels and therefore distributions they are impossible to model so we assume static values we also assume no acquisitions accounts receivable like the merchandise trusts accounts receivable have both a contribution and distribution component given the average age of the current ar portfolio we assume  distribution and  contribution frankly this doesnt logically match our expectations for these figures exactly a higher than expected  seems to flow out and a lower  than expected seems to flow in but it does get close and is more conservative than the past three years trend and average age of the ar portfolio and the fact that a significant portion of early year preneed sales will already have paid the majority of the first of three years worth of payments partially explains timeline on the evening of october   stonemor cut its dividend in half  from unit to unit on a quarterly basis unit to unit annualized the unit price closed trading on october   at  it closed at  on october   and reached a twelvemonth low of  on april     relevant developments just prior to and since cutting the dividend may  american infrastructure mlp funds aim purchased a majority interest in the general partner of stonemor and invested mm in common units to fund nearterm acquisitions aim also agreed to make available up to mm in additional capital to fund future growthi the exact price was not disclosed and because it included acquisition of  of the gp it is hard to derive the common unit low in may  was  and the high was  may and june  immediately following the capital injection from aim ston made two large acquisitions on may  ston entered into a year lease  management agreement with the archdiocese of philadelphia for  cemeteries with an upfront payment of mm on june  ston purchased

mcgrath had previously been cfo of a publicly traded energy mlp he replaced timothy yost who left in may  and had been cfo since april ii late  implemented new sales management practices with intent of limiting churn the idea was to increase output for top salespeople requiring fewer salespeople and then allowing attrition of lowest tier of salesforce where turnover is inefficiently high productivity improved but too many salespeople left preneed sales volume began to drop in mid august   released q financial results and began commenting on preneed sales deficiencies september   announced intention to restate certain financial statements the expectation at the time was that this would only involve a change in capital allocation between the general partner and limited partners

near par deloitte  touche remains the auditor  the former cfo plans to sign the  k liquidation value using gaap accounting preneed sales activity appears to destroy balance sheet value quarter after quarter as of q  there was only  in partners capital per unit on the balance sheet tangible capital was almost zero per unit however this view masks the cash profit that is embedded in the merchandise trusts there is even more accrual profit if one wants to view the deferred revenue as the source of stored value below we look at the true economic value on the balance sheet the exercise assumes that all new preneed sales end and that the existing preneed sales are released into cash as merchandise is delivered and services are rendered the average life of the trust is approximately  to  years valuation we estimate that like the majority of mlps ston will eventually trade based on dividend yield it will trade relative to the mlp universe and other yield instruments adjusted for perceived stability and growth of the dividend we think that after demonstrating it can pay the current dividend it will trade at a slight risk premium to the current alps alerian mlp etf nysearcaamlp yield of  downside  run off net present value and irr calculations we believe the embedded cash value on the balance sheet as detailed in the runoff balance sheet example puts a floor on the units value of upwards of unit to get to this number we discount the  in cash we believe is embedded on the balance sheet assuming a runoff of the preneed business this assumes land and assets are worth depreciated cost very unlikely given hard to duplicate and nimby nature of cemetery assets and given potential for higher and better use of some portion there is no value to the ongoing atneed business again seems too conservative given demographic backdrop risks salesforce has tapped out low hanging fruit this is an alternative explanation to the drop in salesforce productivity we think this is unlikely ston tells us that current penetration rates in the target population are  within each geography it operates in ston believes these can go higher and there is steady and increasing growth in target population due to demographics deloitte resigns as auditor sec andor state ag complaint preneed sales grow too fast and ston is not able to raise new debt andor equity at accretive levels to fund working capital lawsuits take too long and too much money to resolve we were told by company ston has sufficient insurance to cover any damages if granted cremation is a cited risk while on the rise relative to burials ston has demonstrated that while lower dollar value this is more profitable business and thus should have only modest if any negative impact pro forma financial model appendix  ston is not a ponzischeme while the companys statement of cash flows includes accounts receivable and merchandise trust fund flows in the operating section we think it is more accurate when looking at the economics of the business to think of these items as financing in the table below we separate out accounts receivable and merchandise trust fund flows as distinct uses of cash rather than just look at a net operating cash flow number what is clear is that operating cash flow funded all of the distributions from  debt and equity issuance were used to fund both working capital and growth
