speculation and litigation  references  external links operationsedit shaikan oil fieldedit shaikan is an oilfield in northern iraq in which gulf keystone petroleum currently holds  of a production sharing agreement with the kurdish regional government it is notably one of the largest super giant oilfields discovered in the last  years shaikan was declared a commercial discovery on august   following a fivewell appraisal program initially independent estimates place the gross oilinplace oip volume at  billion barrels p potentially making it one of the largest oilfields discovered in iraqi kurdistan the oilfield covers an area of some  to  square kilometres  to  sq mi and comprises a series of limestone reservoirs stacked upon each other these reservoirs encompass a very long period of geological time from the cretaceous which ended some  million years ago to the triassic which began some  million years ago gulf keystone believe that hydrocarbons may also exist in the more ancient permian formation an audit of the shaikan oilfield published in march  appeared to show that dramatically less oil could be recovered than had been previously advised and expected the audit implied a recovery of only  of the oil in the shaikan reservoir and indicated that shaikan contained just  billion barrels × m of which just  million barrels × m could hope to be recovered net to gulf keystone this appeared to be significantly less than the  billion barrels × m previously claimed by gulf keystone petroleum to be in place in the field this apparently low recovery level was partly a presentation issue because elsewhere the audit expressed the opinion that the recovery could be some  as a direct consequence of the perceived negative audit the share price of gulf keystone petroleum crashed by  in the days following the publication of this official audit this audit was reviewed between june and september  in order to take account of additional well and substantial production data this resulted in the proved and probable reserves increasing by  from  million to  million barrels the proved probable and possible reserves rose by  from  million to  million barrels the worldwide historic average recovery rate has been stated at the geological society in london to be some  though many goodquality reservoirs greatly exceed that typical recovery rates for type  and type  fractured carbonate reservoirs have been quoted by as  and  respectively and these figures are consistent with earlier estimates given by gulf keystone for shaikan a conference held by the society of petroleum engineers in istanbul on – february  had the title how can we double carbonate reservoir recovery and addressed the issue of potentially lifting the current global average recovery rate for carbonate reservoirs of  to a much higher level of  or more source society of petroleum engineers modern developments with enhanced oil recovery eor which feature strongly in the plans of companies such as chevron can achieve high recoveries of the in place oil volume the initial stages of production at shaikan are to be natural reservoir pressure longer term output from the wells will be maintained via the use of electric submersible pumps the reinjection of gas into the reservoir to help maintain pressure and reduce oil visocity and potentially other technological approaches gulf keystone has previously said that shaikan should produce oil for  to  years the former chief executive officer of gulf keystone explained to the market that the apparent reduction in the in place oil at shaikan was misleading this was because the  billion barrels total included oil in the cretaceous jurassic and triassic reservoirs whereas the headline figure in the  audit covered only the jurassic the current phase of the development program is restricted to the jurassic which contains an enormous oil column of over  meters in height the auditors decided in  because the current emphasis is on the jurassic to exclude the cretaceous and triassic from their reserves assessment earlier presentations given by gulf keystone gave higher recoverable volumes than the  and  erc equipoise audit report in one talk john stafford gave to the geological society in  the following details were reportedly revealed productivity index  stbbldpsi permeability  md radius of investigation  ft time  hours connected volume  billion bbl furthermore the auditors assessment use relatively low porosity figures for the highly fractured carbonate reservoirs at shaikan it has been difficult for some shareholders to reconcile the apparent low fracture porosity figures suggested in the audits with the fact that the drilling on shaikan has been notoriously difficult because of huge losses of drilling mud which have probably been lost into the fracture network this is also in apparent contrast to reports from over  yrs earlier which indicated that the huge kirkuk oil field in kurdistan also has significant fracturing in its reservoirs and other apparent similarities between kirkuk and shaikan daniel e j  fractured reservoirs in the middle east aapg bull v  p  daniels even refers to one well where a  ft timber when lowered into it was returned to surface after undergoing a  degree rotation the former chief executive officer of gulf keystone referred shortly before christmas  to the drill bit dropping three metres at shaikan during the drilling the likelihood of significant fracturing and potentially cavernous porosity at shaikan appears to be real the former chief executive officer has also said that shaikan has one hell of a fracture population in april  the american association of petroleum geologists were told in houston texas by gulf keystone and two of its external fracture consultants that oilbearing reservoirs of the shaikan anticline in northern iraq with billions of barrels of oil in place consist of highly fractured mesozoic carbonates extensive field and core work documents an interconnected network of fractures dominated by closely spaced bednormal extension fractures supplemented by strikeslip conjugate shear fractures and local lowangle thrust planes younger fracturing consists of flexuralslip bedparallel shearing and shear reactivations of the earlier bednormal fractures characteristics of these natural fractures vary by lithology diagenesis and structural position with fracture heights being greater in the more homogeneous formations and bedparallel shear being best developed on the steep forelimb of the anticline fractures in certain formations have been subjected to significant dissolution with open millimeter to centimeterscale slots developed along what were originally calcitemineralized fractures most fractures in core even the dissolution slots are stratabound but vertical inter connectivity is enhanced by faults fracture patterns and bednormal stylolites provide information on the structural development of the shaikan anticline recording a prefold maximum compressive stress that was parallel to bedding and aligned in the nesw direction evolving into the presentday nnessw oriented stress system aapg datapagessearch and discovery article    aapg annual convention and exhibition houston texas usa april –  this evidence suggests that the shaikan discovery is very substantial and its significance is accentuated by the low success rate of wildcat exploration worldwide which has been on a five to sixyear downtrend the chief financial officer of gulf keystone indicated in march  that the likely recovery rate from shaikan was likely to be significantly above the  level implied by the auditors in  the current chief executive officer consistently describes shaikan as worldclass the first phase of the development of shaikan  phase zero  had a target of producing  barrels of shaikan crude oil per day this target was successfully met by the end of  in  the oil was being exported under agreements reached between the kurdistan regional government and the national government of iraq the export was initially using longdistance road tankers to the turkish coast but during the summer of  the road tankers began being rerouted along a much shorter distance to the export pipeline at fishkabur where the shaikan crude is injected into the pipeline via a mixing plant operated by dno a more efficient arrangement involving the installation of a pipeline connection directly into the shaikan field is anticipated on  may  an output of  barrels per day was commemorated with a group photograph in kurdistan source gulf keystone petroleum in august  the  barrels per day level was reached further phases which will be implemented in the coming years have previously been said by gulf keystone to target a longerterm production level of  to  barrels of shaikan crude oil per day such a level would put shaikan into an elite group of international oil fields the company is not currently stating its longterm expectations but in september  it said that its next benchmark objective was  barrels of shaikan crude oil per day the achievement of these very high output levels will involve drilling more production wells over the coming years the construction of additional surface facilities to receive the oil from the wells remove the associated gas and prepare the oil for export and the connection into the export pipeline whilst this will represent a substantial project the total capital cost will be relatively modest by international standards this is because of the high outputs anticipated per well the relatively shallow depth of the reservoirs compared to modern deep drilling and the readily accessible onshore operations which do not suffer from severe winters which can otherwise hamper production operations the lifting costs per barrel of shaikan crude are already among the lowest in the world in september  the company announced that new understandings of how the shaikan reservoir was behaving would further reduce future capital expenditure levels because the wells would individually produce more oil and drain a greater proportion of the reservoir than was previously anticipated thereby reducing the number of additional wells required other operationsedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to

and akribijeel blocks which are adjacent to the shaikan block four separate discoveries have been made in these blocks in addition to the discovery at shaikan each of these discoveries had been described by gulf as a company maker in its own right the sheikh adi discovery is particularly significant because gulf has an  interest in it a field development plan for the discovery is due to be put to the kurdistan regional government during the fourth quarter of  and the discovery has been described by gulf as a significant sidelobe to the shaikan oilfield the oil in sheikh adi is intended to be processed using surface facilities within the shaikan block the akribijeel asset is considered noncore by gulf keystone it is on production but the operator mol revealed during  that the output level was modest and well below previous indications of what the asset would be achieving at that stage gulf keystones stake in the asset has been formally described as for sale for a considerable period in march  the akribijeel oilfield had been said by its operator kalegran part of the large hungarian company mol to be producing at an initial  barrels per day  md take over speculation and litigationedit gulf keystones initial operations in algeria were rather less successful than had been hoped and the share price weakened as a consequence rak petroleum pcl announced an agreement in april  to acquire gulf keystone petroleum but the transaction was not completed the company continued as an independent and altered its strategy working with the american company texas keystone international to complete the acquisition of exploration acreage in kurdistan a small american company called excalibur ventures had initially drawn the attention of texas keystone to the possibility of acquiring exploration acreage in kurdistan this initially included a majority position in the shaikan block for which gulf keystone would be the operator and a minority position in the akribijeel block for which mol would be the operator op cit in the summer of  the shaikan wildcat well was a success and it was realized that the volume of oil in shaikan was much greater than had been expected from the predrill assessments made by the companys geophysicists the share price strengthened considerably as a consequence moving beyond its previous high levels as time passed and more wells were drilled the volume of oil judged to be in shaikan continued to rise in late  exxon mobil announced it had signed exploration contracts for six blocks in the kurdistan region of iraq including one block adjacent to the shaikan block an article appeared in the independent on sunday on  december  suggesting that a number of major oil companies were potentially interested in gulf keystones discovery a further article in that publication on  february  stated that exxonmobil had looked closely at shaikan it said that the onetime minnows growth has been so extraordinary in the past two months that it would comfortably qualify for the ftse  blue chip club gulf keystones executive chairman said in the article were not that little kid in sort pants anymore and that the £ billion market capitalization was due to the world waking up to the vast oil reserves the company possessed he also commented that he hoped that small private investorssome of whom have risked their lifesavings on gkp would not be squeezed out by the big city firms speculation about interest by larger oil companies in gulf keystones assets has raged for several years on internet bulletin boards and in the media the company itself has also referred on various occasions to such possibilities the company issued a news release on  december  explaining that exxonmobil had not made an offer for the company though the independent on sunday had not in fact made such a claim a large team of executives from gulf and its advisers and lawyers went to china in early  in connection with undisclosed commercial matters after the share price reached a peak in late february  the absence of any announcement by gulf keystone about corporate activity reduced the level of market expectation regarding a possible takeover bid and the share price consequently eased back at that same time the american company excalibur ventures secured thirdparty litigation funding for a highprofile trial in the commercial court in london which excalibur would subsequently lose for around  of gulf keystones key assets in kurdistan to which they claimed they were entitled because of their introduction of texas keystone to the opportunities which existed in kurdistan this impending trial acted as a further dampening effect upon investor sentiment it was not until december  that the excalibur claim was fully dismissed by lord justice christopher clarke in a judgement which was highly critical of excalibur and also of the manner in which the gargantuan in scale litigation had been conducted against both gulf keystone and texas keystone subsequent to removing the threat posed by excalibur and moving toward the achievement of the phase zero production level of  barrels per day of production disruption in the region caused by isis and the difficulties experienced by the kurdistan authorities in paying fully for the oil being exported by three kurdistan operators including genel as well as gulf keystone continued to adversely affect market sentiment on  april  the chairman of gulf keystone who had left the company the previous day ignited fresh speculation about corporate activity involving gulf keystone when he revealed that the company was involved in commercial talks with other oil companies four oil companies were said in august  to be assessing the companys assets in the context of possible corporate
