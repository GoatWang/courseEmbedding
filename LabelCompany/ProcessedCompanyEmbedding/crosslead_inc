crosslead fulltime more than a yearpros people are generally kind and understanding treat each other with respect a few very knowledgeable engineers have introduced cutting edge modern technologies and industry best practices into tech team operations much more relaxed than typical tech startup it is a  schedule and slower paced downside is missing the energy of pushing hard towards goals opportunity to be involved in crossfunctional efforts and wear different hatscons hard to build culture and camaraderie with mostly remote team including senior leadership on engineering everyone works in parallel and rarely collaboratively weak standard of excellence  while most engineers are capable cases of underperformance put product development at risk and were overlooked for quite some time the company is primarily a consulting firm with salesdriven rather than productdriven approach and lacks a unified product vision product and design team consists of junior employees whom management does not trust with job responsibilities and instead micromanages pms pick up design responsibilities like wireframing with no design experience while almost all product decisions fall back

a good job at managing work bandwidth they give time for teams to group up and digest the work to come and the work that was recently done communication was usually very accessible for some people which makes it easier for me to get feedbackconsan inexperienced company very new and is still trying to find their vision design language and footing the company and the product have very large fundamental problems that are just pushed aside and ignored for the sake of a release date some people in the company who are higher ups constantly try to do the job of others while having little to no experience on the subject as a designer theyd constantly skip steps in the design process and push deadlines for underdeveloped solutions for developers theyd constantly be left out of the loop of product development until late stages where conflicts would arise this company just chews through contractors and freelancers which has made their design chaotic and inconsistent which will be the products downfall probably to avoid paying adequate compensation and benefitsadvice to managementplease heed the advice and concerns of your creative and developer employees please make the design and development processes a conversation instead of isolating the teams into their own islands dont rush or skip steps in the design process every step is important and especially the early onesshare on

emphasize their services around their enterprise software platform which helps execute the team of teams theory for organizations of any size crosslead functions very well as a company in part because they truly administer their organizational theory into their own company they are the biggest believers of what they are selling and that is something not a lot of companies can say because of their dedication to immaculate organization there is a level of transparency camaraderie and efficiency that i have never seen before at company especially a startupconswhile the product development and engineering side is finely tuned machine the client services side seemed less together it would serve them well to have a bigger emphasis on business development and sales however i believe they are already aware of this and are implementing solutionsadvice to managementthe cloud platform is awesome but dont lose sight of the importance of the consulting part too the team of teams philosophy is
