companyinformation item  information on the company a history and development of the company      we were incorporated in brazil under the brazilian corporate law on november   as companhia brasileira de distribuição our principal executive offices are located at avenida brigadeiro luis antonio no  cep  são paulo sp brazil telephone  our agent for service of process in the united states is ct corporation  broadway new york new york       we have been a pioneer in the brazilian retail food industry opening our first store a pastry shop in  in são paulo city under the name pão de açúcar  we established one of the first supermarket chains in brazil opening our first supermarket in  and opened the first hypermarket in brazil in       brazilian economic reforms implemented in  including the introduction of the real as the brazilian currency and the drastic reduction of inflation rates resulted in an unprecedented growth in local consumer markets it has been estimated that more than  million people gained access to consumer goods markets for the first time after  as brazilians predominantly in lower and middleincome households generally experienced real income gains this increase in available income and the resulting increase in consumer confidence broadened our potential customer base and provided us with growth opportunities      we responded to these changes by strengthening our capital structure increasing our logistics and technology investments and implementing an expansion strategy focused on the different consumer preferences of the brazilian population to support our expansion strategy consisting of acquisitions and organic growth we defined the format of our stores in terms of the expectations consumption patterns and purchasing power of the different income levels in brazil      from  through  we invested approximately r million in technology or about  of our total investments in the last five years we also implemented projects designed to improve operational logistics and margins in  we began substituting our stores autonomous operating model for a more centralized system under which the responsibility for purchases was transferred to our commercial department our distribution and other administrative functions were also centralized to obtain economies of scale these changes strengthened our negotiating position with suppliers with respect to prices and payment terms in  we finished implementing our new category management system under which our commercial department became responsible solely for purchases in order to maximize bargaining power however we transferred category management decisions which relate to the pricing and mix of products to each of our banners as they are in a better position to make these determinations for their particular target customers we have also sought to gain efficiencies through improvements in our supply chain in an effort to decrease stockouts breakage and shrinkage and packaging and labor costs as well as to increase inventory turnover      since  we have acquired and merged a total of  stores when entering new markets we have generally sought to acquire local supermarket chains to benefit from existing knowhow of the geographic region for expansion within urban areas where we already have a presence we have historically opened new stores nowadays our focus is to expand organically not through acquisitions as it was in the past  table of contents although acquisition may occur it is not the focus since  we have also opened  new stores historically our organic growth and smaller acquisitions have generally been funded from our cash flow from operations and larger acquisition opportunities have required external funding or capital increases we expect to fund future organic growth from our cash flow from operations our aggregate sales area has increased by  since  as a result of our acquisitions and our opening of new stores      also in response to the increased levels of income resulting with the introduction of the real we realized in  that in order to take full advantage of brazils economic growth we needed to adjust the format of our stores according to the expectations and needs of different consumers we refocused the pão de açúcar format to cater specifically to the highincome consumers and sought to target lower income consumers with a costoriented format barateiro currently named comprebem  which we acquired in  the acquisition of the barateiro chain represented a decisive step in carrying out our targeted marketing plans our diversity of formats allows us to reclassify stores to a more appropriate format within a market from time to time some pão de açúcar stores particularly in the state of são paulo were converted into the barateiro format in  as average income levels dropped in neighborhoods of these stores original locations      in june  we acquired the sé supermercados chain of supermarkets which at the time of acquisition was the seventh largest chain by sales in brazil all of the  sé stores were located in the state of são paulo      also in  as part of our effort to increase sales of our barateiro stores we launched a new store format known as comprebem barateiro in certain regions of brazil this format which responded to market research from the target barateiro audience focused not only on reduced costs but also on personal service organization and increased customer relations under the new model the stores offer new layouts more modern equipment and a more pleasant shopping environment with a variety of services in addition the comprebem barateiro format emphasized the importance of family and community connection sponsoring community outreach activities such as local artwork competitions and showcase of neighborhood childrens artwork in the stores due to the great consumer acceptance of this new format which was evidenced by the performance as measured by total sales of comprebem barateiro stores as compared to barateiro ones we have converted the barateiro stores into comprebem stores      during  cbd undertook an intense review of its purchasing and category management activities including processes systems and management models additionally throughout the year the strategies for all categories of the companys sales mix were redefined all these initiatives aimed at increasing efficiency in negotiations with suppliers product assortment exposure in the stores promotions and pricing in  we will execute the actions and strategies defined in  by which the company expects to reach higher competitiveness and profitability levels      the sendas strategic partnership      in december  we signed a letter of intent to enter into an association with sendas sa or sendas the association was named sendas distribuidora sa or sendas distribuidora and became operational in february  at that time sendas distribuidoras voting stock was held  by us and  by sendas and we are responsible for the management of the company see item c  material contracts  the sendas association sendas has been operating in the brazilian retail market for  years operating exclusively in the state of rio de janeiro as of december  sendas network was comprised of  hypermarkets and  supermarkets the association with sendas was an important strategic step towards growth and leadership consolidation in the brazilian market sendas distribuidora is enjoying the benefits from the synergy with our corporate operations furthermore this association is helping us to increase our presence in other businesses including gas stations sendas distribuidora had  in december  compared to  in february  and drugstores sendas distribuidora already had  in december  compared to  in february       the aig group association      in order to reduce net indebtedness and strengthen the capital structure of sendas distribuidora on november   sendas cbd and investment funds of the aig group  aig entered into an agreement through which aig invested r million equivalent to us  million in sendas distribuidora through the acquisition of  class b preferred shares and  class a common shares issued by sendas  table of contents distribuidora representing  of its capital due to the agreement cbd currently has a  stake in sendas      pursuant to the agreement cbd and aig mutually granted reciprocal call and sale options for shares acquired by aig from sendas distribuidora which may be exercised within  years upon the exercise of these options the shares of sendas distribuidora purchased by aig would represent a credit valued pursuant to a formula based on multiples of ebitda of sendas distribuidora less its net debt held by aig against cbd which would be used to subscribe up to three billion preferred shares issued by cbd that will be created in a future capital increase any excess of the credit above the three billion shares issued by cbd would be paid in cash the price of the future issuance of preferred shares issued by cbd will be set based on market value at the time of issuance the capital increase will also allow cbd shareholders to exercise preemptive rights with respect to preferred shares      the itaú cbd association      on october   we entered into a partnership agreement with banco itaú holding financeira or itaú holding to establish a new financial institution named financeira itaú cbd sa crédito financiamento e investimento fic fic service kiosks in our stores have exclusive rights to offer private label and cobranded credit cards personal and consumer credit extended warranties and insurance currently fic kiosks are present in  of our stores we and itaú holding each indirectly hold  of fics capital stock however itaú holding is responsible for the management of the company being entitled to appoint most of the companys officers      in  fic  financeira itaú cbd advanced on three fronts recording physical and financial growth and increasing its share of sales during the year  fic stands were installed in extra  extraeletro  comprebem  sendas  and pão de açúcar stores  almost  more than the initial annual target of  the number of clients exceeded the fourmillion mark in december  also higher than the initial target in fact fic gave priority to growing the client base in order to build a representative portfolio to work with in the coming years      in addition more than three million privatelabel cards exclusively for use in cbd stores were issued during the year overtaking the number of existing cards issued by cbds previous financial partners this increase in clients also allowed fic to beat the target for share of sales      receivables representing the volume of

consisting of our shareholders mr abilio diniz península participações ltda or península and the other members of the diniz family that control península and the casino group executed a joint venture agreement which set forth a series of transactions that resulted in equal cocontrol by the casino group on the one hand and the diniz group on the other through the holding company that controls cbd on june   a holding company shareholders agreement and a new cbd shareholders agreement were entered into superseding the  shareholders agreement between the groups see item  major shareholders and related party transactions  major shareholders  shareholders transactions financial settlement of the transaction occurred on july        the casino group and the diniz group contributed  billion and  billion cbd common shares respectively to the holding company allowing the holding company to become our controlling shareholder by the ownership of  of the voting shares of cbd which represents  of our share capital both diniz group and casino group owns  of the common shares of the holding company      on june   cvm sent us a letter in which it requested the acquirer of our shares under the terms of the joint venture agreement to make a mandatory tender offer to the minority holders of our common shares based on cvms understanding that implementation of the transaction detailed in the joint venture agreement would represent a transfer of our corporate control on june   we filed a petition before cvm i requesting that its respective technical areas  superintendências

decision before the cvms board  colegiado  in accordance with the terms of applicable regulation our petition was not reconsidered by cvm technical areas and in a meeting held in april   the cvm committee  colegiado  did not accept the appeal instead ratifying the assessment of the technical areas of cvm and calling for the exercise of the public tender offer to acquire voting shares in the market corresponding to approximately  of our voting capital despite the request for registering a public offering for the acquisition of our outstanding voting shares made by casino on may   before the cvm we expressly reiterated our understanding that the corporate transaction between diniz group and casino group did not constitute a transfer of our control cocontrol      control of cbd is in the form of equal representation of the two shareholding groups on the boards of the holding company and of cbd abilio diniz will act as chairman of the holding company for at least the first seven years of the joint venture all corporate actions of the holding company require unanimity except that certain issues including those pertaining to the chairmanship quorum and dividend policy are governed by the holding company shareholders agreement      the cbd board of directors is now composed of five casino group representatives five diniz group representatives and four independent directors jointly appointed by the casino group and the diniz group abilio diniz will continue to act as chairman of the board of directors of cbd and for at least the first seven years of the joint venture will be appointed by diniz group starting june   the appointment of the chairman will alternate every three fiscal years and casino group will have the right to the first alternate appointment a unanimous vote of a quorum of the board of directors not including the independent directors is required in matters involving a conflict of interest with abilio diniz specified matters including those with respect to quorum certain investments and certain issuances of debt are governed by the holding company shareholders agreement our chief executive officer will be jointly selected by the diniz group and the casino group out of a list of three candidates submitted to our board of directors by abilio diniz      the diniz group has agreed to lock up its stake in the holding company for the first nine years following the closing of the transaction similarly the casino group has agreed to a lock up of its stake for  months following the closing of the transaction at the end of these lockup periods the other holding company shareholder will generally have a right of first refusal to buy the stake if it is offered for sale      the holding company shareholders agreement provides that beginning in  casino may appoint the chairman of the board of the holding company who could be someone other than abilio diniz or his designee in the case of casinos exercise of its right to appoint a chairman the shareholder agreement provides for put and call mechanisms that if used would change the voting control of the holding company in particular casinos exercise of its right to appoint a chairman would result in reduced corporate governance rights for abilio diniz and the diniz group in addition the diniz group may cause the casino group to purchase a direct equity interest in the holding company representing  shares of cbd and thereafter during a period of eight years to cause the casino group to purchase the remaining block of shares owned by the diniz group if these put rights are not exercised by the diniz group casino has a share call that would be sufficient to transfer share voting control see item   major shareholders and related party transactions  major

pão de açúcar supermarkets with gross sales of around r billion or approximately  of our total sales were transferred to a real estate investment fund called fundo de investimento imobiliário península whose quotas are owned by a company controlled by the diniz group hereinafter referred as reco master      on october   and december   final agreements were entered into referring to the sale of the referred real estate properties to fundo de investimento imobiliário península the properties were transferred at their fair value indeed an appraisal by independent experts with

under these leases in  was r  million out of which r million were paid directly by cbd cbd paid to the diniz group r  million on the inception date of the lease agreements as an initial fee for entering into those longterm lease agreements      cbd the diniz group and the casino group executed an agreement that establishes the principles governing the relationship between cbd reco master and fundo de investimento imobiliário península pursuant to the agreement as amended cbd and casino group each own a golden share issued by reco master providing them with specific rights that ensure the proper use of the real estate properties by the diniz group      the ultimate use of the proceeds from the transfer of real estate store assets will be to reduce cbds debt and will also enhance its ability to fund its growth tax impacts of the transactions      following completion of the transaction the parties have agreed that casino will contribute to cbd the acquisition goodwill generated by the casino group as a result of its acquisitions of cbd shares as contemplated by cvm regulation in return the casino group will be entitled to receive the economic benefits of new cbd preferred shares without additional payment to the extent that the goodwill is utilized to generate tax credits for cbd casinos call option for  of share capital      abilio diniz and a relative have granted the casino group a call option for a period of three years on  billion of cbd common shares at an exercise price of us  per thousand common shares the exercise of this option by the casino group would not affect casinos equal control with the diniz group of the holding company see item   major shareholders and related party transactions  major shareholders       b business overview the brazilian retail food sector      the brazilian retail food sector represented approximately  of brazils gdp in  according to abras brazils supermarket association the food retail sector in brazil had gross revenues of r  billion in  a  increase over  the brazilian retail food sector is highly fragmented however despite the consolidation within the brazilian retail food industry the five largest supermarket chains have accounted for an estimated  of the retail food sector in  down from  in  we believe this consolidation will continue and this is expected to favor large food retailers such as us that can take advantage of better economies of scale in the provision of services implementation of costcutting and efficiency measures and sourcing from suppliers according to abras our gross sales represented  of the gross sales of the entire retail food sector in       foreign ownership in the brazilian food retail sector began with carrefour  a leading french retail chain which opened its first hypermarket  years ago in the last decade international chains such as walmart and sonae have also entered the brazilian market mostly through acquisitions of domestic retail food chains and competition in the industry has intensified in addition to the organized retail food sector the brazilian retail food sector also consists of small food retailers which frequently avail themselves of access to merchandise from irregular and informal distribution channels this merchandise usually has lower prices than those charged by manufacturers and stores in the conventional supply chain of the organized retail food sector      overall supermarket penetration in brazil today in terms of the number of supermarkets relative to overall population and area is estimated to be below the levels common in the united states many western european countries such as france and some south american countries such as chile management believes that the population of brazil is an important factor affecting the potential growth in supermarket activity according to the brazilian institute of geography and statistics or ibge the total population of brazil was approximately   table of contents million at the end of  making brazil the fifth most populous country in the world and the population is currently growing at a rate of  per year as approximately  of the population lives in urban areas and the urban population has been increasing at a greater rate than the population as a whole our business is particularly well positioned to benefit from economies of scale deriving from brazils urban growth são paulo with a population of approximately  million and rio de janeiro with a population of approximately  million are the two largest cities in brazil são paulo state has a total population in excess of  million representing approximately  of the brazilian population são paulo state is the first and rio de janeiro is the second largest consumer market in which we operate      the brazilian retail sector is perceived as essentially growthoriented since retail margins are substantially more constrained compared to other business sectors we are therefore intrinsically dependent on the growth rate of brazils urban population and its different income levels while living expenses in brazil are lower than those in north america western europe and japan brazilian household income levels are also substantially lower      the following table sets forth the different income class levels of brazilian households according to ibope     annual income   class level     in reais        a    above r  b    between r and r  c    between r and r  d    between r and r       class a households account for only  of the urban population and class b households account for  of the urban population classes c d and e collectively represent  of all urban households in recent years the class c d and e households have been increasing and now have greater purchasing power      current salary levels in brazil have generally lagged compared to increases in interest and exchange rates and price levels we expect that increased consumption by the lower income class levels will take place over time as a result of gradual increments to salary levels and a steadily growing population as seen in the years immediately following the introduction of the real  even small increments in purchasing power generally result in significant increases in consumption in absolute terms as well as increased expenditures in premium priced food products and other nonfood items including home appliances and consumer electronics our company      we are the largest food retailer in brazil based on both gross revenues and number of stores in  we had a market share of approximately  in the brazilian food retailing business according to abras with annualized gross sales of r billion as of december   we operated  stores throughout brazil of which  were retail food stores of our retail food stores  are located in são paulo state representing  of our net sales revenue from our retail food stores in  são paulo state is brazils largest consumer market we are among

into one of our formats during  and        one new store was opened during the year and the remaining stores  came from the association with sendas sa   our competitive strengths      our main competitive strengths are our different retail food store formats our extensive network of distribution centers our economies of scale our prime locations in densely populated urban areas and growing provincial urban areas and our high level of customer service  table of contents      different retail food store formats      we conduct our retail food operations under three main store formats pão de açúcar  comprebemsendas and extra  each of which has a distinct merchandising strategy and a strong brand name we offer a variety of formats which enables us to effectively target different consumer preferences and thus earn their loyalty this approach coupled with our intimate understanding of the brazilian consumer permits us to meet diverse customer needs without confusing consumers as to the marketing or price focus of each format each of our brand concepts is clearly identified in the marketplace for a combination of goods and services offered and relative consumer wealth for example our pão de açúcar format is positioned to serve the higher income consumers through a combination of store location store design and product and service offerings our second format under the comprebem and sendas banners is targeted to middle and lower income consumer brackets our third retail format extra  is our hypermarket format which offers the widest assortment of any of our store formats and allows us to target potential customers along the entire income spectrum our hypermarket stores have the additional advantage of benefiting from the general lack of department stores and specialized stores in brazil as a result a retailer such as an extra store that also sells nonfood products such as household appliances consumer electronic products general merchandise clothing and textiles is particularly convenient to a brazilian consumer      extensive network of distribution centers      we operate distribution centers strategically located within the cities of são paulo brasília fortaleza curitiba rio de janeiro and recife our distribution centers have a total storage capacity of  square meters of builtin area our management believes that our network of distribution centers is the most extensive and technologically advanced product distribution center network in the brazilian retail food industry we believe that our facilities are capable of servicing substantially all of our distribution requirements both for our existing stores and for the stores that we currently plan to open in the near future approximately  of our inventory in  came directly from a distribution center instead of a supplier a substantial increase from  in  resulting in higher bargain power with suppliers fewer inventory shortages lower shrinkage and improved working capital management many of the functions of our distribution centers are automated allowing for quicker and more efficient handling of products our distribution centers are supported by sophisticated systems which other brazilian retailers lack including pdnet  a businesstobusiness technology platform which links our computer automated ordering system our suppliers and our distribution centers to automatically replenish our inventory      economies of scale      we enjoy significant economies of scale resulting from our position as the largest food retailer in brazil our large scale gives us increased bargaining power with suppliers resulting in lower prices for consumers higher operating margins and more favorable payment terms our size permits us to benefit from important marketing channels including prime time television advertising one of the most effective means to promote sales which would be prohibitively expensive for smaller retail chains our scale also enables us to make major operational investments such as in technology which generates attractive returns our size and financial strength compared to most other supermarket chains in brazil has put us at the forefront of the brazilian retail industry in using information technology and in continually improving our sophisticated management information systems      prime locations in densely populated urban areas and growing provincial urban centers      since we started our operations in  we have been able to accumulate store locations for our pão de açúcar and extra stores in prime sites that offer significant competitive advantages our older stores in são paulo and brasília are located in high traffic residential neighborhoods and as a result the average monthly sales per square meter in these stores is substantially higher than that of the average supermarket in brazil since prime real estate in these urban areas in brazil is scarce new stores would be prohibitively expensive for competitors our recent association with sendas in the state of rio de janeiro enabled us to add numerous high quality locations      high level of customer service      all of our store formats offer a broad selection of quality products in a pleasant shopping environment that emphasizes customer service we believe that our emphasis on employee training and our commitment to employee loyalty lead to higher levels of customer service which differentiates us from our competitors we have also developed customer loyalty and recognition programs which we believe enhance our competitive position for our  table of contents pão de açúcar  comprebemsendas and extra formats we offer a preferred shopping card which customers present at checkout and which collects information on the shopping patterns of our customers and offers credit products based on this information we also offer personalized discounts to our customers we were also the first brazilian food retailer to appoint a customer liaison to voice opinions suggestions and complaints on behalf of customers we have won several awards from industry associates for our innovative service such as prêmio sm excelência no varejo the excellence in retail award given by a group of industry professionals      offering of additional products and services      in the past several years we have begun to expand our range of complementary products and services in an effort to enhance our customer satisfaction and provide additional revenue sources for example with respect to the extra hypermarket format we have begun to provide additional services tailored to the specific needs of extra s broad base of customers such as gasoline stations within the parking area of extra stores in addition we have successfully test marketed and are currently incorporating drugstores into our existing store formats our recent association with sendas has greatly expanded our presence in drugstore services      during  our partnership with itaú holding to exploit financial products and services at cbds stores was enhanced the main product is private label cards that attracted more than  million card holders by the end of the year fic partnership allows cbd to offer its customers a wider variety of credit products and facilities      the main benefits offered by fic are lower risk and cheaper funding due to the presence of a strong financial partner increase in investments and technological updating as itaús core business includes the investment in this type of activity better quality products and higher profitability for the company wider products and services portfolio such as personal credit insurance etc and reduction of operating expenses our strategy our strategy is focused on pursuing increased efficiency allowing us to operate with lower costs and expenses and greater competitiveness the resulting gains will allow us to become even more competitive thereby boosting our main performance indicator  growth of samestore sales  in turn generating greater assets turnover and higher returns in  our focus was to identify opportunities for improving efficiency whereas in  the goal is to consolidate these initiatives thereby ensuring a virtuous circle of increased profitability and competitiveness we therefore drew up and implemented several initiatives throughout the year that will allow us to achieve the main goal of trimming costs and expenses and becoming more efficient commercial dynamic project      resulting from the new management model which brought together the purchasing and categorymanagement areas the commercial dynamic project is a key ingredient of our strategy by revising the management model processes and systems related to these two areas it will ensure greater efficiency in such aspects as negotiations with suppliers defining the best product assortment pricing strategies promotions and product display zero base budget      the adoption of this methodology is designed to ensure that our budgets are determined in a more rational manner taking into account real needs andor what really adds value to the operation the next step was to construct a ranking of proposed expenditures in order to prioritize those most relevant to achieving our strategic goals in order to ensure that expenditures are monitored in the most efficient manner we also adopted in line with zero base budget a model whereby executives variable compensation will be tied to meeting the expenditure targets shared services center      in order to eliminate the overlapping of internal tasks and procedures that have arisen from the growth of our administrative area in recent years we created an area which will concentrate all our repetitive and bureaucratic operational services ie those that do not involve such aspects as strategy decision taking or creation in practice they can be reduced to certain activities in the accounting human resources property management and treasury areas among others initially the center will map out the various departments demands and needs in relation to  table of contents these activities in order to identify how the associated processes take place centralization will allow them to be carried out in a more rational manner in line with real demand subsequently we intend to identify opportunities for boosting productivity and reducing expenses new purchasing area for nonsaleable products and services      this new area was set up to unify the acquisition of products and services not destined for resale which had previously been handled by various corporate areas these purchases involving items that are essential for the daytoday functioning of our offices and stores such as cleaning materials paper outsourced services electric power water airfares etc amount to around r  billion per year the aim is to provide the area with the same expertise we use when acquiring the products sold in our stores this means making maximum use of its bargaining power which will translate into more fruitful supplier negotiations backed by the most uptodate negotiating techniques cancellation of marketing contracts      cbd cancelled all its contracts with outside marketing agencies and concentrated all publicity activities for its store banners in the hands of pa publicidade an agency belonging to the group      all the above mentioned initiatives already implemented in the company aim at increasing efficiency by reducing costs and expenses our main objective is to be more pricecompetitive and boost samestore sales      additionally cbd is investing in competitive advantages such as to strengthen brandpositioning advantages with each store banner developing marketing and consumer relations activities for their respective target publics to restructure ecommerce operations with an emphasis on nonfood items thereby strengthening extra s share of this important sales channel to reinforce nonfood operations in general with an emphasis on home electronics and appliances textiles and householdautogardening items consolidating the extra brand as a national reference and increasing inandout initiatives to increase privatelabel sales in all store banners thereby boosting sales margins to increase the share of gas stations and drugstores in all store banners by opening new stores helping cement customer loyalty and increasing store traffic to strengthen the activities of financeira itaú cbd fic by developing products and services that represent new forms of revenue generation and act as important mechanisms for building loyalty and increasing store traffic      further improve efficiencies      we continually seek to improve operating efficiencies in connection with our supply chain we were one of the first supermarket chains in brazil to equip our stores with a point of sale or pos system and utilize a computer automated ordering system that automatically replenishes our inventory we intend to improve operating efficiencies in other stages of the supply chain particularly product outflow by increasing the volume of merchandise going through our distribution centers in  approximately  of our inventory came directly from one of our distribution centers instead of a supplier in the past year we combined our perishable and groceries departments in an effort to rationalize and reduce costs and we consolidated our nonfood product area and our flower department in order to achieve operating efficiency also as part of our strategy we intend to substantially increase our crossdocking capability which should result in working capital savings and lower inventory levels we also intend to improve handling to further decrease stockouts breakage and shrinkage and delivery costs for example we are exerting pressure on suppliers to ship their products in amounts that are less than a full pallet which we feel will result in cost savings through lower levels of spoilage      private label strategy      privatelabel and firstprice products constitute one of the main components of our strategy for the next  table of contents four years our aim is to double sales of privatelabel and bestprice products which will not only give us an extra edge over our competitors but should also strengthen customer loyalty      in the fourth quarter of  therefore we developed a new privatelabel brand for all our stores  the escolha econômica literally economical choice line as its name implies it aims to offer products at the lowest price in the market our intention is to boost competitiveness by forming a strong association between the our stores and low prices to generate store traffic by attracting priceconscious consumers to expand the range of lowpriced products to increase our bargaining power within our industry to maintain consumption patterns among customers whose purchasing power has diminished and to promote experimentation among customers with more rigid consumption patterns that habitually consume certain products the idea is to offer the products with the highest sales volume in each of  categories of items      in  we launched  escolha econômica items as well as  other privatelabel ones pão de açúcar  good light  mister valley  comprebem  sendas  and extra  both privatelabel and bestprice items recorded substantially higher gross profits than in  over the period from  sales have increased at an average annual rate of        seasonal performance was also strong at easter time privatelabel easter egg sales moved up  compared to sales a year earlier they were accompanied a series of free gifts such as characters from sítio do pica pau amarelo a famous series of brazilian childrens books robots and disney pixar characters at christmas time we launched seven seasonal items including meat products  tender  ham pernil  leg of pork and ave natalina  chicken and new varieties of panettone honey bread for extra and pão de açúcar and the introduction of the previous years favorite  cream fudge  into the comprebem and sendas stores period sales volume jumped  over       another of the years highlights was the construction of the innovation center which will substantially step up the development of privatelabel items it comprises two areas the consumer research center where products are tested with consumers against leading brands to ensure that they can compete in quality with the best in the market and the culinary center responsible for devising the new products in association with the suppliers and for creating the recipes that will eventually appear on the packaging in less than a year of operations  consumer tests and  technical tests were carried out and  courses were offered operations      the following table sets forth the number of stores the total selling area the average selling area per store total number of employees and the net sales revenue as a

our pão de açúcar stores are predominantly located in large urban areas with over onethird located in the greater são paulo city area we believe this to be a significant competitive advantage since available sites in those urban areas are scarce the pão de açúcar stores target the brazilian class a and class b household consumers whose minimum annual household income exceeds r the stores are characterized by a pleasant shopping environment a broad mix of quality products innovative service offerings and a high level of personal service with an average of  employees per  square meters of store space many of these stores feature specialty areas such as perishables baked goods wine readytoeat dishes meat cheese and seafood departments many stores offer shopping advisors to assist customers with inquiries about particular food needs prices special discounts and brand information pão de açúcar stores also offer private label products including the goodlight brand of health food products      we had  pão de açúcar stores at december   the pão de açúcar stores range in size from  to  square meters and averaged  square meters of selling space at december   the sale of food products represented  and nonfood products represented  of pão de açúcar net sales revenue in  pão de açúcar customers can also make purchases online through paodeacucarcombr  the pão de açúcar website this site is available to customers in the cities of são paulo rio de janeiro brasília and curitiba       pão de açúcar recorded gross sales of r  billion in  versus r  billion in  the decline was primarily due to the conversion of  stores to the comprebem format and by a slowdown in consumption and food deflation      nevertheless pão de açúcar maintained its  market share this was mainly thanks to the good performance of the stores in the more cosmopolitan regions whose sales increased such stores are responsible for  of total sales      the remaining  located in regions where there is strong price competition were more affected by the market variations albeit not unduly      in order to counter the declining price of certain food products there was a more pronounced specialization in certain items regarded as strategic such as coffee wine olive oil and bread a variety of initiatives were implemented to reinforce pão de açúcar s presence in these categories and encourage their purchase thereby adding value increasing consumers understanding of the product and generating a healthier costbenefit ratio      these initiatives were not limited to enhancing product variety but also involved services that supplied consumers with additional information through specialist talks posters leaflets and blackboard notices equipping them to make more knowledgeable purchase decisions one such example was a pilot project involving wine whereby customers could make use of touchscreen terminals to seek information on the product in question we intend to extend this procedure to other products      in order to improve productivity we established a project to permit continuous store monitoring we created a series of tools allowing managers to undertake a more detailed analysis of sales behavior and subsequently introduce staffing levels more appropriate to daytoday store movement the pursuit of best practices continued throughout the year and pão de açúcar stores across the board were subjected to internal expensereduction benchmarks in order to boost productivity      following a study carried out during the year the pão de açúcar mais program a preferred shopperfidelity card will be overhauled and relaunched in six stores in  the new program will hopefully be selfsustaining and will attract consumers      comprebemsendas stores       comprebem supermarkets offer competitive prices and essential services comprebem stores target the brazilian class c and class d household consumers whose annual household income is less than r and which collectively make up approximately  of all urban households accordingly comprebem stores are located in lowerincome neighborhoods compared to pão de açúcar stores generally comprebem stores offer more competitively priced products than pão de açúcar stores in addition these stores are characterized by a lower level of personal service than pão de açúcar stores with an average of  employees per  square meters of store space  table of contents      we have a private label preferred shopperfidelity card the clube comprebem card which is currently used by approximately  customers this card in addition to assisting us in the collection of consumer shopping data allows us to offer customers credit products      we had  stores under the comprebem banner at december   comprebems stores range in size from  to  square meters and averaged  square meters of selling space at december   in  nonfood items accounted for approximately  and food items accounted for approximately  of comprebem net sales revenue      the sendas communications strategy is aligned to the comprebem format however emphasis will be placed on the regional characteristics of the rio de janeiro market such as a strong presence on television another goal will be the revitalization of the banners image as a prestigious brand that celebrated its th anniversary in second quarter of        sendas ended  with  stores and gross sales of r billion its focus was on the profitability of the business and its brand repositioning in the state of rio de janeiro and the resulting revitalization of the banners image among consumers      the changes followed the same pattern adopted by the comprebem chain and were aimed at making sendas the main supermarket option for middle class women in rio de janeiro       comprebem and sendas had an exceptionally good year in  particularly sendas  with sales up  as compared to  comprebem also did well recording gross sales of r  billion up        one of the main factors behind these results was the conversion of  sendas stores in rio de janeiro incorporating the new positioning focused on the lower end of the middleincome spectrum developed in  for the comprebem stores the project undertaken between february and june consumed around r  million in remodeling and recuperation of the banners image this enhanced alignment of sendas stores with the comprebem model also helped recoup sendas  image in rio and it increased its market share according to nielsen which tracks retail performance the investment was quickly rewarded in terms of performance with growth accelerating as of june sendas closed the year with cbds best results      despite these advances there are still many challenges ahead due to the nature of the rio market which is more competitive than other regions and demands higher expenditure one initiative that will certainly help reduce expenses is the new commercial framework under which a good deal of the business management was transferred to são paulo with only operations regional supplier development and marketing remaining in rio  another positive step was the conversion of five abc stores in rio to the sendas format      in  comprebem replaced  pão de açúcar stores which were out of alignment with the latters positioning mostly located in são paulo state outside the capital and six coopercitrus ones acquired by cbd in may  in the case of these six a new store model was created called city supermarket  which functions as a small hypermarket in towns which do not have this type of establishment one example is the store in barretos which has  square meters of floor space and differs from its competitors in its greater attention to nonfood lines including an extensive home electronics and appliance range a bigger householdautogardening area and a streamlined textile section the aim of the format is to complement existing food sales thereby attracting more customers      in conjunction with fic there were a number of initiatives geared towards pleasing customers with comprebem and sendas cards but the undoubted highlight was the inandout initiatives dubbed now or never in both stores designed to reinforce the lowprice image and increase traffic of consumers in order to supply consumers with the products in question  with a focus on nonfood items that are not part of the stores normal mix  whose total or installment price is low the association with fic was crucial in ensuring low installment payments      extra extra eletro stores       extra hypermarkets are the largest of our stores we introduced the hypermarket format to brazil with the opening of our first  square meter store in  the extra hypermarkets offer the widest assortment of products of any of our store formats with approximately  items and an average selling area of  square meters at december   the extra stores target the brazilian class b class c and class d household consumers whose annual household income ranges from r to r at december   we had   table of contents extra stores the sale of food products represented  and nonfood products represented  of extra s net sales revenue in       in general the year was dominated by the consolidation of initiatives and processes begun in previous years and whose results should become apparent in  in addition to strengthening basic services such as reducing checkout waiting periods and improving the quality of perishables extra stores also concentrated on more strategic aspects such as privatelabel and bestprice products means of payment by putting greater emphasis on extra credit cards the creation of new services such as digital photo development expanding the gas stations and drug stores currently raising the number of each to  and  respectively and reinforcing the cartão presente a giftvoucher card which was restructured and will be relaunched in new format in       one of the years highlights was the introduction of mundo casa home world  a space dedicated to homes uniting products from three categories  consumer electronics and home appliances householdautogardening items and textiles in order to give customers all the information they need salespersons were trained in the knowledge of all the items involved      another pioneering initiative was a detailed customer profile survey including data on the number of customers per store and frequency of their visits allowing stores to adapt to changes in daytoday customer behavior and extra stores to introduce specific neighborhood initiatives in order to increase sales      the focus on perishables which has become one of extra s key features also continued throughout the year with the creation of the third employee training module which introduced new standardized techniques designed to improve the quality with which these products are treated by staff in turn improving competitiveness       extra eletro stores are generally small showrooms that sell a broad range of home appliances and consumer electronic products these stores had an average selling area of  square meters at december   customers place orders in the stores and products are shipped from a central warehouse at december   we had  extra eletro stores all of which are in the state of são paulo      in  extraeletro closed the year with  stores and gross sales of r  million the focus of the year was the street stores that were subjected to changes in layout and product mix in order to increase their sales and profitability also we launched a pilot project in a single store in which a space was dedicated to homes in line with the hypermarket concept of mundo casa home world this involved the introduction of categories not normally associated with such stores such as decorative items and textiles geared towards the b and c income groups consumer electronics and home appliances are expected to account for  of sales and the new products for the remaining  capital expansion and investment plan      as part of our capital expansion and investment plan we have invested approximately r billion in our operations since  our investments have included       acquisitions of supermarket and hypermarket chains  since  we have acquired and merged  stores consisting of numerous supermarket chains and individual stores through our acquisition of the barateiro chain in  we inaugurated a new store format targeted specifically to lower income consumers in addition when entering new markets we have generally sought to acquire local supermarket chains to benefit from their existing knowhow of the geographic region as a result these acquisitions have enabled us to expand our operations to locations outside of the state of são paulo particularly rio de janeiro and some northeastern brazilian states      we acquired the sé supermercados chain of supermarkets in  the purchase price was r million including the assumption of debt in the amount of r million on january   we sold the sé trade name for r million as requested by the conselho administrativo de defesa econômica cade the principal brazilian antitrust authority we have spent an aggregate of r million on acquisitions since       the following table presents information regarding these acquisitions and the regional

 including  pão de açúcar stores  comprebem stores  extra stores  extra eletro stores and  sendas store the total cost of these new stores was r million we seek real estate properties for constructing or renovating stores under one of our banners in regions where there are no local supermarket chain acquisition opportunities that suits one of our formats we also tend to enter new regional markets with the construction of a hypermarket      renovation of existing stores  we have remodeled pão de açúcar comprebem barateiro extra stores sendas and extra eletro stores every year our renovation program allows us to add refrigeration equipment to our stores create a more modern customerfriendly and efficient environment and outfit our stores with advanced information systems the total cost of renovating these stores was r million       improvements to information technology  we have been committed to technology as an important component in our pursuit of greater efficiency and security in the flow of information among stores distribution centers suppliers and corporate headquarters we implemented a computer automated ordering system which automatically replenishes our inventory based on consumers shopping habits we have a proprietary technology system the pdnet  a bb or business to business platform for the online integration of approximately  suppliers this internet process enables information to be exchanged rapidly precisely and transparently among all participants in the supply chain for more information see  technology we have spent an aggregate of r million on information technology since        expansion of distribution facilities  since  we have opened distribution centers in the cities of são paulo brasília fortaleza rio de janeiro and recife the increase and improvement in storage space enables us to further centralize purchasing for our stores and together with improvements to our information technology improve the overall efficiency of our

 mostly in opening new stores and remodeling the  sendas stores which were totally renovated and adapted to our standards another portion went towards the advance purchase of strategic sites that will form part of our investment plan in the next two years      annual organic growth in  was strong with the inauguration of seven extra hypermarkets and eight supermarkets seven pão de açúcar stores and one comprebem store as well as eight gas stations and  drug stores we also acquired the coopercitrus chain located in the midwest of são paulo state with gross sales of r  million in  the six stores and three gas stations were converted to the comprebem format      in addition to being remodeled and upgraded three abc barateiro stores were converted to the sendas format during the year and  pão de açúcar stores were converted to the comprebem format information technology and logistics investments involved respectively the substitution of hardware and software and the upgrading and renovation of the distribution centers      in  and  the company plans to open  to  hypermarkets and  to  supermarkets which should increase sales by  to  per year      our board of directors approved the investment plan for  totaling r million in the year earmarked for opening new stores gas stations and drugstores site acquisitions renovations and maintenance of existing assets supply and distribution       supply  we have centralized purchasing for our pão de açúcar  comprebem  extra and extra eletro stores we purchase substantially all of our food products on a spot or shortterm basis from unaffiliated suppliers in the aggregate we purchase up to  products from approximately  suppliers in  no single supplier accounted for more than  of total goods purchased our  largest suppliers in  collectively accounted for  of our purchases and we believe that we are not dependent on any single supplier       distribution  in order to distribute perishable food products grocery items and general merchandise efficiently we operate  distribution centers strategically located within the cities of são paulo brasília fortaleza curitiba rio de janeiro and recife with a total storage capacity of  square meters of builtin area we were the first retailer in brazil to have a centralized distribution center the locations of our distribution centers make it possible for us to make frequent shipments to stores which reduce the need of instore stockroom space and limits nonproductive store inventories cbd has an efficient logistics operation with an  centralization level which enables it to have lower logistics costs and higher productivity gains in addition the higher productivity is related to recent investments in new distribution centers flowers fish frozen products fruits and vegetables this performance has enabled the company to operate the supply chain with the lowest costs of its history      in  our distribution centers focused on reducing expenses by developing initiatives aimed at adding value and cutting logistics costs      one such initiative was the structuring of the distribution network which involved more suppliers delivering their goods to the regional distribution centers thereby strengthening the regionalization process and reducing cbds freight costs another was the introduction of more compact loads enabling trucks to carry a  table of contents greater volume of merchandise in turn reducing the number of trips logistics costs were further trimmed by streamlining operating processes within the distribution centers which increased productivity and rationalized workforce numbers      in addition monitoring procedures were introduced which led to a substantial decline in the outofstock index the national benchmarking level aside from the reduction itself the initiatives also focused on processes that resulted in more efficient controls over breakages involving those products with the highest turnover      relationships with suppliers were strengthened by the consolidation of our top log suppliers certification system which ranks suppliers and helps develop a better relationship between cbd and its suppliers which generated strong results meetings were held with more than  suppliers during which cbd was able to broaden its knowledge of their logistics while suppliers also improved their understanding of our distribution and logistics enabling the development of several joint processimprovement initiatives at the end of the year  suppliers were certified as having achieved the proposed objectives which were based on indicators related to level of service outofstock indicators and joint projects      in addition to strengthening the supply framework in the northeast with the construction of a new distribution center for grocery and nonfood items and the remodeling of the old facility which was turned into a perishable center we also tripled the capacity of our seafood center previously limited to supplying  extra stores in são paulo state the seafood operation now covers all stores including in other states the flower center located in holambra in the state of são paulo was also expanded to and began to supply rio de janeiro marketing      our marketing strategy is to further enhance the quality image of our stores and to emphasize our selection and service and our competitive and fair prices each store banner executes its own marketing strategy designed to promote its particular strengths and to appeal to its customer base in  and  we spent approximately r million and r million respectively on advertising approximately  of total net sales revenues in each year      we spent  in  and  in  of our total marketing expenditures on radio newspaper and magazine advertising in addition television accounted for  of advertising expenses in  and  in  we spent  in  and  in  on other promotional activities      we centralize the purchasing of advertising time or space for all of our stores which enables us to reduce marketing expenditures cbd cancelled all its contracts with outside marketing agencies and concentrated all publicity activities for its store banners in the hands of pa publicidade an agency belonging to the group while our primary advertising focus is on specific brand name price and qualityrelated promotions we also regularly promote our store brands through sponsorships and sporting and cultural events endorsements and support of environmental activities      we have further developed our marketing initiatives through the pão de açúcar mais card the first preferred shopperfidelity relationship card in the brazilian retail industry and the clube comprebem card through these programs we continue to collect customer information in an effort to offer more personalized services and products to shoppers who use our stores we have also developed a private label strategy pursuant to which our various stores sell high quality products at competitive prices the principal advantages of this private label strategy have been improved brand loyalty to our brands and increased leverage with our suppliers because our private label products are similar in quality to but more favorably priced than leading brands credit sales      in   of our net sales revenue were represented by credit sales in the form of credit card sales installment sales postdated checks and purchase vouchers in   of our net sales revenue was represented by credit sales       credit card sales  all our store formats accept payment for purchases with mastercard credicard  visa diners club american express or our cobranded credit cards we also offer private label credit cards whose use is limited to our stores sales to customers using credit cards accounted for  of our net sales revenue in  in  sales through credit cards accounted for  of our net sales revenue an allowance for doubtful  table of contents accounts is not required as credit risks are substantially assumed by third parties our itaú cbd partnership provides credit products and services at cbds stores which involves private label and cobranded credit cards       installment sales  our extra eletro stores and extra hypermarkets offer attractive consumer financing to our customers who frequently purchase electronic goods or home appliances respectively on an installment basis the consumer credit installment term in  averaged  months with fixed interest payments averaging approximately  per month throughout  we borrow funds approximately equivalent to the consumer credit financing we extend through our sales of electronics the consumer financing is generally for a term of up to  months and is funded by our borrowing on a shorterterm basis at fixed rates in  installment sales accounted for  of our total net sales revenue       postdated checks  postdated checks are commonly used financial instruments in brazil to make purchases postdated checks are executed by a consumer with a future date up to  days instead of the date of the purchase the retailer typically deposits the check only as of this future date and interest for the time elapsed is included in the amount of the check we currently have postdated check programs in which interest is computed on the settlement amount based upon a fixed monthly rate of interest to a lesser extent for certain promotional programs no interest is charged we limit the availability of postdated checks to customers who meet our credit criteria and who hold our identification card over  customers use the programs on at least a monthly basis sales to customers using postdated checks accounted for  of our net sales revenue in   in       as part of the credit approval process we require each customer to complete a credit application the applicant must also provide a taxpayers identification number identification card proof of residential address and current pay stub or other evidence of income as part of the application process we then run a credit check with local credit reporting services and with spc and serasa both of which are national credit reporting services to determine a credit limit we also input the data regarding the client and any purchases into our database       purchase vouchers  we accept as payment in our stores vouchers issued by third party agents to participating companies who provide them to their employees as a fringe benefit purchase vouchers accounted for  of our net sales revenue in  compared to  in  an allowance for doubtful accounts is not required as credit risks are substantially assumed by third parties technology      we have been at the forefront of the brazilian retail industry in using information technology we were one of the first supermarket chains in brazil to equip its stores with a pos system and the first major food retailer in brazil to equip every one of its checkouts with this technology we invested r million in technology in  and r million in       considered an important competitive advantage information technology operates in harmony with our strategic guidelines seeking solutions and tools to sustain and simplify internal processes aligned with the changes undergone by cbd during the year the area played a fundamental role in the integration of the commercial and category management areas      the main goal was to furnish a package of instruments and aids which in addition to providing support would transform the new business models proposed changes into reality with this in mind systems and tools were developed which would allow the two areas to work together and have access to the same information with the same indicators ensuring transparency in commercial relations cost and margin calculations etc      in the business intelligence area the team came up with a new type of intelligence gathering tool which allows us to analyze the prices of all our competitors in all the leading cities its novelty lies in the enhancement of the interface with the database which already existed but was endowed with a wider range of consultative and graphic features allowing managers and executives to broaden their analytical spectrum      the area handled the updating of more than  pointsofsales machines in the entire group and the migration of  software programs from dos to linux allowing cbd to expand the applications of these machines to include even more frontline services to its customers      another highlight was the implantation of new budget planning system that can be updated online in addition to integrating the sales category management and commercial areas it also allowed these areas to carry  table of contents out their planning activities with greater ease and speed      on the innovation front studies into the application of smart tags moved ahead with the development of the first pilot project using this technology in the latin american retail sector cbd was also the first supermarket company to offer its customers wifi wireless broadband internet access now available in  pão de açúcar stores and was responsible for installing brazils first self checkout facility in the pão de açúcar store in real parque in the state of são paulo this allows consumers to make their own product barcode readings and pay for their purchases without the need for checkout personnel competition      the brazilian food retailing business is highly competitive and has experienced consolidation in recent years in  the three largest food retailers in brazil accounted for  of the organized sector sales which consist of sales by companies enrolled in abras brazils supermarket association in  we accounted for  of the organized sector sales according to abras we believe that consolidation will continue to take place not only within the food retail market but also other segments of the retail industry for example hypermarkets are expected to gain market share in apparel general merchandise consumer electronics furniture home development and other nonfood categories because of a general lack of department stores and specialized stores in brazil we have continued our growth strategy by focusing on regions where we can reinforce our presence as part of our expansion strategy we have also focused on the needs and expectations of different consumers by developing store formats that respond to different household income levels although we operate stores in many regions throughout brazil the size wealth and importance of the são paulo state have led us to concentrate our stores in this particular market in  sales in são paulo state accounted for  of our total sales in são paulo state and throughout brazil we compete principally on the basis of location price image quality and service in the retail food market our competition includes hypermarkets supermarkets and traditional wholesalers our principal competitors are multinational retail food chains local supermarkets and grocery stores      the main competitor of our extra hypermarket is carrefour  a leading french retail food chain which at december   operated  retail stores principally in the southeast and south of brazil at december   carrefour accounted for  of the organized sectors sales according to data from abras walmart  which as of december   operated  stores in brazil is also a competitor in the hypermarket and supermarket format with an  market share       pão de açúcar has different competitors in each of the markets where we operate in são paulo state we compete principally with a number of local supermarkets and grocery stores such as sonda pastorinho carrefour mambo futurama and walmart the main competitor of pão de açúcar in brasília is champion the supermarket division of carrefour super maia super cei and big box in the state of rio de janeiro our pão de açúcar format competes with supermercados mundial and zona sul in paraíba pernambuco ceará and piauí our main competitors are local supermarkets and bompreço walmart       comprebem  sendas also faces different competitors depending on the particular regional market in the state of são paulo comprebem faces strong competition from a number of smaller regional chains the main competitors of comprebem  sendas in the state of rio de janeiro are guanabara champion and mundial      in other regional markets we compete within the organized food retail sector as well as against several medium and small chains and familyowned and operated food retail businesses which are estimated to represent approximately  of overall food sales in brazil other organized food retail chains among our competitors include sonae and bompreço  owned by walmart in brazil      the principal competitors of our extra eletro stores are casas bahia and ponto frio globex each of which operates in são paulo state      other us and international retailers may enter into the brazilian retail market either directly by forming joint ventures or by acquiring existing chains some of these potential competitors may have greater financial resources than us moreover to the extent that other large international food retailers enter the brazilian market or  table of contents the retail sector continues to consolidate through the acquisition of local supermarket chains our market share may be adversely affected regulatory matters      we are subject to a wide range of governmental regulation and supervision generally applicable to companies engaged in business in brazil including federal state and municipal regulation such as labor laws public health and environmental laws in order to open and operate our stores we need a business permit and site approval an inspection certificate from the local fire department as well as health and safety permits our stores are subject to inspection by city authorities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable statutory and administrative regulations with respect to our business      our business is primarily affected by a set of consumer protection rules regulating matters such as advertising labeling and consumer credit we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these consumer protection regulations      as a result of significant inflation during long periods in the past it is commonly the practice in brazil not to label individual items currently there exists uncertainty regarding the requirement for price labeling each individual item this uncertainty derives from a conflict between federal and state laws on the subject state laws allow other pricing methods such as the posting of signs and the placement of scanners for bar codes which are the prevailing commercial practices if the conflict is not resolved in a manner consistent with our current pricing practices and we are compelled to place price tags on each individual item we would lose flexibility in carrying out our sales and may incur increased labor costs in connection with the affixing of price tags however we do not believe that our business would be adversely affected in a material way      the brazilian congress is considering a bill requiring a prior assessment of the impact of the construction of a hypermarket in excess of  square meters on the relevant neighborhood the proposed regulation is intended to protect traditional familyowned retailers that have increasingly lost market share in brazil to the larger chains and hypermarkets regulations of this type already exist at the municipal level for example governmental authorities in the city of porto alegre in the state of rio grande do sul issued a city ordinance in january  prohibiting construction of food retail stores with a selling area greater than  square meters which in may  was amended as to increase from  to  squares meters the selling area of food retail stores other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and if the bill pending before the brazilian congress becomes law our future expansion and growth may be subject to significant constraints       c organizational structure      companhia brasileira de distribuição conducts our operations our investments in subsidiaries are effected primarily to acquire the share capital of other retail chains from third parties in most cases the retail operations are transferred to retail stores under existing banners or the stores acquired begin operating under our banners all our operations are conducted under the pão de açúcar  comprebem sendas extra and extra eletro banners       d property plant and equipment      we own  stores seven warehouses and a part of our headquarters the remaining  stores and  warehouses we operate and the remainder of our headquarters are leased leases are usually for a term of five to  years and provide for monthly rent payments based on a percentage of sales above an agreed minimum value we have  leases expiring in  based on our prior experience and brazilian law and leasing practices we do not anticipate any material change in the general terms of our leases or any material difficulty in renewing them as of december   we leased  properties from members of the diniz family and  stores from fundo de investimento
