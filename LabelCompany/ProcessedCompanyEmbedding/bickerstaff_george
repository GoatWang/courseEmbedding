james e humes ii columbus ga for appellee in this case a company challenges under several provisions of state and federal law the decision of a county board of commissioners to rezone the companys property   the district court granted injunctive relief in favor of the company and the county took this interlocutory appeal   for the reasons that follow we affirm in part reverse in part and vacate in partiathe property in question is a landlocked acre tract located in southwest harris county georgia along interstate highway    appellee bickerstaff clay products inc “bickerstaff” a brick manufacturing company bought the property in  because of the propertys rich reserves of a mineral used in the brickmaking process   bickerstaff uses a form of rock called weathered mylonite in the manufacture of bricks  the harris county property lies along a vein of such rock   at the time bickerstaff purchased the property it had no immediate need to mine the weathered mylonite on the property   it conducted several test drills on the property and dug a trench to determine the extent of the mylonite deposit but otherwise did not mine the property   instead bickerstaff held the property in its mineral reserves for future usein  the governing entity for harris county a fivemember board of commissioners enacted a countywide zoning ordinance including a comprehensive landuse plan for the county   the ordinance provided that initial determinations on zoning matters such as rezoning requests would be studied by the county planners office which would recommend the denial or granting of the request to a planning commission   the planning commission would hold a public meeting on the rezoning request and then would make recommendations to the board of commissioners which would have final authority over all zoning decisions   the  ordinance zoned bickerstaffs property a which is the designation given to vacant property  under the ordinance the uses permitted on land zoned a include general agriculture and forestry  the stated purpose of the a category is to “preserve land areas suitable for eventual rezoning”in  bickerstaff decided to make use of the mylonite reserves on the harris county property   to that end bickerstaff applied for a mining permit from the georgia environmental protection department   in this application bickerstaff indicated the proposed duration and manner of the mining and explained how the company would shield surrounding areas from the noise and visual disturbances attendant to the operation  the application also contained provisions for land reclamation and runoff containment   in august of  the department granted bickerstaff a permit to mine the propertywhile preparing its application to the environmental protection department bickerstaff discovered that the property had been zoned a and that a zoning would not permit mining   armed with state approval of the mining operation bickerstaff sought to have the property rezoned m which would permit mining   bickerstaff presented its plan to the harris county planner who found that m zoning was consistent with the countys comprehensive landuse plan and recommended that the planning commission approve the rezoning request   following a public meeting however the planning commission voted to recommend that the board of commissioners deny the rezoning requestthe board of commissioners then held a public hearing on bickerstaffs application for rezoning   in accordance with the zoning ordinance bickerstaff was allowed to present its proposed plan for mining its land and any citizen with an opinion about bickerstaffs proposal was allowed to speak   the board made no decision on the rezoning request at that time but instead met privately two weeks later to consider the request   at that meeting the chairman of the board of commissioners moved to rezone the property r which allows only lowdensity residential development  bickerstaff had not requested r zoning and had no notice that the board would consider rezoning the property r   the chairmans motion passed by a vote of four to onebfollowing the boards decision bickerstaff brought this suit against harris county alleging violations of the united states constitution the georgia constitution and state real property law  bickerstaffs primary contention is that rezoning the property r constituted a taking of bickerstaffs property because the rezoning rendered the property virtually useless  the property cannot be developed as a residential subdivision because there is effectively no access to a public roadway  according to bickerstaff this taking was in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution  and article i of the georgia constitution  because the taking was accomplished  pursuant to an invalid exercise of the countys police power and  without providing bickerstaff just compensation   bickerstaff therefore asked the district court to award the company just compensation for a temporary taking in the event the r zoning was held invalid or for a permanent taking if it was not   see first english evangelical lutheran church v los angeles county  us   sct   ledd   recognizing a takings clause claim for the temporary deprivation of all use of private propertyin its answer to bickerstaffs complaint the county denied that it was liable under any of bickerstaffs theories of recovery   as for bickerstaffs fifth amendment claim the county contended that the suit was not ripe for federal court review because bickerstaff had not pursued its remedies in state court   see williamson county regional planning commn v hamilton bank  us    sct    ledd     the county noted that although bickerstaff had filed a suit on the same claims in the harris county superior court bickerstaff had persuaded that court to stay its hand pending the outcome of the instant case   the county further contended that because the superior court had jurisdiction over the controversy the instant case was barred  the district court did not rule on these contentions and scheduled a bench trial on bickerstaffs claims for declaratory and injunctive reliefthe bench trial focused on bickerstaffs acquisition of the property its plans to mine the land and the circumstances surrounding the rezoning of the property r   after entertaining the parties evidence the court entered an order declaring the r and prior a zoning classifications invalid   the court enjoined the enforcement of either the r or the a zoning classification on both state and federal grounds   it concluded that these measures were “not substantially related to any valid health safety or welfare considerations” and thus under the due process clauses of both the state and federal constitutions constituted invalid exercises of the countys police power   in addition these classifications were enacted in derogation of bickerstaffs right under georgia law and the harris county zoning ordinance to mine the property as either a vested right or a nonconforming use   the court thus enjoined the county from applying any zoning classification to the property other than m   finally the court held that the r classification by rendering bickerstaffs property worthless had effected a taking of the property without just compensation in violation of the state and federal constitutions   proceedings to determine just compensation have been stayed pending our resolution of this appealfollowing the district courts entry of the injunctive relief described above the county took this interlocutory appeal   we have jurisdiction under  usc § a    we review the district courts factual findings for clear error  fedrcivp a   questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo   see nadler v mann  fd   th ciriias noted the district courts injunction addressed three zoning classifications  a r and m   the court invalidated the a and r classifications and ordered the board to apply the m classification to the property   we summarily vacate the aspect of the courts injunction that prohibits the board from applying any zoning classification to the property except m   the court cited no authority state or federal for such actionwhich in effect usurped the boards legislative functionand bickerstaff has cited us to nonein the discussion that follows we address first the courts decision to strike down the a zoning and conclude that bickerstaffs challenge to that zoning is time barred   turning next to the boards decision to zone the property r we conclude that the court had no basis for invalidating the decision on the ground that bickerstaff had acquired a right to mine the property as either a vested right or a nonconforming use under georgia law   the courts alternative holdingthat under georgia law the boards decision constituted a taking without just compensationis however correct   we therefore affirm the courts decision invalidating the r zoning   we vacate though the courts holding that the boards decision also violated the united states constitution because bickerstaffs federal claim is not ripe a bickerstaff cannot challenge the countys original decision to zone the property a   the property has been zoned a since  and bickerstaff is barred from challenging this zoning not only by the applicable statute of limitations see ocga § b but also by the doctrine of laches  the provision of the district courts injunction invalidating the a zoning is accordingly vacatedbwe consider now the merits of the remaining statelaw grounds for the district courts invalidation of the r zoning   they are   that bickerstaff had acquired a right to mine the property as a nonconforming use within the meaning of the harris county zoning ordinance   that bickerstaff had acquired a “vested right” under the georgia common law to mine the property  and  that the boards r rezoning of the property and its refusal to rezone the property m constituted a taking without just compensation in violation of the georgia constitutionthe harris county zoning ordinance defines a nonconforming use as “a building structure or use of land existing at the time of enactment of this ordinance and which does not conform to the regulations of the district in which it is situated”   the court found that bickerstaffs intention to mine the property was a “use of land” that existed at the time the zoning ordinance was enacted because the ordinance defines “use” as “the specific purpose for which land or building is designed arranged intended or for which it is or may be occupied or maintained” emphasis added in georgia however “mere preliminary work not of a substantial nature does not constitute a nonconforming use  neither does a use which is merely contemplated for the future but unrealized as of the effective date of the regulation”  rainwater v coweta county bd of zoning appeals  gaapp   sed      bickerstaffs drilling and testing on the property more than thirty years agoto determine the extent of the mylonite veincannot be characterized as anything but preliminary and its intention to mine the property was in  when the harris county zoning ordinance was enacted a “use ․ merely contemplated for the future”   extending a nonconforming use to an owners unrealized intentions for his property would mean that any property owner whenever confronted with unfavorable zoning could claim a nonconforming use by stating that he had always intended to use the property as for instance a shopping center or an apartment complex or an office park   bickerstaff has not acquired the right to mine the property as a nonconforming use and we reverse the district courts conclusion to the contrarybickerstaff contends and the district court held that it has a “vested right” to mine the propertya right that the board is powerless to limit   this right supposedly arose from the companys preliminary drilling and testing of the soil on the property   we do not believe that georgias vested rights doctrine extends that far the doctrine of vested rights that the district court applied in this case is derived from the principle of equitable estoppel   see cohn communities inc v clayton county  ga   sed      the doctrine applies when a “landowner relying in good faith upon some act or omission of the government has made a substantial change in position or incurred such extensive obligation and expenses that it would be highly inequitable and unjust to destroy the rights he has acquired”   id bickerstaff has established none of these elements   while bickerstaffs expenditures for the test drills may have risen to the level of “extensive obligations and expenses” harris county made no representations on which bickerstaff could have relied or did rely   at no time between bickerstaffs purchase of the property and the companys application for rezoning did any harris county official promise bickerstaff that the property would be zoned for mining   we therefore reverse the district courts holding that bickerstaff has acquired a vested right to mine the property under georgia law in order to determine whether a zoning ordinance has effected a taking without just compensation in violation of the georgia constitution see ga const art i § iii par i and note  supra courts employ a balancing test   in the words of the georgia supreme court a court must “weigh  the benefit to the public against the detriment to the individual”  gradous v board of commrs  ga   sed      in practical terms the balancing test means that an aggrieved landowner must show that the zoning decision “presents a significant detriment to the landowner and is insubstantially related to the public health safety morality and welfare”   id  sed at  the district court found that the application of the r zoning classification to bickerstaffs property rendered the property virtually worthless   we agree that the rezoning of bickerstaffs property r deprives the property of all reasonable economic use   thus bickerstaff has proven the first part of its georgia takings claim  that the zoning “presents a significant detriment to” bickerstaffthe district court further concluded that the r zoning was not substantially related to the public health safety morality or welfare and was thus an invalid exercise of the countys police power   although there is no formula for determining when government action exceeds the police power the georgia supreme court has held that a zoning decision that “completely fails to scrutinize the merits of the land in question and the impact of the decision upon the landowners property rights” is an invalid exercise of the police power  barrett v hamby  ga   sed   the county has presented no evidence indicating that the board evaluated prospective uses for the property conducted a study of the possible impact mining would have on neighboring property or even considered the probable effect that r zoning would have on the value of bickerstaffs property   the members of the board testified at trial that they thought the r zoning was in the “best interests” of the county but they offered no justification for this conclusion the exercise of the police power is not without limits   where as here the governing entity “completely fails to scrutinize” the balance between the public interest in the contemplated zoning and the impact of the zoning on the property the entitys decision is beyond its police power   it is clear that the r zoning had a significant detrimental effect on the value of bickerstaffs property and that the board had only vague and unsubstantiated conclusions to justify the zoning   therefore the rezoning of bickerstaffs property constituted a taking of the property in violation of the georgia constitutioniiithe district court also held that the boards decision to rezone bickerstaffs property r was invalid under the takings clause of the fifth amendment and the substantive component of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment   the court so held because it found that the zoning decision  effectively condemned bickerstaffs property for a purpose not within the countys police power to pursue and  failed to provide bickerstaff just compensation  in concluding that these two elements made out a claim under both the takings clause and the due process clause the district court did not consider whether the bickerstaffs takings claim subsumed its substantive due process claim   we hold that it doesa the takings clause of the fifth amendment prohibits government from condemning “private property ․ for public use without just compensation”   the clause applies in any case in which government action renders private property worthless  see agins v tiburon  us    sct    ledd    lucas v south carolina coastal council  us    sct    ledd   government action effectively condemns a landowners property if it denies him “all economically beneficial or productive use” of his property   bickerstaff contends and has established that the r zoning classification rendered its property worthless and it seeks “just compensation” for its loss   bickerstaff also contends that this “taking” was not for a “public use”   depending on the resolution of the public use issue bickerstaff will be entitled to just compensation for either the temporary or permanent loss of use of the property  the substantive component of the due process clause prohibits a government entity from applying to property a zoning classification that bears no relationship to the “public health safety morals or general welfare” and thus is beyond the governments police power   see village of euclid v ambler realty co  us    sct    led     a person whose property is affected by such a classification may challenge the measure and if successful may recover damages for any injury the classification may have caused him while it was operative   here bickerstaff contends that the application of the r zoning classification to its property is an invalid exercise of the countys police power and has rendered the property worthless   if bickerstaff ultimately prevails on this issue it may recover in damages the value of its temporary loss of use of the property this discussion makes it apparent that bickerstaffs takings clause claim and its substantive due process claim are identical if the challenges to the validity of the r zoning classification itself are evaluated under the same standard   that is the claims are identical if the scope of “public use” under the takings clause and the scope of “police power” under the substantive component of the due process clause are the same   the supreme courts decision in hawaii hous auth v midkiff  us    sct    ledd   indicates that they aremidkiff involved a landowners challenge to the validity of an hawaii statute that provided for the condemnation of private land and the sale of such land to the landowners lessees   the landowners mounted their challenge under the “public use” component of the takings clause   they claimed that “the taking of their property for the purpose of reselling it to their lessees was not for a public purpose and hence violative of the fifth amendment command  ‘nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation’ ”  midkiff v tom  fsupp   dhawin rejecting the landowners challenge the supreme court compared the scopes of “public use” under the takings clause and “police power” under the due process clause   the court concluded that “the public use requirement is ․ coterminous with the scope of a sovereigns police powers”  midkiff  us at   sct at   see also national rr passenger corp v boston  maine corp  us    sct    ledd   “we have held that the public use requirement of the takings clause is coterminous with the regulatory power”   bickerstaffs takings clause and substantive due process challenges to the validity of the r classification are therefore evaluated under the same standardaccordingly bickerstaffs takings clause claim subsumes its substantive due process claim unless it can be said that the framers of the bill of rights in addition to providing the substantive rights contained in the takings clause meant to replicate by implication those same rights in the due process clause   we do not believe that such duplication was intended   we therefore hold that bickerstaffs challenge to the validity of the r zoning classification lies solely under the takings clause b the foregoing discussion makes clear that the only federal constitutional ground supporting the district courts injunction is bickerstaffs fifth amendment takings claim   that claim however is not ripe   see williamson county regional planning commn v hamilton bank  us    sct    ledd     a takings clause claim does not become ripe unless the state provides no remedy to compensate the landowner for the taking   a property owner cannot claim a violation of the clause unless the state provides the landowner no procedure such as an action for inverse condemnation for obtaining just compensation   williamson  us at   sct at  bickerstaff contends that georgia provides it no judicial mechanism for obtaining just compensation in this case  accordingly its takings clause claim is ripe   we disagree   under georgia law a landowner may bring suit under the eminent domain and due process provisions of the georgia constitution ga const art i § i par i and § iii par i to enjoin the enforcement of a zoning classification that effects a “taking” of his property   see eg gradous v board of commrs  ga   sed     we find no georgia cases denying a landowner just compensation for the temporary loss of use of his property while burdened with an invalid zoning classification  nor do we find any cases denying a landowner just compensation where a valid zoning classification effectively condemns his property   see eg eastbibb twiggs neighborhood assn v macon bibb planning  zoning commn  fd  th cir affg  fsupp  mdga amended and superseded  fd  th cir  see also calibre spring hill ltd v cobb county  fsupp   ndga  first english evangelical lutheran church v los angeles county  us   sct   ledd   holds that a state deprives a landowner of his rights under the takings clause if it denies him just compensation in either of these situations   we assume that the georgia courts will follow the holding of first english we therefore do not hold that the harris county superior court will not as a matter of georgia law recognize bickerstaffs takings claim and provide the company just compensation for either a temporary or a permanent taking   we hold instead that because the superior court will entertain bickerstaffs claim for inverse condemnation bickerstaffs fifth amendment takings claim is not ripe for federal district court reviewivin conclusion we affirm the district courts injunction that invalidates the application of the r zoning classification to bickerstaffs property but we do so on only one ground  the classification constitutes a taking of bickerstaffs property in violation of the georgia constitution   we vacate the portions of the injunction invalidating the a zoning classification and ordering the board to apply the m classification to the property   finally we vacate the portion of the injunction that is based on bickerstaffs takings clause and substantive due process claims   we direct the court to dismiss bickerstaffs takings clause claim as not ripe and to dismiss the substantive due process claim because it states no case for reliefwe note that the district court has retained jurisdiction to try bickerstaffs claim for money damages for the temporary loss of use of its property from the effective date of the boards r zoning decision to the receipt of our mandate   that claim shall be tried under georgia lawso orderedfootnotes   the  zoning ordinance was reenacted almost verbatim in  and again in  to cure alleged procedural defects in the original ordinance   the zoning of bickerstaffs property was a in all three ordinances   the mining of mylonite does not involve any blasting or crushing of rock   it is simply a digging operation whereby the rock is extracted from the ground using backhoes and then hauled away in dump trucks   r is the designation given to land that is to be developed as a residential subdivision containing singlefamily lots   bickerstaffs amended complaint the pleading before us contains eight counts   the complaint is a typical shotgun pleading in that some of the counts present more than one discrete claim for relief   see eg anderson v district bd of trustees  fd   th cir   moreover in some instances one cannot discern with respect to a given claim for relief the substantive rule giving rise to the claim   for purposes of this appeal we give bickerstaffs complaint a liberal reading and construe it as presenting the following claims for relief a takings claim pursuant to  usc §  that seeks just compensation for the full value of the property under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution  count one   this count also seeks an injunction under an undisclosed rule of law prohibiting the board from preventing bickerstaff from mining its property a claim under  usc §  for money damages on the ground that the board has violated bickerstaffs unspecified “substantive rights” under the fifth and fourteenth amendments  count two   this count also seeks the same injunctive relief as count one   the district court appears to have interpreted this allegation as alleging a claim under the substantive component of the fourteenth amendments due process clause a claim under  usc §  for money damages on the ground that in reaching its zoning decision the board denied bickerstaff its right to procedural due process under the fifth and fourteenth amendments  count three   this count also seeks the same injunctive relief as count one a takings claim under the georgia constitution article i section i paragraph i and article i section iii paragraph i   this claim seeks an injunction prohibiting the board from preventing bickerstaff from mining its property  count four a claim for a declaration that unspecified provisions of the united states and georgia constitutions grant bickerstaff a “vested right” to mine the property  count five   this count seeks in the alternative money damages for the full value of the property a claim that unspecified provisions of the united states constitution and georgia law and several provisions of the harris county zoning ordinance grant bickerstaff the right to mine the property as a “nonconforming use”   bickerstaff seeks an injunction prohibiting the board from preventing it from mining the property  count six a claim that the boards denial of bickerstaffs m zoning request was “arbitrary and capricious” under an unspecified provision of law and also violates the harris county zoning ordinance   bickerstaff seeks an injunction prohibiting the board from preventing bickerstaff from mining the property  count seven a claim that the harris county zoning ordinance is invalid under ocga §   because of procedural irregularities in the adoption of the ordinance   bickerstaff seeks a declaration that the ordinance is invalid  count eightthe district court had subject matter jurisdiction under  usc §§  and  to entertain bickerstaffs federal constitutional claims   the court entertained bickerstaffs statelaw claims under its supplemental jurisdiction   the district court based its injunction only on the claims described in   and  above   accordingly we do not address the claims described in  and    bickerstaff has a footwide easement running  feet over neighboring land to georgia highway    bickerstaff contends and the county does not dispute that a residential subdivision must have at least one means of ingress and egress and that to accommodate a subdivision entrance the easement would need to be at least  feet wide   the fifth amendments prohibition on takings for public use without just compensation is applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment   see chicago b  q rr v chicago  us    sct    led     further references in this opinion to a takings claim under the fifth amendment mean a takings claim under the fifth and fourteenth amendments   the georgia constitution does not have a takings clause   georgia courts recognize takings claims however under the eminent domain provision of article i section iii paragraph i “private property shall not be taken or damaged for public purposes without just and adequate compensation being first paid” and the due process provision of article i section i paragraph i “no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property except by due process of law”   see gradous v board of commrs  ga   sed      the county provided the district court with no authority for the proposition that the pendency of the state court suit barred bickerstaffs prosecution of this suit and we know of none   we read the countys answer on this point as a request that the district court stay its hand until the state court proceeding ran its courseon appeal the county contends that bickerstaffs takings clause and substantive due process claims are not ripe for federal district court adjudication and that therefore the district court should have dismissed them for want of subject matter jurisdiction   in addition the county contends that the court in the exercise of its discretion should have dismissed bickerstaffs remaining pendent state law claims   we disagreebickerstaffs federal constitutional claims are not “frivolous” nor were they asserted “solely for the purpose of giving the district court subject matter jurisdiction”  bell v hood  us    sct    led     thus the district court was not required to dismiss the pendent statelaw claims and it was within its discretion to decide the statelaw issues   we are mindful of the doctrine that a federal court should not pass on federal constitutional issues unless necessary to its decision   see ashwander v tennessee valley auth  us    sct    led   brandeis j concurring “the court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of”   we believe that it is prudent to discuss the federal constitutional claims in this case because the damages issue remains to be litigated   if we do not decide the federal constitutional claims then the district court in framing the issues for the damages trial will likely provide for recovery under the fifth amendment takings clause and the substantive component of the fourteenth amendments due process clause   if the district court submitted those claims to the jury and an appeal followed we would likely be required to reach the federal claims   we believe it judicious to reach them now   on appeal bickerstaffs brief is silent on these points and thus appears to concede them   the georgia courts have applied the vested rights doctrine in cases where a property owner has materially changed his position in reliance on a zoning ordinance and government assurances that a building permit will issue   see eg barker v county of forsyth  ga   sed     cohn communities  sed at    whether the georgia courts would extend the vested rights doctrine to cases such as bickerstaffs is an open question   we need not reach the question because as explained in the text bickerstaff has failed to meet the doctrines requirements   the district court erred in holding that any zoning classification that is an invalid exercise of the police power constitutes a fifth amendment taking   to constitute such a taking the zoning classification must render the property worthless   see agins v tiburon  us    sct    ledd   stating that government action that deprives a landowner of only part of the value of his property is not a taking prohibited by the fifth amendment   due to our disposition of bickerstaffs takings clause claim however this error is of no moment   a taking within the meaning of the amendment may occur in one of two ways   first the government exercising its power of eminent domain may institute a proceeding to condemn the landowners property for a public use   second a taking may occur when the government exercising its police power enacts a measurehere a zoning classificationthat effectively condemns the landowners property without paying for it   when the government has not instituted an eminent domain proceeding the only way a property owner can vindicate his takings clause rights is to institute an inverse condemnation proceeding   this is what bickerstaff has done in this case   the district court reached the public use issue and resolved it in favor of bickerstaff   the court erred in doing so however because as we explain in part iiib infra bickerstaffs takings claim is not ripe   it is not necessary that bickerstaff prevail on the public use issue in order to obtain just compensation for the loss of use of its property   if bickerstaff succeeds in having the r zoning classification declared invalid its loss of use will be for a temporary termfrom the date the r classification became operative to the date of its invalidation   see first english evangelical lutheran church v los angeles county  us   sct   ledd     if bickerstaffs public use challenge fails its loss of use will be permanent and it will recover as just compensation the full value of the propertywith respect to this second scenario bickerstaffs takings clause and due process clause claims differ   if in the prosecution of the due process claim the zoning classification were upheld bickerstaff would be entitled to no damagesnotwithstanding the complete taking of its property   damages for a taking occasioned by the application of a valid zoning classification would be recoverable only under the takings clause   it thus becomes apparent that bickerstaffs claim under the takings clause not only subsumes its substantive due process claim as we point out infra but is broader than that claim   a reading of dicta in eide v sarasota county  fd  th cir cert denied  us   sct   ledd   may suggest at first blush that in a case such as this where the zoning classification renders the property worthless inverse condemnation claims under the takings clause and the substantive component of the due process clause are not identical   see id at we do not read eide as drawing such a distinction   in posing a hypothetical takings clause claim the eide panel assumed sub silentio that the landowner was not questioning the public purpose that is the “public use” behind the zoning classification   in posing the hypothetical substantive due process claim though the panel assumed expressly that the landowner was questioning such public purpose   were the panel to have assumed that in both cases the landowner questioned the public purpose behind the classification we are satisfied that it would have reached the same conclusion we reach todayeide describes a second specie of substantive due process claims which is not presented in this case  a claim that a regulatory measure exceeds the governments police power but has not effected a taking  eide refers to such a claim as “an ‘arbitrary and capricious due process claim”  id at    because the regulatory measure has not rendered the property worthless this type of substantive due process claim is not foreclosed by the takings clausetjoflat chief judge findlaw career center attorney corporate counsel academic judicial clerk summer associate intern law librarian

ga for appellants h wayne phears norcross ga joseph l waldrep james e humes ii columbus ga for appellee before tjoflat chief judge carnes circuit judge and fay senior circuit judge tjoflat chief judge in this case a company challenges under several provisions of state and federal law the decision of a county board of commissioners to rezone the companys property the district court granted injunctive relief in favor of the company and the county took this interlocutory appeal for the reasons that follow we affirm in part reverse in part and vacate in part i a the property in question is a landlocked acre tract located in southwest harris county georgia along interstate highway  appellee bickerstaff clay products inc bickerstaff a brick manufacturing company bought the property in  because of the propertys rich reserves of a mineral used in the brickmaking process bickerstaff uses a form of rock called weathered mylonite in the manufacture of bricks the harris county property lies along a vein of such rock at the time bickerstaff purchased the property it had no immediate need to mine the weathered mylonite on the property it conducted several test drills on the property and dug a trench to determine the extent of the mylonite deposit but otherwise did not mine the property instead bickerstaff held the property in its mineral reserves for future use in  the governing entity for harris county a fivemember board of commissioners enacted a countywide zoning ordinance including a comprehensive landuse plan for the county the ordinance provided that initial determinations on zoning matters such as rezoning requests would be studied by the county planners office which would recommend the denial or granting of the request to a planning commission the planning commission would hold a public meeting on the rezoning request and then would make recommendations to the board of commissioners which would have final authority over all zoning decisions the  ordinance zoned bickerstaffs property a which is the designation given to vacant property under the ordinance the uses permitted on land zoned a include general agriculture and forestry the stated purpose of the a category is to preserve land areas suitable for eventual rezoning in  bickerstaff decided to make use of the mylonite reserves on the harris county property to that end bickerstaff applied for a mining permit from the georgia environmental protection department in this application bickerstaff indicated the proposed duration and manner of the mining and explained how the company would shield surrounding areas from the noise and visual disturbances attendant to the operation the application also contained provisions for land reclamation and runoff containment in august of  the department granted bickerstaff a permit to mine the property while preparing its application to the environmental protection department bickerstaff discovered that the property had been zoned a and that a zoning would not permit mining armed with state approval of the mining operation bickerstaff sought to have the property rezoned m which would permit mining bickerstaff presented its plan to the harris county planner who found that m zoning was consistent with the countys comprehensive landuse plan and recommended that the planning commission approve the rezoning request following a public meeting however the planning commission voted to recommend that the board of commissioners deny the rezoning request the board of commissioners then held a public hearing on bickerstaffs application for rezoning in accordance with the zoning ordinance bickerstaff was allowed to present its proposed plan for mining its land and any citizen with an opinion about bickerstaffs proposal was allowed to speak the board made no decision on the rezoning request at that time but instead met privately two weeks later to consider the request at that meeting the chairman of the board of commissioners moved to rezone the property r which allows only lowdensity residential development bickerstaff had not requested r zoning and had no notice that the board would consider rezoning the property r the chairmans motion passed by a vote of four to one b following the boards decision bickerstaff brought this suit against harris county alleging violations of the united states constitution the georgia constitution and state real property law bickerstaffs primary contention is that rezoning the property r constituted a taking of bickerstaffs property because the rezoning rendered the property virtually useless the property cannot be developed as a residential subdivision because there is effectively no access to a public roadway according to bickerstaff this taking was in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution and article i of the georgia constitution because the taking was accomplished  pursuant to an invalid exercise of the countys police power and  without providing bickerstaff just compensation bickerstaff therefore asked the district court to award the company just compensation for a temporary taking in the event the r zoning was held invalid or for a permanent taking if it was not see first english evangelical lutheran church v los angeles county  us   sct   ledd   recognizing a takings clause claim for the temporary deprivation of all use of private property in its answer to bickerstaffs complaint the county denied that it was liable under any of bickerstaffs theories of recovery as for bickerstaffs fifth amendment claim the county contended that the suit was not ripe for federal court review because bickerstaff had not pursued its remedies in state court see williamson county regional planning commn v hamilton bank  us    sct    ledd   the county noted that although bickerstaff had filed a suit on the same claims in the harris county superior court bickerstaff had persuaded that court to stay its hand pending the outcome of the instant case the county further contended that because the superior court had jurisdiction over the controversy the instant case was barred the district court did not rule on these contentions and scheduled a bench trial on bickerstaffs claims for declaratory and injunctive relief the bench trial focused on bickerstaffs acquisition of the property its plans to mine the land and the circumstances surrounding the rezoning of the property r after entertaining the parties evidence the court entered an order declaring the r and prior a zoning classifications invalid the court enjoined the enforcement of either the r or the a zoning classification on both state and federal grounds it concluded that these measures were not substantially related to any valid health safety or welfare considerations and thus under the due process clauses of both the state and federal constitutions constituted invalid exercises of the countys police power in addition these classifications were enacted in derogation of bickerstaffs right under georgia law and the harris county zoning ordinance to mine the property as either a vested right or a nonconforming use the court thus enjoined the county from applying any zoning classification to the property other than m finally the court held that the r classification by rendering bickerstaffs property worthless had effected a taking of the property without just compensation in violation of the state and federal constitutions proceedings to determine just compensation have been stayed pending our resolution of this appeal following the district courts entry of the injunctive relief described above the county took this interlocutory appeal we have jurisdiction under  usc § a  we review the district courts factual findings for clear error fedrcivp a questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo see nadler v mann  fd   th cir ii as noted the district courts injunction addressed three zoning classifications a r and m the court invalidated the a and r classifications and ordered the board to apply the m classification to the property we summarily vacate the aspect of the courts injunction that prohibits the board from applying any zoning classification to the property except m the court cited no authority state or federal for such action — which in effect usurped the boards legislative function — and bickerstaff has cited us to none in the discussion that follows we address first the courts decision to strike down the a zoning and conclude that bickerstaffs challenge to that zoning is time barred turning next to the boards decision to zone the property r we conclude that the court had no basis for invalidating the decision on the ground that bickerstaff had acquired a right to mine the property as either a vested right or a nonconforming use under georgia law the courts alternative holding — that under georgia law the boards decision constituted a taking without just compensation — is however correct we therefore affirm the courts decision invalidating the r zoning we vacate though the courts holding that the boards decision also violated the united states constitution because bickerstaffs federal claim is not ripe a bickerstaff cannot challenge the countys original decision to zone the property a the property has been zoned a since  and bickerstaff is barred from challenging this zoning not only by the applicable statute of limitations see ocga § b but also by the doctrine of laches the provision of the district courts injunction invalidating the a zoning is accordingly vacated b we consider now the merits of the remaining statelaw grounds for the district courts invalidation of the r zoning they are  that bickerstaff had acquired a right to mine the property as a nonconforming use within the meaning of the harris county zoning ordinance  that bickerstaff had acquired a vested right under the georgia common law to mine the property and  that the boards r rezoning of the property and its refusal to rezone the property m constituted a taking without just compensation in violation of the georgia constitution  the harris county zoning ordinance defines a nonconforming use as a building structure or use of land existing at the time of enactment of this ordinance and which does not conform to the regulations of the district in which it is situated the court found that bickerstaffs intention to mine the property was a use of land that existed at the time the zoning ordinance was enacted because the ordinance defines use as the specific purpose for which land or building is designed arranged intended or for which it is or may be occupied or maintained emphasis added in georgia however mere preliminary work not of a substantial nature does not constitute a nonconforming use neither does a use which is merely contemplated for the future but unrealized as of the effective date of the regulation rainwater v coweta county bd of zoning appeals  gaapp   sed    bickerstaffs drilling and testing on the property more than thirty years ago — to determine the extent of the mylonite vein — cannot be characterized as anything but preliminary and its intention to mine the property was in  when the harris county zoning ordinance was enacted a use  merely contemplated for the future extending a nonconforming use to an owners unrealized intentions for his property would mean that any property owner whenever confronted with unfavorable zoning could claim a nonconforming use by stating that he had always intended to use the property as for instance a shopping center or an apartment complex or an office park bickerstaff has not acquired the right to mine the property as a nonconforming use and we reverse the district courts conclusion to the contrary  bickerstaff contends and the district court held that it has a vested right to mine the property — a right that the board is powerless to limit this right supposedly arose from the companys preliminary drilling and testing of the soil on the property we do not believe that georgias vested rights doctrine extends that far the doctrine of vested rights that the district court applied in this case is derived from the principle of equitable estoppel see cohn communities inc v clayton county  ga   sed    the doctrine applies when a landowner relying in good faith upon some act or omission of the government has made a substantial change in position or incurred such extensive obligation and expenses that it would be highly inequitable and unjust to destroy the rights he has acquired id bickerstaff has established none of these elements while bickerstaffs expenditures for the test drills may have risen to the level of extensive obligations and expenses harris county made no representations on which bickerstaff could have relied or did rely at no time between bickerstaffs purchase of the property and the companys application for rezoning did any harris county official promise bickerstaff that the property would be zoned for mining we therefore reverse the district courts holding that bickerstaff has acquired a vested right to mine the property under georgia law  in order to determine whether a zoning ordinance has effected a taking without just compensation in violation of the georgia constitution see ga const art i § iii par i and note  supra courts employ a balancing test in the words of the georgia supreme court a court must weigh the benefit to the public against the detriment to the individual gradous v board of commrs  ga   sed    in practical terms the balancing test means that an aggrieved landowner must show that the zoning decision presents a significant detriment to the landowner and is insubstantially related to the public health safety morality and welfare id  sed at  the district court found that the application of the r zoning classification to bickerstaffs property rendered the property virtually worthless we agree that the rezoning of bickerstaffs property r deprives the property of all reasonable economic use thus bickerstaff has proven the first part of its georgia takings claim that the zoning presents a significant detriment to bickerstaff the district court further concluded that the r zoning was not substantially related to the public health safety morality or welfare and was thus an invalid exercise of the countys police power although there is no formula for determining when government action exceeds the police power the georgia supreme court has held that a zoning decision that completely fails to scrutinize the merits of the land in question and the impact of the decision upon the landowners property rights is an invalid exercise of the police power barrett v hamby  ga   sed    the county has presented no evidence indicating that the board evaluated prospective uses for the property conducted a study of the possible impact mining would have on neighboring property or even considered the probable effect that r zoning would have on the value of bickerstaffs property the members of the board testified at trial that they thought the r zoning was in the best interests of the county but they offered no justification for this conclusion the exercise of the police power is not without limits where as here the governing entity completely fails to scrutinize the balance between the public interest in the contemplated zoning and the impact of the zoning on the property the entitys decision is beyond its police power it is clear that the r zoning had a significant detrimental effect on the value of bickerstaffs property and that the board had only vague and unsubstantiated conclusions to justify the zoning therefore the rezoning of bickerstaffs property constituted a taking of the property in violation of the georgia constitution iii the district court also held that the boards decision to rezone bickerstaffs property r was invalid under the takings clause of the fifth amendment and the substantive component of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment the court so held because it found that the zoning decision  effectively condemned bickerstaffs property for a purpose not within the countys police power to pursue and  failed to provide bickerstaff just compensation in concluding that these two elements made out a claim under both the takings clause and the due process clause the district court did not consider whether the bickerstaffs takings claim subsumed its substantive due process claim we hold that it does a the takings clause of the fifth amendment prohibits government from condemning private property  for public use without just compensation the clause applies in any case in which government action renders private property worthless see agins v tiburon  us    sct    ledd   lucas v south carolina coastal council  us    sct    ledd   government action effectively condemns a landowners property if it denies him all economically beneficial or productive use of his property bickerstaff contends and has established that the r zoning classification rendered its property worthless and it seeks just compensation for its loss bickerstaff also contends that this taking was not for a public use depending on the resolution of the public use issue bickerstaff will be entitled to just compensation for either the temporary or permanent loss of use of the property the substantive component of the due process clause prohibits a government entity from applying to property a zoning classification that bears no relationship to the public health safety morals or general welfare and thus is beyond the governments police power see village of euclid v ambler realty co  us    sct    led   a person whose property is affected by such a classification may challenge the measure and if successful may recover damages for any injury the classification may have caused him while it was operative here bickerstaff contends that the application of the r zoning classification to its property is an invalid exercise of the countys police power and has rendered the property worthless if bickerstaff ultimately prevails on this issue it may recover in damages the value of its temporary loss of use of the property this discussion makes it apparent that bickerstaffs takings clause claim and its substantive due process claim are identical if the challenges to the validity of the r zoning classification itself are evaluated under the same standard that is the claims are identical if the scope of public use under the takings clause and the scope of police power under the substantive component of the due process clause are the same the supreme courts decision in hawaii hous auth v midkiff  us    sct    ledd   indicates that they are midkiff involved a landowners challenge to the validity of an hawaii statute that provided for the condemnation of private land and the sale of such land to the landowners lessees the landowners mounted their challenge under the public use component of the takings clause they claimed that the taking of their property for the purpose of reselling it to their lessees was not for a public purpose and hence violative of the fifth amendment command nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation midkiff v tom  fsupp   dhaw in rejecting the landowners challenge the supreme court compared the scopes of public use under the takings clause and police power under the due process clause the court concluded that the public use requirement is  coterminous with the scope of a sovereigns police powers midkiff  us at   sct at  see also national rr passenger corp v boston  maine corp  us    sct    ledd   we have held that the public use requirement of the takings clause is coterminous with the regulatory power bickerstaffs takings clause and substantive due process challenges to the validity of the r classification are therefore evaluated under the same standard accordingly bickerstaffs takings clause claim subsumes its substantive due process claim unless it can be said that the framers of the bill of rights in addition to providing the substantive rights contained in the takings clause meant to replicate by implication those same rights in the due process clause we do not believe that such duplication was intended we therefore hold that bickerstaffs challenge to the validity of the r zoning classification lies solely under the takings clause b the foregoing discussion makes clear that the only federal constitutional ground supporting the district courts injunction is bickerstaffs fifth amendment takings claim that claim however is not ripe see williamson county regional planning commn v hamilton bank  us    sct    ledd   a takings clause claim does not become ripe unless the state provides no remedy to compensate the landowner for the taking a property owner cannot claim a violation of the clause unless the state provides the landowner no procedure such as an action for inverse condemnation for obtaining just compensation williamson  us at   sct at  bickerstaff contends that georgia provides it no judicial mechanism for obtaining just compensation in this case accordingly its takings clause claim is ripe we disagree under georgia law a landowner may bring suit under the eminent domain and due process provisions of the georgia constitution ga const art i § i par i and § iii par i to enjoin the enforcement of a zoning classification that effects a taking of his property see eg gradous v board of commrs  ga   sed   we find no georgia cases denying a landowner just compensation for the temporary loss of use of his property while burdened with an invalid zoning classification nor do we find any cases denying a landowner just compensation where a valid zoning classification effectively condemns his property see eg eastbibb twiggs neighborhood assn v macon bibb planning  zoning commn  fd  th cir affg  fsupp  mdga amended and superseded  fd  th cir see also calibre spring hill ltd v cobb county  fsupp   ndga  first english evangelical lutheran church v los angeles county  us   sct   ledd   holds that a state deprives a landowner of his rights under the takings clause if it denies him just compensation in either of these situations we assume that the georgia courts will follow the holding of first english we therefore do not hold that the harris county superior court will not as a matter of georgia law recognize bickerstaffs takings claim and provide the company just compensation for either a temporary or a permanent taking we hold instead that because the superior court will entertain bickerstaffs claim for inverse condemnation bickerstaffs fifth amendment takings claim is not ripe for federal district court review iv in conclusion we affirm the district courts injunction that invalidates the application of the r zoning classification to bickerstaffs property but we do so on only one ground the classification constitutes a taking of bickerstaffs property in violation of the georgia constitution we vacate the portions of the injunction invalidating the a zoning classification and ordering the board to apply the m classification to the property finally we vacate the portion of the injunction that is based on bickerstaffs takings clause and substantive due process claims we direct the court to dismiss bickerstaffs takings clause claim as not ripe and to dismiss the substantive due process claim because it states no case for relief we note that the district court has retained jurisdiction to try bickerstaffs claim for money damages for the temporary loss of use of its property from the effective date of the boards r zoning decision to the receipt of our mandate that claim shall be tried under georgia law so ordered footnotes  the  zoning ordinance was reenacted almost verbatim in  and again in  to cure alleged procedural defects in the original ordinance the zoning of bickerstaffs property was a in all three ordinances  the mining of mylonite does not involve any blasting or crushing of rock it is simply a digging operation whereby the rock is extracted from the ground using backhoes and then hauled away in dump trucks  r is the designation given to land that is to be developed as a residential subdivision containing singlefamily lots  bickerstaffs amended complaint the pleading before us contains eight counts the complaint is a typical shotgun pleading in that some of the counts present more than one discrete claim for relief see eg anderson v district bd of trustees  fd   th cir moreover in some instances one cannot discern with respect to a given claim for relief the substantive rule giving rise to the claim for purposes of this appeal we give bickerstaffs complaint a liberal reading and construe it as presenting the following claims for relief  a takings claim pursuant to  usc §  that seeks just compensation for the full value of the property under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution count one this count also seeks an injunction under an undisclosed rule of law prohibiting the board from preventing bickerstaff from mining its property  a claim under  usc §  for money damages on the ground that the board has violated bickerstaffs unspecified substantive rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments count two this count also seeks the same injunctive relief as count one the district court appears to have interpreted this allegation as alleging a claim under the substantive component of the fourteenth amendments due process clause  a claim under  usc §  for money damages on the ground that in reaching its zoning decision the board denied bickerstaff its right to procedural due process under the fifth and fourteenth amendments count three this count also seeks the same injunctive relief as count one  a takings claim under the georgia constitution article i section i paragraph i and article i section iii paragraph i this claim seeks an injunction prohibiting the board from preventing bickerstaff from mining its property count four  a claim for a declaration that unspecified provisions of the united states and georgia constitutions grant bickerstaff a vested right to mine the property count five this count seeks in the alternative money damages for the full value of the property  a claim that unspecified provisions of the united states constitution and georgia law and several provisions of the harris county zoning ordinance grant bickerstaff the right to mine the property as a nonconforming use bickerstaff seeks an injunction prohibiting the board from preventing it from mining the property count six  a claim that the boards denial of bickerstaffs m zoning request was arbitrary and capricious under an unspecified provision of law and also violates the harris county zoning ordinance bickerstaff seeks an injunction prohibiting the board from preventing bickerstaff from mining the property count seven  a claim that the harris county zoning ordinance is invalid under ocga §   because of procedural irregularities in the adoption of the ordinance bickerstaff seeks a declaration that the ordinance is invalid count eight the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under  usc §§  and  to entertain bickerstaffs federal constitutional claims the court entertained bickerstaffs statelaw claims under its supplemental jurisdiction the district court based its injunction only on the claims described in   and  above accordingly we do not address the claims described in  and   bickerstaff has a footwide easement running  feet over neighboring land to georgia highway  bickerstaff contends and the county does not dispute that a residential subdivision must have at least one means of ingress and egress and that to accommodate a subdivision entrance the easement would need to be at least  feet wide  the fifth amendments prohibition on takings for public use without just compensation is applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment see chicago b  q rr v chicago  us    sct    led   further references in this opinion to a takings claim under the fifth amendment mean a takings claim under the fifth and fourteenth amendments  the georgia constitution does not have a takings clause georgia courts recognize takings claims however under the eminent domain provision of article i section iii paragraph i private property shall not be taken or damaged for public purposes without just and adequate compensation being first paid and the due process provision of article i section i paragraph i no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property except by due process of law see gradous v board of commrs  ga   sed     the county provided the district court with no authority for the proposition that the pendency of the state court suit barred bickerstaffs prosecution of this suit and we know of none we read the countys answer on this point as a request that the district court stay its hand until the state court proceeding ran its course on appeal the county contends that bickerstaffs takings clause and substantive due process claims are not ripe for federal district court adjudication and that therefore the district court should have dismissed them for want of subject matter jurisdiction in addition the county contends that the court in the exercise of its discretion should have dismissed bickerstaffs remaining pendent state law claims we disagree bickerstaffs federal constitutional claims are not frivolous nor were they asserted solely for the purpose of giving the district court subject matter jurisdiction bell v hood  us    sct    led   thus the district court was not required to dismiss the pendent statelaw claims and it was within its discretion to decide the statelaw issues  we are mindful of the doctrine that a federal court should not pass on federal constitutional issues unless necessary to its decision see ashwander v tennessee valley auth  us    sct    led   brandeis j concurring the court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of we believe that it is prudent to discuss the federal constitutional claims in this case because the damages issue remains to be litigated if we do not decide the federal constitutional claims then the district court in framing the issues for the damages trial will likely provide for recovery under the fifth amendment takings clause and the substantive component of the fourteenth amendments due process clause if the district court submitted those claims to the jury and an appeal followed we would likely be required to reach the federal claims we believe it judicious to reach them now  on appeal bickerstaffs brief is silent on these points and thus appears to concede them  the georgia courts have applied the vested rights doctrine in cases where a property owner has materially changed his position in reliance on a zoning ordinance and government assurances that a building permit will issue see eg barker v county of forsyth  ga   sed    cohn communities  sed at  whether the georgia courts would extend the vested rights doctrine to cases such as bickerstaffs is an open question we need not reach the question because as explained in the text bickerstaff has failed to meet the doctrines requirements  the district court erred in holding that any zoning classification that is an invalid exercise of the police power constitutes a fifth amendment taking to constitute such a taking the zoning classification must render the property worthless see agins v tiburon  us    sct    ledd   stating that government action that deprives a landowner of only part of the value of his property is not a taking prohibited by the fifth amendment due to our disposition of bickerstaffs takings clause claim however this error is of no moment  a taking within the meaning of the amendment may occur in one of two ways first the government exercising its power of eminent domain may institute a proceeding to condemn the landowners property for a public use second a taking may occur when the government exercising its police power enacts a measure — here a zoning classification — that effectively condemns the landowners property without paying for it when the government has not instituted an eminent domain proceeding the only way a property owner can vindicate his takings clause rights is to institute an inverse condemnation proceeding this is what bickerstaff has done in this case  the district court reached the public use issue and resolved it in favor of bickerstaff the court erred in doing so however because as we explain in part iiib infra bickerstaffs takings claim is not ripe  it is not necessary that bickerstaff prevail on the public use issue in order to obtain just compensation for the loss of use of its property if bickerstaff succeeds in having the r zoning classification declared invalid its loss of use will be for a temporary term — from the date the r classification became operative to the date of its invalidation see first english evangelical lutheran church v los angeles county  us   sct   ledd   if bickerstaffs public use challenge fails its loss of use will be permanent and it will recover as just compensation the full value of the property with respect to this second scenario bickerstaffs takings clause and due process clause claims differ if in the prosecution of the due process claim the zoning classification were upheld bickerstaff would be entitled to no damages — notwithstanding the complete taking of its property damages for a taking occasioned by the application of a valid zoning classification would be recoverable only under the takings clause it thus becomes apparent that bickerstaffs claim under the takings clause not only subsumes its substantive due process claim as we point out infra but is broader than that claim  a reading of dicta in eide v sarasota county  fd  th cir cert denied  us   sct   ledd   may suggest at first blush that in a case such as this where the zoning classification renders the property worthless inverse condemnation claims under the takings clause and the substantive component of the due process clause are not identical see id at  we do not read eide as drawing such a distinction in posing a hypothetical takings clause claim the eide panel assumed sub silentio that the landowner was not questioning the public purpose that is the public use behind the zoning classification in posing the hypothetical substantive due process claim though the panel assumed expressly that the landowner was questioning such public purpose were the panel to have assumed that in both cases the landowner questioned the public purpose behind the classification we are satisfied that it would have reached the same conclusion we reach today eide describes a second specie of substantive due process claims which is not presented in this case a claim that a regulatory measure exceeds the governments police power but has not effected a taking eide refers to such a claim as an arbitrary and capricious due process claim id at  because the regulatory measure has not rendered the property worthless this type of substantive due process claim is not foreclosed by the takings clause comment your name your email comments
