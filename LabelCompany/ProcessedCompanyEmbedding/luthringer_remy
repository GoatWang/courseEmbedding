luthringer thank you bill and good morning everyone thanks for joining us today today i will briefly discuss the latest step in the advancement of min on its clinical development paths i am pleased to report that minerva recently has an end of phase ii meeting with the us food and drug administration during which we discussed the current min package particularly the phase iib results we obtained in patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia with negative symptoms and the phase iii iv clinical development of min we shared with the fda the complete package of clinical preclinical and cmc data generated to date with min our discussion included as well the potential content of our phase iii and phase iv development plan particularly focusing on the target population and study design including primary and secondary outcome measures which might be adverse we plan to initiate phase iii development of min in schizophrenia in the second half of  the meeting allowed us to share our view on the potential contribution of min as a new treatment paradigm for people diagnosed with schizophrenia and not functioning well due to the presence of negative symptoms the considerable amount of recent scientific literature is being accumulated reinforcing the facts of negative symptoms is the target of min represents a significant unmet need for patients the families of patients and physicians these symptoms contribute substantially to both quality of life and functional outcomes for the large worldwide population of patients suffering from this disease i will move on with brief comments on our other programs our second clinical stage compound is min in development to address unmet medical needs in patients suffering from major depressive disorder mdd based upon clinical and preclinical findings we believe min may demonstrate the safety profile comparable to placebo while avoiding many typical sideeffects of current mdd treatments including cognitive impairment sexual dysfunction sleep disorders and weight gain following the acceptance of the investigation of new drug application ind for min minerva is planning clinical trials with its compound in the us and europe planning is underway for these trials which are expected to begin in late  our third clinical stage compound is min a selective orexin  receptor antagonist such as developing in partnership with janssen pharmaceutica nv janssen based on positive clinical data generated last year min is being targeted for the treatment of both insomnia without neuropsychiatric comorbid symptoms and comorbid insomnia in patients suffering from depressive disorders supportive activities and clinical pharmacology studies are currently being carried out in anticipation of the next efficacy studies with our compound in both indications finally our preclinical stage product candidate is min to treat parkinsons disease min is a recombinant protein with extracellular domain of neuregulin  beta primary activating the erbb receptor this regulation of the nrg signaling pathway has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders including and beyond parkinson’s disease the next plan steps in the min program are the timing of an ind in the us or an investigational and medicinal product dossier impd in europe and pending acceptance by regulatory authorities initiation of phase i clinical testing thereafter in summary we recently held an end of phase ii meeting with the fda which helps us to design the phase iii clinical development of min we look forward to sharing details of our development plan when finalized i will now turn the call over to geoff to cover our financial results geoff race thank you remy this morning we issued a press release summarizing our operating results for the first quarter of  a more detailed discussion of our results may be found in our quarterly report on form q filed with the sec earlier today net loss was  million for the first quarter of  or a loss per share of  basic and diluted compared to a net loss of  million or a loss per share of  basic and diluted for the same period in  research and development expenses were  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million in the first quarter of  rd expenses in the three months ended march   and  included noncash stock based compensation expenses of  million and  million respectively this increase in rd expenses primarily reflects higher development expenses under the min program for phase ii clinical trial preparation and an increase in noncash stock based compensation expenses these amounts were partially offset by lower costs due to the completion of our phase iib clinical trial of min and the completion of our phase iia clinical trial of min general and administrative expenses were at  million in the third quarter of  compared to  million in the first quarter of  ga expenses in the three months ended march   and  include a noncash stock based compensation expenss of  million and  million respectively this increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in legal and professional fees an increase in noncash stockbased compensation expenses and increased personnel costs during the three months ended march   cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of march   were approximately  million since december   warrants with respect to approximately  million shares were exercised by certain institutional stockholders for proceeds of  million received by the company the warrants were issued in connection with a private placement that took place in march  and they expired on march   the company believes that its existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet its cash commitments for at least the next  months now i would like to turn the call over to the operator for any questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you operator

forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after todays call except as required by law i would now like to turn the call over to remy luthringer remy luthringer thank you bill and good morning everyone thank you for joining us today  was a pivotal year for minerva as a public company during the year we reported five data readouts for our three clinical stage product candidates this include min for negative symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia min for insomnia disorder and for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder mdd and min for mdd this data laid a solid foundation for the future development of our compounds and thus reflect significant progress along the respective clinical development pathways for these products more importantly they inform our decisions regarding the nature of advanced stage clinical testing we plan to initiate in  today i would like to take both a lookback on the last year’s achievements and to look forward for this year’s objectives in the second quarter of  we announced that our phase b trial evaluating min in monotherapy with daily doses of  milligram and  milligram compared to placebo achieved its primary endpoint which was improvement in negative symptoms of note improvements were also observe ph the numerous predefined secondary and exploratory endpoints including total panss score and cognition the observed improvements shared the same time course beginning to differentiate from placebo as early as two weeks after treatment initiation and continuing over the  week doubleblind period very importantly treatment with min helped keep positive symptoms tabled over the complete treatment period without observed side effects such as sedation or motor effects to the best of my knowledge min is a first treatment for schizophrenia with a specific effect on negative symptoms such raising the possibility that it might be the first treatment to address the significant unmet medical need in patients suffering from this disease later in the year we announced data from the six months expansion phase of the trial in which we observed further and continuous improvements in these symptoms in other words the longer patients were treated with min the greater improvement was observed in the negative symptoms during the entire expansion period result evidence of reaching a plateau importantly positive symptoms remained stable over the extension period min was observed to be well tolerated throughout the entire  week period of the trial no weight gain no sedation no extrapyramidal symptoms eps no apetizia and no productive increase were reported during the study two patients who received  milligram a day were discontinued based upon prespecified qtc criteria later when this trial was presented at the american society of neuropsychopharmacology acnp annual meeting last december highlighted by a hot topic over session in addition to the overall presentation several process were presented one included a subanalysis of negative symptoms by age with a strongest effect size observed in the youngest patients in the trial two additional processes were presented one focusing on the effects of min on cognition and one on sleep cognition observations measured by the batch scale included significant improvements in motor functions verbal fluency and working memory following treatment with min compared to placebo for the somnography measurements included observed improvement in time to fall asleep and deep sleep as well as restoration of the number of sleep cycles the sleep parameters are typically disturbed in patients suffering from schizophrenia based on these outcomes we are planning to move into phase  with trials expected to be initiated in the second half of this year after we obtained input from both the fda and ema in end of phase ii meeting with the fda has not been scheduled to take place early in the second quarter of this year we plan to schedule a scientific advisory meeting thereafter with the european medicines agency ema the main objective of this meeting is to share with the agencies our overall phase  and  development plans and to seek guidance about the phase  clinical program particularly is a target patient population and the primary and secondary end points we will also seek input in terms of the cmc scaleup program as well as our technical and clinical pharmacologic program which we’ll run in parallel with the pivotal efficacy trials during the first quarter of  we reported positive data from two trials with min also known as jnj this compound is a selective orexin  antagonist under codevelopment with the jannsen pharmaceutical so clinical studies with min included a phase iia trial in patients suffering from insomnia without associated neuropsychiatric disorders and the phase b trial in mdd patients data from the insomnia trial indicates that min improved significant sleep induction restore sleep duration and preserves key phases sleep particularly deep sleep thus enabling restorative sleep additional significant positive efficacy signals were observed for key secondary endpoints results from the trials in patients with mdd included consistently creative improvements in depressive symptomatology observed in patients who received min compared to those who received placebo or diphenhydramine a positive control depressive symptoms were also observed to significantly improving patients treated with min independent from its effects on sleep at the acnp meeting in december data were presented indicating that inhibition of orexin  receptors decreased its stress induced activation of the hba axis supporting the role of this receptor in modulating response to threats researchers noted that orexin  antagonist may therefore be valuable in the treatment of stress induced disorders these finding suggest that min may be a treatment of choice for insomnia and depression to diseases with disregulated stress levels data from a third trial with min became available early in the year as well in this phase  trial single dose morning administrations of min was observed to be well tolerated in healthy japanese adult male study participants pharmacokinetic features were comparable to those observed in previous studies carried out in healthy nonasian study participants and thus paves a way for worldwide development of min reported activities and clinical pharmacology studies are currently being carried out in anticipation of the next phases of clinical development which is compound in insomnia and mdd our third clinical stage compound is min in development to address unmet medical needs in patients suffering from depressive disorders we announced positive topline results from a phase a clinical trial with min in may  this data was subsequently presented at the acnp annual meeting in december the goal of this study was to establish prospectively signal detection and to assess effect sizes in order to power consolatory trials and to defy specific attributes of the molecules we observed the dose dependent superiority of both doses of min versus placebo in this trial in reducing depressive symptomatology paving the way towards the next stage of development in further data analysis  of patients treated with the higher dose passing  milligrams per day were observed to achieve remission of depressive symptoms the higher dose was also observed to improve cognitive impairment which is a major burden for patients suffering from depression in addition improvement in anxiety as measured by the hamilton anxiety rating scale were observed with both doses min tested this efficacy outcome were observed in a context in which both those tests demonstrated favorable to our ability profile thus the incidence and type of side effects did not differ significantly between min and placebo no unexpected adverse events were reported and treatment with min was not associated with sexual dysfunction suicidal ideation or weight gain pharmacodynamics measurement based on sleep recording showed that min preserved sleep continuity and architecture and therefore is not expected to have related detrimental effect on sleep in september  we announced that the fda accepted our ind for min allowing us to begin clinical trials with its compound in the us planning is underway for these trials which are expected to begin in late  finally our preclinical stage product candidate is min to treat parkinson’s disease min is a recombinant protein with extracellular domain of neuregulin  beta one primary activating erbb receptor this regulation of the neuregulin  signaling pathway has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders including and beyond parkinson’s disease preclinical data with an analog of min represented in december  at the acnp this data demonstrates the beneficial effect of treatment on behavioral and mortal deficits in animal models of parkinson’s disease results also suggest that neuroinflammatory surrogate markers were controlled and thus should be explored in future studies the next planned step in the min program are the timing of an ind in the us or an investigational and medicinal product dossier impd in europe and pending acceptance by regulatory authorities initiation of phase  clinical testing thereafter we would also like to acknowledge a key hire for minerva late last year in the person of professor michael davidson our chief medical officer we expect that dr davidson’s deep expertise in cns disorders its insight in to the development strategy and regulatory review of new agents to treat neuropsychiatric diseases and explore knowledge of clinical trial conduct will help us realize the potential of minerva’s portfolio of products in summary  saw the emergence of a number important positive clinical results with min min and min these results and the scores of potential of these product candidates of innovative and differentiated in the respective indications importantly they also represent a solid foundation for the next round of clinical trials planned to begin in  i will now turn the call over to geoff to cover our financial results geoff race thank you remy earlier this morning we issued a press release summarizing our operating results for the fourth quarter and yearended december   a more detailed discussion of our results may be found in our annual report on form k filed with the sec earlier today net loss was  million for

december   this increase in rd expenses primarily reflects higher development costs under the min program for phase  clinical trial preparation and an increase in noncash stock based compensation expenses this increase was partially offset by decreased expenses due to the completion of our phase b clinical trial of min general and administrative expenses were at  million in the fourth quarter of  compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  ga expenses were  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december   the increase in general and administrative

offering of common stock we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements for at least  months from today the assumptions upon which we have based our estimates are under constant review and subject to change the actual amounts and timing of our research and development expenditures may vary depending on a number of factors including but not limited to those related to the design timing and duration of future clinical trials we anticipate that our available financial resources will allow us to initiate the next clinical trials with our product candidates particularly min on a timely basis now i’d like to turn the call over to the operator for any question operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is from jason butler with jmp securities you may begin jason butler just a couple of min can you give us any color on what  other than finalizing trial design whether there are any gaining items in the nonclinical studies ongoing right now that needs to be completed before starting the next trials and then can you give us any color on the likely or a potential trial designs or patient populations that you intend to study in the next trials thanks remy luthringer thank you jason for this question remy speaking as the work which is currently ongoing is really standard work in order to speed up the process and to have altogether in order to run the two clinical trials so nothing in particular just i have to say doing the studies in order to be ready to move in terms of the two studies we currently plan to carry out in patients so far with insomnia so primary insomnia indication we are really planning it for study where we confirm what we have seen in the phase iia in terms of efficacy also in terms of very improved day time functioning in these patients so we will have a lot of pharmacodynamics measurements in addition to the efficacy measurements based on polysomnography and some clinical scales and we will also have some comparison with the standard of care in order to really position our molecule at best in depression here again it will be done as it has been done in the phase b so it is really a study which is very similar in terms of study design and in terms of adding it to standard of care as well so this is what i can tell you today about the two studies operator operator instructions our next question comes from byron inaudible with jefferies you may begin unidentified analyst on min fda’s meeting coming up would you hope to agree with fda on what are one of the outstanding issues currently that you hope to iron out by fda meeting remy luthringer i’m afraid that i did not completely understand the end of your sentence can you repeat please unidentified analyst are you hoping to gain agreement with the agency on primary endpoint for the trial or is there something that you feel that fda will likely agree with your study design and what other outstanding items are you hoping to discuss with fda at the meeting remy luthringer so definitely this meeting is to confirm the primary endpoint and also the study design of our study so clearly this is a primary objective and yes indeed the agency will decide we are already proposing a study design which is very clear and meanwhile the questions are extremely well laid out so i hope that we will have a complete clear answer on this aspect so the additional things we will also discuss with the fda are again very standard things in other words the cmc part is a dgi study which you have to carry out in parallel with the phase  program all this having an objective to be ready when we have the readout of the phase  study with all the additional activities you have to do around this pivotal study unidentified analyst and then just on the new formulation where is that currently is that been finalized and when will we see the pkpd data on the new formulation remy luthringer so this is a work which is progressing well and obviously we will have this data finalized before starting the phase  so this i think is what i can say but clearly yes indeed as soon as this formulation work is finalized we will report on this without any problem operator operator instructions and i’m showing no further questions at this time i’d like to turn the call back over to remy luthringer for closing remarks remy luthringer really thank you everybody to be with us today and looking forward to speak with you very soon thank you again operator ladies and gentlemen this
