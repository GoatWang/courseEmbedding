close search expand collapse previous next rss feed linkedin twitter facebook email guerrero howe hispanic executive search search for search javier palomarez president and ceo ushcc photos by sheila barabad is javier palomarez the most influential man in american politics unifier of the new majority and head of the ushcc sends a clear message to  presidential candidates you will not win without the hispanic vote october   by matt alderton the nation’s capital is teeming with powerful people from journalists and judges to lawmakers and lobbyists politicos and pundits to the president himself its residents collectively have more sway than a ship deluged by storm surge like racehorses perpetually circling a track they spend their days jockeying for position simultaneously gaining and ceding ground in sync with fickle political winds of all the steeds orbiting capitol hill in  however perhaps the most influential isn’t a senator a general or even a diplomat it’s a businessman with dark eyes and platinum hair javier palomarez president and ceo of the united states hispanic chamber of commerce ushcc his isn’t blunt inyourface power it’s the shrewd incisive kind it’s the voice not the fist or rather the voices—plural—as his represents the interests of nearly  million hispanicowned businesses which together contribute more than  billion to the american economy every year “the business owners that make up the hispanic business community aren’t just business owners they’re also job creators taxpayers political donors and ultimately voters” palomarez says “they are hugely influential in their own communities and even more so among the tens of millions of americans they employ they’re the gatekeepers if you will to a huge voting bloc—the hispanic community—which in today’s elections can be the difference between winning and losing” the hispanic chamber wasn’t always so significant in fact what today is one of the most influential organizations in the country just a few years ago was one of the least according to ushcc chairman emeritus nina vaca “when i got here the organization was in terrible shape” recalls palomarez who vaca helped recruit “it was the height of the recession and we were over  million in debt we had a bloated staff our finance chair told me we only had  days of life left—and that was the good news the brand was broken the bloom as they say was off the rose we were in a downward spiral programmatically reputationally and certainly financially we were in triage mode literally the day i walked in the door” six years later on the eve of the  presidential election the ushcc is transformed like a butterfly emergent from its cocoon it is selfassured and powerful—the product of a remarkable turnaround led by palomarez and bolstered by the increasing size standing and stature of the hispanic business community the road to washington palomarez knows a lot about turnarounds he’s been through a few in his life originally from south texas he spent his youth as a migrant farm worker picking fruits and vegetables alongside his nine siblings and their immigrant mother whose early death from a heart attack led him to drop out of high school and run away from home “i come from a fairly impoverished background we had to hustle for what we got” says palomarez who as a teenager spent more than a year on the streets before returning home where he ultimately decided to earn his ged and go to college he graduated from the university of texas–pan american in  with a degree in finance “through a lot of hard work and good fortune i ended up getting something called the wall street journal student achievement award that literally put me on the map my name appeared in the wall street journal and two weeks before i graduated i had several job offers from corporate america” palomarez spent the next two decades becoming one of the nation’s top multicultural sales and marketing executives building programs that touched millions during tenures at allstate insurance corp sprint inc and bank of america where he was senior vice president of multicultural marketing “i made a career out of introducing multicultural markets to brands that had come to the realization they needed to engage diverse consumers but didn’t know how to go about it” says palomarez who is best known for creating the insurance industry’s first integrated national hispanic marketing sales and service campaign during his  years at allstate “toward the end of my career i was very fortunate to work not only with the hispanic community but also with the african american community the gay and lesbian community and the women’s market which really afforded me the opportunity to see the changing demographics in america and how incredibly important these markets had become—and were going to be going forward” what palomarez had done for corporate brands the ushcc believed he could do for its nonprofit brand “the united states hispanic chamber of commerce started courting me” says palomarez although he was admittedly the perfect man for the job he initially didn’t want it “i wanted nothing to do with it i didn’t see nonprofit management as my strength or my bailiwick i didn’t think i’d be the kind of guy to run a nonprofit” nina vaca strongly disagreed “for almost two years—three or four times a week—i would hear from nina” palomarez continues “she was relentless about how i should give back and how i could bring my talents and experience to help the organization solve the challenges it was facing” vaca’s persistence paid off and in  palomarez joined the ushcc as its captain his monumental mission save the sinking ship then sail it to greatness driving change the ushcc’s is a cinderella story and if there’s anything cinderella had to do a lot of it was clean house—which is exactly what palomarez did when he arrived at the organization’s k street headquarters “we went from  employees to four and i was one of the four” says palomarez who had become ushcc’s fifth ceo in as many years “perhaps the toughest thing we did was transform our board of directors we had to tell  people who meant well but simply weren’t the right people that they needed to leave basically i had to fire my boss  times over culturally that’s very difficult” difficult but necessary palomarez went on to create a board of toptier corporate executives and hispanic business owners including the likes of josé ramon mas ceo of the nation’s largest hispanicowned construction firm mastec “we’re not partisan but we are political we see policy and legislation as critically important to american business” “it was clear to me that in order for us to succeed—in order for us to really articulate the potential of our entrepreneurial community—our board needed honesttogoodness entrepreneurs who were living the american dream—who started with nothing and built empires” palomarez continues “getting the person who occupied the seat out and attracting the right person in—who frankly didn’t need to sit on our board because he was busy running a  billion enterprise—was one of the toughest things we had to do but we did it because we felt our board should elevate the stature of our chamber” palomarez needed to make and follow through with a lot of tough decisions like severing ties with the federal government which when he arrived in washington was one of  sponsors that funded ushcc “the first thing i did when i became ceo was give back every penny of federal funding” palomarez says adding that refunding the government’s money was an important turning point for the organization “today if we disagree with the administration or the department of commerce or the department of the treasury we can say so without having to worry about the millions of dollars they’re going to give us next year to stay alive it was heresy at the time” establishing independence from the government strengthened ushcc’s bipartisan brand which has helped it grow from  corporate sponsors in  to  in —fueling topline sales growth of over  percent in the same fiveyear period “things look much better today and the road ahead looks amazing” palomarez says he attributes the turnaround to his staff and their willingness to run the organization like a business instead of a nonprofit “we’re not a civil rights organization we’re a business organization we’re about getting business done so we run the ushcc like we would run an entrepreneurial startup that means we work insane hours we drive hard we set outrageous goals and when we achieve them we turn around and set even more outrageous goals” political pull one of these outrageous goals palomarez set about achieving was elevating the ushcc to a prominent level of political relevance “we’re not partisan but we are political” palomarez says “we see policy and legislation as critically important to american business we believe they’re inextricably linked so we need to be at the table articulating the views and values of american small business” seats at the proverbial table are often bought but because the ushcc was broke it couldn’t afford a voice “we had to earn it” palomarez says “we had no resources no money and little influence we were starting from scratch “we may not have had the finances but we understood the game” palomarez infused the organization with his will to thrive and washington noticed “you have to be good enough smart enough and tenacious enough to build yourself into the network—to force yourself into the dialogue and then begin to push and pull to get your agenda listened to and ultimately met we’re very good at that” so good in fact that the new and improved ushcc already has several feathers in its cap one for instance was the april  appointment of proamérica bank founder maria contrerassweet as the th administrator of the us small business administration sba “never again will an american president be elected without openly courting america’s hispanic vote” “when the position became available we were asked to give a short list of names to the administration when they came back and told us that they had in fact selected one of those names we led a coalition of  national organizations—none of which were hispanic—to urge congress to nominate and confirm maria contrerassweet” palomarez explains “we didn’t back her nomination because she’s hispanic or a woman or an immigrant or a member of our association but because she was the best american choice for the job to this day she is one of only three uncontested nominations that the president has made to his cabinet and to date maria has outperformed every sba administrator in recent memory “the sba is the pinnacle in terms of small business affairs so her leadership is very significant for the hispanic business community” the ushcc likewise proved instrumental in the nomination and confirmation of julián castro as secretary of housing and urban development and earlier this year flexed its political muscles on behalf of the transpacific partnership tpp a proposed trade agreement with asia that according to palomarez would create valuable jobs and revenue for hispanicowned businesses with presidential primaries just a few months away ushcc’s teeth couldn’t have grown in at a better time “president obama went to mexico and costa rica in  and on the eve of his departure i had an opportunity to talk to him” palomarez recounts “i said ‘you know mr president you wouldn’t be mr president were it not for the hispanic vote’ he agreed with me but i went further i said ‘never before has the hispanic community played such a critical role in electing an american president’ which he again agreed with finally i said ‘even more interesting to me—and perhaps even more important—is that never again will an american president be elected without openly courting america’s hispanic vote’ … in the last election mitt romney only got 7 percent of the hispanic vote president obama got 7 percent and the rest as they say is history” courting votes the ushcc’s hardwon political prowess permeates the air at the organization’s two annual events the ushcc legislative summit each spring and the ushcc national convention every fall the former which takes place each march in washington dc has hosted such guests as president barack obama vice president joe biden house speaker john boehner roh house minority leader nancy pelosi dca sen rand paul rky sen john mccain raz rep xavier becerra dca sen cory booker dnj sen elizabeth warren dma and sen chuck schumer dny among other heavy hitters “7 members of congress visited with us in  hours during our most recent legislative summit” palomarez says “of the 7 there were  republicans and  democrats which sends the message that no matter which side of the aisle you’re on if you aspire to a nationally elected position you’ve got to deal with america’s hispanic business community” as influential as the legislative summit is the national convention is even more so as it brings candidates facetoface with the voters and donors most capable of helping them get elected “it is the largest gathering of hispanic business leaders in america” states palomarez who stresses hispanic voters’ growing political capital “every  seconds a latino turns  and becomes an eligible voter that’s anywhere from  and  brandnew voters every single month and that’s going to be the case for the next  years” this year’s convention taking place september  in houston is expected to host as many as  attendees including small business owners elected officials and senior executives from as many as  corporations such as bank of america bp ford fritolay toyota verizon visa and wells fargo bank “it’s a ‘who’s who’ of both the public and the private sector” continues palomarez who has invited presidential contenders from both parties—including secretary of state hillary clinton and former florida governor jeb bush—to address this year’s convention during which the clout of the hispanic business community will be on full display “it’s our job to remind america that hispanic entrepreneurs are in fact a very useful asset to this nation they’re not only leading in innovation and creativity but they’re creating new companies at a rate three times that of the general market our national convention is a celebration of that” to get a sense for how important the ushcc national convention is—especially leading up to and during an election year—consider what happened in january  when a group of republican strategists set up a meeting with the ushcc “we were told ‘the republican party sees the light but… the candidates are afraid to engage the hispanic community during the primaries for fear that they will frighten off their conservative base’” palomarez recalls the republican strategy was to ignore the hispanic community during the primaries then offer an olive branch during the general election “it was not a good strategy we warned that they would be committing a fatal flaw by that taking the hispanic electorate for granted” palomarez says “the next thing you know republican leadership was sitting down with us so they could engage our members we’ve spoken to ted cruz jeb bush rand paul marco rubio among others the republican strategy changed midstream because we called the party out for trying to sneak through the primaries without answering to the hispanic community” no ‘hispandering’ allowed since the republican snafu candidates from both parties including hispanic hopefuls—senators ted cruz of texas and marco rubio of florida—have conducted special qa sessions with palomarez in front of the international press palomarez also publicly questioned one democratic presidential candidate maryland governor martin o’malley on immigration reform and former florida governor jeb bush has accepted an invitation to keynote the  ushcc national convention in houston like the candidates’ campaigns however the questions have only just begun according to palomarez who promises that the ushcc will continue pressing all the candidates on issues of import to hispanic businesspeople throughout the upcoming election season “we want to make sure that the presidential candidates are not simply ‘hispandering’ to hispanics” he says “we want them to understand the breadth of our concerns and… to seriously engage our community by illustrating that they understand what it means to be a hispanic american” immigration reform will be among the most important issues on which the ushcc presses candidates—“it’s a unifying issue and it’s important that candidates explain their position to us as candidly as they can” palomarez says—but it won’t be the only issue “the reality is we are a community that is not monolithic we care about all of the things that affect americans” palomarez explains “in fact according to a poll we conducted with  registered hispanic voters jobs the economy health care national security the federal budget and immigration were all important issues” on these issues palomarez believes many of the candidates stand with the ushcc concerning immigration for instance bush and clinton are “solidly on board” with the organization’s position he says “in varying degrees” o’malley meanwhile has made verbal commitments to the organization promising to treat immigration as an economic imperative to work with congress to pass immigration reform within the first  days of his presidency and to use executive action where possible in the absence of legislative reform “that’s what we want we want clear spoken commitments from the candidates to the hispanic business community” palomarez says insisting that the hispanic electorate remains “undecided” at this early stage of the election “more than any time in history the hispanic vote is truly up for grabs—in part because of the diversity within the parties and the individuals who are running and in part because the ushcc has been hard at work building bridges with both the republican and democratic parties ensuring that they hear us out and know that we have real issues that require real thoughtful deliberate discussion solutions and answers” because they unite the boardroom with the voting booth those bridges promise to endure—and the ushcc with them and palomarez who has in his lifetime gone from handpicking fruit to handpicking presidents has the best possible motivation to see this through “this is the second chapter of my life and i’m trying to live it by something tom brokaw once said ‘it’s easy to make a buck it’s a lot tougher to make a difference’ i’m trying to make a difference” you

palomarez president and ceo ushcc photos by sheila barabad is javier palomarez the most influential man in american politics unifier of the new majority and head of the ushcc sends a clear message to  presidential candidates you will not win without the hispanic vote october   by matt alderton the nation’s capital is teeming with powerful people from journalists and judges to lawmakers and lobbyists politicos and pundits to the president himself its residents collectively have more sway than a ship deluged by storm surge like racehorses perpetually circling a track they spend their days jockeying for position simultaneously gaining and ceding ground in sync with fickle political winds of all the steeds orbiting capitol hill in  however perhaps the most influential isn’t a senator a general or even a diplomat it’s a businessman with dark eyes and platinum hair javier palomarez president and ceo of the united states hispanic chamber of commerce ushcc his isn’t blunt inyourface power it’s the shrewd incisive kind it’s the voice not the fist or rather the voices—plural—as his represents the interests of nearly  million hispanicowned businesses which together contribute more than  billion to the american economy every year “the business owners that make up the hispanic business community aren’t just business owners they’re also job creators taxpayers political donors and ultimately voters” palomarez says “they are hugely influential in their own communities and even more so among the tens of millions of americans they employ they’re the gatekeepers if you will to a huge voting bloc—the hispanic community—which in today’s elections can be the difference between winning and losing” the hispanic chamber wasn’t always so significant in fact what today is one of the most influential organizations in the country just a few years ago was one of the least according to ushcc chairman emeritus nina vaca “when i got here the organization was in terrible shape” recalls palomarez who vaca helped recruit “it was the height of the recession and we were over  million in debt we had a bloated staff our finance chair told me we only had  days of life left—and that was the good news the brand was broken the bloom as they say was off the rose we were in a downward spiral programmatically reputationally and certainly financially we were in triage mode literally the day i walked in the door” six years later on the eve of the  presidential election the ushcc is transformed like a butterfly emergent from its cocoon it is selfassured and powerful—the product of a remarkable turnaround led by palomarez and bolstered by the increasing size standing and stature of the hispanic business community the road to washington palomarez knows a lot about turnarounds he’s been through a few in his life originally from south texas he spent his youth as a migrant farm worker picking fruits and vegetables alongside his nine siblings and their immigrant mother whose early death from a heart attack led him to drop out of high school and run away from home “i come from a fairly impoverished background we had to hustle for what we got” says palomarez who as a teenager spent more than a year on the streets before returning home where he ultimately decided to earn his ged and go to college he graduated from the university of texas–pan american in  with a degree in finance “through a lot of hard work and good fortune i ended up getting something called the wall street journal student achievement award that literally put me on the map my name appeared in the wall street journal and two weeks before i graduated i had several job offers from corporate america” palomarez spent the next two decades becoming one of the nation’s top multicultural sales and marketing executives building programs that touched millions during tenures at allstate insurance corp sprint inc and bank of america where he was senior vice president of multicultural marketing “i made a career out of introducing multicultural markets to brands that had come to the realization they needed to engage diverse consumers but didn’t know how to go about it” says palomarez who is best known for creating the insurance industry’s first integrated national hispanic marketing sales and service campaign during his  years at allstate “toward the end of my career i was very fortunate to work not only with the hispanic community but also with the african american community the gay and lesbian community and the women’s market which really afforded me the opportunity to see the changing demographics in america and how incredibly important these markets had become—and were going to be going forward” what palomarez had done for corporate brands the ushcc believed he could do for its nonprofit brand “the united states hispanic chamber of commerce started courting me” says palomarez although he was admittedly the perfect man for the job he initially didn’t want it “i wanted nothing to do with it i didn’t see nonprofit management as my strength or my bailiwick i didn’t think i’d be the kind of guy to run a nonprofit” nina vaca strongly disagreed “for almost two years—three or four times a week—i would hear from nina” palomarez continues “she was relentless about how i should give back and how i could bring my talents and experience to help the organization solve the challenges it was facing” vaca’s persistence paid off and in  palomarez joined the ushcc as its captain his monumental mission save the sinking ship then sail it to greatness driving change the ushcc’s is a cinderella story and if there’s anything cinderella had to do a lot of it was clean house—which is exactly what palomarez did when he arrived at the organization’s k street headquarters “we went from  employees to four and i was one of the four” says palomarez who had become ushcc’s fifth ceo in as many years “perhaps the toughest thing we did was transform our board of directors we had to tell  people who meant well but simply weren’t the right people that they needed to leave basically i had to fire my boss  times over culturally that’s very difficult” difficult but necessary palomarez went on to create a board of toptier corporate executives and hispanic business owners including the likes of josé ramon mas ceo of the nation’s largest hispanicowned construction firm mastec “we’re not partisan but we are political we see policy and legislation as critically important to american business” “it was clear to me that in order for us to succeed—in order for us to really articulate the potential of our entrepreneurial community—our board needed honesttogoodness entrepreneurs who were living the american dream—who started with nothing and built empires” palomarez continues “getting the person who occupied the seat out and attracting the right person in—who frankly didn’t need to sit on our board because he was busy running a  billion enterprise—was one of the toughest things we had to do but we did it because we felt our board should elevate the stature of our chamber” palomarez needed to make and follow through with a lot of tough decisions like severing ties with the federal government which when he arrived in washington was one of  sponsors that funded ushcc “the first thing i did when i became ceo was give back every penny of federal funding” palomarez says adding that refunding the government’s money was an important turning point for the organization “today if we disagree with the administration or the department of commerce or the department of the treasury we can say so without having to worry about the millions of dollars they’re going to give us next year to stay alive it was heresy at the time” establishing independence from the government strengthened ushcc’s bipartisan brand which has helped it grow from  corporate sponsors in  to  in —fueling topline sales growth of over  percent in the same fiveyear period “things look much better today and the road ahead looks amazing” palomarez says he attributes the turnaround to his staff and their willingness to run the organization like a business instead of a nonprofit “we’re not a civil rights organization we’re a business organization we’re about getting business done so we run the ushcc like we would run an entrepreneurial startup that means we work insane hours we drive hard we set outrageous goals and when we achieve them we turn around and set even more outrageous goals” political pull one of these outrageous goals palomarez set about achieving was elevating the ushcc to a prominent level of political relevance “we’re not partisan but we are political” palomarez says “we see policy and legislation as critically important to american business we believe they’re inextricably linked so we need to be at the table articulating the views and values of american small business” seats at the proverbial table are often bought but because the ushcc was broke it couldn’t afford a voice “we had to earn it” palomarez says “we had no resources no money and little influence we were starting from scratch “we may not have had the finances but we understood the game” palomarez infused the organization with his will to thrive and washington noticed “you have to be good enough smart enough and tenacious enough to build yourself into the network—to force yourself into the dialogue and then begin to push and pull to get your agenda listened to and ultimately met we’re very good at that” so good in fact that the new and improved ushcc already has several feathers in its cap one for instance was the april  appointment of proamérica bank founder maria contrerassweet as the th administrator of the us small business administration sba “never again will an american president be elected without openly courting america’s hispanic vote” “when the position became available we were asked to give a short list of names to the administration when they came back and told us that they had in fact selected one of those names we led a coalition of  national organizations—none of which were hispanic—to urge congress to nominate and confirm maria contrerassweet” palomarez explains “we didn’t back her nomination because she’s hispanic or a woman or an immigrant or a member of our association but because she was the best american choice for the job to this day she is one of only three uncontested nominations that the president has made to his cabinet and to date maria has outperformed every sba administrator in recent memory “the sba is the pinnacle in terms of small business affairs so her leadership is very significant for the hispanic business community” the ushcc likewise proved instrumental in the nomination and confirmation of julián castro as secretary of housing and urban development and earlier this year flexed its political muscles on behalf of the transpacific partnership tpp a proposed trade agreement with asia that according to palomarez would create valuable jobs and revenue for hispanicowned businesses with presidential primaries just a few months away ushcc’s teeth couldn’t have grown in at a better time “president obama went to mexico and costa rica in  and on the eve of his departure i had an opportunity to talk to him” palomarez recounts “i said ‘you know mr president you wouldn’t be mr president were it not for the hispanic vote’ he agreed with me but i went further i said ‘never before has the hispanic community played such a critical role in electing an american president’ which he again agreed with finally i said ‘even more interesting to me—and perhaps even more important—is that never again will an american president be elected without openly courting

successful small businesses are the foundation of a healthy vibrant american community thats why serving small business owners is one of the most important things we do yet we also know that many small businesses across the country including those in diverse communities are still recovering from the great recession serving diverse owned businesses is a priority for us and we know that more needs to be done to help those businesses grow and prosper its also clear that we as well as those who support small business in our country need to better understand the challenges facing diverse business owners for this reason we turned to gallup to conduct a study working with the us black chambers the us hispanic chamber of commerce and the us pan asian american chamber of commerce education foundation gallup surveyed diverse business owners nationwide to better understand their motivations for starting a business their funding needs and their attitudes towards credit we learned about how diverse small business owners addressed funding needs and their perception of financial institutions we heard about their desire for resources education and tools to help their business succeed in this video javier palomarez president and ceo of us hispanic chamber of commerce shares his perspective about the study and how it relates to ushcc members javier palomarez i think one of the things that truly resonated with me was that the survey in a way challenged some myths the survey found that the hispanic community and the entrepreneurial spirit within the hispanic community is alive and well between the years  and  the ushcc collaborated on a study with an organization called geoscape a member of the ushcc and we looked at the growth of hispanicowned firms in this country and we found that while small businesses in general were trending downward the exact opposite was the case with hispanicowned firms in fact hispanicowned firms between the year  and  doubled and it challenges the myth that hispanics are jobtakers in fact what were seeing through this kind of a study is that hispanic business owners are jobmakers and that to me gets at the root of the potential this community represents clearly the challenges that americas hispanic small businesses are facing are access to credit capital and contracts when a business has access to any one of those three or all three they have an opportunity to invest in the business they have an opportunity to pitch the business and they ultimately have an opportunity to grow the business one of the cultural nuances that exist within the hispanic community that sometimes can be a deterrent to a loan conversation is that oftentimes our hispanic business owners are either immigrants themselves or one or two generations removed from an immigrant and those immigrants came from societies from economies from countries where the financial services industry was not as established in those countries the financial services industries were never interested in talking to our business owners they never wanted to have a relationship with them when you bring that cultural nuance to a setting such as you have here in america there is a reticence to trust a financial institution that in a sense continues to be a bit of a barrier in the hispanic business community as it relates to a loan application and ultimately a loan being delivered to one of our small business owners i think the best way to address the lack of confidence within the hispanic business community as it relates to credit possibilities and credit products and services is to educate that community the chamber training institute is a program that is put on through the united states hispanic chamber of commerces foundation it is  funded through an investment from wells fargo the training is put on by notre dame university and we put it on in different cities all over the nation what were doing with wells fargo through our chamber training institute gets right at that issue it teaches the hispanic business owner what the options are what the potential is that exists in the marketplace and it prepares them for that conversation with a banker so that ultimately they feel more comfortable about having the conversation and they feel more comfortable and confident about the fact that ultimately they can get access to credit or that loan thats critically needed to continue to grow the business when you invest in a local business in essence you are helping create tax dollars you are helping create jobs you are helping drive a local economy and thats the kind of giving that i think is very strategic and ultimately has a multiplier effect that can be felt for years to come i think this is a wonderful time to be commissioning studies that better understand the needs of our diverse business communities specifically the hispanic business community but certainly all of them american small business needs all the help it can get it is i think clearly understood now more than ever that american small business is the engine of the american economy so the better we understand them the better we understand their needs the better equipped we are as this nation as an economy as a society of responsible business thinkers to continue the development and growth of that small business community which is critically important to the continued wellbeing of our economy see full transcript share business creditcenter get started go to the business credit center lending to diverse
