severely adverse scenario identified by the federal reserve board indicate that comerica would maintain sufficient capital ratios throughout the ninequarter forecasting horizon pursuant to cfr § the following is a summary of the results of the  dfast supervisory severely adverse scenario of comerica based upon the scenario and assumptions discussed below loss projections supervisory severely adverse scenario quarter total     in billions  total loan losses  of average loans   preprovision net revenue ppnr  of average assets   pretax income  of average assets   capital ratios supervisory severely adverse scenario actual q minimum common equity tier  capital ratio   tier  risk  based capital ratio   total risk  based capital ratio   tier  leverage ratio    minimum means comericas lowest result for any quarter over the quarter forecast period the federal reserve board clarified on november   that the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar minimum regulatory capital ratios do not apply in the dfast scenarios and therefore there are no minimum capital requirements in the dfast the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act pursuant to section i requires all bank holding companies bhcs with total consolidated assets of  billion or more to develop a set of forwardlooking stress tests twice each year this includes a midyear test based upon hypothetical economic scenarios developed internally by the bhc and a yearend test based upon hypothetical economic scenarios developed both internally and by the federal reserve board frb the estimated financial results of the stress test will identify the projected capital position of a corporation under hypothetical severely adverse economic conditions that include both systemic and bhcspecific summary results of doddfrank act stress test      risks as defined by the bhc to determine if there is sufficient capital to absorb losses and support operations for the dfast forecasts subjected bhcs are required to use a uniform set of capital assumptions over the ninequarter planning period which includes using actual capital actions for the first quarter of the planning horizon and using the following assumptions for the second through the ninth quarters of the planning horizon i quarterly common stock dividend distributions equal to the average quarterly dollar amount of common stock dividends paid in the prior year plus dividends attributable to issuances related to expensed employee compensation ii payments on any other instrument that is eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio equal to the stated dividend interest or principal due on such instrument during the quarter iii no redemption or repurchase of any regulatory capital instrument and iv no issuances of common stock or preferred stock except for issuances related to expensed employee compensation  economic scenario the supervisory severely adverse scenario used for the  dfast was released by the federal reserve on february   in the  supervisory scenarios for annual stress tests required under the doddfrank act stress test dfast rules and the capital plan rule the supervisory severely adverse scenario reflects a hypothetical lowprobability distressed macroeconomic environment the supervisory severely adverse scenario is characterized by a severe fivequarter recession beginning in q that can be categorized as similar in severity compared to the recession of  in terms of real gdp decline both in absolute and percentage terms the unemployment rate peaks at  in q and the federal funds rate falls back down to near zero levels from the onset of the recession and remains there throughout the forecast period  risks accounted for in stresstesting results comerica developed its capital management process leveraging its existing risk management structure in order to ensure that capital adequacy was assessed based on all of its material risks and its associated risk profile comerica assumes various types of risk in the normal course of business while management classifies its key risk exposures into seven areas i credit ii market iii liquidity iv operational v compliance vi financial reporting and vii strategic risks it also evaluates its total portfolio risk exposures through its enterprisewide risk management structure  enterprise risk management comericas enterprise risk division headed by the chief risk officer cro represents comericas second line of defense which provides objective oversight and support to the organization as it continually reassesses and mitigates risk the enterprise risk division ensures appropriate risk management practices and processes are in place to maintain risk levels within the requirements of the risk appetite laid out by the board of directors through the implementation of the corporations enterprise risk management framework specialized risk managers along with the risk management summary results of doddfrank act stress test      committees for each of the seven major risk categories are responsible for the daytoday management of those respective risks the monitoring and coordination of the corporations risk resides with comerica’s enterprisewide risk management ewrm committee the ewrm committee is responsible for monitoring governance over the enterprisewide risk management process and providing oversight in managing comerica’s aggregate risk position the ewrm committee is principally made up of various senior managers from the different risk areas and business units the ewrm committee has reporting responsibility to the enterprise risk committee erc of the board of directors in order to facilitate the enterprisewide risk management process the enterprise risk division provides the resources for the ewrm committee to carry out its responsibilities the enterprise risk division is responsible for processes supporting risk identification and assessment planning and coordinating the enterprise stresstesting activities and the production of the capital plan in addition the model risk management department under the cro provides a recurring independent validation function of the various riskmanagement models that complement comerica’s existing audit processes  credit risk management comerica considers credit risk to be in aggregate its most significant risk credit risk is the risk of loss due to the failure of customers or counterparties to meet their financial obligations to comerica or otherwise perform as agreed in accordance with contractual terms or due to lack of portfolio diversification at the relationship level comerica manages credit risk through conservative underwriting skilled and experienced relationship management oversight by an objective credit administration function approval and periodic review of all significant credit exposures early identification and elevated management of deteriorating credit risk exposures and detailed credit policies and guidelines at the portfolio level comerica mitigates the impact of credit risk through loan portfolio diversification in addition to geographic diversification naturally achieved through comericas multistate footprint comerica limits exposure to any single industry customer highrisk loan type or guarantor the governance of the credit risk process begins with the strategic credit committee which is chaired by the chief credit officer and is supported by various other corporate resources credit administration provides the resources to manage business line transactional credit risk by ensuring that all credit exposure is properly underwritten and risk rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy portfolio risk analytics a part of the enterprise risk division provides comprehensive reporting analysis and effective challenge on the status and migration at the portfolio and subportfolio levels of credit risk continuous assessment and verification of risk rating models quarterly calculation of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on offbalance sheet items quarterly calculation of credit risk economic capital and periodic stress testing of the credit risk portfolio summary results of doddfrank act stress test      the corporations asset quality review function a division of internal audit audits the accuracy of internal risk ratings that are assigned by the lending and credit groups the special assets group a unit of credit administration is responsible for managing the recovery process of distressed or defaulted loans and loan sales  market and liquidity risk management market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movements in financial markets including interest and foreign exchange rates as well as commodity and equity prices liquidity risk represents i the failure to meet financial obligations when due that results from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding and ii the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without taking a significant loss due to market disruptions or inadequate market depth the asset liability policy committee alco establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities comerica’s enterprise risk division and treasury department support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk and liquidity risk and in coordinating all other market risks this encompasses a variety of key activities from analysis of risk positions and balance sheet structures to recommendations on risk mitigants more specifically the enterprise risk division and the treasury department monitor risk levels anticipate potential needs and devise solutions for alco’s consideration including actions such as interest rate risk hedging both on and offbalance sheet debt and capital issuance for liquidity management and security portfolio size and composition in addition the enterprise risk division and the treasury department support alco through the development of economic capital estimates for market risk and the monitoring of capital adequacy in accordance with comerica’s capital management policy  operational risk management operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people systems or external events operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operating risks at appropriate levels this system of controls is tailored to each business unit’s specific risk profile and is comprised of a combination of system controls and manual controls including management review and oversight designed specifically to detect and prevent operational failures for governance purposes comerica established an operational risk management committee to help ensure that appropriate risk management techniques and systems are maintained comerica has developed a framework that includes a centralized operational risk management function and support personnel who are responsible for managing operational risk specific to the respective business lines in addition finance staff monitor and assess along with internal audit through extensive audit testing the overall effectiveness of the system of internal controls on an ongoing basis summary results of doddfrank act stress test       compliance risk management compliance risk represents the risk of regulatory sanctions or financial loss resulting from failure to comply with regulations and standards of good banking practice activities that may expose comerica to compliance risk include but are not limited to those dealing with the prevention of money laundering privacy and data protection community reinvestment initiatives fair lending consumer protection employment and tax matters overthecounter derivative activities and other activities regulated by the doddfrank act comerica established an enterprisewide compliance committee ewcc consisting of senior business unit managers as well as managers responsible for a broad array of risk and audit management this enterprisewide approach provides a consistent view of compliance across the organization the ewcc also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level  financial reporting risk management financial reporting risk represents the risk of loss or other adverse impacts to comerica arising from material inaccuracies or misstatements in external financial reporting to regulatory or other external third parties these risks are mitigated through a comprehensive system of governance and controls that ensure accurate results are provided for external reporting purposes additionally the disclosure signoff committee consisting of senior representatives from all lines of business ensures that appropriate processes and controls have occurred to produce accurate financial results  strategic risk management strategic risk represents the risk of loss due to the impairment of reputation failure to fully develop and execute business plans failure to assess current and new business market and product opportunities failure to require appropriate compensation for risk taken and any other event not identified in the defined risk categories of credit market liquidity operational compliance or financial reporting risks mitigation of the various elements that represent strategic risk is achieved through initiatives to help the corporation better understand and report on the various risks day to day business risks faced by comerica fall into one of the seven categories discussed above and are incorporated into the stresstesting process through a variety of quantitative models and qualitative considerations where statistical models are not capable  methodologies used and resulting stresstest estimates comerica employs several different quantitative and qualitative methods in the stresstesting processes to forecast the impact of the risks over a ninequarter forecast period the methods developed are focused on a repeatable transparent process that ties forecast results to macroeconomic variables to ensure comerica’s ability to forecast using given economic scenarios methods include statistical modeling techniques regression models monte carlo simulations actuarial models mathematical finance models etc  for primary forecasts along with challenger models for benchmark forecasts historical trend analysis scenario analysis and calibration with expert management judgment where appropriate there are many core statistical models used to generate forecast results sensitive to summary results of doddfrank act stress test      macroeconomic scenarios throughout the stresstesting process key models employed were backtested by comparing forecasts against comerica’s historical results and industry performance to ensure relevance and consistency key models are subject to sensitivity analysis entailing both parameter stability analysis and data sensitivity analysis an independent team reviews and validates the components of the model development the reasonability of the forecast results and the accuracy of model and mathematical calculations additionally the organization involves a collection of various committees consisting of differing levels of management and business expertise that provide input into the model development process and challenge the stresstesting results from a business perspective to ensure alignment with business expectations given the economic scenario quantitative and qualitative overlays and buffers are incorporated into the forecast estimates to account for internal strategic initiatives tactical business decisions or identified model weaknesses and limitations where appropriate final results and submissions to the federal reserve are reviewed challenged and formally approved by comerica’s board of directors the methodologies used for each major component of the stresstesting process and the resulting model estimates are summarized below  credit losses and allowance for loan and lease losses alll model development and estimates  credit loss forecasts  commercial loans commercial loans represent more than  of comericas credit risk exposure commercial and industrial ci loans are dominated by exposures to middle market and large corporate borrowers small business companies and private banking customers which are primarily located in comericas operating footprint the ci portfolio also includes exposures to certain specialty industries and to a lesser extent to international businesses comericas commercial real estate cre loans include the financing of construction projects and income producing properties located primarily in comericas operating footprint as well as limited infootprint exposure to finance land acquisition land development and homebuilding comerica utilized several internally developed quantitative models to forecast credit losses for its ci and cre portfolios as well as related exposures to derivative and foreign exchange product counterparties core lossforecasting models were developed at granular levels for ci business segments and cre product segments that had historically demonstrated different degrees of sensitivity to the macroeconomic environment exposure to owneroccupied cre was modeled in the owners ci segment due to the nature of the collateral and underwritten repayment sources certain personal purpose loans that are underwritten and have the same fundamental sources of repayment as related wholesale loans such as loans to owners of comericas ci customers were modeled in the relevant ci or cre segment summary results of doddfrank act stress test      core models for each of these segments were developed to generate loss forecasts by projecting quarterly probability of default pd loss given default lgd exposure at default ead and changes in the risk profile of the portfolio under different economic conditions the models used  the credit exposure and risk profile of each segment at the outset of the forecast period  forecasts of the outstanding balance for each segment through the forecast period and  combinations of predictive macroeconomic variables demonstrated to have been specifically relevant to each ci and cre segments credit loss drivers pd lgd and ead for each of the ci and cre segments default forecasting is based on actual historical risk migration patterns and sensitivity to the macroeconomic environment lgd and ead projections for each of the segments are based on historically demonstrated sensitivity of those factors to changes in the macroeconomic environment in addition to the core credit loss forecasting models based on the performance history of comericas own portfolio comerica has constructed macrosensitive challenger models using relevant external data and alternative modeling methodologies the output of these challenger models serves to benchmark and influence the final credit loss forecasts in the stressed scenarios incorporating the results of these challenger models can help amplify the loss forecasts generated by the core models when the loss forecasts generated by the core models under severely adverse macroeconomic scenarios do not match or exceed historic experience under stressed conditions  credit loss forecasts  retail loans the retail portfolios which represent less than  of total loans mainly consist of loans secured by residential real estate originated directly from borrowers in comericas footprint over  of retail outstanding loans are associated with customers who have other comerica relationships retail portfolio balances and losses were quantitatively estimated for two segments residential mortgage and home equity by using comericas historical portfolio data together these loans represent over  of the total retail portfolio the remainder of the retail portfolio consists of exposures to product segments too small to serve as the basis for separate estimates the home equity line of credit loss forecasts rates are used for these small segments in addition to the core credit loss forecasting estimates based on the performance history of comericas own retail portfolios comerica constructed macrosensitive challenger models using relevant external data and alternative modeling methodology incorporating the results of these challenger models serves to amplify the loss forecasts generated by the core estimates when the loss forecasts generated by the core quantitative estimates under severely adverse macroeconomic scenarios do not match or exceed historic experience under stressed conditions the challenger models did not alter any of the core estimates either in the bhc or supervisory adverse scenarios since the core quantitative estimates were higher than comericas historical experience  allowance for loan and lease losses alll and provision the comerica alll forecasting models and related provision expense are driven by modeled balances risk distribution portfolio losses and select macroeconomic variables over the ninequarter forecast period several key ratios are employed to ensure that the modeled results of alll are appropriate and provide sufficient coverage of expected losses summary results of doddfrank act stress test      the table below

development of ppnr components is integral to estimating credit losses and capital impacts for the stresstesting process major balance sheet and income statement items including loans deposits noninterest income and noninterest expense are forecasted based upon the outputs of statistical regression models that properly quantify the relationship between macroeconomic variables and internal historical results at a granular level of product or business line segmentation macroeconomic variables used in the models are selected based upon business and statistical reviews final model selection includes both a business and a statistical review ensuring that forecasts are in line with management expectations and that the model passes a collection of statistical tests to confirm reliable and stable results the forecasts used for stress testing are reviewed from a business perspective with overlays of management expertise where justified by identified strategic plans tactical business changes or other model limitations for those segments that do not use a statistical regression model an empiricallybased calculation combined with management judgment is used to quantify in a given economic scenario and is reviewed with similar rigor in  comerica announced the implementation of a comprehensive corporatewide initiative gear up which identified meaningful opportunities to operate more efficiently as well as to drive increased summary results of doddfrank act stress test      revenue across the corporation all expected incremental revenues and expense reductions related to gear up initiatives are captured in each of the scenarios supporting the  capital plan furthermore models have been explicitly constructed so as to not “institutionalize” the restructuring charges required to implement these initiatives  balance sheet projections balance sheet forecasts are based upon a combination of statistical models for most major asset and liability components combined with other mathematical formulas and management judgment for estimates of balances for other balance sheet components total accruing loans are divided into granular commercial loan segments by major business lines and retail segments by product type mainly using statistical regression models tied to macroeconomic variables used to forecast monthly periodending balances in a given economic scenario the smaller segments of commercial and retail loan portfolios amounting to less than  in total are modeled using various empirical forecasting methods total deposits are divided by major product type within the wholesale and consumer segments statistical regression models tied to macroeconomic variables are used to predict monthly periodending balances in a given economic scenario the remaining balance sheet categories that are not driven by macroeconomic variables are estimated using a combination of quantitative relationships tied to internal variables and management judgment  income statement projections net interest income is forecasted by using modeled balance estimates of commercial loans retail loans and deposits noted above and applying forecasted loan and other asset yields deposits and other liability costs these are developed based upon a combination of the interest rate environment and management insights noninterest income is forecasted mainly using statistical regression models tied to macroeconomic variables noninterest income model segment development used major product categories that were statistically analyzed and examined by subject matter experts for business consistency in an effort to group the product lines into classes that would resonate similarly to macroeconomic factors and business drivers noninterest expenses were forecasted in a similar manner to noninterest income with granular segmentation based on major expense category a few expense segments were modeled with a statistical regression model while the majority of noninterest expense segments were modeled using quantitative historical financial relationships and empiricallybased calculations which more appropriately captured the response in a given economic scenario in ccar  comerica employed a less complex statistical framework and the operational risk methodology followed a standard modeling approach that uses historically experienced loss severity data legal reserves projections followed similar methodology summary results of doddfrank act stress test      the table below identifies the cumulative ninequarter forecasted estimates of revenues

losses   other lossesgains        equals net incomeloss before taxes   total net incomeloss before taxes over the ninequarter period in the hypothetical supervisory severely adverse scenario was estimated at  billion primarily attributable to high levels of credit losses and provisions driven largely by the impact of the fivequarter severe recession on the general economy total estimated net losses were also impacted by lower revenues as a result of lower interest rates lower loan volume and lower noninterest income the capital impact of these estimates is discussed and identified below  capital methodology and results summary under the hypothetical  supervisory severely adverse scenario which was performed under dfast rules comerica’s capital position and capital ratios were calculated by analyzing the impact to capital from • changes in business mix on and offbalance sheet • changes in projected earnings • capital actions as prescribed by the dfast regulations and • any adjustments for regulatory rules the pro forma balance sheet was then risk weighted using the standardized approach for risk weighted assets the regulatory rules to which comerica is subject the change in the level of the total summary results of doddfrank act stress test      risk weighted assets from one quarter to the next reflects changes in the overall balance sheet size and mix and changes in offbalance sheet exposures risk weighted asset projections were based on applicable risk weightings pertaining to each type of asset category the resulting regulatory capital and risk weighted asset estimates were used to generate pro forma quarterly capital ratios comerica is not an advanced approaches bhc and thus became subject to the basel iii rules beginning in the first quarter of  thus comericas projected capital ratios were calculated in accordance with the final basel iii capital rule and based on the instructions issued by the frb for the hypothetical dfasts as required by the dfast rules certain capital actions and capital distributions assumptions were prescribed by the frb and do not necessarily represent the actual capital actions that comerica would intend to take instead dfast requires bhcs to calculate their pro forma capital ratios using the following assumptions regarding their capital actions over the planning horizon • for the first quarter of the planning horizon a bhc must take into account its actual capital actions for that quarter • for each of the second through ninth quarters of the planning horizon a bhc must include in the projections of capital ◦ common stock dividends equal to the quarterly average dollar amount of common stock dividends that the bhc paid in the previous year plus common stock dividends attributable to issuances related to expensed employee compensation ◦ payments on any other instrument that is eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio equal to the stated dividend interest or principal due on such instrument during the quarter ◦ an assumption of no redemption or repurchase of any capital instrument that is eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio which would include an assumption of no common share repurchases and ◦ an assumption of no issuances of common stock or preferred stock except for issuances related to expensed employee compensation the impact of the aforementioned rules assumptions and balance sheet and income statement results on capital ratios in the hypothetical supervisory severely adverse scenario over the

standardized approach     risk weighted assets   comerica maintains sufficient levels of capital throughout the forecast horizon as shown in the table above in the dfast supervisory severely adverse scenario common equity tier  capital increases approximately  basis points over the forecast horizon to   this increase is primarily driven by a reduction in riskweighted assets over the course of the forecast horizon which offsets the expected decline in pretax income that decline is attributable to a deterioration in core earnings as well as rising credit costs exceeding preprovision net revenues ppnr over the ninequarter forecast horizon as a result of the severe downturn in the us economy included in this hypothetical scenario as detailed in the ppnr table this leads to a forecasted pretax net loss of approximately  billion over the forecast horizon in summary in the  dfast supervisory severely adverse scenario comerica maintains sufficient capital ratios throughout the forecast horizon
