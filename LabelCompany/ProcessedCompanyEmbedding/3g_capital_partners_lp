required fields g capital partners lp is known for wringing costs out of foodandbeverage businesses its track record for boosting sales and market share of their products is less stellar the brazilian privateequity firm is currently embarked on its biggest challenge integrating the former kraft foods group into the heinz business that g bought two years ago with warren buffetts berkshire hathaway inc kraft heinz co formed last month owns many of the most recognized food names in americaincluding eight brands with more than  billion in annual sales among them kraft heinz oscar mayer and velveeta but many of the companys brands are struggling to keep up with consumers shift toward lessprocessed fare some analysts think g could take on even more acquisitions activist investor william ackmans pershing square capital management lp last week revealed that it had built a  billion  stake in mondelez international inc betting in part that it might eventually be acquired by kraft heinz a wall street journal examination of the companies g and its founders already have invested in which also include burger king and anheuserbusch inbev nv shows impressive increases in profit margins but mixed performances on sales growthother than that which comes from more acquisitions since g bought heinz two years ago for example the ketchup maker lost market share in  of the food categories in which it has brands maintained share in  and gained in less than  according to a february report by mckinsey  co heinz has had only two major product launches in the us in its two years under g in february it unveiled srirachaflavored ketchup and in april it announced a consumer version of the yellow mustard it has long sold to bulk retailers and foodservice customers like ballparks g hasnt done anything revolutionary or groundbreaking that worked with heinz products said david turner food analyst at market researcher mintel a spokesman for g capital said the global investment firm focuses on longterm with a particular emphasis on maximizing the potential of brands and businesses he added that the firm works in close partnership with management teams at its portfolio companies kraft heinz spokesman michael mullen said its strategy is focused growth that emphasizes fewer bigger better innovations and it has increased advertising media spending by  over the past two years including heinzs first super bowl commercial in decades in  part of the issue is priorities say people who follow g it focuses on reducing spending through cutting staff and increasing efficiency and only then focuses on growth says a consultant who has worked with the firm gs spending cuts generally far exceed typical belt tightening its use of zerobased budgeting which requires justifying all spending from scratch annually yields detailed savings measures such as limits on color printing and requiring executives to share hotel rooms on business trips the firm says such penny pinching yields savings that it invests in products and marketing as it scrutinizes costs g also evaluates which of its brands are worth investing in at heinz executives reallocated money to core products like its namesake ketchup from less promising ones like heinzs bottled gravy and discontinued dozens of unsuccessful items while heinz has gained market share with ketchup and its lea  perrins worcestershire sauce since  it lost share in areas that include bagel bites frozen snacks and classico pasta sauce according to marketresearch firm iri its sales fell  million to  billion in the first quarter this year but operating income rose  to  million kraft heinz reports secondquarter results for its two predecessor companies on monday at kraft gs approach could mean less investment in brands like jello and maxwell house as it focuses on core moneymakers like oscar mayer analysts say gs strategy brings potential longterm downsides the mckinsey report while noting that the firm has created tremendous operational value warns that its focus on shortterm profitability and cash flows does pose risks to brand health particularly to future growth mckinsey declined to comment further g emphasizes its desire to grow companies but its main means for that so far has been more deals burger king which g bought in  last year acquired canadas tim hortons chain to form restaurant brands international inc ab inbev has purchased grupo modelo maker of corona beer and craft breweries including chicagos goose island at burger king sales at restaurants open at least  months have risen at a respectable average of  over the past three years though that followed a rocky start with a poorly executed menu overhaul the company has stumbled with some products it eliminated its chicken fries only to bring them back two years later because of popular demand in  it introduced satisfries lowercalorie french fries which were discontinued within a year other than that i havent seen a whole lot out of burger king in terms of food innovation since g came in said a burger king franchise operator who also owns stock in restaurant brands still he isnt complaining restaurant brands earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization rose  to  million last year excluding tim hortons burger king and heinz also have focused on international expansion which heinz has said could also benefit kraft the business is being driven by listening to consumers and delivering what they want innovation for the sake of innovation isnt the key driver of our business a restaurant brands spokesman said g doesnt own ab inbev but its founding partners own large stakes after helping create it through a  merger operating income at ab inbev has grown by an average of  a year in its five
