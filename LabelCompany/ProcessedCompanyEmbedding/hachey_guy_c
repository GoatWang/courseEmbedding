years ago in the automotive industry with general motors gm in canada and the us which led to him heading delphi automotive systems as president of its chassis systems division he oversaw a  billion us business with  product lines  plants and over  employees he made the switch to aerospace very recently in april  we met with him at the nbaa show in orlando recently to ask him how he views his new responsibilities and the future of private aviation et so what brought you to bombardier and the private aviation industry guy hachey i spent  years in the auto industry just outside of montreal and enjoyed a very gratifying career but recently i was approached about the opportunity at bombardier coming from montreal and being a canadian it intrigued me quite a bit bombardier has had a long history in canada and as i explored the opportunity i got more and more interested—particularly as i looked at the prospects so it was an opportunity to join a very exciting industry but in addition to that it was kind of like going back home et are there similarities between the automotive industry and private aviation guy hachey we’re talking about industries that are very complex that have long lead times that require a lot of engineering capability and design there’s also the emotional appeal of the products in the car industry certain segments carry a great deal of emotional appeal it’s the same with private aviation it’s about emotion and passion so those are the similarities the manufacturing process is somewhat similar too there’s difference in terms of scale and volume but in general i see a lot of similarities along those lines et what are the differences from your standpoint guy hachey if you look at the auto industry there’s a multitude of competitors in the private aerospace industry there’s just not that many we cater to a different clientele obviously so that is a major difference the supply base is different too there’re fewer suppliers for airplanes than for cars i would also say the transactional side is much more personal in private aviation et what does the president of bombardier aerospace oversee exactly guy hachey i oversee all of the aerospace activities for bombardier it’s essentially an  billion company at this point in time and growing very fast we have three major segments to the company the largest one being the business aircraft segment where we have a very extensive portfolio of products in fact it’s the industry’s largest our commercial aircraft segment includes both regional jets and the q series of turboprop aircraft as well we just announced the launch of a major new aircraft the c series and then we have quite an extensive customer service and support group so those are the three major businesses that i’m responsible for et previously in the automotive business you oversaw the middle east and i know this is an important market for bombardier too for any of the readers who might see all of the things that are going on in the gulf countries and are looking to expand their businesses there what advice could you them guy hachey there’s tremendous opportunity and if you look at what happened most recently in the world you know the region seems to be more insulated than many others essentially every other market in the world has been affected by the global economic crisis but yet in the middle east things seem to be going relatively well i would say that having feet on the ground that really understand the region is key it’s a very different market very relationshiporiented so you can assume certain things about western europe or even in asia but in the middle east you have to be there it’s based on longterm relationships and being there and establishing those relationships is very very important et what’s your outlook for the business aviation industry over the next say  years will growth continue to come from outside of north america guy hachey last year the order intake we had was  percent for north america and  percent international so obviously our customer base is diversifying in the past it was more like  percent north america  percent international so there’s a huge swing happening in our customer base in terms of a longerterm view obviously we’re monitoring the situation very closely right now i hate to refer to the economy but it is there it’s top of mind so in the short run we do expect something of a slowdown our customers are cautious but we think the longterm fundamentals are still there we predict very very high growth for business aircraft use as a productivity tool wealth is being created in the rest of the world gdps are going up in general so we see longterm demand increasing for business aircraft we also see good opportunity from an infrastructure standpoint for regional jets on top of that the fleet age for our traditional customers commercial airlines is getting up there so this means a robust business in selling replacements we see a bright future in the long run in the short run we’ve got to observe monitor…make sure we’re careful in our decisions et i know bombardier has vertical integration with flexjet the fractional ownership and card provider do you see that as the type of model you’re going to continue to stay with going forward guy hachey flexjet is an important part of our operaton it complements our strategy you know we obviously are in the business of making and selling planes flexjet is a very large customer even though they’re part of the family so they have a fleet of roughly  planes they replace the aircraft on an ongoing basis so the aircraft age is consistently young it’s a really good for us to get our potential customers used to flying in our aircraft it’s a very healthy situation for us to have flexjet as part of our portfolio so we don’t see a change in that situation et any hobbies or passions outside of work guy hachey before i got into my new job i had a lot of hobbies right now i’m sort of absorbed with the new responsibilities i’m an avid golfer so when i have a chance i do go out and golf i am also pretty fanatical about exercising so that takes up a lot of time and i make time for my children—even though they’re grown up my daughter’s a professional ballerina  so i spend some time visiting her in new york but i’ll go watch her wherever she is in the world my son is in golf school so i like to go out and get beaten up by him too et what’s your handicap guy hachey that’s not for public information—but it used to be a lot better than it is right now et any great golf course recommendations guy hachey i guess if i had one dreamgolf wish i would go to augusta national i’ve never had a chance to play that one so if there’s a customer out there that wants to invite me i’ll go et what is bombardier’s business philosophy guy hachey one thing about our company—it really has a genuine family feel and atmosphere—the grandson of the founder is now the ceo that’s the reason i came whoever is reading right now don’t hesitate to call us call me personally at   we will delight you and amaze you with our customer experience and with our products related leaders in
