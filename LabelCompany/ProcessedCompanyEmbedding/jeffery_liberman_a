‘creatures of a day’ by irvin d yalom email share via email to add a message your email facebook twitter google linkedin comments print the boston globe tweet share istock by julia m klein globe correspondent  march   is psychiatry mostly art science or hocuspocus the short answer it depends on whom you ask what condition you’re looking to treat — and what time frame you have in mind the debate two years ago over the dsm the latest iteration of the manual guiding psychiatric diagnosis treatment and insurance reimbursement suggested that our disease categories remain at least partly social constructions they are according to irvin d yalom “invented and arbitrary    a product of committee vote” in his latest collection of tales from the couch “creatures of a day” yalom argues that no manual can classify “the complexities and unpredictability of human thought and behavior” advertisement jeffrey a lieberman a former president of the american psychiatric association who chairs the psychiatry department at columbia university college of physicians and surgeons espouses a different view lauding the dsm as a victory for empiricism and psychiatric pluralism “shrinks” his lucid popular history is at once skeptical and triumphalist it shows just how far psychiatry has come from its reliance on dungeonlike asylums crude treatments such as frontal lobotomy and insulin coma therapy — and even psychoanalysis for lieberman talk therapy — especially scientificallyvalidated modalities such as aaron beck’s cognitivebehavioral therapy — retains a role psychiatry he writes must “embrace the mind and the brain simultaneously” and “touch upon fundamental questions about our identity purpose and potential” but promising research at the frontiers of neuroscience biological medicine and genetics clearly excites him more get the weekender in your inbox the globes top picks for what to see and do each weekend in boston and beyond sign up thank you for signing up sign up for more newsletters here yalom an emeritus professor of psychiatry at stanford university is more oldschool he cares about dreams free association and the therapeutic relationship for him psychiatry is an art and an existential inquiry more than a science one of his mentors was the existential psychologist rollo may “creatures of a day” is a series of moving if partly fictionalized tales illuminating yalom’s handcrafted approach to treating grief loss regret and above all encroaching mortality storytelling is in fact key to both books it seems a stretch though to claim that “shrinks” which like “creatures” uses composite characters and invented details relates an “untold story” much of its account of psychiatry’s past — “with all its rogues and charlatans its queasy treatments and ludicrous theories” — is familiar if only from hollywood images of the “snake pit” and the analyst’s couch “shrinks” is organized somewhat artificially into three sections “the story of diagnosis” “the story of treatment” and “psychiatry reborn” its introduction about a schizophrenic patient whose parents kept her from doctors telegraphs lieberman’s passion to destigmatize mental illness and help sufferers access effective treatments “her dramatic improvement” he writes of this patient “was a testament to the power of modern psychiatry” advertisement yet as recently as the s he notes “the majority of psychiatric institutions were clouded by ideology and dubious science” lieberman critiques wilhelm reich’s discredited theory of “orgones” supposedly a hidden form of energy franz mesmer’s animal magnetism walter freeman’s frontal lobotomies melanie klein’s “sexual orientation conversion therapy” and rd laing’s “existential psychiatry” for lieberman freud “stands in a class of his own simultaneously psychiatry’s greatest hero and its most calamitous rogue” his theories says lieberman embody both “prescient insights” and “missteps oversights and outright howlers” lieberman regards psychoanalytic approaches to serious illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as particularly disastrouson the other hand he admires emil kraepelin who pioneered the modern classification of mental illness and robert spitzer who helped refine it with his oversight of the empiricallybased dsmiii lieberman also celebrates the introduction of the first targeted psychoactive drugs chlorpromazine for schizophrenia imipramine for depression and lithium for bipolar disorder and looks forward to new advances in personalized psychiatric medicine quoting winston churchill he declares psychiatry to have finally reached “the end of the beginning” yalom’s stance is far more tentative still working in his s he is a student of the human condition whose literary as well as therapeutic voice mixes wonder and humility his book’s title and its epigraph is drawn from the roman emperor marcus aurelius’s “meditations” “all of us are creatures of a day    always reflect that soon you will be no one and nowhere” yalom’s parttime practice tends to draw older patients who often ask only for a session or two an elderly man with writer’s block a retired russian ballerina lamenting a lost love a doctor grieving his dead brother a former ceo unable to adjust to a retirement home two women wrestling with fatal illnesses instead of grand theories yalom offers kindness understanding selfcriticism and occasional truisms one patient recalls his smart advice to “give up the hope for a better past” he tells another “it’s always more painful to think of death when you sense you haven’t lived fully” he often works intuitively improvising “if i can create a genuine and caring environment my patients will find the help they need” he writes “often in marvelous ways i could never have predicted or even imagined” it is unexpectedly poignant to eavesdrop on their modest epiphanies creatures of a day and other tales of psychotherapy by irvin d yalombasic books  pages  shrinks the
