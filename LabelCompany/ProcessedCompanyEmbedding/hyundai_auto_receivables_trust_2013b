for these transactions and that are offset by the strength of the sponsor and the deal structures moodys has learned that for hyundai securitizations hyundai capital america does not subtract the costs associated with the repossession of vehicles from the liquidation proceeds allocated to the trust and thus does not include repossession expenses in reported net loss these costs are absorbed into corporate costs and are not compensated by the trusts given hyundais current practice of absorbing the repossession expenses consideration of these expenses does not impact historical static loss curves or increase moodys lifetime cumulative net loss cnl expectations for these transactions for all the hyundai securitizations except the b and c transactions the lifetime cnl expectations remain unchanged and range between  and  the cnl expectations for the b and c transactions were lowered to  from  as transactions are performing better than previously anticipated the upgrades resulted from the buildup of credit enhancement owing to sequential pay structures nondeclining overcollateralization and reserve accounts as well as yield supplement overcollateralization below are key performance

original pool balance moodys lifetime remaining cnl expectation and moodys aaa level expressed as a percentage of the current pool balance the aaa level is the level of credit enhancement that would be consistent with a aaa sf rating for the given asset pool performance metrics include pool factor which is the ratio of the current collateral balance and the original collateral balance at closing total credit enhancement expressed as a percentage of the outstanding collateral pool balance adjusted for ysoc which typically consists of subordination overcollateralization reserve fund and ysoc

rating for hyundai prime auto loan abs was assigned in accordance with moodys existing methodology entitled moodys global approach to rating auto loanand leasebacked abs dated  october  please note that on  march  moodys released a request for comment in which it has requested market feedback on potential revisions to its approach to assessing counterparty risks in structured finance if the revised methodology is implemented as proposed the credit ratings on hyundai prime auto loan abs are not expected to be affected please refer to moodys request for comment titled  moodys proposes revisions to its approach to assessing counterparty risks in structured finance for further details regarding the implications of the proposed methodology revisions on certain credit ratings factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings up levels of credit protection that are greater than necessary to protect investors against current expectations of loss could lead to an upgrade of the rating moodys current expectations of loss may be better than its original expectations because of lower frequency of default by the underlying obligors or appreciation in the value of the vehicles that secure the obligors promise of payment the us job market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers of performance other reasons for better performance than moodys expected include changes in servicing practices to maximize collections on the loans or refinancing opportunities that result in a prepayment of the loan down levels of credit protection that are insufficient to protect investors against current expectations of loss could lead to a downgrade of the ratings moodys current expectations of loss may be worse than its original expectations because of higher frequency of default by the underlying obligors of the loans or a deterioration in the value of the vehicles that secure the obligors promise of payment the us job market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers of performance other reasons for worse performance than moodys expected include poor servicing error on the part of transaction parties lack of transactional governance and fraud regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring for ratings issued on a program series or categoryclass of debt this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series or categoryclass of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with moodys rating practices for ratings

methodology the principal methodology used in these ratings was moodys global approach to rating auto loan and leasebacked abs published in december  please see the ratings methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of ratings up levels of credit protection that are greater than necessary to protect investors against current expectations of loss could lead to an upgrade of the rating moodys current expectations of loss may be better than its original expectations because of lower frequency of default by the underlying obligors or appreciation in the value of the vehicles that secure the obligors promise of payment the us job market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers of performance other reasons for better performance than moodys expected include changes in servicing practices to maximize collections on the loans or refinancing opportunities that result in a prepayment of the loan down levels of credit protection that are insufficient to protect investors against current expectations of loss could lead to a downgrade of the ratings moodys current expectations of loss may be worse than its original expectations because of higher frequency of default by the underlying obligors of the loans or a deterioration in the value of the vehicles that secure the obligors promise of payment the us job market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers of performance other reasons for worse performance than moodys expected include poor servicing error on the part of transaction parties lack of transactional governance and fraud regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring for ratings issued on a program series or categoryclass of debt this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series or categoryclass of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings are derived exclusively from existing ratings

regulatory disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned and in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would have affected the rating for further information please see the ratings tab on

please see the credit policy page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating up levels of credit protection that are greater than necessary to protect investors against current expectations of loss could lead to an upgrade of the rating moodys current expectations of loss may be better than its original expectations because of lower frequency of default by the underlying obligors or appreciation in the value of the vehicles that secure the obligors promise of payment the us job market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers of performance other reasons for better performance than moodys expected include changes in servicing practices to maximize collections on the loans or refinancing opportunities that result in a prepayment of the loan down levels of credit protection that are insufficient to protect investors against current expectations of loss could lead to a downgrade of the ratings moodys current expectations of loss may be worse than its original expectations because of higher frequency of default by the underlying obligors of the loans or a deterioration in the value of the vehicles that secure the obligors promise of payment the us job market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers of performance other reasons for worse performance than moodys expected include poor servicing error on the part of transaction parties lack of transactional governance and fraud regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative
