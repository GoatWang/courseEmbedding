former president of the hasty pudding club has made his love for his alma mater quite public due to his recent donation new college theater now bears the name farkas hall it’s winter but farkas is tan he has an air of monied efficiency a clipped genial tone and a sense of unadulterated selfassurance he is the kind of short man he boasts who is not intimidatedby tall women “my wife” he says “is ’”in heels” he is the kind of man whose calendar is always full prominent among these commitments is this evening’s hasty pudding man of the year event when he will be recognized as the theater’s new namesake farkas is familiar with the hasty pudding club—as an undergraduate he was its president for two years he says that it was his fondness for the club and the theatricals which call  holyoke street home that inspired the gift since his harvard days farkas has founded island capital a hugely successful real estate firm more relevant to tonight’s festivities however is abusiness enterprise he was involved with while at harvard “when i was undergraduate president the pudding was in a tremendous amount of trouble” farkas says “it was basically broke” so farkas did something that he admits has since become a major component of his lifestyle if not of his business model he threw a party “i got the copley plaza hotel to give me  bottles of champagne for a very very cheap price”he recounts “then i sold tickets basically doortodoor for a gala in honor of the hasty pudding” the party grossed about  covering the club’s operating budget for that year farkas rhapsodizes about the pudding recounting strings of facts about the organization “it’s been around since it’s the oldest college social club in the united states by far five presidents of the united states were members the hasty pudding theatricals is the thirdoldest theatrical organization in the world” the pudding is not the only club at harvard to which farkas has kept ties after graduating he was in the ad club as an undergraduate and he is rumored to have flown all of the final club’s members to las vegas “i will not comment on anything that goes on in the ad club” farkas responds to the rumor in a voice that suggests that he is accustomed to talking to reporters about things he will not comment on farkas will however confirm the rumors currently circulating that he wanted to name the theater “the farkatorium” “the farkatorium sounds to me like thunderdome” he says with a smile—though the university apparently was slightly less amused but it’s not the first time the farkas name has been a source of tension the family has long been linked to harvard—farkas’ father brother daughter nephews and cousins all attended the school but farkas says with playful matteroffactness that he was “brutally relentlessly ruthlessly” mocked for his unconventional surname “it probably formed who i am today having to overcomethat torment” he says when asked for advice he pauses for a moment then offers “harvard is just the greatest place on earth” it’s the kind of phrase that would qualify as “gushing” if he weren’t so composed “it really is” he affirms his voice building “if you’re fortunate enough to be here it’s really important that you pause and remind yourself of that” maybe that’s easy to say when your name graces a building—but there’s something about the man’s conviction that could persuade the rest of us too though farkas himself never participated in the hasty pudding’s most famed ritual he has no qualms about attending his dedication in whatever dress is necessary “if i have to do it while wearing panties and a bra i’ll do it” most read seven votes final clubs episode iii the empire strikes out harvard rescinds acceptances for at least ten students for obscene memes

from his personal and professional ties to andrew l farkas credit michael nagle for the new york times perhaps no man would become more important to andrew m cuomo’s political and personal finances than the real estate magnate andrew l farkasbut in  the two men were sworn enemiesmr cuomo then the nation’s housing secretary was pursuing a case in which mr farkas’s company had paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to a landlord mr farkas believed that his company insignia financial group was being unfairly singled out for what had been a widespread and accepted industry practiceeventually mr cuomo settled the case clearing the way for insignia to complete the sale of its apartment business for  million in  and three years later he began a friendship with mr farkas astonishing insignia’s workers who had lived through the battlethat relationship proved hugely beneficial to both menmr cuomo received hundreds of thousands of dollars for his campaigns and in a threeyear stretch between political races a job working for mr farkas that paid him more than  million advertisement continue reading the main story mr farkas having made an ally of his onetime nemesis gained new prestige as he pursued ventures from the west village to the united arab emirates continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story now as mr cuomo runs for governor on a pledge to clean up albany the relationship is drawing renewed firemr cuomo’s republican opponent carl p paladino suggests mr farkas essentially repaid mr cuomo for going easy on his company in the case with the department of housing and urban development“here’s a man who stole millions of dollars and andrew gives him a pass” mr paladino said on a radio show this weekmr cuomo brushes off the charge saying the idea that he hud officials and the justice department conspired to give mr farkas a pass in exchange for personal rewards for mr cuomo much later is preposterous and there is little evidence to support itbut the subject remains delicate enough that mr cuomo declined repeated requests to be interviewed about it and his unabashed reliance on mr farkas stands out in a time in which mr cuomo scrupulously seeks to avoid even the appearance of controversymr farkas in a telephone interview said that befriending mr cuomo back in  required overcoming his own deep suspicion and anger and he said he had taken a big role in mr cuomo’s career knowing full well how it might look“the truth is there’s a friendship here a love and a respect here and a bond that surmounts all of this stuff” mr farkas said “because there is nothing about all of this noise that is remotely inappropriate or improper” advertisement continue reading the main story mr farkas likened their  détente to the wary peacemaking of two old warriorsbut in  he and mr cuomo were more like crown princes of the housing world mr farkas the heir to the alexander’s department store fortune had spent years amassing apartment portfolios building insignia into the nation’s largest owner and manager of multifamily property mr cuomo had just taken over at hud with promises to clean up fraud and wastein a campaign with the justice department mr cuomo authorized a lawsuit against a bruce rozet a notorious hud landlord accusing him of taking kickbacks from the management company he had hired to run his buildings insignia had taken over that management company and continued the arrangement turning over onethird of its hud fees to mr rozetinsignia was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit but the allegation that it had broken the law by splitting its fees inflamed mr farkas and threatened his company “the finger was being pointed directly at farkas and the charge was led by cuomo” said a former insignia executive “it couldn’t have gotten more personal” photo andrew l farkas in  a period when he employed andrew m cuomo whom years earlier was a sworn enemy mr farkas is now finance chairman in mr cuomo’s campaign for governor credit marilynn k yeethe new york times insignia settled in  paying a total of  million — the government had alleged  million in kickbacks — and providing evidence against mr rozet the former executive said insignia feared that the government could otherwise bar it from handling hud properties a crippling blowa prosecutor in the case speaking on the condition of anonymity said insignia had received no special treatment rather hud and the justice department were less aggressive with insignia than with mr rozet because insignia had inherited the feesplitting arrangement and because of a lack of evidence that it had intended to break the lawbut mr farkas was deeply embittered toward mr cuomoit was not until the summer of  that the two men

the man again” mr farkas said but when he returned to his office he found a message from mr cuomothe two had a long intense conversation mr farkas complained that hud had mistreated his company and that the case was “terribly disruptive” and meritless mr cuomo asked to put their past differences behind them but mr farkas insisted that he also talk with insignia’s managers and directors again mr cuomo surprised him by doing so earning “mixed reviews” mr farkas said advertisement continue reading the main story but mr farkas was impressed and increasingly enamored of mr cuomo he was still new to politics and was “a little scared of it” but he began helping mr cuomo with fundraising then mr cuomo’s father former gov mario m cuomo asked him to serve as andrew’s finance chairmanmr farkas said it was he who broached their adversarial past asking “what are people going to say people love to make allegations about things are you concerned’ and they said ‘no we’ve thought about it we’re not concerned’ ”the turnabout staggered workers at insignia who bridled at requests to contribute to mr cuomo said one executive “in the beginning a lot of us on the inside had a hard time taking that relationship seriously”mr cuomo’s run for governor in  failed and the next year he found himself in the midst of a difficult divorce mr farkas having made another fortune amassing and selling insignia’s commercial real estate business was building up a new venture island capital and offered mr cuomo a jobmr cuomo’s title was vice president he helped in both bigpicture and smallbore ways offering political advice mediating disputes and counseling mr farkas on dealing with foreign governmentsin one case mr cuomo got mr farkas to listen to opponents of a luxury marina planned for the virgin islands which would have restricted access to the bay for publichousing tenants who lived across the street and he helped broker a deal in which mr farkas sold the west village houses a subsidized complex in manhattan to the tenants mr farkas said mr cuomo persuaded him to accept a lower price than he could have exacted to avoid a public battle that “would not be good for the man i wanted to be”mr cuomo did not treat his job as a sinecure colleagues and adversaries called him diligent and astute but by  eyeing a run for attorney general he began spending more time preparing for that campaign associates saidin may  a wealthier mr cuomo left island capital to campaign full time mr farkas said he agreed to serve as mr cuomo’s finance chairman again but reminded mr cuomo to expect more attacks over their adversarial past advertisement continue reading the main story “are we ok with that” mr farkas said he asked“we’re fine with it” he said mr cuomo told himmr farkas said he understood why their relationship was viewed with suspicion but he insisted his motives were pure saying he was not seeking any personal gain“i need this kind of thing like i need a hole in my head” he said “there’s nothing in this for me i do this purely out of love for the man and because the future of this state is important to my family” continue reading the main story we’re interested
