plan may not accept rollovers from certain types of plans or it may not accept roth or other aftertax money you can avoid mandatory income tax withholding with a direct rollover make sure the rollover funds don’t come to you the money should go directly from your old plan’s trustee to your new plan’s trustee if you have a roth account check with your new employer to see if the plan accepts roth rollovers if the plan does not you can roll this money into a roth ira if you choose an indirect rollover income taxes will be withheld  you can still initiate a rollover if you request a cash distribution however  of the taxable portion of your distribution is withheld for income taxes you must then roll over the money into the new plan within  days of receiving your distribution if you want to keep the tax benefits if you replace the amount withheld you can roll over your entire account value your withholding amount will be refunded by the irs when you file your taxes if you don’t replace the amount withheld it will be considered a distribution subject to taxes and possible penalties you may not be able to roll your money into your new plan right away  some employers may require a waiting period before you can roll your money into the plan your investment choices will be limited your investment choices are limited to what is offered in your new plan you’ll have to follow the rules of the new plan participating in your new plan means you’re subject to new investment exchange and withdrawal rules you can also save outside the plan participating in your employer’s plan isn’t the only way to save and receive taxdeferral benefits if you want to put away additional money for retirement an ira is another great way to save   keep your money in your old plan if you’re undecided about what to do with your retirement plan account when you leave your job keeping it where it is may be a temporary solution check with your employer to review how your plan works why keep your money where it is you will maintain your tax benefits as long as you keep your assets in the plan your account can continue to grow taxdeferred roth accounts provide the potential for taxfree distributions you will avoid taxes and penalties by not cashing out you won’t have to pay taxes or early withdrawal penalties you keep your money invested if you’re satisfied with your plan’s provider you can keep your assets in the same investments a few things to keep in mind you can’t continue to contribute because you’re no longer an employee you’re no longer eligible to make contributions to that account your investment choices will be limited your investment options are limited to what is offered in the plan the rules of the plan will still apply keeping your account in the plan means you’re still subject to its rules your ability to choose investments make exchanges between investments or make withdrawals may be restricted also you’ll generally have to take required minimum distributions rmds when you retire or reach age ½ whichever is later your balance could be cashed out or rolled into an ira if your account balance is  or less at any time after you leave your job your employer may automatically cash you out unless you elect another option within a certain time period if your balance is between  and  your balance may be rolled into an ira selected by your employer ask your benefits department about your plan’s rules   cash out your savings most financial experts advise against cashing out however withdrawing your plan balance does give you money to take care of current needs a few things to keep in mind you may have to pay federal taxes before you receive your payout your employer must withhold  of the taxable portion of your distribution for federal income taxes depending on your income tax rate you may owe even more on the taxable amount qualified withdrawals from roth accounts including earnings are taxfree only the earnings portion of nonqualified withdrawals from roth accounts is taxable withdrawals from roth accounts are taxfree if the account was established at least  years before and if you’re at least ½ years of age or if withdrawals are made because of disability or death withdrawals from your nonroth balance are generally taxable you could be subject to penalties if you’re under age ½ when you cash out you may have to pay a  early withdrawal penalty on the taxable portion of your distribution if you’re  or older when you leave your job withdrawals are penaltyfree but still taxable other exceptions may also apply you may be hit with additional taxes you may owe state and local taxes on the taxable portion of your distribution you can reduce what you owe instead of taking your entire account balance in cash consider taking a distribution for just what you need that way you avoid paying applicable taxes and penalties on the rest of your account the remaining amount can keep growing taxdeferred if you leave it in the plan or roll it into an ira or another plan roth accounts can be rolled only into roth iras or into plans that accept roth rollovers check with your tax advisor or financial professional about the specific rules for lumpsum withdrawals related products iras traditional and roth related tools spend it or save it calculator see the difference between taking a cash
