pain relief that leaves patients speechless chronic pain relief that leaves patients speechless chronic pain relief that leaves patients speechless     assess is hf therapy right for you find locate a hf therapy physician near you learn read how hf therapy is reducing pain and changing lives understanding chronic pain and how to treat it what is chronic pain chronic pain is a recurring debilitating kind of pain that lasts for three months or longer it affects roughly  billion people worldwide and is most commonly located in the back it can also affect the arms legs head and other locations the source of chronic pain is often difficult to determine it can be associated with an illness accident or even injury to nerves causing false pain signals that feel very real that’s why it’s so difficult to manage in some patients chronic pain also appears without any explanation at all chronic pain is different from acute pain which commonly results from injury or surgery and heals with time living with chronic pain the idea of living with chronic pain is more of a resignation for most patients because the pain is so restrictive to their everyday life longtime chronic pain patients often find themselves depressed withdrawn from friends and family and reliant on others for even the simplest daily activities many patients try everything from physical therapy and medications to invasive surgeries only to have their pain return or even made worse by the side effects of those treatments treatments of chronic pain many patients spend years in painful trial and error with treatments that seek a single way to manage their chronic pain but chronic pain is unique to each individual that’s why treatment needs to be tailored to the needs desires and circumstances of each patient initially physicians may recommend physical therapy and lifestyle modifications however for many patients these approaches are not adequate corrective surgery injections pain pumps nerve ablation and medications may also be prescribed although these therapies also have mixed results  another option spinal cord stimulation scs was first introduced in  it works to relieve pain by delivering mild electrical pulses to the spinal cord to mask the transmission of abnormal pain signals traveling along the spinal cord to the brain the pulses are delivered by small electrodes placed near the spinal cord that connect to a compact batterypowered generator which is implanted under the skin    in clinical trials and in practice traditional scs has demonstrated relief for leg pain however sustained relief of back pain has been uncommon    all these traditional norms were upended with the fda approval of nevro’s hf™ therapy hf therapy is the nextgeneration spinal cord stimulation device it is just as safe as traditional systems but also offers longterm relief for both back pain and leg pain it also has none of the driving or sleep restrictions typical of traditional scs what does the fda say about hf therapy in may  the us food and drug administration approved nevro’s hf therapy as a treatment for chronic pain it is the only scs system to ever receive a superiority designation from the fda for both chronic back pain and leg pain to put this new therapy to the test nevro carried out the firstever randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the relative effectiveness of hf therapy to traditional scs the study followed  patients using hf therapy or traditional scs for  months to measure how many patients responded to treatment and their levels of pain relief results from the clinical study showed that nearly twice as many patients achieved dramatic relief from back pain and leg pain with hf therapy as with traditional scs the study also demonstrated that eight out of ten patients with severe back or leg pain who used hf therapy experienced significant pain relief    finally the hf therapy patients also showed greater improvement in overall function – so these patients can more easily return to the activities they enjoyed before the pain started learn more about hf therapy’s advantages  all superiority and paresthesiafree
