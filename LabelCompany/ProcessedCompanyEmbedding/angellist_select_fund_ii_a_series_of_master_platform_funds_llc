neither of my geldings likes the taste i am having to soak mush with the pellets in it to get them to eat it so once i use up this bucket i will look for another product date published  rated  out of  by ab from complete and palatable supplement i find this supplement to be superior to others and the horses eat it date published  rated  out of  by bear from select the best great product  im using this product for my mare in foal and will continue also after foaling date published  rated  out of  by bambi from just what i was looking for according to feedxl my mare needed more copper phosphorus selenium zinc and vitamin a she is on a grainfree diet because she is sensitive to the sugars handful of grain onceday only so she only gets the nutrients that come from her hay and pasture this was the only supplement that had enough phosphorus it doesnt quite meet her needs for vitamin e so she will start getting smartprotect too she doesnt seem to notice she isnt getting any grain with her supplements if they are pelleted so she eats this just fine date published  rated  out of  by bear from select the best i am feeding this supplement per my vets reccomendation to my mare in foal
