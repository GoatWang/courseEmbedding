interestsisotope geochemistryprofessor fike is interested in the detailed working of global biogeochemical cycles their evolution over earth history and their impact on biological evolution stable isotope biogeochemistry involves the analysis and interpretation of the stable isotopic compositions of a variety of elements that make up minerals and organic matter in the modern stable isotope biogeochemistry is used to understand biological cycling within microbiallydominated environments eg microbial mats or marine sediments reconstruct largerscale ecosystem dynamics and food webs and trace the development of human agriculture eg the spread of maize domestication isotope studies of carbon and sulfur in sedimentary strata provide one of the most powerful tools for reconstructing environmental change throughout earth history particularly oxygenation events during both the paleoproterozoic  billion years ago and the late neoproterozoic    million years ago on a globalscale these isotopes provide the best estimate for global biological productivity as well as the burial of both reduced carbon organic matter and sulfur pyrite which are the two dominant factors that regulate atmospheric oxygen levels po ongoing projects include mapping the evolution of carbon and sulfur cycling during the course of the cambrian ‘explosion’ using sedimentary carbonates from the antiatlas mountains of morocco the deposition of ediacaran and phanerozoic sulfate evaporites the study of modern acidic sulfates as analogs for martian environments and the mapping of micronscale
