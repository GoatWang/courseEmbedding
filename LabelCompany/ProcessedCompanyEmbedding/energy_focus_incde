consisting of  million in commercial and  million in military maritime sales in the first quarter of  • gross profit was  million or  of net sales for the quarter compared to  million or  of net sales

loss of  million or  per diluted share in the prior year’s quarter • reduced gross inventory values by  million from december   • ended the quarter with  million in cash and no debt on the balance sheet first quarter  corporate highlights • sales from commercial and military products introduced during the last six months accounted for approximately  of first quarter revenue • achieved a quarteroverquarter operating expense reduction of  million • cash used in operations for the first quarter of  of  million was the lowest operational cash consumption for the previous four consecutive quarters • shipped the first contract award for military led lighting fixtures for new us navy ship construction • penetrated the military base installation market with first led lighting retrofit project as previously announced the company implemented a restructuring initiative during the first quarter of  with a goal of reducing annual operating costs by an estimated  million from the  levels the company’s workforce was reduced approximately  and the offices in new york new york arlington virginia and rochester minnesota were shut down accordingly during the first quarter the company recognized  million in restructuring costs principally related to severance and related costs as of march   the company had vacated the rochester leased office location but had not fully vacated the new york and arlington leased office spaces during the second quarter of  the company expects to shut down these additional office facilities and recognize additional restructuring costs of approximately  million dr ted tewksbury chairman chief executive officer and president commented “as expected we continued to experience headwinds due to excess inventory in the channel lackluster navy demand and delays in commercial projects but we are beginning to see signs that our restructuring efforts and fivepoint strategy will return the company to profitable growth first while our overall sales levels were below that of the previous quarter if we exclude the fourth quarter  order required under the distribution agreement with our distributor to the us navy our sales levels remained flat during a quarter of significant organizational restructuring activities and executive management changes second the inventory level of our us navy product in the sales channel decreased significantly during the quarter third we expanded military sales into new ship construction and n  aurora road solon oh         •      wwwenergyfocuscom        •       click to enlarge avy base installations fourth new product sales of  million or  of net revenue in the first quarter exceeded total new product sales for the full year  lastly the implementation of our restructuring plan in late february resulted in a sequential quarter over quarter reduction of operating expenses of  million and the slowing of our cash burn rate to the lowest level in four quarters” “the company recently announced the hiring of larry fallon as our senior vice president of sales and marketing in looking for a sales and marketing leader we were keenly focused on finding an individual with the skills and experience to help implement our fivepoint strategy that we announced in february larry’s experience and proven results in the led lighting controls and iot industries made him the perfect candidate to drive these strategic efforts” continued dr tewksbury a further breakdown of net sales is shown below in thousands   three months ended march      commercial products     military maritime products   total net sales           financial results net sales of  million for the first quarter of  decreased  compared to the first quarter of  due to lower sales across all our product lines net sales of our commercial products decreased  compared to the first quarter of  first quarter  commercial sales of  million represented the highest level of quarterly commercial sales during  and included approximately  million of lighting projects through our energy service company or esco partners that did not repeat at the same levels during the first quarter of  net sales of our military maritime products decreased  primarily due to the expiration of our exclusive distribution agreement that contained quarterly order commitments with our distributor for the us navy gross profit was  million or  percent of net sales for the first quarter of  compared to  million or  percent of net sales for the first quarter of  the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to lower sales unfavorably impacting our manufacturing and overhead absorption and product mix as the military maritime products sold in the first quarter of  generally had a higher standard gross margin the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily the result of lower revenue scale and a smaller percentage contribution of military maritime products which have historically had higher standard margins than commercial products in addition we increased excess inventory reserves as we continue to evaluate potential excess inventory levels as a result of our restructuring efforts we recorded restructuring expenses totaling approximately  million during the three months ended march   primarily comprised of approximately  million for severance and related benefits operating loss loss from continuing operations and net loss was  million for the quarter including a  million restructuring charge or negative  per share compared to operating loss loss from continuing operations and net loss of  million or  per share in last year’s same period  aurora road solon oh         •      wwwenergyfocuscom        •       click to enlarge at march   our cash and cash equivalents balance was  million compared to  million at december   net cash used in operating activities of  million in the first quarter of  resulted from the net loss adjusted for noncash items including depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and the adjustment to the excess inventory reserve and changes in working capital dr tewksbury concluded “while this will be a multiquarter turnaround and we have significant work ahead of us our restructuring initiatives and the implementation of our strategy during the first quarter confirm that we are making great strides in our efforts to return the energy focus to profitable growth”  business outlook given the continuing quarterly volatility in military maritime sales and the timing uncertainty in commercial sales growth it is challenging for us to provide quarterly revenue guidance at this time our focus is to control our operating costs so that we can reach our goal of returning to profitability by the end of  once our revenue achieves a more predictable growth rate we will provide further guidance earnings conference call energy focus inc will host a conference call and webcast on may   at  am et to review the
