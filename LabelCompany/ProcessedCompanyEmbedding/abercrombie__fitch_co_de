opening times    bst marketing reference this apa mla mla harvard vancouver wikipedia  words chapters line spacing single double performance assessment of abercrombie and fitch co marketing essay published rd march  last edited rd march  this essay has been submitted by a student this is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers abercrombie  fitch was founded by david t abercrombie in  under the name david t abercrombie co af handbook  the first store was located in downtown new york city at  broadway and was dedicated to selling high quality camping fishing and hunting gear to a market containing professional hunters explorers and trappers af handbook  a lawyer and camping enthusiast ezra fitch became one of the stores most devoted customers and eventually bought partnership into the business in  af handbook  in  the company became incorporated and officially known as abercrombie  fitch af handbook  the two men had radically opposing views as to how to run the company abercrombie was very conservative while fitch saw a new direction for the company eventually abercrombie resigned in  af handbook  the store began to expand and reached international recognition after fitch published a gear and clothing catalogue af handbook  expansion into other areas of the united states continued even after fitchs retirement in  after being bought and sold numerous times including once by the limited inc in  the company finally became fully independent and publicly traded in may of  af handbook  today the abercrombie  fitch co is segmented into five brands abercrombie  fitch abercrombie hollister co gilly hicks and ruehl no which comprise the   stores in five countries and five online stores one for each brand abercrombie  fitch  this year abercrombie  fitch and abercrombie each established a flagship store in milan italy and tokyo japan allowing the company to reach an international level beyond the scope of the online store the customermarket perspective abercrombie  fitch cos five subsidiaries each have a coordinated theme apparel style and logo to satisfy their individual target market abercrombie  fitch co considers their customer instore experience as the primary vehicle for communicating the spirit of each brand abercrombie  fitch  and thus invests great effort into the maintaining common elements across the brands and in all locations the company ensures that the five senses sight sound smell touch and energy abercrombie  fitch  are continually and equally experienced by all potential customers that enter the store regardless of location the way in which the senses are felt by customers is controlled by head office and enforced by instore management sight includes lighting eg generally dim with strategic spot lighting cleanliness of the store presentation of clothing fixtures and forms and instore marketing eg black and white photos of abercrombie  fitch models af manager m deffet personal communication october  sound is completely controlled by the head office satellite through a music playlist that is automatically turned on at a predetermined volume during mall hours af manager m deffet personal communication october  the playlist is always upbeat and energetic in keeping with the energy of the store and includes songs that will attract their target market smell is the fragrance that is sprayed hourly in a specific fashion onto all clothing and forms by models ie salesfloor associates af manager m deffet personal communication october  touch includes the softest richest and highest quality fabrics in their clothing af handbook  finally energy is the result of the aforementioned senses and is exemplified by the attitude and look of the associates energy is also created and maintained through the models use of standardized taglines greetings and phrases that customers receive to promote customer serviceinteraction and the stores products af manager m deffet personal communication october  the first tagline is given in the front room meant to make the customer feel welcome the minute they walk in the store such that their first impression is positive one af manager m deffet personal communication october  the second tagline is given at the cash and invites the customer to try the brands latest fragrance af manager m deffet personal communication october  the aforementioned elements are a general view of how abercrombie  fitch co creates their store experience although there is a high level of coordination among the brands each differs slightly such that it can reach its target market most effectively abercrombie  fitch sells casual luxury apparel at a premium price point to a target market that includes postsecondary students ranging from  to  years of age abercrombie  fitch  the company describes the style of their clothing as timeless and always cool abercrombie  fitch  although abercrombie  fitch has a timeless style it is responsive to current trends they incorporate elements of modern fashion into their classic american look to attract both a trendy and a classic consumer base all clothing has a moose logo consistently placed on the left side of the clothing abercrombie  fitch strives to create a classic sexy and energetic atmosphere to sell their clothing abercrombie  fitch  the instore theme is grayscale luxury the music is dance the fragrance sprayed is mens fierce and customers are welcomed into the store with the tagline hey hows it going abercrombie  fitch co created a younger sibling with the establishment of their childrens store abercrombie in july  abercrombie  fitch  maintaining the same atmosphere and classic cool look as abercrombie and fitch abercrombie targets a consumer base ranging from  to  years of age the instore theme is navy luxury the music is pop the fragrance sprayed is boys phelps and customers are welcomed into the store with the tagline hey whats going on in july  a third sister company was launched by abercrombie  fitch co hollister co abercrombie  fitch  hollister co sells southern california socal inspired clothing at a premium price point slightly lower than that of abercrombie  fitch to a market containing teenagers  to  years old abercrombie  fitch  the atmosphere is laidback and beachlike and all clothing is identified by a red seagull logo outlined in white abercrombie  fitch  today hollister co is the second most preferred teenage clothing brand jaffray  the instore theme is a beachhouse in sepia color scheme the music is rock the fragrance sprayed is mens jake and customers are welcomed into the store with the tagline whats up the fourth subsidiary ruehl no was established in september  to reach a older postgraduate consumer base ranging from  to  years of age abercrombie  fitch  ruehl no offers the same clothing and store experience as abercrombie  fitch with added sophistication and artistic flair inspired by a new york city lifestyle abercrombie  fitch  their clothing is distinguished by a french bulldog and is more upscale and expensive than all other abercrombie  fitch brands abercrombie  fitch  the instore theme is a greenwich home in a burgundy red and blue color scheme the music is dance the fragrance sprayed is mens signature and customers are welcomed into the store with the tagline the tagline hey hows it going have you checked out gilly hicks yet the latest addition to the abercrombie  fitch co assemblage of companies is their lingerie store gilly hicks nicknamed the cheeky cousin of abercrombie  fitch abercrombie  fitch  inspired by the free spirit of sydney australia gilly hiks sells cute bras and underwear and other intimate apparel to female consumer of the parent brand over the age of  abercrombie  fitch  all clothing is recognized by a koala logo and is sold at a premium price point abercrombie  fitch  the instore theme is a british colonialstyle manor in grey burgundy and sepia color scheme the music is slow pop usually pianobased the fragrance sprayed is womens la perouse and customers are welcomed into the store with the tagline hey welcome to gilly hicks were afs cheeky cousin another key factor in creating the abercrombie  fitch co store experience and image is its models all models are hired on a basis of being aspirational that is customers should walk into one their stores and want to look and dress like the models in accordance with that strategy abercrombie  fitch co depends on a passive customer that is susceptible to conform for this reason little information is collected through customer feedback since in most cases the primary objective of purchasing the clothes is not to obtain clothing but to achieve the lifestyle that comes along with wearing the clothing in addition abercrombie  fitch co does not have any forms of formal advertising or promotions eg buy one get one free and therefore adds value to the product because it is truly a luxury however customer service is still important to the company as their employee handbook states providing amazing customer service should be a top priority to all associates af handbook  in addition the return policy is very reasonable all items may be returned at any time regardless of date of purchase as long as the items are not worn and the tags and receipt is present for a full refund or without a receipt a merchandise credit may be given in addition an online store was created to give the customers the convenience of shopping from home from anywhere in the world there is a separate online store for each brand that mirrors the five senses of the instore experience sight is demonstrated through pictures of models wearing the clothing the font used the layout of the clothing in its picture the generally dimlit appearance and the overall organization of the website sound on the website is in the form of a playlist that includes all the songs that are played in the store with the option of switching between songs smell and touch cannot be incorporated into the website however all fragrances are available for purchase and the clothing remains to be of the highest quality fabrics energy is created in this way and thus customers can have a similar abercrombie  fitch co experience in the comfort of their home it is clear that the customer perspective of the company performs effectively as seen by its  average growth that the company has been experiencing over the past five years microsoft  the financial perspective in spite of its emphasis on qualitative measurements of a firms success the balanced scorecard also recognizes the importance of incorporating financial data into overall performance assessment bsci  abercrombie  fitch co the american casual luxury apparel designer and retailer has experienced a steady increase in sales for the past five years with the exception of the last year see figure  in appendix on average the companys sales have been growing at a rate of about  a year for the past  years however sales suffered a  drop in the year ending january st  see table  in appendix it is safe to assume that the drop is a result of the international financial crisis when consumers have less disposable income they are less likely to purchase premium priced items abercrombie  fitch  also last years income statement included a noncash  million unusual expense in the form of an impairment of store related assets see table  in appendix the combination of the drop in sales and the additional expenses taken on by the company last year resulted in a  million net income a  drop from s  million see table  in appendix in  the company used cash from operations to finance its growth strategy they opened up  new abercrombie  fitch store  new hollister stores  new abercrombie stores six new ruehl stores and  new gilly hicks stores abercrombie  fitchf  the balance sheet shows a strong abercrombie  fitch with approximately  billion in assets of which  billion are current and only  billion in liabilities of which  million are current see table  in appendix this results in strong key ratios demonstrating good financial health these ratios will be discussed further and analyzed with respect to ratios from competitors and average industry standards also in the  fiscal year there was an increase in inventory on hand due to the drop in sales as opposed to the decrease in inventory on hand experienced in the fiscal year  abercrombie  fitch  on january st  inventory was valued at approximately  million a  million  jump from last years  million see table  in appendix some analysts might find this statistic worrying however it may not be as dangerous as it seems firstly as mentioned earlier this observation is primarily due to a negative change in spending patterns associated with the global financial situation this is trend experienced by a majority of retailers worldwide and not just abercrombie  fitch in addition the image that the brands strive to portray is a timeless and always coolâ€¦ one af brands  meaning that the average lifespan of a piece of their attire is longer than that of a company whos image is more current and trendy because of this the small amount of left over inventory should not be a problem to move as displayed in fiscal year  prior to the onset of the financial crisis where the company experienced a  reduction in inventory see table  in appendix here is a broader look at a range of abercrombie  fitchs key financials and their implications as to where the company stands in regards to its competitors and the industry the primarily relevant ratios reported and analyzed are those pertaining to growth profitability financial condition and management efficiency table  current key financial ratios of abercrombie  fitch compared to three competitors and the industry adapted from microsoft    abercrombie  fitch american eagle outfitters gap guess industry sales growth rate  year average       gross margin  year average       net profit margin  year average       debt over equity ratio      current ratio      quick ratio      leverage ratio      inventory turnover      income per employee  usd      revenue per employee  usd      looking at each area individually will lead to more accurate conclusions and help identify problem areas and strengths along with providing explanations for certain phenomena sales growth ratio  year average  this ratio demonstrates what percentage sales have been increasing or decreasing by from year to year on average for the past  years business dictionary  abercrombie  fitchs  growth rate is significantly higher than the industry average at par with american eagle outfitters higher than competitor gap whose sales have been decreasing however significantly lower than guess these results are positive and indicate progress abercrombie  fitch is not the fastest growing of its competitors but sales are growing at a steady sustainable rate gross margin ratio  year average  this ratio express gross profit as a percentage of total revenue business dictionary  for abercrombie  fitch this ratio is  see table  indicating that goods are marked up approximately  a mark up that is nearly double that of their closest competitor american eagle outfitters and nearly four times the industry average net profit margin ratio  year average  this ratio expresses net income business dictionary  in spite of the outrageously high initial mark up the  see table  net profit margin are at par with american eagle outfitters slightly higher than guess and nearly double that of the industry the trend of a much higher gross margin and a more tempered net profit margin can be interpreted to suggest that although direct costs associated with goods sold may be relatively low the indirect costs associated with operations are higher and exhaust a larger sum of the revenue from sales debtequity ratio  a measure of a companys financial leverage calculated by dividing total liabilities by stockholders equity business dictionary  it shows what portion of equity and debt a company is using to finance its assets this demonstrates that abercrombie  fitch may not have a hard time paying off any long term debts based on the condition of the company at this time the companys competitors are all in a similar situation and are stronger than an average company in the industry in this regard this shows that they are more established larger players in the apparel retail industry this is a strong asset when applying for a longterm loan current ratio  this is a liquidity ratio that shows how capable a company is of paying off their shortterm liabilities business dictionary  calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities higher current ratio implies that the company is financially healthy and can easily reach its shortterm obligations abercrombie  fitch its competitors and the industry are all comparable and well off in this area quick ratio  a measure if how easily a company can meet its shortterm obligations using only its most liquid assets eg cash business dictionary  it is calculated by subtracting inventory from current assets and dividing the result by current liabilities basically this ratio tells us how easily a company can meet its shortterm obligations without selling their inventory again abercrombie  fitch scores well in this field along with its competitors and the industry the companys ability to pay off short termdebts with ease show strong financial condition and can help them secure short term loans and a unsecured line of credit abercrombie  fitch  inventory turnover  the number of times a companys inventory is sold and replaced over a period of time business dictionary  calculated by dividing sales by inventory abercrombie  fitchs number here is  while all competitors show an inventory turn over of over  and the industrys average is  see table  more than one and a half times that of abercrombie  fitchs as mentioned earlier abercrombie  fitchs image is vintage timeless and effortlessly cool because of this the company does not have to change styles as often as some of its competitors and it does not need to participate in extensive promotional activities like those practiced by its competitors that can quickly move inventory but can tarnish the brands premium image revenue per employee  this is a productivity and management efficiency ratio it measures sales in relation to number of employees business dictionary  it is calculated by dividing total sales by total number of employees abercrombie  fitch reported sales of  per employee significantly higher than that of gap  and guess  and slightly higher than the industrys  see table keeping in mind that abercrombie  fitchs mark up to achieve this statistic income per employee  this is also a productivity and management efficiency ratio however is measures net income after tax in relation to number of employees business dictionary  after all expenses are paid abercrombie  fitchs net income per employee is only  only a fraction of american eagle outfitters  and guesss  and significantly lower than the markets  see table  when net income per employee is compared to revenue per employee a very large change is observed in regards to where abercrombie  fitch stands in the market it goes from being one of the leaders in revenue per employee to having an extremely low result for income per employee that is approximately  lower than the industry average see table  this again goes to show that relative to other players in the apparel retail industry abercrombie  fitch has relatively high overhead costs looking at the statements in the appendix we see that abercrombie  fitch have general selling and administrative expenses close to  billion for sales of about  billion see table  in appendix more than double that of american eagle outfitters whose sales were approximately  billion see table  in appendix and more than triple guesss whose sales were approximately  billion see table  in appendix in brief conclusion abercrombie  fitchs financial condition is sound all figures reported reflect a strong sustainable business figures that suggest otherwise compared to the industry average such as inventory turnover and yearend january st  sales are justifiable the high overhead and indirect expenses can be studied and lowered to net increase pretax income however doing so without bringing down the gross margin may result in a higher taxable income the business process perspective abercrombie  fitchs business processes can be exemplified through its management processes operational processes and its supporting processes  management processes can be expressed as corporate governance a collection of policies and laws affecting the way the corporation is administered bsci  abercrombie  fitch employee relations criteria states that the company will care for its employees honestly fairly and with respect af handbook   happy associates working together in a team prove to be essential elements in the growth and success of the

look policy implemented that affects the model and impact employees which requires to represent the brand by being properly groomed and naturallooking while portraying an abercrombie  fitch style af manager m deffet personal communication october  the operational processes are the primary aspect of the value stream consisting of purchasing and manufacturing  in  abercrombie  fitch purchased merchandise from  different suppliers which are located in  different countries abercrombie  fitch   the corporations largest supplier is responsible for only  of apparel and personal care products and no other factory produces more than  of their merchandise abercrombie  fitch   consequently in a scenario of political or financial incidents this is advantageous as it poses minor disruption for the company  all of the manufacturers are required to uphold abercrombie  fitchs high quality standards in production  the distribution and merchandise inventory is monitored by two distribution centers that check quality before distributed to the retail stores by primarily one contract carrier abercrombie  fitch   abercrombie  fitch managements goal is to uphold ample merchandise in stock at retail stores  in order to balance inventory levels and stock turnover markdowns are implemented to keep their merchandise stylish with current fashion trends abercrombie  fitch   supporting processes assist in contributing to the value stream  an important process that abercrombie  fitch uses is recruitment  the company has  part time employees and  full time employees and is still focusing on recruiting and hiring more abercrombie  fitch   the managers at retail stores have a quota indicating the number of people that must be recruited in a given time period af manager m deffet personal communication october   managers who believe that a customer represents the abercrombie  fitch lifestyle will attempt to recruit them for one of the parttime positions and invite them to a group

current trends and outlook our results for the first quarter of fiscal  reflect comparable sales improvement over the prior quarter in a continued challenging promotional environment hollister our largest brand delivered an increase in comparable sales at abercrombie sales results were in line with our expectations as we continue to lay the foundation for its revitalization while we anticipate the second quarter retail environment to remain promotional and generally challenging we expect comparable sales trend improvement in the second half of the year as we gain traction from our strategic
