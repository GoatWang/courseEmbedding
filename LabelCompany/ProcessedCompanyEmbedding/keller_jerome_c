matsuura to check the performance and the results were excellent the sump was clean and the oil drained from the keller skimmer was solid oil it eliminated coolant wasteron mfacilities manager at paramount machine “…for a modest investment the two pfa units have allowed me to increase shop throughput avoid unscheduled shutdowns eliminate parts finish problems and greatly reduce labor costs for sump maintenance…”steve dpresident and founder of csi manufacturing “i have cut my waste generation from  drums per month to two drums per month since i installed the keller tko units in addition i have increased production by minimizing downtime which helps us meet our customer deadlines by removing the tramp oil my coolant is less likely to foam and filtering out the aluminum means i am less likely to plug coolant lines in my machines the keller units paid for themselves in a few months i’m glad i kept looking for the right solution to this difficult problem”peter jmanufacturing manager at stanfordville machine “the magnetic separators are working great we clean them about every  hours or so and have been very pleased with the results”jonathan saj rose manufacturing company “…the pfa
