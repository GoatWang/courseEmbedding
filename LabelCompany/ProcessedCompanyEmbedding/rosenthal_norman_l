artists included joseph beuys hans haacke klaus staeck albrecht d kp brehmer kp brehmer dieter hacker and gustav metzger whose work was to urge artists to strike for three years to bring down the art system apart from a brief visit to ireland beuys remained present in the gallery for the majority of the exhibition he engaged in conversations with the audience on how to achieve democracy sketching out his ideas onto numerous chalkboards subsequently strewn across the floor the following year in  rosenthal again worked with joachimides on the exhibition eight artists eight attitudes eight greeks

chryssa jannis kounellis pavlos lucas samaras takis and costas tsoclis sought to examine the facts of a spiritual as well as an actual immigration as director of exhibitions rosenthal famously was beaten up by keith allen and his antiestablishment friends to this day flecks of blood remain preserved beneath plexiglass on the ica office wall beneath it a title reads this is norman’s blood royal academy londonedit in  the spectator published a short polemical article rosenthal wrote called the future of the ra in it he criticised the organisation for its lack of driving philosophy it had fantastic galleries but lacked money and vision partly as a result of this article rosenthal was eventually offered a job as exhibitions secretary by then president hugh casson rosenthals first exhibition at the royal academy in  at the suggestion of bryan robertson was on the american painter robert motherwell it was followed by a major exhibition on postimpressionism in – and in  a new spirit in painting an exhibition of neoexpressionist painting cocurated with christos m joachimides and sir nicholas serota considered to be one of rosenthals greatest achievements this exhibition foregrounded the work of painters georg baselitz and anselm kiefer and set the agenda for a return to painting in the early s in  rosenthal cocurated the very controversial exhibition sensation young british artists from the saatchi collection with charles saatchi besides these two most notorious exhibitions for with which rosenthal is most readily identified he organised over thirty exhibitions ranging from art in plantagenet england – in  to anish kapoor in  for a full list see below the majority of these exhibitions were initiatives of the royal academy that travelled to museums in the united states and europe while still at the royal academy rosenthal curated a number of exhibitions in germany including zeitgeist at the martingropiusbau berlin with christos m joachimides in  metropolis again at the martingropiusbau berlin in  and nationalschätze aus deutschland von luther zum bauhaus at the bundeskunsthalle bonn in  rosenthal was notoriously unpopular with royal academicians many felt their work had been ignored by the exhibitions secretary and was only displayed in the annual summer exhibition with which rosenthal played no part i want the best exhibitions thats that rosenthal told fiona maddocks in an article for the evening standard in  ok strictly speaking all the academicians are equal he continued but its an open secret that some are more equal than others tracey emin norman foster zaha hadid david hockney gary hume anish kapoor tom phillips richard rogers the angel of the north man in an interview on bbc omnibus in  he questioned the significance of the artist john ward a royal academician and was felt to have ridiculed an elderly victor pasmore that month three academicians resigned – michael sandle who subsequently rejoined craigie aitchison and gillian ayres two cited the treatment of pasmore as one of their chief reasons for going the inclusion of myra marcus harveys contentious portrait of myra hindley in the sensation exhibition and rosenthal himself were other reasons cited in  rosenthal was nearly sacked by lawton fitt an exgoldmann sachs banker who took the role of the royal academys secretary fitt and two others sent me a fax saying my services were no longer required and i should find a solicitor rosenthal has said i did cherie blair my biggest regret is not having seen their faces when they

article details insurance broker as risk consultant magazine article risk management insurance broker as risk consultant by rosenthal norman l read preview magazine article risk management insurance broker as risk consultant by rosenthal norman l read preview article excerpt over the next ten years the role of the insurance intermediary will expand into a function that will differ in many respects from the ways we have generally looked at this business in the past the intermediary will be transformed in many ways similar to changes that have taken place in the securities industryan occurrence that is not coincidental as a consequence of this new role for insurance intermediaries there will be several significant structural changes in the insurance brokerage industry there are certain underlying presumptions about the current functioning of the commercial propertycasualty insurance industry from which i derive my views of the new role for the insurance intermediary let me enumerate these guiding principles at the outset first insurance is now thought of as only a subset of a broad range of risk management techniques for controlling loss exposures in many situations it is not the most efficacious method second the commercial insurance industry has increasingly become a worldwide business in which pools of riskbearing capital can be accessed in a highly efficient manner third the evaluation of credit risk or the potential inability of an insurer to meet its policyholder obligations has taken on a new dimension of importance in the current period due to the enormity and unpredictability of both underwriting and investment risk fourth potential loss exposures have become increasingly large in size complexity and unpredictability these exposures parallel growth in the worldwide economy continued advances in technology geographic concentration of values the increasing occurrence of weatherrelated catastrophic events and worldwide expansion of a judicial system based on contingent fees for plaintiff attorneys and finally further worldwide competitive pressures will continue to force buyers of commercial insurance to push down the distribution costs embedded in the price of the product and to foster more efficient distribution methods so what does all this mean for the insurance intermediary generally it implies that the traditional insurance broker will give way to a new breed of risk management consultant who works for an entity that looks in many ways like an investment banking firm of today put another way the added value associated with placing commodity commercial lines will become so small as to render this activity an extremely lowmargin business that isnt necessarily to argue that this activity should not be done by international brokerage firms but that it will have to be performed in a more innovative manner than is done today these developments are very similar to the changes that occurred in the institutional equity secondary trading business following the end of fixed commissions commissions for this activity have been slashed dramatically to levels that are now only pennies per share if investment banks had remained heavily dependent on the profits of their secondary equity market trading activities their profit margins would have collapsed consequently this industry was compelled to develop higher margin businesses such as mutual funds and new forms of complex securities to enter emerging securities markets and to undertake principal investments through merchant banking subsidiaries while reengineering commoditylike operations to become more efficient consequently the large international insurance brokerage firms will increasingly be compelled to expand their business into highermargin ie higher valueadded activities one noteworthy example of such diversification has been the move by major insurance intermediaries to create market capacity in lines of business that are experiencing acute shortages in certain respects this activity has become so institutionalized that brokerage clients are coming to expect that their intermediaries will play an active role in solving their coverage shortfall dilemmas rather than simply seeking out the available market capacity often on terms and conditions that are highly punitive to the insured … subscribe
