usdirections our firm our firm industry recognition our history our team important disclosure our history our company dates back to  when it was founded by timothy j grimes in the early days there were few truly independent wealth management firms and most investment advice was given by commissionbased representatives of large regional and national firms even then tim had a vision of providing objective customized advice and guidance on a fee basis to eliminate the conflict of interest that can sometimes exist with commissionable products in many ways tim was a pioneer in the industry he recognized the value in becoming a cfp® practitioner certified financial planner and earned the designation early in his career he was also an early adaptor of the discretionary fee based asset management model that has become an industry standard today kevin t grimes cfa cfp® joined his father in  and soon began building out the firm’s infrastructure with a heavy emphasis on investment management kevin’s primary focus has been leading the investment committee and serving as chief investment officer in this capacity he and his team created several successful proprietary investment strategies and they continue to cultivate new ideas to continuously offer clients a dynamic suite of investment solutions in  kevin stepped into the role of president and tim graduated to the title of founder and chairman as president kevin’s focus is the strategic vision of the firm effectively managing the talented teams and continuing to thoughtfully grow the firm the firm originally started as a family business and there are still four family members involved today but what started as a sole proprietorship over thirty years ago has evolved into the firm it is today with discretionary assets under management of over  billion over thirty employees and clients across the country the grimes family is one that identifies with the ocean and has multigenerational roots to cape cod the lighthouse in the grimes  company logo is reminiscent of the firm’s early days before voicemail everyone in the office had a lighthouse figurine and the receptionist would leave messages under the lighthouse but the image is more than that it represents the firm’s investment philosophy of trying to minimize risk while serving as a trusted guide to clients through both good and bad times home
