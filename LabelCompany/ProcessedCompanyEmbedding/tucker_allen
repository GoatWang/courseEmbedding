allentucker  get awesome home books contact ← older posts self awareness posted in positive psychology i’ve been listening to the iprocrastinate podcast and they talk a little about increasing self awareness then the other day i was thinking about how most of the coaches and athletes i know keep detailed workout logs they track each set rep weight and some go so far as to record velocity how they feel what they ate and so on  they review these logs and they know exactly what works and what doesn’t in a way this is all self awareness self awareness is knowing where we are what we’re capable of what we’re feeling and so on when we don’t have self awareness the gap between who we are and who we think we are grows as this gap grows it becomes harder to prevent and solve problems  it becomes harder to be who we want to be in the future if you’re five lbs overweight that’s much easier to address than if you’re  pounds overweight  we can address problems sooner when we are more sensitive and aware of those problems losing self awareness is one of the ways we end up  lbs over weight we disconnect our immediate behaviors with our present state because we are not fully aware of our present state  in this example eating too much is causing a decline in our health  if we don’t recognize that decline we can’t stop it before it gets much worse on the other side self awareness can reinforce positive behaviors  recognizing small improvements in our performance in the quality of our lives or in the strategies we use makes us happier  we can understand what works when we should continue  we’re better able to develop strategies for getting where we want to be this self awareness also applies to our future selves we often fail to anticipate how we might feel and behave in the future we feel anxiety over a deadline or a task that we don’t want to do even though we know we should  so we procrastinate in order to remove that anxiety if we get an accurate picture of our future selves we will see that this future version of us will have even greater stress performing under a close deadline  our future selves will have to deal with the consequences of not meeting our goals  we can see that we will still have that anxiety and that distraction or delay will only make it worse the better we understand that future self the easier it is to make good decisions today in order to make life better for our future selves as we better understand and attend to our current emotions our ability to address them with positive behaviors increases rather than simply reacting to how we feel automatically with avoidance distraction and so on what behaviors do we engage in that might decrease our self awareness  what do we do in order to distract ourselves what can we do to increase our self awareness conflicting goals posted in health our goals must compete for our willpower and resources  often one goal prevents us from achieving other goals because we don’t have the energy to do everything  we try to do too much and then we fail at everything  even when several of our goals seem to align they cause us to make assumptions that lead us to failure we can only do so much and change so much  so when we set out to make change it’s important consider how difficult a change will be and how this change affects other areas of our lives continue reading → write advice to yourself posted in motivation write advice to yourself or other people  review it regularly  edit it  refine it  it worked for marcus aurelius and it worked for bruce lee i’ve started a list of

zombie survival or you really just like multitools well all that stuff has to go somewhere and if it’s not with you well what’s the point enter the man purse i get made fun of  my little arcteryx backpack goes with me wherever i go  then someone needs something… oh you need a towel  ya i’ve got one  here you go flashlight knife need your finger reattached  let me get my bag then the man purse becomes a little bit cooler though maybe not much it does save a ton of hassle though  more importantly it gives you autonomy and self reliance continue reading → taglines and framing your message posted in business neville wrote a great blog post today on creating a slogan  you should go read it here  i wanted to expand on this a little and provide an example no one is better at taglines than politicians a few years ago i was watching a documentary called our brand is crisis  this documentary provides a behind the scenes look at the very best political strategists and how they frame their message to connect with voters one of the things they talk about is the slogan or central message  this is the same team that came up with the “hope and change” slogan that was so central to the obama campaign the idea is that we take a whole bunch of complicated issues with complicated solutions and we condense all that into a nice simple slogan or tagline  the purpose of that tagline is to provide a single idea or feeling that people can focus on so that when they think of our company they aren’t thinking about all those complications random facts or potentially negative qualities  instead they think of that one idea and if we do our homework that idea is the one thing that motivates people to accept our offer then we take that idea and we repeat it over and over again the idea is not to sound clever  clever doesn’t sell  our objective is focus so if you think about “hope and change” you’re not thinking about is this politician trustworthy do they have a track record of delivering on their promises are their views the same as mine instead this idea focuses us on our problems making us feel the pain of those problems  because it’s simple and vague any problem you have fits within this frame  this drives us to seek a solution to the discomfort we experience and erases all those other issues that might distract us a tagline example continue reading → exponential blogging – lesson  consistency posted in business anyone that’s ever heard me talk about blogging knows i hate short blog posts  most of what i do with clients is force them to write longer and more difficult blog posts there’s a problem with this though until you’ve reached a certain level of consistency this perfectionism only leads to failure just like someone new to the gym we want you to just show up every week  it doesn’t matter what you do we need you to lift something  times per week  you have to build the habit of just showing up before you worry about optimizing what you do when you’re there this is blogging perfectionism is the biggest barrier to success in blogging when you first start out until one masters writing every day and publishing a good portion of that writing they can’t get off the ground continue reading → why you shouldn’t build a new website for your next product posted in product launch i’m going to start with the exception to the rule if you are a large venture backed company willing to invest lots of time and effort into creating great websites with lots of ground breaking content or your products are assets that will likely be sold off to third parties or go public …then by all means you should create a new site for your product however most of the bloggers out there who put out their own products should be launching those products

causes the one thing that magnifies these conflicts is our minds constant desire to predict the future at least in the short term so that we may control that future where this gets us in trouble is that we try to predict the behavior of those around us and we develop expectations for how they should behave these expectations are at the root of most conflicts continue reading → ← older posts

been listening to the iprocrastinate podcast and they talk a little about increasing self awareness then the other day i was thinking about how most of the coaches and athletes i know keep detailed workout logs they track each set rep weight and some go so far as to record velocity how they feel what they ate and so on  they review these logs and they know exactly what works and what doesn’t in a way this is all self awareness self awareness is knowing where we are what we’re capable of what we’re feeling and so on when we don’t have self awareness the gap between who we are and who we think we are grows as this gap grows it becomes harder to prevent and solve problems  it becomes harder to be who we want to be in the future if you’re five lbs overweight that’s much easier to address than if you’re  pounds overweight  we can address problems sooner when we are more sensitive and aware of those problems losing self awareness is one of the ways we end up  lbs over weight we disconnect our immediate behaviors with our present state because we are not fully aware of our present state  in this example eating too much is causing a decline in our health  if we don’t recognize that decline we can’t stop it before it gets much worse on the other side self awareness can reinforce positive behaviors  recognizing small improvements in our performance in the quality of our lives or in the strategies we use makes us happier  we can understand what works when we should continue  we’re better able to develop strategies for getting where we want to be this self awareness also applies to our future selves we often fail to anticipate how we might feel and behave in the future we feel anxiety over a deadline or a task that we don’t want to do even though we know we should  so we procrastinate in order to remove that anxiety if we get an accurate picture of our future selves we will see that this future version of us will have even greater stress performing under a close deadline  our future selves will have to deal with the consequences of not meeting our goals  we can see that we will still have that anxiety and that distraction or delay will only make it worse the better we understand that future self the easier it is to make good decisions today in order to make life better for our future selves as we better understand and attend to our current emotions our ability to address them with positive behaviors increases rather than simply reacting to how we feel automatically with avoidance distraction and so on what behaviors do we engage in that might decrease our self awareness  what do we do in order to distract ourselves what can we do to increase our self awareness conflicting goals posted in health our goals must compete for our willpower and resources  often one goal prevents us from achieving other goals because we don’t have the energy to do everything  we try to do too much and then we fail at everything  even when several of our goals seem to align they cause us to make assumptions that lead us to failure we can only do so much and change so much  so when we set out to make change it’s important consider how difficult a change will be and how this change affects other areas of our lives continue reading → write advice to yourself posted in motivation write advice to yourself or other people  review it regularly  edit it  refine

expand on this a little and provide an example no one is better at taglines than politicians a few years ago i was watching a documentary called our brand is crisis  this documentary provides a behind the scenes look at the very best political strategists and how they frame their message to connect with voters one of the things they talk about is the slogan or central message  this is the same team that came up with the “hope and change” slogan that was so central to the obama campaign the idea is that we take a whole bunch of complicated issues with complicated solutions and we condense all that into a nice simple slogan or tagline  the purpose of that tagline is to provide a single idea or feeling that people can focus on so that when they think of our company they aren’t thinking about all those complications random facts or potentially negative qualities  instead they think of that one idea and if we do our homework that idea is the one thing that motivates people to accept our offer then we take that idea and we repeat it over and over again the idea is not to sound clever  clever doesn’t sell  our objective is focus so if you think about “hope and change” you’re not thinking about is this politician trustworthy do they have a track record of delivering on their promises are their views the same as mine instead this idea focuses us on our problems making us feel the pain of those problems  because it’s simple and vague any problem you have fits within this frame  this drives us to seek a solution to the discomfort we experience and erases all those other issues that might distract us a tagline example continue reading → exponential blogging – lesson  consistency posted in business anyone that’s ever heard me talk about blogging knows i hate short blog posts  most of what i do with clients is force them to write longer and more difficult blog posts there’s a problem with this though until you’ve reached a certain level of consistency this perfectionism only leads to failure just like someone new to the gym we want you to just show up every week  it doesn’t matter what you do we need you to lift something  times per week  you have to build the habit of just showing up before you worry about optimizing what you do when you’re there this is blogging perfectionism is the biggest barrier to success in blogging when you first start out

allentucker home books contact pay too much posted in money have you ever inherited something that’s really old  when you held it did you notice that it’s different than what you can buy at the store today  chances are your grandparents saved up for quite some time to buy it and that’s why it’s lasted until now often something that costs twice as much doesn’t perform twice as long it lasts ten times longer when you multiply this over a lifetime when it becomes the default rather than the exception you get more for your money people buy the cheapest stuff so they can afford to buy more with their money  but because more expensive stuff often provides more value in the long term paying more means you can actually buy more  when you buy a john deer or a snapper you don’t have to replace it every other year like that random wally world lawnmower gear high end gear lasts a lifetime  just like that old watch or tool that your grandfather passed down the stuff made by real craftsmen and engineers will be working years from now instead of rewarding copycats who make lower quality rip offs you are rewarding the real engineer who developed or perfected a product  in the long term this means we’ll have more of those real engineers and fewer garbage products the best retailer the best products and the best service providers usually guarantee your happiness for life  these products fail less yet you can get them fixed forever  i buy camping gear from rei and backcountrycom  and  years from now if i decide i don’t like a tent i can return it overpaying means getting exactly what you need often custom made to your specs not some imaginary average person at the end of the day you end up with a very few items that you deeply love rather than a house stuffed with junk that is worthless to you a year later  life is simpler appreciation most of the things we buy now are disposable  your new phone will be garbage in  years  what if we started buying things that weren’t disposable that lasted for generations  how would this impact us in the long term expensive stuff appreciates in the long term  the best guitars from  years ago are worth  times what they cost originally  this means we can get paid to own stuff we like services when you overpay you are first in line  your stuff gets made first and the other guy’s stuff gets done when there’s time  it gets rushed  many of the intangible pieces that make up the quality of a product or service go out the door when we’re getting a deal  they’re doing a favor and sometimes when we bargain people resent us what if we always sought out the best of the best  rather than hiring the guy down the street to do our marketing we go out and find the best firm in the country  won’t the best firm end up paying for itself even if it costs way more  at the same time won’t our lives be easier employees top pay attracts the best people  although freedom and recognition generally trump pure dollars for employee happiness those that consistently pay their employees less end up losing their best people employees don’t ask for raises  on the infrequent occasion that they do they’re not really asking for a raise their telling you about the new job some place else that they found which comes with a raise  it’s your job to make sure they never have a reason to look for that job often companies that can’t afford to hire the best people end up this way because they don’t hire the best people who will generate more money  if your business is struggling look at your payroll  do your employees resent you  are they making a sacrifice to work for you  it is your job to find a way to keep them thrilled to work with you and monthly pizza parties aren’t going to do it services and tipping no one cares about  unless it’s a tip or part of a meal  this is so weird to me  no one haggles over  on the price of a car but it seems that everyone needs a tip calculator to determine if they should pay  or  for a meal i usually eat at the same few restaurants all the time  they’re maybe  more expensive usually locally owned and the food doesn’t come out of a frozen premade bag before being tossed in the oven  i never tip less than  and i’m not an asshole…at restaurants i always get great service  the staff who isn’t even waiting on me comes over to say hi  they know what i’m going to order and if i forget something they know it this doesn’t happen at applebee’s or mcd’s overpaying in small ways is often not financially significant to you but it seems like a lot to someone else  over tipping makes  or  seem like a lot of money  this multiplies the value of your money by the way a mcd’s cheeseburger has about  oz of beef  if we assume that ¾ of the cost of the cheeseburger is in the beef  for a  cent burger that’s  a pound for the lowest quality beef you can buy  you’re not saving any money by buying  cent cheeseburgers changing our mindset people who constantly try to always get that great deal end up spending all their time chasing those deals and never actually get things done  i’ve seen people do this their entire lives and it is debilitating when we change your mindset from getting the best deal to getting the best quality it changes the emphasis from shopping to deciding what’s important  because we only buy quality we are forced to wait until we can afford what we really want  that wait time leads to better decisions and it forces us to make do with what we have  often making due or improvising means we can avoid buying things we don’t need thereby saving money this doesn’t always work  sometimes a cheaper product is actually better  but consider removing price as the default decision criteria my favorite pair of jeans gets worn  times more often than my other jeans  if i did away with the other jeans i could afford to buy more of those things i really love  what if all of our stuff was mind blowingly awesome even if we had way less of it   lead image courtesy

often it’s good to see it expanded on further thank you reply daniel richard says july   at  pm i used to buy s cheap bags meant for school use i was  then i could easily spend s for a few bags in a span of a few months less than a year just because they spoil easily today i spend about s on a calvin klein bag or a same amount for a vibrams … both lasted me for  years and going these gears are pretty worth the price and the aesthetics otherwise i’ll buy something at the army market we have that in singapore where the value is much higher for their durability than buying cheap goods i’m now running a couple of businesses coowner and owner while i sometimes get to do work on the side ie setup websites my rates aren’t too aggressive but i get things done at about s a day i won’t consider myself the best out of the best however people are willing to pay because they know they are going to get the results that i will be doing so for myself too overall it’s not entirely about paying too much but its the mindset shift from wasting time price haggling to understanding the true value that one can get at a price that was set as is some do come at a premium but it’s way worth it 🙂 reply john wolf says july   at  am really great stuff here allen i’ve bookmarked your site and hope to read more killer posts in the future 😉 reply brian downes says july   at  am it’s about time someone said it i really enjoyed this post reply b says july   at  am yes if you’re wealthy then you can redirect your funds to more expensive purchases to make yourself feel better meanwhile those more short on disposable income will surely get more of a lift from hunting down those bargains reply mike says july   at  am being rich isn’t the point buy fewer higher quality goods with whatever amount of money you have josh says july   at  am you can also go to an antique shop and buy an old but well made mixer etc without paying much more for a new piece of crap from target karro says july   at  am agree just a small comment there are the best deals and the best deals it is not wise to go for the cheapest item of whatever manufacturer as long as it remotely suits its purpose it is wise to select the best product you can afford – or will be able to afford within some foreseeable future if you start to save up for it – and then shop around to see if there are places that offer exactly the same thing – but for less of course the price is not the only variable here service knowhow possibility to try something out and being able to returnexchange it later – all of this adds a value this added value sometimes is worth more than these extra  or  that one overpays when shopping at the “higher end” places i have a theory and possibly this theory has been around for ages but i haven’t seen it – or searched for it so i feel i canshoud share it here’s a simple diagram on quality to price relationship buying below the red dot – you’ll essentially get a disposable item spend relatively slightly more – and you’ll get the quality product green dot is the sweet spot for everyday items going over the yellow dot where a small increase in quality requires a whole lot more money – is up to each on her own shop around the yellow dot and higher these items will last longer will serve their purpose better – and longer and in the long term you’ll end up actually spending less – as the author of the blog post has already stated going way over the yellow dot – truth be told there will be increase in quality of the item will it be worth the money will you notice the difference will it just serve as an ego booster those are the questions each has to answer for herself as there’s no right answer reply holger says july   at  am thanks for writing this down you echo my thoughts had to nod in acknowledgment the whole time reply stuart corbishley says july   at  am great piece completely justifies my expensive tastes 😀 more awesome less ‘stuff’ reply thomas grové says july   at  am great read as for  tips you buy a car once in five years but you might eat out  times a day over the course of five years that would come to  which isn’t insignificant to most people but i think your point still stands i used to be extremely frugal and exact when it came to splitting a bill and… it really ruins the experience to be so miserly i’m much happier now that i care less i also make more money so maybe that’s why reply rob nelson says july   at  pm eat out  times a day who does that i don’t even like eating out that much when traveling for work on a company expense account where i am not paying for it anyway your math doesn’t add up right you did day for one year not  years great point on letting go of small amounts i am much happier since i did that i also leave a couple of bucks a day for the maid at hotel rooms don’t wait until you checkout you could have a different maid each day my room always seems to be cleaner than it was when i checked in because of doing that interestingly if i don’t leave a note that says “tip for maid” on it they won’t touch it chris bird says july   at  pm i think you meant to use the word “cheap” instead of “frugal” cheap is paying the least amount possible regardless of value whereas frugal is looking for the highest value relative to cost so in your example if splitting the bill was a bad experience ie low value then it was more an act of being cheap not frugal not busting your chops it’s just something that i think a lot of people confuse as someone that is very frugal but not cheap – i have to make this distinction often especially to my wife anna stanton says july   at  am really really great post making me rethink a lot of my “moneysaving” ideas just one criticism sorry i can’t help it but the phrase is “make do” not “make due” httpgrammaristcomusagemakedomakedue reply tolvak says july   at  am while i mostly agree with your article it isn’t really fair to pick out applebee’s in your example mostly because i follow your same rule minimal  tip being nice to staff etc and used to frequent a local applebee’s in a smaller southern town and many of the staff their knew my favorite orders by heart and employees would come over and chat at my table if it was slow and we got to know each other well it was like a second dinner table for me when i was going through some pretty lonely times in life of course this definitely backs up your premise that paying a solid tip is worth it reply ravi says july   at  am wow i mean wow neat article i liked the line about jeans particularly reply radable says july   at  am imo it goes even further – i worry people are generally loosing sense of money money is power it’s responsibility the more you have the more you do change the world around you when you buy something you pass your money down the chain yes that’s a whole new topic too and it’s not just about food’s airmiles and fairtrade – it’s about where you choose to spend your money “what’s money for anyway to make things happen” said auntie joyce in  richard branson’s aunt before she lent him money to get out of financial trouble mind you she charged him interest apparently 🙂 reply lani says july   at  am great perspective on beef and costtwicelasttentimes that’s the kind of thinking that sets one financiall free some amount of mental friction is involved with paying hence tipping at each meal is subconsciously a painful idea one can be trained to ignore or not thikn that though reply jono says july   at  am nice sentiment the problem nowadays is finding those that actually deliver on the promise lots of things can be expensive these days but it is often branding over substance price is not an indicator of quality in itself and you need to watch out reply donny d says july   at  am less is more the longevity of quality products will blow your mind so many people do not understand why i like to wait and save up for “the best” it’s like investing your money you need to think long term reply sami says july   at  am a classic expect high traffic to this post tim ferris fb status’ link reply neil keleher says july   at  am wow that was awesome thanks for putting it so clearly reply horia dragomir says july   at  am “i’m too poor to afford something cheap” has been a guiding principle for the better part of my life even after i stopped being poor especially after also having less “stuff” gives me more time to appreciate the little “stuff” i do have — maximizing the return on investment if you want to see it like that one thing that struck a chord “i’m not an asshole…at restaurants” most of my friends know i am not a calm polite sweettongued person i am always nice to the staff i almost always leave a tip and so i’m almost always happy with service and quality of whatever i receive cheers reply harry guinness says july   at  am hey allen really great post it reminds me a bit of the captain samuel vimes ‘boots’ theory of socioeconomic unfairness from men at arms by terry pratchett “the reason that the rich were so rich vimes reasoned was because they managed to spend less money take boots for example he earned thirtyeight dollars a month plus allowances a really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars but an affordable pair of boots which were sort of ok for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out cost about ten dollars those were the kind of boots vimes always bought and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in ankhmorpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles but the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years a man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet” reply benboyer says july   at  am harryguinness nice elaboration on an already very good point i see the same concept with many of my tenants who pay more than double the price for tv’s and furniture because they are financing these things lower incomes usually equate to higher interest rates on bigger ticket items as well  cars houses etc… this kind of thing has been going on forever robert kiyosaki talks in great length about financial literacy and impact it has those who understand it versus those who don’t also i love and embrace the ‘tipping point’  the ‘tipping point’ in this post not the book by malcolm gladwell although that is an awesome book  allen  very nice job with this thanks mark stosberg says july   at  am high end gear lasts a lifetime unfortunately much of it does not the whole category of “ultralight” products are often expensive because they are optimized for performance or weight not durability think of carbon fiber road bikes macbook airs for example there are also items that are “luxury products” that are positioned as “the best that money can buy” but their price tags are far steeper than the value that they add over other options think of exotic cars and some topoftheline headphones highend gear designed for durability could be a good investment if it’s light and fast enough for you 🙂 the thinkpad tseries laptops or a workcycles brand bicycle but overall i agree with the sentiment we would do well to have fewer higher quality products that we enjoyed more than so much cheap disposable stuff reply ydmadi says july   at  pm this quality items are not a guarantee they’ll last longer although it may be more likely that they will that vintage piece of equipment still going at grandma’s place might have been built to last or it might just have been the best of the lot most items with a fashionable brand name will be overpriced i cringed when i noticed a comment with somebody claiming the ‘buy nice or buy twice’ effect on a calvin klein bag… steve says july   at  am great post think of the impact on our environment buying crap that doesn’t last has a huge impact on our earth in terms of materials shipping and disposing in landfills what gets me going is that  years ago a new appliance lasted  years  years ago it would last   years ago it would last  all in the name of creating a cheaper product now even when you want to pay more for something that lasts the option often isn’t available reply peter says july   at  am this would make complete sense if price correlated strongly with quality in my experience if the cheapest item is  then  of the  items will be of the exact same level of quality as a seller the odds of the buyer knowing the quality of your product are pretty low if you sell a  product for  with fancy packaging rather than a  product for  you make x more per sale that more than makes up for lost future sales indeed if the product lasts forever there often are no lost future sales given that i can spend a few hours researching on the internet at a few hundreds dollars of my time — a clear lose — or i can buy what’s cheapest heck in some cases the  product does turn out to be incredibly good quality reply matt says july   at  am your math is a bit off with  oz per pound at  per pound and  oz that is  for beef alone in a mcdonalds burger so assuming it is  of the cost you actually are saving money the real question is at what cost reply rob s says july   at  am yes a thousand times yes there’s a great book called the magic of thinking big by david j schwartz that talks about this too it was written in  and is just as true today as it was then here’s an excerpt i always share with people i know from the magic of thinking big by david j schwartz go first class that is an excellent rule to follow in everything you do including the goods and services you buy once to prove the unconditional truth of the gofirstclass thinking i asked a group of trainees to give one example of how they had been pennywise and poundfoolish here are some sample replies “i bought a lowpriced suit from an offbeat retailer thought i got a bargain but the suit was simply no good” “my car needed a new automatic transmission took it to an alley garage that agreed to do the job for  less than an authorized dealer the ‘new’ transmission lasted  miles and the garage wouldn’t make it right” “for months i ate at a real greasy spoon trying to save money the place wasn’t clean the food wasn’t good the service — well you couldn’t call it that – and the clientele was a bunch of downatheelers one day a fiend persuaded me to join him for lunch at one of the best restaurants in town he ordered the businessman’s lunch so i did too i was amazed at what i got good food good service good atmosphere and for just a little more than i had been paying at the greasy spoon i learned a big lesson” there were many other replies one fellow reported that he got in trouble with the bureau of internal revenue because he used a “bargain” accountant another went to a cutrate doctor and later learned he had received a completely wrong diagnosis others related the costs of going second class in home repairs hotels and other goods and services of course i’ve heard the argument many times “but i can’t afford to go first class” the simplest answer is you cannot afford to go any other way certainly in the long run going first class actually costs you less than going second class then too it’s better to have fewer things and have quality than to have many things and have junk it’s better for example to have one really good pair of shoes than to have three pairs of secondclass shoes people rate you for quality often subconsciously perhaps develop an instinct for quality it pays and it costs no more often costs less than second class ………… when i stress “respect your appearance” in training programs almost always i am asked the question “i’m sold appearance is important but how do you expect me to afford the kind of clothing that really makes me feel right and that causes others to look up to me” that question puzzles many people it plagued me for a long time but the answer is a really simple one pay twice as much and buy half as many commit this answer to memory then practice it apply it to hats suits shoes socks coats — everything you wear insofar as appearance is concerned quality is far more important than quantity when you practice this principle you’ll find that both your respect for yourself and the respect of others for you will zoom upward and you’ll find you’re actually ahead moneywise when you pay twice as much and buy half as many because  your garments will last more than twice as long because they are more than twice as good and as a rule they will show “quality” as long as they last  what you buy will stay in style longer better clothing always does  you’ll get better advice merchants selling  suits are usually much more interested in helping you find the garment that is “just right” for you than are merchants selling  suits reply brad says july   at  am well said good ain’t cheap and cheap ain’t good reply steven says july   at  am in general i agree with this however you might be taking a bit of a leap in assuming that all of these decisions are strictly money related for example with the mcdonald’s cheeseburger sure you can make your own cheeseburger for less money but that takes time and effort and knowledge part of the perk of mcdonalds and fast food in general is convenience there’s also the opportunity cost to take into consideration with the time i would have to spend going to the grocery store to buy ground beef going home shaping patties and then cooking burgers i could theoretically be making more money or even just doing something more useful with my time if i just stopped in a mcds for  minutes instead reply dickie armour says july   at  am great post really thought provoking and so true the trouble with living in this “ondemand” time of life is we all want stuff right away and often this stuff is of less quality i love the idea of aspiring to always buy the best i think it’s time for me to open a new savings account for my rolex gmtmaster ii 🙂 reply ryan says july   at  am completely agree i do still buy cheap stuff but usually out of necessity cheap is not necessarily price because i appreciate the engineering that can go into making something that is high quality and inexpensive but cheap as in poor quality even then i only buy what i feel will last me until i can afford to buy something nice buying something nice is cheaper in the long run unfortunately that upfront cost can be a barrier however i’d buy something quality used before something cheap new thank you ebay and craigslist reply dan scharch says july   at  am excellent article i think in the back of my mind we all know we can spend a bit more for quality it’s just that the pain of losing that money hurts more some say twice as much than the imagined gain of something that would last longer and accrue value did you just start this blog i’m already a fan very clean layout simple words i’m all about breakthroughs and reflective thinking thanks for the words reply mr lee says july   at  am you sir have style reply cliff huizenga says july   at  am you bring up some really excellent points what really grabbed my attention was the section on eating out at restaurants not because of the comparison to fast food places but on how there wasn’t a discussion about food shopping in general many people will eat unhealthy fast foods on a daily basis because it’s more convenient and cheaper however if people spent a little extra time and money on weekly grocery shopping runs and put in a little extra effort to buying slightly higher quality foods that spending will become an investment towards their health if someone ate fast food every day at around  per meal  meals a day they would be spending  per week at a minimum simply converting that  into shopping for fruits vegetables and other healthier alternatives can go a long way if people stopped thinking about “cost” and instead thought about “worth” we’d see some dramatic changes great post reply stephanie george says july   at  am great post reply zach says july   at  am this is very true about  years ago it started with a decent pair of shoes they lasted  years since then i’ve slowly been expanding where i buy quality it can be a bit intimidating to pay  for a watch or a pair of shoes for the first time it gets easier when you see the quality difference and instead of getting worn out it gets a nice patina also with higher quality stuff you can get it repaired instead of throwing it away for example alden shoes has a  remanufacturing program every few years send in your shoes and get them cleaned up and resoled reply gillian b says july   at  am eggbeaters you can’t buy a decent egg beater these days – i had to find this old rusted beast at a junk shop in a country town then spend an hour cleaning it up it beats egg whites to meringuelevel in less than  minutes and i used to buy whisks for  but i got sick of them rusting after  months and leaving streaks in the cream so  years ago i went to a proper kitchenprofessionalcook store and spent  on a decent one i still have it it works like a dream not a spot of rust on it i hear what you say and support it totally reply david says july   at  am i would add mobile apps to your list of things people obsess spending  on i am amazed by how some people criticize and nitpick the features of a  app… great post and a good reminder that you get what you pay for reply patrick hitches says july   at  am excellent article allen i love the idea to pay more and that seriously just aligned my perspective big time pay more love it live the best life possible it doesn’t get better than that patrick reply cari lane everett says july   at  am thank you for your insightful knowledge  the whole article rings true with me and how i view things it’s encouraged me alot  amazing advice to follow for success reply tom watkins says july   at  am great advice a work around i’ve found for paying a lot is to use craigslist goodwill and other thrift stores it’s amazing the super highquality stuff people discard like solid wood furniture or a steelcase desk from the s that has a classic look think mad men at goodwill i’ve gotten space heaters built like tanks for  affluent areas seem to be the best places to find cheap used stuff reply rochelle treister says july   at  am my favorite clothes are not the high quality highpriced brands who wants the extra time and dollar expense of cleanershandwashing and the need to avoid the use of the dryer followed by ironing give me polycotton wash and wear any day if we bought cellphones that lasted for generations we would not be able to use the functionality of new devices with greater functionality should i really carry around a cellphone that is  times heavier than the one i can buy today one that has no wifi no gps no camera why be wedded to old technology because you paid so much to buy the best you could find at the time why would i want to pay more for a cellphone that lasts  years when i know that it will be obsolete in three the same is true for an item of fashion where is the logic in this when you buy something that will outlast its usefulness you are wasting money not being frugal or wise reply laura says july   at  am my only quibble with this post is that i wouldn’t call it “overpaying” if something is worth it this concept is right on the mark though reply tom watkins says july   at  am good point rochelle my method of savings with technology is to stay away from the bleeding edge and often the leading edge too prices will be a lot cheaper then for a small drop in quality for example fry’s big electronics store recently had a sale on dell computers for  i observed that most people were passing up the deal but if you looked up the specs you could see that it was  as good as a typical  “latest  greatest” computer reply matt parker says july   at  am now that are in the final endgame for the currency system i find myself overpaying for everything food and onward the us dollar has lost almost  of its buying power since the federal reserve was created it’s not a question of paying more because since  we are also in a deflationary depression people have less money overall except the  so real things cost more money but labor’s value has plummeted no one has all this money to “overpay” for anything they are overpaying already for housing and automobiles and then paying more with interest that’s right people have overpaid already for their homes and they are overpaying with tax money for nothing but a fancy pension plan for bad government services so if people want to overpay for a cup of coffee they really can’t because the government and banks have heisted all the money they should be overpaying with silly reply foobaz says july   at  am hi i like your way of thinking but taka a new trend into account things are designed to break at some time or become in another sense obsolete this is intentional to make you buy more stuff google for planned obsolescence’ to get to know more ciao foozi reply eric says july   at  am i agree with everything in here except the tipping is a bit off any service that should be tipped for should be provided before the tip is given ie not coffee shops mcdonalds etc therefore since you already know how good the service was there is no harm in following longtime tipping etiquette which dictates a minimum of  pretax sure i have no problem with rounding and accidentally tipping more but setting the floor at  just takes the burden off of the restaurant owner to properly pay his employees it’s not a competition why all the tip creep it’s about making sure people are making an appropriate amount of money to live and being compensated properly for their efforts the same reasons we all expect to get paid at our jobs inflation means that the same  rule from  years ago is still appropriate unless we are now frequenting places that don’t pay their employees properly if that’s the case we should think about finding an ethical business instead that all said i religiously do everything else in this article and i definitely have a “nothing but the best” policy reply gary hackney says july   at  am i produce tv commercials and other videos so a big part of my work is invading a hotel with my team within minutes of pulling up i find the sharpest valet and bellman and give each of them  before they lift a finger i continually tip appropriately throughout my stay but that first  set the stage for top service when i call down for my car or pull in after a long day of shooting or ask for local recommendations i get better service than anyone the whole team knows from the first guys that “you’ll want to take care of that guy” reply elizabeth says july   at  am i kept finding myself being extremely dissatisfied buying cheaper things just go “have more” buying higher quality at less quantity has really been a more fulfilling way to go thanks for the post reply florian says july   at  am buy cheap buy twice reply alan cassinelli says july   at  am reddit has a great subreddit for this buyitforlife i highly recommend it reply chris harris  between the temples says july   at  am amen amen and amen… this is the article i wish i had written it echoes my thoughts exactly about issues surrounding cost quality and true value every day i notice the effects of people going for bottom dollar and it isn’t pretty the market goes where the people go your thoughts are brilliant and wellstated thanks for putting this out there reply adam says july   at  am great article great perspective 🙂 reply ian says july   at  am agree with the sentiment totally allan and have lived that way all my life i saved and bought a simple stainless rolex  years ago which replaces the  watches i used to buy every couple of years my job in construction used to kill them in that time i would also rather drive our  year old saab and the  year old daimler two door at the weekends than run a modern tin box although the better fuel consumption would be welcome  i still get a kick out of parking my old daimler next to a car that’s probably worth as much as a house but because it is totally anonymous my car gets the stares for next to no bucks sweet cheers ian reply ian says july   at  am ps agree with a couple of the previous comments that you do have to exercise a certain caution these days when buying high priced items in the ‘old days’ high prices reflected the actual costs of manufacture etc nowadays high prices can reflect the amount spent on advertising and paying sports stars to ‘promote’ the said item caveat emptor reply mike  homeless on wheels says july   at  am mostly good info the theory is sound i agree  with generous tipping otoh just as folks maybe shouldn’t shop for the cheapest price alone the also shouldn’t shop for the highest price either while something more expensive is often better made or comes with better service sometimes it’s just more expensive the extra money goes — guess where — somebody’s pocket as profit and they’re laughing all the way to the bank while they make you believe you’re getting value bottom line is you should ignore the price while making purchasing decisions and learn how aside from price to recognize quality because unlike “the old days” price isn’t always proportional to quality reply junk science says july   at  am range rover suvs continually rank at the low end of any quality score despite costing much more than a similar toyota dozens of more examples trivially spring to mind paying more does not assure quality you are often simply paying a social cost of a brand reply saad says july   at  am i actually disagree with most of what is written in this article while i do agree with the concept that cheaper doesn’t mean you are getting more bang for your buck but same thing with the expensive stuff i think the “goodness” of product should be measuered by the total value divided by its price i think we agree on that what we don’t agree on that expensive stuff doesn’t always mean better stuff especially with big names companies think about medicines the kroger brand and claritin have the same effective compounds since they are forced to write that down on the box it is the hardest to fake yet the kroger brand is significantly cheaper why is that is it because it is less effective no it is not but claritin name is more famous and people think it works better thus paying triple just to get the same result i do agree sometime more expensive is better for value but it is not always the case while you were criticizing people who look for cheaper you over done it by going to the slightly other extreme thank you for the article reply james says july   at  am while i agree with this i think there is a hidden danger in a world that operates like this – especially a place like the united states where the gap is increasingly widening between rich and poor i feel that there will come a time where one must pay the premium price even to get what was once considered a basic level of service i am seeing this happen in concerts for example just this past week i was at a festival where the  pass get you early access while i do believe in buying quality good and paying the fair price for them i fear a world where  buys you extra rights and access reply seth says july   at  am wow talk about nailing it straight on with this article i’ve been saying the same thing for years quality over quantity is the best policy i think the microwave culture we live in helps to keep the walmart mentality going people want things now we’re such an instant gratification society that we’re only looking at the short term cost and not the long term thanks for the great wake up call reply joel says july   at  am great article and some good responses there is a sweet spot for purchases and it is dependent upon your disposable income and your own budgeting i bought a  masticating juicer that is in the top of its class my wife’s next big purchase is to buy a high end industrial blender that will last for years we’re tired of our worn out half dead  blender we just bought a luxurystyle sqft condo for k despite the fact we could have had a regular one for k less — but would have been a lot less happy however i stay away from olive garden and coza because i don’t have the money to eat there regularly i bought my digital coax hdmi and optical cables online or from walmart because the markup is ridiculous and i don’t feel like getting ripped off and why should i pay lb for sockeye salmon in a grocery store when i can go to the meat shop and pay lb filleted that has a gorgeous deep red nearly purple color why should i pay lb for chicken in canada when i can pay  for an entire chicken by just crossing the border into washington state bc apples are still cheaper the same bottle of wine that sells for  in bc costs only  from trader joes in washington and the  bottle of rum in bc is maybe  in washington there is a time and place to spend the extra money sometimes though it’s just a ripoff of  markup for no good reason other than to put money into the pockets of investors reply earl grey says july   at  am i agree completely with everything you say whenever i have tried to save money it always ended up costing me in the long run reply brooks h says july   at  am just a tip when you retun a ten year old item to rei the staff person will know you are an utter and total jerk their generous return policy is no reason to rip them off and yes i saw this more than once when i worked there i had one woman return a pair of shoes because of a broken shoelace another woman retuned a seven year old rain shell that “does not fit anymore” which was no surprise she was way fat and the jacket must have fit her before she gained  lbs another got a full refund for her used bob stroller the kid she bought it for was standing there… years old and finally able to walk for himself stroller had a “bad tire” when we fill out return authorization i put the real reason not customer reason for return “customer too stupid to change broken shoelace” “jacket now too small for woman who got fat” best part of that job co workers were great customers sometimes great often awful a real learning experience reply kevin morgan aka fitolddog says july   at  am excellent article sorry i can’t find your name but i will i recently wrote a post along similar lines httptinyurlcomdjoma to explain how in my life generosity has really paid big dividends in many strange and unexpected ways i was once and only once reprimanded by my boss in pharma yep the billion dollar earnings guys for over tipping this was the deal  i went to a great little diner for breakfast at  and left a  tip  later that day i had a very fancy but average meal for  and tipped  which tip was reprimanded the  diner tip because i exceeded the company recommended percentage no wonder pharma is in trouble from then on until i left the company to set up my own businesses i paid all my own tips fancy or not because i didn’t want company policy determining my appreciation level that is all in the past but still interesting we create our lives by how we live them as dumbledore said to harry potter in so many words blog on my friend time for me to subscribe thanks k fitolddog reply ryan detzel says july   at  pm don’t forget services like httpwwwcustommadecom customquality is the new cheapikea… reply tim says july   at  pm i have said this for years when asked for reccomendations buy quality it will usually cost more than the cheapest item on the shelf tools quality means a lifetime of use price means lost timeincome example walmart not originally a bad company their original idea was best price on value products now best price on lower value items came to town  years ago people shopped for lower prices the co strategy was show local items and say their price our price the hidden price was custom packaging  sheet ream of paper their  sheet pack our i saw this in a friends business when customers would ask he always said please buy from them walmart however i noticed as a service even to customers that would buy large orders for less than  difference from out of state vendors they would call for a product they needed now example take out food boxes they would deliver and if a truck wasn’t available he would get in his vehicle and deliver it comercial customers carry this farther on the search for the lowest price regardless think about it this way people originally shop at walmart because they could then they shopped at walmart beacause they had to  the local merchants went out of business the ones that paid good wageshad several employeescarryed local high value productsremember the flow of money when you buy something the people that made it buy something the people that make that buy something or when you buy a quality product the mfr pays a quality wage the employee buys a service or the plant employee loses their job outsourced didn’t buy a new car lost car dealership dealership didn’t buy the new house realtor lost commission builder laid off construction workers constructionworkers sdidn’t go to moviestheater closes long way of saying quality is worth the price thank you for listening reply sean says july   at  pm i disagree with much of what you say paying more doesn’t mean better you just need to find better for things you don’t care about pay less for things that are a real investment don’t just pay more do research know what you’re buying sure if you i’ve a very large disposable income pay more for everything and hope you’re paying for quality but in our society where name seems to matter paying more is rarely buying quality there is no lazy answer like “pay more” how about care more take more time to figure things out prioritize more price doesn’t mean shit reply daniel says july   at  pm “because we only buy quality we are forced to wait until we can afford what we really want” so you’d rather walk until you can afford a ferrari reply brian says july   at  pm i read your article and instantly thought of groupon’s struggles it seems that their business model is the antithesis of your theme forging these relationships are way more worthwhile than saving an extra buck or two reply georgina says july   at  pm i don’t completely agree with the concept especially in regard to the material goods first i do not believe that just because you pay more for something that it means it is better made my retail experiences have taught me that also it depends on your care for it if you trash it which frankly i will admit i am hard on my stuff that being the case i don’t think the more expensive outlast the cheap stuff that much longer also what about the person that pays  for a pair of sunglasses and habitually looses them lastly sometimes i don’t want things to last forever styles change preferences and tastes grow and develop i can’t imagine wanting the same bedspread in  years that i have now i buy shoes at payless yes i know they will only last for  wearings but i can pay the same price for  pairs of shoes that i can now wear with anything or have one pair of shoes there is something to be said about the “disposable” product reply natalie says july   at  pm you are completely missing the point here lol what are you saying about a product that only lasts  wearings wouldn’t it be far better to have a decent pair of shoes that will last you longer if you buy a classic pair they will always be in vogue and they can be worn with anything you will be saving the earth at the same time howard says july   at  pm this was an excellent read we have been pushing quality for years and it has always felt like an uphill battle what with all the bad cheaply made products out there with the huge popularity of deal sites and overseas manufacturing to get the lowest price point people tend to lose sight of quality and value i hope the pendulum starts to swing back the other way i am going to share this article with all our showroom associates and colleagues thanks allen reply ben says july   at  pm i  agree with everything in this post except for one point i think it is very unethical to take advantage of companies like rei with generous return policies if you used a product for  years you shouldn’t return it you should buy a new one if everyone just returned things because they no longer liked them after years of use then these companies would not be able to afford their awesome return policy great blog post though reply steven ray says july   at  pm great post really good stuff to think about reply kate says july   at  pm it seems like everything is so disposable these days i prefer to find treasures in second hand shops like the salvation army or st vincent du pauls i have spruced up old qualitymade furniture that will last infinatley longer than anything from ikea and has style this in my opinion is an even better way to spend money reply ahmed says july   at  pm i don’t agree to your analysis i buy both cheap and expensive stuff everything you buy shouldn’t fall into the category of expensive it might not be worth the money this is where opportunity cost comes into play i’d graph the worth vs price in an exponential manner so if it’s a commodity that’s worth more money say a television yes i might spend the extra dollar to get a better product but if it’s lower on the worth scale based on my usage requirements and money i’d rather go for something cheaper it’s sort of a balancing act that makes it possible to spend money on expensive stuff that is worth more to you reply brandon says july   at  pm totally agree i like the phrase “buy nice or buy twice” however i don’t think this is synonymous with “overpaying” or “paying too much” to me paying too much is buying something for more than it’s worth i’m happy to spend  for a nice meal with my family but it’s hard for me to justify spending  on a meal because i know i can get high quality food for less you may pay  for a nice macbook but would you pay  that’s overpaying also sometimes even low quality items are priced much higher than good quality items it’s not all about the price you have to know what you’re getting and if it’s worth it to you reply kyle says july   at  am i’m so glad you put in words what i’ve been thinking over the last year it doesn’t matter what industry it holds true i’ve come to the conclusion that i either need to invest in quality and what i really want or i need to wait until i can afford it i’m done with buyer’s remorse and buying cheaper lower quality products and services that i didn’t want in the first place reply adam musialbright says july   at  am i can’t agree more – great article buying cheaply means buying many times the same stuff due quality or reliability issues also a cheap service is not only a terrible experience but also causes a lot of stress and cost you a lot of time – and time is money having a few good quality things instead of a house full of crap feels better makes you happier more efficient and just looks better and the best of all saves you money over time reply userul lui pește says july   at  am “instead of rewarding copycats who make lower quality rip offs you are rewarding the real engineer who developed or perfected a product in the long term this means we’ll have more of those real engineers and fewer garbage products” simplistic thinking confirmed by the multitude of positive comments the real engineer deserve credit indeed but with what price from economic prospective an agent on the market can and should by classic mba teachings set the highest price that market will bear that alone should be a good reason to regulate such situation through buying stuff from competition in order to maintain a sane reality you seem to take a lot for granted and think of ways to bring “improvements” but think also that there might be as well an equilibrium at stake reply bonnie jean says july   at  am you should only eat out the amount of times you can afford to including the tip same as buying a car you can afford i’m still with the poster people can be very cheap when determining a discretionary amount given to someone else such as a tip or donation but extravagant and even wasteful when purchasing for themselves a modern personality disorder reply julie says july   at  am i absolutely love this post i would like to respond to the folks stating that this is only for the wealthy and the others need the bargains this article is not about not buying a bargain it is about not by poorly manufactored items and a lot of them for example you can buy a nice columbia brand fleece   in july that is a bargain bargains are great the message here is to not buy   fleece in october that are flimsy and fall apart instead of going to the drive through make your own burgers buy nd hand shop ebay…still buy quality not quantity whether you shop “off the rack” not me or are a bargain hunter dingding — aim for what is well made and will last that is the message reply annika says july   at  pm yup most people are penny wise dollar foolish your post is exactly how i think now i’m actually going through this major purge in my life downsizing to what i really truly will use wear and want i’ve even gotten disgusted with myself during this process at my consumerism just wasting away my money on just stuff all the while having to work more to have the money to buy that stuff now i ask myself do i really need it if yes after really considering it then i search for the best quality out there i now think about how can i do more with less that includes finances getting slim and staying fit etc… get more work done with less time get more life out every second what can i do to live the lifestyle of my dreams but make it a reality by taking action steps everyday although i do falter sometimes on my quest i still find the way back to the road of more for less good post reply john kelly says july   at  pm i visited switzerland two years ago to interview with google everything there was horrendously expensive  ounce coffee  haircut  it got to the point where i’d try to predict how much something would cost by asking myself the question what is the price at which you would say “are you out of your mind” and that’s what it would be but you know–it didnt take long to see the value in it i don’t need three cups of coffee a day a book i’d buy and never look at for  becomes something i consider and reject at  i was more discriminating and less garbage came into my life reply marc says july   at  am i love this article thank you 🙂 unfortunately there will always be more people looking for deals than ‘paying too much’ reply karin says july   at  am my father always used to say that the poor cannot afford to buy cheap that has always stuck with me buying cheap can become very expensive as you have to replace more often reply john gaston says july   at  pm great philosophy reply benjy says july   at  am how timely that i came across this post via kottkeorg today… i spent the weekend returning products that couldn’t carry out their most basic functions properly about a year ago i purchased a multishelf metal shower caddy at a big chain store selling housewares etc and it began rusting really badly after less than a year curious what the online reviews for the product were i went to the company’s website and saw  of  reviews were star and most commented on the item rusting in a matter of a couple months who designs a product designed to go in the shower that cannot handle water and why do stores carry such patently inferior products had i shopped online instead of at the store perhaps i would have seen these reviews and comments and bought something else because we’re a bit tight financially now due to my wife being back in school we ended up returning the rusted one for a new version of the same product so no new money out of pocket… because we needed something to hold out shampoo bottles etc but we were already planning for purchasing a stainless steel one twice the price when this one invariably fails us sometime in about a year when we’ll have more income it shouldn’t be this way… if brickandmortar stores want to continue to exist and thrive they need to become the curators of the good products and stop filling their shelves with crap even if you carry  shower caddies amazon can carry  your advantage would be to carry the  that are worth buying reply jane fox says july   at  am i could’ve bought outlook  on the microsoft online store for  but i looked a little further and found the same product on ebay for  sorry looking for deals to save you over  is worth the time for me reply joe says july   at  am “just like that old watch or tool that your grandfather passed down the stuff made by real craftsmen and engineers will be working years from now” often this is simply survivor bias my fatherinlaw has an old refrigerator in the garage that’s probably  years old for every one of that model that’s left there were no doubt dozens of lemons that failed within a year reply ian says july   at  pm you’ve summed up my buying habits very nicely also applies to cars – my mil was buying crappy  cars and spending thousands to keep them on the road not to mention all the lost time for breakdowns etc convinced her to spend more once and the same car is still going strong eight years later babysitting is another area where this really works overpay and they’ll drop the cheap parents if you have a lastminute sitting job the last ones we had would even do little housecleaning around the house since we paid them so well or was it the other way ’round reply mat says july   at  pm actually while this post is of great merit i take one issue the point of paying for something is to make an assessment for how long you want something thus if you want something temporary it’s ok to pay for the cheap version but if it’s something you want to keep for a while it makes sense to pay well for well made buy for the appropriate lifespan reply paul says july   at  pm your example of snapper vs the wally world lawnmower reminded me of this – httpwwwfastcompanycommagazineopensnapperhtml the entitlement of ever cheaper consumer goods – summed up as lower prices always – isn’t compatible with decent jobs at living wages and with the expectations of the customer sure you can always find a more expensive option for just about any product is a kia or hyundai good enough or do you need a honda or a bmw levi’s or store brand timed or rolex not everyone has the same expectations or requirements everyone should decide for themselves what offers the best value what brings the most satisfaction without regret or buyers remorse reply andy tovar says july   at  pm people buy a car on average once every  years people eat at restaurants at a higher frequency than that therefore you can’t compare the  dollar analogy to this  doesn’t matter when it’s once every  years but matters if you’re eating out every single day like me just keeping it real reply matt says july   at  pm “… and  years from now if i decide i don’t like a tent i can return it” that means you didn’t buy it if you got your money back you never spent any money on it and got  years of use out of it how is that “paying too much” reply eric says july   at  am good spin on the concept of buying in bulk in this case bulk means time or rather the amount of time an item lasts i must say the mistitled “pay too much” did get me to read the article but’s it anything but paying too much it’s about paying less by paying more the hard part is knowing how long a higher quality item will last so there’s a little more voodoo than science… or just experience good article on what should be common sense in us reply jessica says july   at  am thanks for this great and timely post i’ve worked in the fashion industry for  years many of them with small designers who have partnered with mass retailers on cobranded less expensive lines that never exactly lived up to the look or quality of their highend counterparts after those experiences i rededicated myself to creating a new business of my own that’s focused on quality durability fit and classic style for women we certainly believe in buying less but better yet i agree with some replies that argue that higher prices don’t always correlate with higher quality look for products from companies like mine dobbinclothingcom that are made to last have usability and function in mind rather than luxury we use the highest end italian fabrics and produce here in the usa yet we’re able to charge under  for our garments because we skip the wholesale middleman and constantly try to be fair to the consumer with our profit margins less and better is possible but our shopping habits as a nation will have to change over time we’ve all become accustomed to deals and timelimited offers as well as to expecting low prices for basic items i’d urge shoppers to remember that there are labor costs material costs and environmental costs affiliated with every manufactured good try to find companies that pay their employees decently use great materials and are not destructive to the world at large reply freebird says july   at  pm the stuff you describe also happens to be made by american workers in american factories the stores that carry made in usa are being driven out of business by big box retailers who simply won’t sell this kind of stuff so every year the pool shrinks even in food most people don’t think through the consequences of their purchase decisions as consumers they are just as guilty as the corporations who are chasing lower wages lower taxes and “flexibility” on environmental issues reply norman says july   at  pm when you buy something really nice and expensive you are only sorry once reply barry says july   at  pm i have several issues with this “pay too much” theme now days most marketing is about brand name recognition a company may have previously produced a high quality product to establish a brand name presence and then sold the brand name to a conglomerate that cheapens the quality and milks the brand name numerous examples including the north face kodak polaroid stanley tools second is related to first most merchandise is marketed to the masses has a life style necessity or something to solve a problem that isn’t there and most consumer fall for it my best example is cookware there are a number of mass market expensive cookware however if you really want exceptional cookware you need to look for the brands that are not in the mass market all clad cookware is perfect example exceptional cookware not heavily advertised when the consumer leaves the mentality of expecting a highly marketed and expensive brand name product must be the best and really start to think about purpose and functionality then are paying for the quality they need my example of this is an exgirlfriend that insisted i buy red onions instead of white onions for a recipe when asked why the reply was ‘they are more expensive so they have to be better’ not something about red onion flavor is better for the recipe high price instead of intended purpose was the only input to the decision reply gary says july   at  am this makes me think of something my father likes to say “the quality is remembered the price forgotten” while i still remember the price i think it more means the price is insignificant if the quality is really there reply mike  homeless on wheels says july   at  pm that reminds me of another clever even if it isn’t always true saying quality is like buying oats if you want nice clean fresh oats you must pay a fair price if you can be satisfied with oats that have already been through the horse  that comes a little cheaper mitch says july   at  pm in general i agree with the ideas but it is possible to go too far sometimes if you buy the really expensive stuff you are then stuck with something that is hard to maintain because parts supplies and service are rare expensive or difficult to obtain this particularly applies to tools and automobiles one rule of thumb is to buy the best quality product that is readily available in your area steering clear of exotic items reply losthayden says july   at  pm great read my brother was giving me hell for spending  bucks on a pair of quality boots i looked in his closet and he has five pairs of  nikes buy once cry once now i have to get my wife to read this we have two blenders four sets of dishware and a crock pot still in the box thank you qvc reply brad says july   at  pm i get what the author is saying don’t always be cheap but the reasoning is all faulty i’d bet the author is young all the cheap crap your grandparents bought didn’t get passed down because it broke the only stuff left is the good stuff even still most old stuff is simply old as opposed to “classic” shops are filled with antiques nobody wants i don’t buy a new tv thinking it will last for generations in a few years there will be a new model that blows away the best one available today the people who bought the first hd tv’s have these huge cabinet sets that weight a ton and use lots of energy the biggest “problem” with nice things is you have to take really good care of them sometimes it’s worth it and sometimes you are stuck with something that you’d like to replace but can’t because it cost too much to begin with i’d love to eat off waterford crystal every day and i could afford to buy it but then i could not afford to accidently break it or replace it if my tastes changed constantly worrying about damaging your nice stuff is stressful i have a general rule that i do not buy anything i cannot afford to insure or replace if it gets damaged or lost reply sparky says july   at  am “this means we can get paid to own stuff we like” you can either get paid sell it or enjoy it keep it unless you’re renting it you can’t do both at the same time reply ray gompf says july   at  am buying cheap to save money is like stopping the clock to save time reply derrick says july   at  am i don’t know that the issue with today’s consumer is actually about the merits of quality over quantity as much as switching their mindset from constant seasonal consumption to a slower thoughtful consumption we remain conditioned with the mentality of refreshing ourselves to keep up with the jones’s we can lose the visual thrill of seeing the same qualityproduced jacket worn time after time reply mike asbury says october   at  am excellent post allen i have happily shared it reply will macadam says october   at  pm for years i have subscribed to a consumer magazine they independently test goods far too often the cheaper goods trump the ‘big brands’ in quality and obviously price also i regularly notice how even “junk” candy bars are shrinking as the price goes up mr allen you are clearly a man of integrity the same cannot be said of many householdcorporatestatus brands and that includes ‘celebrity’ endorsements bottom line make sure you are buying true quality people and not merely paying for someone’s gazillion dollar marketing bill and finally… don’t ever pay to market for someone else garments with a brand emblazoned all over it should at the very least be free reply john locke says march   at  pm you speak the truth sir you get what you pay for not only that you value things so much more when you pay the premium for them reply leave a
