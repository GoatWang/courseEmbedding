firm walton street capital  investment strategies investment approach investment strategy our philosophy our strategy our portfolio strategy single asset transactions walton street utilizes the principals’ substantial real estate experience expertise and longterm relationships in sourcing and selectively acquiring single asset investments with an emphasis on well located assets with institutional quality potential walton street will focus on three primary strategies within single asset transactions value creation walton street seeks real estate assets which have significant cash flow and residual value enhancement potential through creative and aggressive asset management including targeted capital improvements tenant leaseup opportunities and operating efficiencies value investing walton street targets the acquisition of real estate assets at a discount to their replacement cost or in some cases below their current market value larger transactions the emphasis on overseas markets from most of the major real estate opportunity investors and the capital constraints upon reits and highly leveraged investors have created a capital void for larger transactions in the us particularly for assets with significant scheduled tenant rollover andor capital improvement requirements thus larger us transactions  million and up may be more likely to provide attractive pricing today for credible buyers with identified and discretionary sources of capital strategy complex ownership situations walton street seeks opportunities to acquire real estate assets which are undervalued due to the complexity or illiquidity of the existing ownership or capital structure in such situations walton street will seek to actively work through the complexities gain control of the asset and prepare such asset for sale without the prospective risks of bankruptcy fragmented ownership or propertylevel issues strategy illiquid assets managers such as walton street who possess real estate investment and management expertise in combination with financial and corporate skills can capitalize upon unwilling owners in illiquid structures walton street will seek i passive opportunities in which the interests of an entity can be acquired at a significant discount to the underlying net asset value with the knowledge that the underlying assets are nearing their disposition and ii owners of assets or holders of interests who seek to sell in an illiquid market strategy international ventures while our primary investment focus remains in the us walton street has a demonstrated access to opportunities within global markets unlike our typical domestic investment strategy walton street seeks to access these global opportunities through experienced local partners and operators who have established longterm relationships within their markets and have access to proprietary transaction flow strategy targeted development walton street participates in selected land acquisition and development opportunities to capitalize on an imbalance between the supply and demand of space for a particular property type in specific markets which possess proven barriers to entry strategy entity recapitalizations walton street seeks to capitalize on pricing arbitrage opportunities within and between the public and private markets walton street will seek to make investments in entities which require additional capital to restructure their ownership recapitalize their portfolios fund additional acquisitions or in some cases capitalize upon the significant spread between the private net asset value of a public entity’s underlying real estate and the public entity’s share price strategy private equity platform investments walton street will consider private equity investments in experienced real estate operators or operating companies which require capital to expand or create an enterprise with a significant asset base walton street will seek to build enterprises that it cannot build efficiently on its own in areas that possess public andor private exit opportunities through i the consolidation of a fragmented asset ownership base and ii an enterprise’s leading expertise or specific industry profile contact private equity firm walton street capital  contact wsc general info contact us send us a message general info walton street capital
