defendants from seeking to enforce minnesota regulation of its service doc no  at  defendants filed a motion to dismiss under rule b doc no  and this court referred that motion to magistrate judge hildy bowbeer doc no  magistrate judge bowbeer issued a rr concluding that defendants had not established as a matter of law that charter advanced is a telecommunications service as opposed to an information service as those terms are defined by federal law the rr observed that the federal communications commission fcc has refused to issue a broadly applicable rule on the classification of voip services and that applicable law establishes that the classification is factdriven and dependent on numerous factors doc no  at  thus it remains plausible that charters service is an information service such that state regulation should be preempted id therefore the rr recommended denial of defendants motion to dismiss under rule b as resolution of the issue must be afforded a full and complete factual record id defendants now assert objections to the rr i standard of review this court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made  usc § b this court may accept reject or modify in whole or in part the findings and recommendations made by the magistrate judge id ii defendants objections to the rr in arguing that charters service is a communications service state regulation of which is permissible defendants characterize their objections as addressing matters of law subject to de novo review and contend that the issue does not involve any complex fact—bound inquiry doc no  at  a the presumption against federal preemption and the dual regulatory scheme in the telecommunications arena defendants first contend that the rr erred by ignoring the presumption against preemption and that the eighth circuit has long recognized the scheme of cooperative federalism embodied in the telecommunications act of  doc no  at  defendants argue that although the  act lifted this presumption with respect to state laws preventing competition among providers of local service in other respects the presumption still applies doc no  at  they further contend that the rr without explanation overlooks the constitutional and statutory presumptions against preemption doc no  at  and errs by omitting any reference to defendants discussion of the indicia of legislative intent to preserve the states role in regulating telecommunications id at  this highly—limited view of preemption in the telecommunications arena that defendants propose is too narrow while defendants are correct that there is a presumption against preemption that presumption is rebutted where congress expresses its intent that federal regulation supersede state law louisiana pub serv commn v fcc  us    delineating certain varieties of preemption furthermore preemption may result not only from action taken by congress a federal agency acting within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority may preempt state regulation id at  in short recognition of the presumption is simply the starting point for determining whether some particular matter of state law is in fact preempted the presumption does not dictate a conclusion of nonpreemption and here in the context of the communications act generally it is beyond dispute that federal law can and does preempt certain aspects of statelaw regulation  the dual regulatory system there can be no dispute that federal law entered the telecommunications field upon the enactment of the communications act of  and expanded its presence with the enactment of the telecommunications act of  in  congress set up a dual regulatory regime for communications services vonage ii  fccr   ¶  congress established the fcc for the purpose of regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire  usc §  the federal communications act as amended by the  act provides that chapter  of title  that is sections  through  shall apply to all interstate and foreign communication by wire  usc § a but the fcc does not have jurisdiction with respect to    regulations for or in connection with intrastate communication service    of any carrier id § b and while section b fences off from fcc reach or regulation intrastate matters—indeed including matters in connection with intrastate service louisiana pub serv commn  us at  congress has expressly provided for preemption of statelaw regulation of certain telecommunications att corp v iowa util bd  us   n  noting that with respect to matters addressed by the telecommunications act of  congress unquestionably took the regulation of local telecommunications competition away from the states sections  and b generally enact a dual regulatory system louisiana pub serv commn  us at  emphasis in original with respect to the myriad matters addressed by federal telecommunications law but such a system hardly means that the presumption is not or could not be rebutted with respect to the particular issue here similarly the scheme of cooperative federalism noted by the eighth circuit in southwestern bell tel co v connect commcns corp refers to the compromise under which state commissions may have the final say with regard to purely state law issues but if the federal courts believe a state commission is not regulating in accordance with federal policy they may bring it to heel  fd   th cir  quoting att corp v iowa util bd  us at  n  the eighth circuit decision addressed the division of authority over interconnection agreements see id at  addressing sections  and  it does not expressly address the distinction between telecommunications services and information services at issue here defendants general contention that congresss intent to preserve the states role in regulating certain telecommunications does not decide the precise issue here in sum this court need not wade into the complexities of preemption under this general scheme of cooperative federalism and the dual regulatory system because with respect to the particular issue here the fcc may preempt state regulation of information services vonage iii  fd   th cir  noting that while congress has deemed that an information service should be free from almost all federal and state regulation with respect to a telecommunications service the intrastate aspects of this service would be regulated at the state level and the interstate aspects regulated at the federal level  fcc preemption of state law regulating information services regardless of any uncertainty with respect to the division of regulatory authority regarding telecommunications in general or in other specific contexts there is simply no doubt as to federal authority here under the authority granted it by congress the fcc may prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions of chapter v of title   usc § b accord att corp v iowa util bd  us at  noting extent of fccs rulemaking authority and the fcc has issued a regulation stating that information services are not regulated under title ii of the act  cfr §  in short any state regulation of an information service conflicts with the federal policy of nonregulation vonage iii  fd at  such that any presumption against preemption is plainly rebutted the fcc itself has discussed the distribution of authority over communications services between federal and state agencies under the act as well as judicial authority that recognizes circumstances where state jurisdiction must yield to federal jurisdiction through the commissions authority to preempt state regulations that thwart the lawful exercise of federal authority over interstate communications vonage i  fccr   ¶   ¶¶  finally insofar as defendants preemption argument is simply that federal courts and agencies should not rebut the presumption against preemption cavalierly qwest corp v scott  fd   th cir  noting that preemption is not to be lightly presumed it is clear that the rr in recommending denial of defendants motion to dismiss did not conclude that federal law preempted state regulation of charter advanceds service but merely determined that it was on this current limited record plausible that federal law might do so doc no  at  b neither the federal statutory language nor the fccs interpretation of the statute dictates the conclusion as a matter of law that mpuc may regulate charters service defendants first contend that the rr erred as a matter of law because the federal statutory language—particularly several statutory definitions—and agency interpretation by the fcc compels the conclusion that charter advanceds service is subject to state regulation as a telecommunications service doc no  at  thus they claim that dismissal is warranted based on the plain language of the act alone contrary to the reports suggestion that this matter involves further complex factbound inquiry id at  simply stated their statutory argument is that charter phone plainly qualifies as a telecommunications service as a matter of law because  charter phone indisputably provides telecommunications and  telecommunications becomes a telecommunications service when it is offered directly to the public for a fee id at  emphasis added they first argue that charter phone is interconnected voip    and thus provides telecommunications because telecommunications is defined as the transmission of information without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received id at  emphasis added citing the fccs finding in paragraph  of the usf order that interconnected voip providers are providers of interstate telecommunications as interconnected voip providers provide such a transmission they then further argue that charters service offers telecommunications as it is offered to the public for a fee and as it does not matter what facilities are used such that facts surrounding the technology charter phone uses to provide its fixed interconnected voip service to consumers are irrelevant id at  defendants claim that telecommunications becomes a telecommunications service when it is offered directly to the public for a fee and here it is undisputed that charter offers charter phone directly to the public for a fee doc  at  they contend that the supreme court has stated that the definition of such service hinges solely on whether the entity offers telecommunications for a fee directly to the public id quoting national cable  telecomm assn v brand x  us    but insofar as defendants focus exclusively on whether a service is offered directly to the public for a fee they misread brand x by failing to address whether charter is offering—as that term is narrowly construed in this context—telecommunications the fact that charter advanced sells its service to the public is not controlling here rather the issue is whether charter phone is a telecommunications service or an information service each of which is defined in terms of what is offered in brand x the supreme court held that the fcc in the cable modem order had permissibly construed the statutory definitions of telecommunications service and information service in concluding that cable companies that sell broadband internet service do not provide telecommunication services as the communications act defines that term  us at  a telecommunications service is the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public    regardless of the facilities used  usc §  emphasis added in contrast an information service is the offering of a capability for generating acquiring storing transforming processing retrieving utilizing or making available information via telecommunications    but does not include any use of any such capability for the management control or operation of a telecommunications system or the management of a telecommunications service id §  emphasis added as will become clear the particular—and narrow—definition of offer in this statutory context and its difference from provide is crucial the court noted that the fcc determined based on the integrated nature of internet access and the highspeed wire used to provide internet access that cable companies providing internet access are not telecommunications providers because consumers use their cable modems not to transmit information transparently such as by using a telephone but instead to obtain internet access brand x  us at  thus cable companies offering broadband internet access do not offer telecommunications service to the end user but rather    merely use telecommunications to provide end users with cable modem service id at  as the court noted the fcc conceded that like all informationservice providers cable companies use telecommunications to provide consumers with internet service    via the highspeed wire that transmits signals to and from an end users computer but that for the fcc the question whether cable broadband internet providers offer telecommunications involved more than whether telecommunications was one necessary component of cable modem service id at  as the court explained cable companies in the broadband internet service business offer consumers an information service in the form of internet access and they do so via telecommunications §  now §  but it does not inexorably follow as a matter of ordinary language that they also offer consumers the highspeed data transmission telecommunications that is an input used to provide the service id at  it is common usage to describe what a company offers to a consumer as what the consumer perceives to be the integrated finished product even to the exclusion of discrete components that compose the product id at  thus the court concluded that the transmission component of cable modem service is sufficiently integrated with the finished service to make it reasonable to describe the two as a single integrated offering id in the telecommunications context it is at least reasonable to describe companies as not offering to consumers each discrete input that is necessary to providing and is always used in connection with a finished service id what cable companies providing cable modem service and telephone companies providing telephone service offer is internet service and telephone service respectively—the finished services though they do so using or via the discrete components composing the end product including data transmission such functionally integrated components need not be described as distinct offerings id at  as the court understood the fccs position the commission did not say that any telecommunications service that is priced or bundled with an information service is automatically unregulated under title ii the commission said that a telecommunications input used to provide an information service that is not separable from the dataprocessing capabilities of the service and is instead part and parcel of the information service and is integral to the information services other capabilities is not a telecommunications offering id at  as charter advanced contends defendants neglect that the fcc draws a distinction between providing telecommunications and offering a telecommunications service doc no  at  emphasis in original this distinction and its relevance here is clarified in the dc circuits decision in vonage holdings corp v fcc  fd  dc cir  vonage iv at issue in vonage iv was whether voip providers are required to contribute to what is known as the universal service fund usf under  usc § d one of the many obligations imposed on common carriers subject to title ii in particular the issue was whether the fcc in the usf order under review had properly determined that provide is a broader term than offer under section d every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute to the fund under the mandatory portion stated in the first sentence of section d and the fcc may in its discretion require any other provider of interstate telecommunications to contribute to the fund under its authority stated in the final sentence of section d the permissive portion id at  emphasis added the dc circuit noted that the fccs application of section d to interconnected voip providers involved two discrete decisions  that unlike the verb offer the verb provide may apply to the act of supplying a component of an integrated product and  that voip providers supply telecommunications as a component of their service id at  with respect to the first decision—the distinction between provide and offer—the court explained that because in brand x the supreme court upheld the commissions narrow interpretation of the word offer the court now faced only two issues has the commission reasonably interpreted the word provide and was it reasonable for the commission to give the word provide a different meaning than the word offer id at   the court concluded that both of the commissions determinations were reasonable noting that the commissions permissive contribution authority extends to providers of interstate telecommunications the court stated that as the commission determined the verb provide    is a different and more inclusive term than offer id at  under this definition the commission explained the verb provide is broad enough to include the act of supplying a good or service as a component of a larger integrated product id as the court further noted after concluding that a provider of telecommunications need only supply telecommunications as a component of its finished product the commission explained that voip does in fact include telecommunications as a component because the transmission    of information required by the definition of telecommunications is provided by interconnected voip services by virtue of their interconnection with the pstn public switched telephone network id and with respect to the second discrete decision that the fcc took the court upheld the fccs finding that voip providers supply telecommunications as a component of their service insofar as they supply pstn transmission itself to end users id emphasis in original in addressing certain challenges to the fccs finding the court rejected the argument that because only telecommunications and not information services may be subject to the usf contribution obligations under the act the commission erred by requiring voip providers to contribute id at  the court reasoned that although information service and telecommunications service are mutually exclusive categories it is possible that a provider of information services could also be a provider of telecommunications for the purposes of section d id at  indeed the act clearly contemplates that telecommunications may be a component of an information service id in sum brand x did not answer the question raised here but rather in conjunction with vonage iv merely frames the issue that is does charter advanced in selling charter phone to the public offer telecommunications or does it offer the capability to perform certain functions with respect to information via telecommunications—even if that information service would include telecommunications as a component and as the fcc itself has stated we observe that the critical distinction between a telecommunications service and an information service turns on what the provider is offering open internet order  fccr   ¶  in short a provider of interstate communications is not necessarily one who offers telecommunications charter advanced contends that its voip service originates and transmits calls using internet protocol ip    instead of legacy communications protocols used by traditional telephone networks and that it therefore is an information service because in order to allow subscribers to place calls to    the public switched telephone network pstn it must convert voice data between ip and time—division multiplexing tdm the protocol used for most pstn interconnections doc no  at  this ability to convert call protocols offers the capability of transforming and processing information such that charters service is an information service id at  moreover charter notes that it offers not only voice call transmission but also other service features facilitated by its use of ip and those advanced functionalities would indisputably be information services if offered separately id at  and where service features are intertwined rather than incidental charter contends that the fcc has concluded that one must classify the entire offering not each service component separately such that charters complete spectrum voice feature set renders that service an information service id in short charter advanced contends that while charter phone might provide communications as a component of its service the overall service is an information service defendants contend that the rr ignores and fails to defer to the fccs explicit conclusion in the usf order that interconnected voip—the precise service charter offers—fits within the definition of telecommunications id at   n emphasis added but the fcc found that interconnected voip providers are providers of interstate telecommunications usf order  fccr  at  ¶   emphasis added and the fact that charter advanced might provide interstate telecommunications is not the same issue as whether it was offering telecommunications as the fcc expressly noted in the usf order on which defendants rely unlike providers of interstate telecommunications services    providers of interstate telecommunications do not necessarily offer telecommunications for a fee directly to the public id ¶  in sum by gliding over the crucial distinction between offering and providing defendants attempt to ignore unresolved fact issues the court concludes that the rr did not err in stating that it remains plausible that charter advanceds voip service is an information service because the classification is factdriven and dependent on numerous factors doc no  at  indeed one of those issues is whether even if a particular service would otherwise be found to constitute an information service the telecommunications management exception precludes such classification c defendants alternative argument—that charter phone falls within the telecommunications management exception to the definition of an information system—is no more compelling in the alternative defendants contend that even if charters service generally could be deemed an information service it is nevertheless expressly and indisputably excluded from the acts definition of information service because such a service does not include any use of the capability for generating acquiring storing transforming processing retrieving utilizing or making available information via telecommunications for the management control or operation of a telecommunication system or the management of a telecommunication service doc no  at  quoting  usc §  as the fcc has explained the exception covers services that may fit within the literal reading of the information services definition but that are used to facilitate the provision of a basic telecommunications transmission service without altering the character of that service doc no  at  quoting the nonaccounting safeguards order  fccr   ¶   defendants claim that the rr improperly disregards the fccs consideration of the exception in the open internet order and that the rrs reliance instead on the nonaccounting safeguards order is misplaced doc no  at  defendants contend that the nonaccounting safeguards order has been eclipsed by subsequent fcc decisions more directly on point id at  and that the yearold nonaccounting safeguards order has been rendered irrelevant by more recent and pertinent fcc authority applying the functional approach id at  at this early juncture of the proceedings however the court need not determine which approach governs to the exclusion of the other—nor even that there is only one proper approach—as the result is the same here under either the court also notes that the fcc in the nonaccounting safeguards order stated that this proceeding is one of a series of interrelated rulemakings that collectively will implement the telephony provisions of the  act  fccr   ¶  emphasis added and as the rr stated the court does not disagree with defendants that the functional approach to classification may be employed here doc no  at   analysis under the nonaccounting safeguards order as the rr explained the fcc has identified three categories of protocol processing services that fall within the telecommunications systems management exception  services involving communications between an end user and the network itself eg for initiation routing and termination of calls rather than between or among users  protocol processing in connection with the introduction of a new basic network technology which requires protocol conversion to maintain compatibility with existing cpe and  services involving internetworking conversions taking place solely within the carriers network to facilitate provision of a basic network service that result in no net conversion to the end user doc no  at  quoting nonaccounting safeguards order  fccr  as amended  fccr   ¶  the rr noted that defendants had not discussed these categories or explained into which category charter advanceds service would fall but nevertheless concluded that none of the categories apply id at  defendants now take issue with the rrs discussion of the second and third categories because the rr fails to recognize that the protocol processing and conversion alleged to be included in charter phone    is used in connection with new basic network technology the second category or for internetworking the third category doc no  at  they assert that charters alleged protocol processing and conversion result in no net conversion to the end user because evaluated endtoend any processing or conversion occurs solely on charter phones network charter phones protocol processing and conversion are accordingly employed merely to facilitate provision of an overall basic service id the rr rejected the application of the second category of the exception because it concerns only conversions to maintain compatibility with existing cpe customer premises equipment when new basic network technology is introduced whereas charter advanced is not converting call protocols for such a purpose but rather is providing new cpe that allows it to offer its subscribers additional ipbased services doc no  at  charter advanced claims that it does not rely on any protocol conversion between a consumers home wiring and the modem used to access spectrum voice but rather relies on the distinct protocol conversion that takes place between charters network and the public switched telephone network doc no  at  emphasis in original in short because the issue is one of contested fact the court may not conclude that the second category of the exception applies here so as to preclude charter phone from being an information service and with respect to the third category the rr stated that unlike the format of service at issue in the att order which concerned a tdm to ip to tdm conversion charters service is ip to tdm such that here there is a net protocol conversion doc no  at  because charters service is interconnected—that is it also allows communications with traditional telephone networks see supra note the rr explained it offers a net protocol conversion from ip to tdm or from tdm to ip id at  as the complaint alleges in order for subscribers of charters service to communicate with users of traditional telephone service calls must be converted from ip to tdm and vice versa doc no  ¶  defendants fail to explain how their characterization of this service is factually accurate despite the allegations of the complaint thus they also fail to show that the reasoning of the rr was in error as the rr correctly observes the fcc in that order emphasized that our decision is limited to the type of service att provided an interexchange service that  uses ordinary customer premises equipment cpe with no enhanced functionality  originates and terminates on the public switched telephone network pstn and  undergoes no net protocol conversion and provides no enhanced functionality to users due to the providers use of ip technology att order  fccr   ¶  the rr stated that charters service meets none of the criteria described by the fcc doc no  at  even assuming that defendants are contending that the rr erred as a matter of law by concluding that none of the categories apply the court finds that these issues raise questions of fact such that it can not sustain defendants objection which seeks a finding that one or more of the categories apply as a matter of law so as to categorize charter phone as falling within the telecommunications management exception and thus preclude the service from being an information service indeed defendants contend that resolution as a matter of law of the issue of protocol conversion is premature and incorrect doc no  at  n claiming there is a contested issue of fact on the issue but that contention hardly serves to support their general claim that the telecommunications management exception necessarily applies here as a matter of law  analysis under the functional approach noting that this exception is a codification of the functional approach to classification—which classifies a service based on what is functionally offered to the end user—defendants contend that the rr fails to apply the open internet order the connect america order and the universal service report doc no  at   open internet order in contending that the open internet order is controlling here to the exclusion of the nonaccounting safeguards order defendants argue that the fcc determined that certain capabilities fall within the    exception not because they are offered as part of a broadband internet access service but instead because these capabilities are incidental to and do not alter the fundamental character of the underlying telecommunication service doc no  at  defendants contend that the fccs reasoning with respect to the capabilities at issue in the open internet order also applies here with respect to charter phone because charter phones features only trivially affect  consumers ability to convey and receive information using the call or they are separate offerings that are not inextricably integrated with the service or both id quoting open internet order as alleged in the complaint in addition to allowing voice services to be provided over broadband cable and internet facilities charter advanceds use of ip within its network also allows it to offer numerous advanced communications features to its subscribers doc no  ¶  specifically because the voice signals in charter advanceds interconnected voip service are already formatted as ip packets and traverse ipbased equipment within charters network charter advanced can easily and seamlessly integrate internetbased features into its service offering for instance charter advanced is able to offer an online web portal ie a website accessible to charter users over any internet connection that integrates subscribers voice calling features with their email accounts and other features of charters highspeed internet and cable video offerings offer subscribers via the same web portal access to their voicemails as both electronic audio files and automatically transcribed to text as well as display caller id information for incoming calls on subscribers television screens id but defendants attempted analogy to the open internet order assumes too much in the open internet order the fcc first found that broadband internet access service is a telecommunications service  fccr   ¶  specifically the fcc found that what such service providers offer are separate services that are best characterized as  a broadband internet service that is a telecommunications service and  addon applications content and services that are generally information services id at  ¶  in addition we find that broadband internet access service is today sufficiently independent of these information services such as email and online storage that it is a separate offering id at  ¶  here however there has been no fcc determination that charters service is like broadband internet access service a telecommunications service nor has there been any determination that any additional capabilities charter advanced provides are a separate offering the fcc further found that domain name service dns and caching when provided with broadband internet access service fit squarely within the telecommunications management exception to the definition of an information service thus when provided with broadband internet access services these integrated services do not convert broadband internet access services into an information service id again there has been no determination that charters additional capabilities are analogous to dns and caching in addition the court notes that the fcc then separately determined that we further find that broadband internet access service is not an information service id at  ¶  to the extent that broadband internet access service is offered along with some capabilities that would otherwise fall within the information service definition they do not turn broadband internet access service into a functionally integrated information service to the contrary we find these capabilities either fall within the telecommunications systems management exception or are separate offerings that are not inextricably integrated with broadband internet access service or both id no such comparable findings have been made here nor should they on a motion to dismiss usf order with respect to the usf order—which required providers of interconnected voip services    to contribute to the usf—defendants argue that because that order addressed section  contributions made by a telecommunications carrier defined as a provider of telecommunications services the order is not only relevant to the classification question before this court but mandates judgment in their favor doc no  at  citing  usc §§  d granted section d provides that every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute to a fund established by the commission  usc § d emphasis added but the fcc was not addressing the mandatory obligation of that provision rather it based its decision on the permissive authority to require in the fccs discretion any other provider of interstate telecommunications to contribute    if the public interest so requires id § d emphasis added and as explained above see supra section iib there is a difference between provide and offer and the classification question before this court is whether charter advanceds service offers telecommunications in short although charter advanced might be providing interstate telecommunications the fccs ruling that such voip providers must contribute does not determine that charter phone is an offering of telecommunications such that it provides interstate telecommunications services in fact the usf order on which defendants rely itself confirms this understanding thereby largely undercutting their argument here as that order stated the fcc requires providers of interconnected voip services    to contribute to the federal usf  fccr   ¶  and to the extent interconnected voip services are telecommunications services they are of course subject to the mandatory contribution requirement of section d id emphasis added that authority extends to every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services  usc § d but the commission has not yet classified interconnected voip services as telecommunications services or information services under the definitions of the act again here we do not classify these services  fccr   ¶  accordingly the fcc clarified that we find that interconnected voip providers are providers of interstate telecommunications under section d under the fccs permissive authority id at  ¶  that authority in contrast extends to any other provider of interstate telecommunications  usc § d in sum while interconnected voip providers are providers of interstate telecommunications that finding did compel any conclusion that such providers are providers of interstate telecommunications services so as to subject them to mandatory contributions as the fcc expressly clarified unlike providers of interstate telecommunications services    providers of interstate telecommunications do not necessarily offer telecommunications for a fee directly to the public because provide is a different and more inclusive term than offer id ¶¶   indeed the dc circuits decision in vonage iv—which reviewed and upheld the usf order in relevant part—clarified that a provider of telecommunications need only supply telecommunications as a component of its finished product  fd   dc cir  vacating the usf order in part in addition the fcc has stated that internet access like all information services is provided via telecommunications universal service report  fccr  at ¶  emphasis added but the fact that information services are provided via telecommunications does not render the information services an offering of telecommunications services because the fcc has maintained that congress intended telecommunications service and information service to refer to separate categories of services id ¶  accord id ¶  we conclude as the commission did in the universal service order that the categories of telecommunications service and information service in the  act are mutually exclusive we find generally    that congress intended to maintain a regime in which information service providers are not subject to regulation as common carriers merely because they provide their services via telecommunications id ¶  universal service report regarding the universal service report defendants assert that the report states that the protocol processing that takes place incident to phonetophone ip telephony does not affect the services classification    because it results in no net protocol conversion to the end user doc no  at  quoting universal service report  fccr  ¶  they thus dispute the rrs conclusion that they misstate the fccs finding as to phonetophone ip telephony because the fcc purportedly concluded as a matter of law that phonetophone ip telephony is a no net protocol conversion id at  the rr noted that the fcc stated in full the regulatory classification of protocol processing is significant to the provision of universal service only to the extent that it affects the appropriate classification of internet access service and ip telephony we find however for the reasons explained below that internet access services are appropriately classed as information services without regard to our treatment of protocol processing doc no  at  the rr thus stated that contrary to defendants position the regulatory classification of protocol processing is significant when it affects the classification of internet access service and ip telephony protocol processing is not significant to    classifying internet access services however because such services are properly classified as information services without regard to protocol processing id emphasis in original the rr thus discloses no error on this particular point the issue before the fcc was whether transmission services incorporating protocol processing should be treated as telecommunications services or information services universal service report  fccr  ¶  the fcc noted that some had argued based on the legislative history that the fact that a service involves protocol processing    should not lead to its classification as an information service but that the nonaccounting safeguards order concluded that those protocol processing services that had qualified as enhanced should be treated as information services but that certain protocol processing services that result in no net protocol conversion to the end user are classified as basic services such that they are deemed telecommunications services id ¶¶  the fcc did not resolve the issue however because it lacked an adequate basis in the record to do so id ¶  and it explained that it need not do so to resolve the issues at hand because internet access services are appropriately classed as information services without regard to our treatment of protocol processing id here the issue is not one of internet access service but rather the classification of charter phone and the universal service report did not rule on that the fcc noted that it would consider the regulatory status of various forms of phonetophone ip telephony service and the record currently before it suggests that certain of these services lack the characteristics that would render them information services and that they instead bear the characteristics of telecommunications services id ¶  emphasis added but the fcc stated that it did not believe it is appropriate to make any definitive pronouncements in the absence of a more complete record focused on individual service offerings id the rr noted the fcc adopted a functional approach to determine when a hybrid service—that is one that offers not only the capability for performing certain actions with respect to information via telecommunications but also as an inseparable part of that service transmits information supplied or requested by the user—is an information service or a telecommunications service doc no  at  and the classification of a telecommunications service depends on the nature of the service being offered to customer id quoting  fccr  at ¶  it further noted that it did not disagree with defendants that the functional approach to classification may be employed here id but if that approach were applied here the service would seem to be an information service because the service offers more than the mere transmission of telecommunications it offers enhanced functionality id at  this court concludes that the rr did not err in its treatment of the usf order because the fccs discussion pertains to the obligation imposed by section  on a provider of interstate telecommunications not an entity that is offering telecommunications so as to be a telecommunications service  conclusion in sum the court rejects defendants argument that the nonaccounting safeguards order is irrelevant here moreover whatever fcc ruling or rulings are applicable there is no basis to conclude now as a matter of law that charter phone necessarily falls within the telecommunications management exception that issue is simply too fact dependent c the impossibility exception defendants argue that the impossibility exception—under which state regulation is preempted if a particular telecommunications service can not be separated into interstate communications which are governed by federal law and intrastate communications which properly may be regulated also by state law—does not apply because charters service has the capability of determining the geographic location of customers calls doc no  at  as the eighth circuit has explained under the impossibility exception the fcc may preempt all state regulation of services which would otherwise be subject to dual control if it is impossible or impractical to separate the services interstate and intrastate components and the state regulation interferes with valid federal rules or policies vonage holdings corp v nebraska pub serv commn  fd   th cir  preempting state regulation of nomadic interconnected voip service after reviewing the cited authorities the rr stated that one cannot conclude as a matter of law on the limited record presented by defendants motion to dismiss that charted advanced would be foreclosed from relying on the impossibility exception simply because it offers a fixed rather than a nomadic voip service doc no  at  as the rr explained the complaint alleges certain facts regarding the nature of charter advanceds provision of a voip service over a broadband internetcapable cable and that taking these allegations as true it is plausible the impossibility exception could apply id at  in vonage ii the fcc concluded that the service at issue there provided voice over internet protocol voip service and other communications capabilities such that the commission could not separate the interstate from the intrastate communications  fccr   ¶   the service at issue was nomadic—customers could access the service via a broadband connection provided by another entity any where in the world where they can find a broadband connection to the internet id at  ¶  characterizing the service at issue as fully portable the fcc further stated that to the extent that other voip services are not the same as vonages but share similar basic characteristics we believe it highly unlikely that the commission would fail to preempt state regulation of those services to the same extent id at  ¶  defendants however contend that the usf order repudiates the vonage ii dicta charter seizes on on which the rr relied rather than the usf order doc no  at  citing doc no  at  this court does not understand the usf order to negate the vonage ii decision as the fcc stated in the usf order the commission recognized in vonage ii that it is difficult for some interconnected voip providers to separate their traffic on a jurisdictional basis and that consistent with the arguments of other voip providers and based on the conclusions in the vonage order we find that it would be reasonable for us to treat the interconnected voip traffic as  interstate for usf purposes  fccr   ¶  moreover the fcc recognized that some interconnected voip providers do not currently have the ability to identify whether customer calls are interstate id at  ¶  the fcc thus permitted such providers to either rely on traffic studies or the safe harbor provision the fcc adopted or in the alternative to the extent that an interconnected voip provider develops the capability to track the jurisdictional confines of customer calls it may determine the jurisdictional divide based on its actual percentage of interstate calls under this alternative however we note that an interconnected voip provider with the capability to track the jurisdictional confines of customer calls would not longer qualify for the preemptive effects of our vonage order id contrary to defendants interpretation the fcc did not negate or abandon vonage ii but simply further delineated the circumstances in which the vonage ii impossibility exception would or would not apply furthermore the fcc noted that it had not yet classified interconnected voip as either a telecommunications service or an information service and that it did not classify interconnected voip today id at  ¶  moreover the fcc noted that the commission previously determined that vonages interconnected voip service is a jurisdictionally mixed service in which part of the service is interstate in nature id at  ¶  citing the vonage order ie vonage i we believe that other interconnected voip services similarly are jurisdictionally mixed id while defendants attempt to distinguish charter advanceds fixed service from the nomadic service at issue in vonage ii as the rr recognized the fact that the interstate and intrastate portions of the service can be more easily distinguished does not mean that a fixed services portions can always be distinguished nor that it would be economically feasible or easy to do so doc no  at  in short while vonages nomadic interconnected voip service cannot be separated into interstate and intrastate usage such that the impossibility exception is determinative  fd   th cir  a fixed service might still be incapable of such separation such that the exception still applies and that determination is not appropriate here given that the issue whether voip services can be separated into interstate and intrastate components is a largely factdriven inquiry requiring a high level of technical expertise vonage iii  fd   th cir  defendants contend that the usf order plainly declares a fixed interconnected voip provider capable of tracking the jurisdictional confines of its customers calls is subject to state regulation doc no  at  the court disagrees however that charter advanceds own representations to consumers disclose that it is capable of such a distinction defendants rely on materials they submitted in support of their motion to dismiss but those materials—even if such were appropriate to consider on a rule b motion—simply state that if a customer dials  the call will be routed directly to the nearest public safety operator and your address will be automatically provided allowing the operator to dispatch help doc no  ex c at  emphasis added this statement—which defendants only selectively quote—hardly establishes that the automatic provision of a customers address to the  operator somehow provides charter advanced with the addresses of the recipients of other calls the customer would make and even if it would it apparently could only do so if and when a particular customer actually used the  service finally defendants  argument establishes nothing with respect to non calls which of course are the vast majority of calls and as the rr explained the fccs recognition that even if vonage could directly identify the geographic location of its calls the costs and complexity of determining the geographic location of calls transmitted through vonages multifaceted services would prohibit any division of intrastate calls from interstate calls and that this impossibility could apply to some fixed services doc no  at  furthermore the rr stated that the fcc has never directly repudiated its statement in vonage ii that if the fcc were faced with other providers of other types of ipenabled services having basic characteristics similar to those at issue in vonage ii it would preempt state regulation to a comparable extent vonage ii  fccr at  ¶  accord id at  ¶  stating belief that it would be highly unlikely that it would fail to preempt state regulation of other ipenabled services having the same capabilities d consideration of matters of public record finally defendants contend that the rr flatly rejected consideration of documents they introduced at the public administrative proceeding before the mpuc and that furthermore the rrs consideration of such materials is inconsistent because the rr credited charters statements in the puc proceeding doc  at   n but the rr discloses no such error with respect to charters statements the rr simply noted that charter does not dispute that its voip service is a fixed service and it conceded as much during the puc proceeding and again in the hearing before the magistrate judge doc no  at  emphasis added any additional reliance on what it might have said at the puc hearing is at most harmless error and with respect to the documents defendants submitted at the puc proceeding the rr states that it does not consider defendants evidence of charter advanceds marketing or charter advanceds testimony to the puc doc no  at  n defendants reliance on great plains trust co v union pac r co stating that the court on a motion to dismiss under rule b may consider documents attached to the complaint and matters of public and administrative record referenced in the complaint  fd   th cir  is misplaced while the court is obligated to accept as true the wellpleaded material factual allegations in the complaint such a motion to dismiss is not the proper procedural juncture for consideration of a defendants evidence including any of a defendants testimony at an antecedent administrative proceeding in short the focus is on the complaint not on a defendants answer or other filings or materials offered in opposition to the allegations of the complaint and the complaint here neither attaches any document nor references any such matters of public and administrative record other than the fact of the mpucs decision that charters service is a telecommunications service while a court may take judicial notice of another courts opinion such notice is of the existence of the opinion which is not subject to reasonable dispute over its authenticity but not of the facts summarized in the opinion mcivor v credit control servs inc  fd   th cir  iii conclusion many of the matters at issue here involve questions of fact that are of course not appropriate for resolution on a rule b motion moreover defendants attempt to have these issues resolved as a matter of law by comparison to judicial decisions and fcc orders addressing other services ignores the fccs casebycase approach regarding particular services as the fcc itself has observed the proper interpretation of the terms telecommunications and telecommunications service in the  act raises difficult issues that are the subject of heated debate universal service report  fccr  at ¶  in particular the commission has recognized the potential difficulty in determining the jurisdictional nature of ip telephony att order  fccr  ¶  and with respect to mixed or hybrid services it recognized that the question may not always be straightforward whether on the one hand an entity is providing a single information service with communications and computing components or on the other hand is providing two distinct services one of which is a telecommunications service universal service report  fccr  at ¶  accordingly with one exception the court denies defendants request that it modify the report reject the recommendation and grant their motion to dismiss the court likewise denies defendants request that the court vacate reference of defendants motion and rehear the matter de novo this court notes however that denying defendants rule b motion simply determines that—in this highly factdependent and complex fielddefendants have not shown as a matter of law that taking the allegations of the complaint as true charter phone is necessarily an offering of telecommunications any such determination must await further proceedings based on the foregoing and all the files records and proceedings herein it is hereby ordered that  defendants objections to the report and recommendation doc no  are overruled  the report and recommendation doc no  is as discussed and modified above adopted  defendants motion to dismiss doc no  is denied and  defendants alternative request that this court vacate the reference of their motion to the magistrate doc no  is denied footnotes  plaintiffs charter advanced services mn llc and charter advanced services viii mn llc are both indirectly whollyowned subsidiaries of charter communications inc doc no  at  ¶  this court will refer to plaintiffs collectively as either charter advanced as does the rr or simply charter  charter advanceds service is now marketed as spectrum voice here this court will refer to it either as charter phone as defendants do or as voip service as the rr does  the mpuc and its commissioners appealed to the eighth circuit the decision in vonage i granting a permanent injunction prohibiting the commissioners from enforcing the state regulatory order but while that appeal was pending the fcc issued an order preempting the mpuc order in the matter of vonage holdings corp  fccr   vonage ii the fcc has clarified that this commission not the state commissions has the responsibility and obligation to decide whether certain regulations apply to particular services vonage ii  fccr at  ¶  accordingly the eighth circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court on the basis of the fcc order having concluded that the fcc order is binding on this court and may not be challenged in this litigation vonage holdings corp v minn pub util commn  fd   th cir  subsequently the eighth circuit denied the petitions seeking review of the fccs vonage ii order minnesota public utilities commn v federal commun commn  fd  th cir  vonage iii here defendants had asserted before the magistrate judge that the entire vonage line of authority is inapposite as those authorities concern nomadic voip rather than charter advanceds fixed voip service doc no  at  defendants now object to the rrs reliance on several preemption authorities including vonage ii as addressing different factual circumstances not applicable here doc  at  this court concludes however that the authorities at issue are hardly inapposite as the rr explained although neither the fcc nor various courts have provided a definitive answer to the precise question here of whether charter advanceds fixed interconnected voip service is an information service or a telecommunications service doc no  at  several judicial decisions have ruled on similar issues and thus provide valid guidance here in vonage i for example the district court addressed the issue of whether the computertocomputer and telephonetocomputer forms of ip telephony two of three such forms the third being telephonetotelephone telephony used in vonages nomadic service constituted a telecommunications service or an information service  f supp d at   n the court ruled that computertocomputer telephony and telephonetocomputer constituted an information service such that vonages service was not subject to mpucs regulatory authority id at  granted a distinction can be drawn    between what is referred to as nomadic voip service and fixed voip service vonage iii  fd at  addressing the difficulty in distinguishing the interstate and intrastate portions of the service but that distinction hardly renders those authorities inapposite here  finally the statutory note included in the  act—that the act shall not be construed to modify impair or supersede federal state or local law unless expressly so provided—simply states that there shall be no implied federal preemption of state law not that there shall not be any preemption  charter advanced argues that insofar as the defendants suggest that the court should apply a presumption that services should be classified as telecommunications services rather than information services to avoid preempting state law no authority supports such an approach doc no  at  the court is similarly unaware of the application of the presumption on that level  defendants also contend that the rr erred as there is not a change in the form or content of information sent and received because the charter phone caller speaks with their voice and the called party hears that same voice id at   n granted it provides a voicein voiceout form of communication to the communicants but their argument overlooks the fact that charters interconnected voip service employs iptotdm conversion see infra section iic  telecommunications is defined as the transmission    of information    without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received  usc §  defendants argue that the rr erred by stating that the definition of telecommunications excludes transmissions without change in form or content of information because such a formulation mistakes an element of the definition to be an exception to the definition id at  n but as will be seen any such error is harmless here see infra section iic  defendants seize on this statement but ignore the context the court was addressing and rejecting an analogy between cable modem service and    enhancedservice providers who own the transmission facilities used to provide those services    because cable companies also own the facilities they use to provide cable modem service and therefore information service noting that under earlier rules the commission regulated such providers more heavily than nonfacilitiesbased providers brand x  us at  in rejecting that analogy the court explained that the acts definition of telecommunications service says nothing about imposing more stringent regulatory duties on facilitiesbased informationservice providers the definition hinges solely on whether the entity offers telecommunications for a fee directly to the public id at   the act regulates telecommunications carriers but not informationservice providers as common carriers which are subjected under title ii to many mandatory obligations including that to contribute to the federal universal service fund under section d brand x  us at  accord att ruling  fccr   ¶  n title ii    imposes certain requirements on common carriers including requirements with respect to rates and terms tariffing interconnection and contributions to the usf  ¶   the act defines telecommunications carrier as relevant here as any provider of telecommunications services  usc §  emphasis added and as relevant here a telecommunications carrier shall be treated as a common carrier under this chapter and thus be subject to the mandatory regulation under title ii of the act only to the extent that it is engaged in providing telecommunications services id  the fcc earlier had requested comments as to whether it should classify voip as a telecommunications service such that voip would be subject to mandatory title ii common carrier regulations or as an information service such that it would not id at  but later in the usf order the fcc deferred addressing that classification question grounding its order in its permissive contribution authority under which the fcc asserted it may impose this obligation regardless of whether a provider is ultimately classified as a telecommunications service or an information service id at   were the commission to conclude that voip is an offering of telecommunications and therefore to classify it as a telecommunications service voip providers would fall under section ds mandatory contribution language id at  the scope of the commissions permissive contribution authority however does not depend on whether voip is considered an offering of either telecommunications or information rather the commissions permissive contribution authority extends to providers of interstate telecommunications id emphasis in original  charter advanceds service is an interconnected voip service because it allows users to communicate not only with other voip users    but also with users of traditional telephone networks doc no  ¶  in the latter instance calls must be converted from ip to tdm and vice versa id moreover it is a fixed service as it is accessed via a specialized piece of equipment installed in the customers home id ¶  such a service is different from a nomadic service which allows access from anywhere a customer can access the internet  in a separatelyenumerated section section iv defendants argue that the rr failed to apply the appropriate fcc orders defendants contend that the weight of fcc precedent strongly supports dismissal and that the usf order the open internet order the connect america order the universal service report and other fcc decisions—but not the nonaccounting safeguards order—control here doc no  at  but this argument is addressed to issues such as the telecommunications management exception and the impossibility exception that the defendants address in other sections entitled with respect to those particular issues accordingly the court will address such arguments in their appropriate context namely here with respect to the telecommunications management exception  the court observes that the fcc has cited the order at least as recently as  in the att order  fccr   ¶¶   defendants also contend that the nonaccounting safeguards order expressly limits its application so as not to be of any relevance here doc no  at  but that order simply states that it addresses only the nonaccounting separate affiliate and nondiscrimination safeguards in sections  and  of the telecommunications act the classification of boc affiliates or independent lecs and their affiliates as dominant or nondominant will be addressed in a separate report and order in this docket  fccr   ¶   defendants fail to explain how this limiting distinction negates the relevance of the order here the order addressed the scope of the services that are included in the statutory definition of information service id at  ¶¶  likewise the order addressed protocol processing and protocol conversion idat  ¶¶   here in a section separate from that expressly devoted to the exception defendants contend that the report repeats this error—purportedly failing to acknowledge the fccs affirmation as a phonetophone ip telephony is a no net protocol conversion—in its treatment of the att order doc no  at  n  as noted above see supra note  in addition to section iii of their objections brief which expressly addresses the exception defendants also address the functional approach in a separately enumerated section section iv regarding agency precedent doc no  at  the court addresses those arguments here  defendants assert that the connect america order  fccr   wl  caf i also supports its position on the functional approach and is relevant here for the same reason as the usf order—that only a telecommunications carrier can qualify for a subsidy doc no  at  but caf i addresses who shall be eligible to receive universal service support under section e only an eligible telecommunications carrier designated under section e of this title shall be eligible to receive such support  usc § e granted a telecommunications carrier is any provider of telecommunications services but telecommunications service means the offering of telecommunications and that term is defined as the transmission    of information    without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received  usc §     emphasis added and whether charter advanceds service involves such change is a question—one of fact—at issue here this court thus agrees with the rr that the connect america order does not pertain to the definition of information services or telecommunications services but rather the funding mechanisms for the universal service fund doc no  at  as that order itself expressly stated our authority to promote universal service in this context does not depend on whether interconnected voip services are telecommunications services or information services under the communications act  fccr   ¶   wl   insofar as the connect america order simply observes that the fcc in a prior order had adopted an approach that focuses on the functionality offered instead of the technologies used the order merely reiterates prior authority and does not provide any new analysis relevant here on reconsideration the fcc modified on its own motion two aspects of caf i but with no relevance here connect america order  fccr   wl  caf ii  finally defendants take issue with the form of the rrs phrasing of its determination regarding net protocol conversion the rr stated that there is net protocol conversion here suggesting that such was a final legal conclusion they contend that resolution of the issue is premature and incorrect doc no  at  n claiming there is a contested issue of fact on the issue this court would agree if that is what the rr did in fact mean but this court does not read the rr so literally as the rr also stated on the limited record before it the court concludes that none of the categories apply to charter advanceds voip service id at  emphasis added in other words there was no basis to conclude on this rule b motion that any of the categories of the exception necessarily applied so as to preclude charters service from being deemed on a fuller record an information service thus this court does not read the rr to have erred on this point but the court does agree with defendants that there is a contested issue of fact on this point  defendants note that commissioner betsy wergin has been replaced by commissioner matthew schuerger doc no  at  n accordingly commissioner schuerger shall be substituted for former commissioner wergin comment your

is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic

that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time
