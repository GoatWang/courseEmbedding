companys website at wwwddrcom nongaap measuresffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure used as a standard in the real estate industry and is a widely accepted measure of real estate investment trust reit performance management believes that both ffo and operating ffo provide additional indicators of the financial performance of a reit the company also believes that ffo and operating ffo more appropriately measure the core operations of the company and provide benchmarks to its peer group ffo is generally defined and calculated by the company as net income loss adjusted to exclude  i preferred share dividends ii gains and losses from disposition of depreciable real estate property and related investments which are presented net of taxes iii impairment charges on depreciable real estate property and related investments and iv certain noncash items these noncash items principally include real property depreciation and amortization of intangibles equity income loss from joint ventures and equity income loss from noncontrolling interests and adding the companys proportionate share of ffo from its unconsolidated joint ventures and noncontrolling interests determined on a consistent basis the companys calculation of ffo is consistent with the nareit definition the company calculates operating ffo by excluding certain nonoperating charges and gains operating ffo is useful to investors as the company removes noncomparable charges and gains to analyze the results of its operations and assess performance of the core operating real estate portfolio other real estate companies may calculate ffo and operating ffo in a different manner the company also uses net operating income noi a nongaap financial measure as a supplemental performance measure noi is calculated as property revenues less propertyrelated expenses the company believes noi provides useful information to investors regarding the companys financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and when compared across periods reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates rental rates operating costs and acquisition and disposition activity on an unleveraged basis the company presents noi information herein on a same store basis or ssnoi the company defines ssnoi as property revenues less propertyrelated expenses which exclude straightline rental income and expenses lease termination income management fee expense fair market value of leases and expense recovery adjustments the company presents ssnoi both with and without provisions for uncollectible amounts andor recoveries thereof in addition the company presents ssnoi both with and without the results of its puerto rico portfolio ssnoi also excludes activity associated with development and major redevelopment and single tenant assets and includes assets owned in comparable periods  months for quarter comparisons ssnoi excludes all nonproperty and corporate level revenue and expenses other real estate companies may calculate noi and ssnoi in a different manner the company believes ssnoi provides investors with additional information regarding the operating performances of comparable assets because it excludes certain noncash and noncomparable items as noted above ffo operating ffo noi and ssnoi do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives
