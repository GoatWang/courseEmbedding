director good morning and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call mike will take you through the specifics of the quarter as has been the case for the last several years there are a lot of moving parts to the quarter from my perspective there were four themes let me discuss each of them first our ecommerce business continued to gain momentum and the business is positioned for a strong second half we continue to add new clients and new geographies ill come back to this in a moment how this business is well positioned in a rapidly growing market second in our software business we still have work to do in previous communications i have pointed to the importance of building channel partnerships with systems integrators and other technology companies and we did make substantial progress on that score in the second quarter we signed with  systems integrators two global and nine regional let me give you an example of a relationship with a global systems integrator in june we joined forces with accenture digital a worldclass leader in digital customer experience pitney bowes engageone video solution will be offered to accenture digital clients who are in the midst of their digital transformation strategy clients across verticals and public service industries can deploy engageone video to boost customer loyalty improve new customer onboarding process support content development and scale video production the scale that a partner like accenture brings to pitney bowes gives us an opportunity for meaningful progress on a related point according to the second quarter forrester wave communications management report and i quote video support through pitney bowes interactive and personalized engageone video solution is best in class also in june we entered into an oem agreement with ibm this agreement helps strengthen our position as a location intelligence supplier to a marketleader in business intelligence and analytics markets these relationships and accolades are important for two reasons first they confirm that we have good products second getting good products to market requires the right channels all these partners are bestinclass in their respective markets and im confident theyll be important partners in bringing our products to market so let me lay out how i see the software business moving forward you should see improved license performance as the first step in this business improvement and were starting the second half with a much improved pipeline that will lead to improvements in subsequent quarters in related streams as i mentioned in the last quarter i expect this business to improve throughout the course of the year while overall business investment in technology is soft i still believe we can turn in better performance third as we discussed on our last call we deployed our new enterprise business platform in april in the united states although we often call this an erp project that really does not do justice to the scale of this initiative the platform affects every aspect of our business including how sales opportunities are managed products are configured leases and bills calculated financials produced customer service delivered and client satisfaction managed it is a substantial business process and technology reengineering project and now extends to approximately  of our revenue base it is already producing benefits to our business and will deliver substantial benefits to our business over time it is worth noting that some of the significant product announcements we have made in the last  days have been enabled by our new business platform although that said the implementation of this platform caused some shortterm interruptions to our business particularly in the high volume portion of our meter business in april mike will elaborate on this more in his comments but heres the bottom line the platform now covers the preponderance of our business and the business case is still intact in some cases we can already see that the business benefits will be beyond what we had originally contemplated fourth and most importantly we have been focused from the beginning on creating longterm shareholder value i said to my team this last april that i believe the second quarter of  would be one of the most pivotal quarters in our companys history in our transformation efforts to establish those fundamentals that enable longterm success let me explain what i mean based on our strategic pillars the reinvention of mail operational excellence and growth of our digital commerce business we made substantial progress in the reinvention of our mail business during the second quarter a big part of this as you all know was the launch of the pitney bowes commerce cloud in april the response from clients has been very encouraging weve already attracted more than  million unique visitors to the commerce cloud portal the number of clients using the web to purchase supplies has increased by  and we are seeing incremental demand for our shipping products particularly our sendpro solution and our apis apis provide a new opportunity to monetize our software assets as developers and isvs embed our capabilities in their products while it will take time for demand to drive recurring revenue streams in these new areas this initiative is integral to create new value for the small and medium business market and all of our existing clients last month we announced smartlink a digital technology solution that connects our existing installed base of postage meters to the pitney bowes commerce cloud to streamline the client experience and enable services from the commerce cloud we will continue to innovate in this area next operational excellence in one of my very early earnings calls as a ceo i said that i thought ceos are sometimes guilty of blaming execution without looking more deeply at root causes things like do you have the right channels the right skills is the brand positioned correctly do you have the right systems to enable execution over the last three years we have slowly sometimes more slowly than i wanted but methodically addressed these items i also said over time you will see the benefits of these endeavors in the income statement and balance sheet i still believe that the benefits never come fast enough but theres no doubt in my mind that investing in channels brand systems products and our people is the best way for us to build longterm shareholder value finally growing digital commerce weve already covered software so i wont rehash it beyond saying that while we still need to improve we can deliver results and we made real progress in the second quarter building channels and pipeline for the second half in our ecommerce business we had  new retail storefronts in the second quarter bringing our total to almost  worldwide last week we added an additional five stores and announced that we were adding outbound capabilities in australia to our existing outbound businesses in the united states and uk in addition to growing our existing relationships these new storefronts have positioned this business for sustainable growth going forward one opportunity that has become particularly hot is helping us and uk retailers sell into asia particularly china over the last several months ive had the opportunity to visit potential clients in india and china and the demand for our crossbrand capabilities is one of the most impressive things ive ever seen bottom line while i thought we had the opportunity to do better in the second quarter we cannot be more pleased with the progress weve made on our strategic agenda and we have set ourselves up for an improved second half i will make a few final remarks after mike but at this point let me turn the call to mike michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer thank you marc and good morning marc outlined how our actions in the quarter are in line with our transformation objectives i want to focus my comments on three things first the impact of our enterprise business platform launch in the us on our results in the quarter and forward second the specifics of the second quarter and third our outlook for the remainder of  let me begin with what we have been calling our erp program but its actually a remake of our enterprise business platform including it systems web capability and new product enablement in fact at the same time we went live with this new platform we also brought online new webstore capability client selfservice functionality and our new saasbased sendpro product which leverages new subscription billing capability the new platform we put in place was critical to us launching each of these items as we look to the future the longterm benefits of our new systems far outweigh the impact on results in the second quarter in april we launched the new enterprise business platform in the us the us represents  of our consolidated revenue generates  of consolidated business segment ebit and covers every one of our business models as a result we developed and implemented a robust cutover plan the results from the second quarter reflect the temporary impacts of that transition our enterprisebased businesses including production mail presort software and crossborder ecommerce were not materially impacted by the transition however given the scale and run rate nature of selling to a large installed based in our smb and shipping businesses there were impacts to revenue and profit resulting from the transition this manifested itself principally in two areas first in sales productivity particularly inside sales and supply sales where selling days were lost to conversion training and early productivity and second in financingrelated fees as a result of proactive waivers to compensate for delayed billing associated with the system cutover and client acclimation to new billing formats to give you some sense of the work needed to do this transformation we had to take down multiple older legacy systems do a phased ramp up of new functionality train across our sales service customer care and back office teams and then validate the new processes all these efforts had an impact on sales productivity our inside sales and supply sales groups initiate and make sales on the same day often in a single call so time off the phone is lost sales productivity so while its not our practice to provide comments on monthly activity we thought itd be instructive to provide insight in this case given the unique circumstances related to the systems golive the impact on our results from this change was most pronounced in the month of april we began to see productivity improvements in may as teams adapted to new processes but we were not yet at pre golive levels by june sales and supplies performance began to normalize closer in line with pre golive levels late june and early july results suggested return to pre golive levels and we will continue to drive further automation and process enhancements throughout the second half it is our estimate when comparing monthly activity in the second quarter to pre golive activity levels in the first quarter this year and second quarter of last year that total revenue was reduced in the second quarter by an estimated  million to  million or  percentage points related to our systems golive activities based on the mix of revenue impacted we estimate the ebit margin impact to be about  basis points overall earnings before interest and taxes or ebit is estimated to have been negatively impacted by about  million to  million or an estimated  per share earnings results for the quarter also included costs of development and deployment of our business platform while we continue to make refinements and enhancements to the system and have opportunities for further improvements and productivity we believe material impacts to revenue related to the us golive are behind us as we enter the second half of the year we are pleased that with the cutover in both canada and the us we now have approximately  of our revenue and the vast majority of our profit for the company deployed on our new infrastructure turning to the quarter we did see some improving trends in several parts of the business this quarter as compared to our first quarter results but in addition to the impacts of our enterprise business platform software continued to underperform as marc mentioned within global ecommerce our crossborder ecommerce business grew organically at a doubledigit rate over prior year and improved its ebit margin from first quarter performance the shipping solutions business was down yearoveryear in part as a result of the enterprise business platform cutover international mailings revenue comparison continues to improve from prior trends production mail saw an improvement in its revenue comparison and ebit margin presort services also continued to show revenue growth though at a lower rate than in prior quarters our software business continued to experience lower license sales yearoveryear as we take actions to improve our channel effectiveness as marc outlined we are improving sales efficiency and are making good progress expanding the indirect channels to improve our market access as he noted we added a total of  new and regional systems integrators these actions will take time to be fully reflected in the results but weve already increased our pipeline of deals during the second quarter i also wanted to highlight that the work we have done thus far to invest in and change our business operating infrastructure continues to be balanced with our commitment to managing total return to shareholders during the quarter we repurchased approximately  million in shares of our common stock and continued to pay a competitive dividend this brings our yeartodate total share repurchase to about  million or a little over  million shares and at the end of the quarter we have about  million remaining on our authorization of  million let me now take you through the high level second quarter financial results and then ill provide details on each of the segments results and provide an update on our  guidance please note that a reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures can be found in the financial schedules appended to our earnings press release and earnings slides which are posted on the pitneybowescom website under the investor relations section turning to the results revenue for the second quarter totaled  million which was a decline of  on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and a decline of  on a reported basis the revenue impact of the systems cutover reduced consolidated revenues by an estimated  million to  million or about  percentage points of growth revenue in our smb segment group declined  on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and declined  on a reported basis within smb north america mailings revenue comparison to prior year was adversely impacted by an estimated  percentage points due to the temporary business impact of the cutover to the new enterprise business platform in the us revenue in our enterprise business solutions group grew  on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and was flat on a reported basis digital commerce solutions revenue grew  on a constant currency basis and  on a reported basis adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were  when compared to the prior year our adjusted earnings per share results this quarter were impacted by the estimated  impact that i discussed earlier related to the disruption caused by the system integration cutover  of incremental erp expense and  of income recorded in the second quarter  for our imagitas business that was subsequently divested last may gaap earnings per share were  which included  in restructuring charges recorded in the quarter and a  loss from discontinued operations free cash flow was  million and we generated  million on a gaap basis in cash from operations free cash flow was slightly favorable to prior year as favorable working capital and lower capital expenditures were partly offset by lower net income free cash flow was also impacted by delayed billing and collections activity associated with the systems cutover these impacts are expected to normalize in the second half of the year during the quarter we returned cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends we spent  million on the repurchase of our common stock buying  million shares in the quarter we also paid  million in dividends to our common shareholders additionally we made  million in restructuring payments the company also received  million of cash from investing activities related to the sale of a building in troy new york turning to the income statement adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted ebit was  million this quarter which was  million lower than the prior year as a result of the reduced revenue related to systems cutover as well as incremental erp and rd expenses the sale of imagitas and the software revenue decline adjusted ebit margin was  adding back depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda was  million for the quarter sga for the quarter was  million which was  million or  lower than the prior year as a percent of revenue sga was  which was nearly flat to last year sga declined in absolute terms yeartoyear primarily driven by lower employeerelated cost this quarter included incremental erp and marketing expenses also when compared to the prior year current year sga includes a full quarter of amortization expense associated with the acquisition of borderfree in support of the savings objectives related to our enterprise business platform rollout we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of  million at the end of the quarter for actions taken to improve operational efficiency and productivity across our business portfolio in addition we recorded an asset impairment charge of  million in the quarter also rd expense increased from prior year by  million as a result of bringing new solutions like sendpro smartlink and the commerce cloud to market concurrent with our infrastructure rollout in addition investments in ecommerce rd were up from prior year due to the integration of our technology platforms net interest expense which includes financing interest was  million which was a decline of about  million when compared to the prior year which is a result of the actions we have taken to manage our debt portfolio average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about  million higher than the prior year the average interest rate this quarter was  which was about  basis points lower than the prior year effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was  which was  basis points higher than the prior years tax rate this reflects increased tax attributable to a change in the mix of earnings now id like to discuss our second quarter results for each of our business segments this information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we post to the pitneybowescom website under the investor relations section for smb solutions in north america mailing revenue was  million and ebit was  million as i discussed earlier we have estimated this quarters revenue comparison to prior year was negatively impacted in the range of  million to  million or about  due to the revenue reduction related to the enterprise business platform implementation and its impact on equipment sales and recurring revenue streams of the estimated revenue reduction the split is roughly twothirds equipment sales and onethird for the recurring revenue streams i should note these temporary impacts related to the system cutover in the quarter are not ongoing changes in the end market therefore on a reported basis equipment sales and recurring revenue streams declined from prior years at a greater rate versus prior quarter trends ebit margin was  which was  basis points lower than prior year mostly the result of the lower revenue in international mailing revenue was  million and ebit was  million the segments yearoveryear revenue performance continues to improve equipment sales grew from prior year most notably in france italy and japan in part due to improved sales productivity from the gotomarket changes especially in france the decline in recurring revenue streams was also the lowest we saw in seven quarters overall constant currency revenue adjusted for market exits was flat to the prior year ebit margin was  which was  basis points lower from prior year primarily due to the equipment sales mix of business turning to enterprise business solutions our overall segment groups revenue was flat on a reported basis and grew  when adjusting for production mail market exits which is in line with our longterm outlook for the segment in production mail revenue was  million and ebit was  million equipment sales grew over prior year due to higher sorter equipment installations support services and supplies revenue declined in part as a result of some inhouse mailers shifting their mail processing to thirdparty outsourcers and the recent market exits ebit margin was  which was an improvement of  basis points from prior year and mostly driven by service delivery cost management initiatives in presort services revenue was  million and ebit was  million revenue benefited from the higher volume of firstclass mail processed as well as expansion into the st louis chicago and portland markets but was partly offset by lower volumes of standard mail processed ebit margin was  which was a decline of about  basis points versus prior year primarily as a result of the usps rate change and increased labor costs for digital commerce solutions in software solutions revenue was  million and ebit was  million revenue declined from prior year due to lower licensing revenues and lower datarelated revenue as marc outlined and i noted earlier we are actively signing up new systems integrators and reseller partners as part of our continued focus on expanding the indirect channel and improving sales efficiency to improve the pipeline of deals ebit margin was  which was a decline of  basis points versus prior year mostly due to the lower licensing revenue which has a high margin we are taking actions to further improve our software margins in global ecommerce revenue was  million and ebit was  million results this quarter included a full quarter of borderfree revenue as compared to one month of revenue in the prior year revenue benefited from strong growth in the uk marketplace business and the launch of new retail storefronts outbound us marketplace package shipments grew in the quarter despite the stronger us dollar versus prior year when adding preacquisition borderfree revenue back to the prior year for comparative purposes organic growth in our crossborder business was  this compares favorably to the first quarter which was slightly down from prior year the improved second quarter performance is due to the growth in outbound volumes in both the uk and the us shipping revenue declined from prior year in part as a result of the enterprise business platform cutover and lower license sales ebit margin was  which was a slight decline of  basis points versus prior year this was due to the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets investments for growth in the business and a lower mix of our higher margin domestic shipping business which more than offsets synergy savings this business remains on track to achieve its synergy run rate objective by year end one thing of note id like to also address is the impact of brexit on our global ecommerce business due to the vote passing late in june we did not see any material impact on our results in the second quarter it is still early days and difficult to determine the longerterm impact to the business however in the short term the weakening british pound has created additional opportunity for our uk outbound business but has an opposite impact for us goods into the uk as the goods have now become more expensive well continue to monitor this situation early july results suggest that the uk outbound growth is being more than offset by the decline in us outbound to the uk over time expansion and globalization of our crossborder ecommerce business will create natural hedges that should moderate the impacts of currency movements that concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter now id like to discuss our updated annual guidance and provide some insights for the second half of  based on yeartodate results particularly in software along with the second quarter temporary impact in north america mailing as a result of the new enterprise business platform cutover the company is adjusting its annual guidance we will take the added step this one time to provide further details on both our second half and full year guidance for full year  we now expect revenue on a constant currency basis to be in the range of a  decline to  decline when compared to  adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of  to  which excludes the yeartodate charge of  related to restructuring asset impairment dispositions expense and discontinued operations free cash flow to be in the range of  million to  million we are also narrowing the range of our annual tax rate on adjusted earnings and now expect it to be in the range of  to  for the second half of the year we expect constant currency revenue to be in the range of  growth to  decline compared to the constant currency decline of  experienced in the first half of the year we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of  to  and free cash flow to be in the range of  million to  million to achieve improvement in the second half as compared to the first half of the year we expect the north america mailing business to return to a more normalized level as we progress throughout the second half our enterprise solutions group is expected to perform similar to the first half and digital commerce solutions performance levels subject to no material changes in key currency valuation or any new material impacts from the brexit decision or canada postlabor negotiations are expected to improve from the first half performance levels we expect software license revenue growth to improve as a result of the progress we are making in channel efficiency and channel partner engagement for global ecommerce we expect constant currency revenue in the second half to grow double digits post the anniversary of the borderfree acquisition this will be driven by continued transaction volume growth as well as the acquisition of new and expansion of existing retail clients adjusted earnings per share in the second half when compared to the first half will benefit from the expected revenue improvements reduced marketing and erp spend and particularly in the fourth quarter the early benefits from the infrastructure cost savings free cash flow in the second half as compared to the first half will benefit from the recovery of delayed billing and collections activity related to the systems cutover i would also like to provide an update on our overall erp project with the us launch we now have the majority of our revenue profit and transactional activity on our new platform in the second half of  in north america we will focus on optimization of the platform driving revenue from our new commerce cloud solutions enabled by the platform and delivering the savings opportunity related to the program in addition weve begun the implementation planning and integration for our international rollout in  we are still on track to achieve the targeted levels of expense and benefits in  to date in  we have expensed about  million and have recognized some early benefits we expect some benefits to come in during the third quarter but the majority to materialize in the fourth quarter additionally we will spend incremental capex in  related to the erp program to enhance automation of manual processes increase web capabilities for client selfservice and add new functionality this added capital is not expected to increase the companys overall capex spending for the year due to lower spending in other areas well provide a more detailed update on the overall program performance and benefit realization at our analyst day later this year that concludes my remarks operator please open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator the first question comes from the line of ananda baruah brean capital please go ahead ananda p baruah  brean capital llc hey guys good morning thanks for taking the questions hey just a couple if i could the first one just wanted to go back to your remarks on the ecommerce business and get a couple of clarifications first off could you – mike could you go back over the organic growth commentary for this quarter and what you said your related organic growth was from the year ago quarter and then i have a follow up on that thanks michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer sure in terms of the ecommerce organic growth looking at the crossborder business was  in the second quarter and that compares to it being slightly down in the first quarter one of the main drivers obviously has been the improving comparison of the us dollar relative to the other currencies that we sell to outbound in the us in addition to that very strong growth in our uk outbound business and addition of new retailers to the marketplace or the retail component of our business so weve seen that improve in terms of growth in outbound volumes from both markets so we feel good about the direction of that now that we have a better currency comparison ananda p baruah  brean capital llc and the crossborder growth of  that includes everything that you just spoke of it includes the uk outbound as well as the borderfree outbound and your traditional ebay outbound is that michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer correct so we think of the traditional ebay as a marketplace and the borderfree component more as the retail thats inclusive of both of those pieces ananda p baruah  brean capital llc okay awesome and then another clarification was i accurate in interpreting your remarks that the fx headwind from us outbound into the uk is actually being for the most part offset by the fx tailwind from your uk business outbound now as well michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah if you look at – and again given the change in the value of the pound in the last several weeks given the brexit vote its early days to know exactly what the pluses and minus will be but the weakening of the british pound has actually made purchases from the uk grow because of the lower cost to buy from the uk and the flip side of that is uk is an important outbound market from the us and thats made the goods from the us a little more expensive into the uk so its actually early days a slight negative given the amount of volume outbound from the us but as the uk grows that obviously diminishes ananda p baruah  brean capital llc okay got it you mentioned – you made comments just a moment ago about – for border reaching the returns goals by the end of the year and so could you context that for us a little bit the overall margins for the business there i think was  this quarter which is a decent snap back if i recall upon acquisition the returns commentary you guys made for border i believe was midteens or  over the first  months of the kind of acquisition close i would just love to get a sense of what we can expect for the margins as we go through the second half of the year and sort of what it means to you guys to kind of hit your return targets for border as per your remarks by the december quarter thanks michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer sure let me just approach it from a high level so if you think about from an acquisition standpoint what we said upfront was we would get  million  million of synergies out of the business if you look at the amortization associated with the intangibles of the business that runs at about  million a year so getting those to be offset so weve gone from basically flat to a little bit positive in the first quarter in that business we think the leverage in the growth and the volumes is ultimately what drives the margin we still have some synergies left to go through the balance of the year to get so we see margin upside the  margin is a longterm objective for the digital commerce solutions business i would say were where we expect to be with the acquisition in terms of sort of the rate and pace of achieving the synergies as well as beginning to see the growth and the volume in the business ananda p baruah  brean capital llc okay thats really helpful thanks a lot ill cede the floor for now michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer thank you operator and our next question is from the line of kartik mehta with northcoast research please go ahead kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc hey good morning marc and mike i wanted to ask you you talked about the erp system now impacting about  of revenue and i was wondering the confidence level why the remaining  will go well and according to your plan and in time michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer sure the simplest answer to that is the more complex implementation of the program is in the us because we have the broadest range of business models the highest volume of activities so getting it right in the us accomplishes two things really one is it obviously gives us a lot of experience in doing the cutover process and converting data and all that second were maturing the platform and so when we go to the other market we have a much more complete and fully featured solution and weve got people who have been through the process of implementation so that strengthens our view of our ability to bring that into the other markets kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc so mike if you look – what do you think went wrong it seems as though – i believe you had the canadian erp solution in first if i remember right and that went well as you look was it just the scope of the project because the us is such a large market or was it something else that resulted in this not going as well as you would have liked michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer i wouldnt say it didnt go well at all i would say it went quite well the impacts were talking about here are really due to lost selling days if you think about inside sales and supplies every day is a selling day and so as part of a natural cutover you take systems down you go through training those are lost selling days so we dont think at all that this was problematic we think actually it went quite well that in three months were back where we started before and have a opportunity for further improvement kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc just one final one could you just provide maybe a little bit granularity about the earnings cadence you would expect in the third quarter and fourth quarter i know you said fourth quarter youll get the biggest benefit but you still understand what type of benefit it seems like fourth quarter has to be a pretty good quarter for you guys from a yearoveryear earnings standpoint i just want to make sure that i understand maybe the cadence of earnings michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah itll definitely be more weighted to the fourth quarter for a couple of reasons one is – and probably most significant is the benefits associated with the erp rollout so there are a couple of things that happened one is productivity in the back office we obviously ramped up resources to ensure we went through the cutover process smoothly well ramp down those resources over time well begin to get the benefits of taking the old systems down and those types of things so those benefits will be skewed to the second half well also continue to see improvement in the productivity of our sales organizations back office organizations finance it as we – as people get more familiar more comfortable with the system so we clearly see a heavier benefit from that in the fourth quarter marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director id like to just add to mikes comment about the implementation ive had the opportunity to see probably  of these implementations this is about as good as it gets so if you think of the life cycle of these systems and processes that were deploying its measured in a decade or so to have  days of interruption for a decade of benefit of  million plus ill take that trade every time its certainly wasnt helpful for the quarter but it was the right thing to do for the long term of the business and just the simple scale of the united states is so much greater than canada and canada was so much greater than everything else this was the difficult deployment that we really had to focus on kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc all right thank you very much i appreciate it operator we have a question from the line of george tong piper jaffray please go ahead george k f tong  piper jaffray  co broker hi thanks good morning michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer good morning george k f tong  piper jaffray  co broker can you elaborate on when you expect north american smb revenues to return to more normalized declines of about  michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer so weve talked about the normalized run rate of the smb business being kind of minus  to minus  from a market perspective and if you look at over the last several quarters weve certainly been in that range and we believe now having gone through the sales force change as well as now the systems change that we should be able to return to that level so its sort of preimpact and post our change in gotomarket and then obviously weve begun to bring new products to market that should provide us some enhanced opportunities as well george k f tong  piper jaffray  co broker got it and then from a timing perspective would you expect q to be the quarter where you see the sort of  range and q more of a transitional quarter michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer in terms of absolute numbers im not going to do that by quarter but certainly the fourth quarter we think were fully back on track we think the third quarter certainly will be a significant improvement from this current quarter as a result of  late june or early july we were pretty much back on track to where we were prior to the golive george k f tong  piper jaffray  co broker got it thats helpful you touched on new software sales channels with partnerships with system integrators can you discuss any other steps youve taken to further improve software sales execution marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director sure let me kind of divide this into a couple of different layers as we talked about earlier in the year we brought in new leaders they are continuing to evolve the team i would characterize those changes as on the edges but certainly not anything terribly disruptive were continuing to invest in the products so if you look at the second quarter you would see rd spending gone up and that certainly had a lot of different contributors to it but our digital commerce business including software was an aspect to that and were looking at what i would say as tuckin type of acquisitions so we made an acquisition in the second quarter of a company called maponics fairly small in size but helps our products get better so were evolving the management team were continuing to invest in the products and then obviously our central focus has been channels my thesis all along has been weve got the right products so we need to continue to invest in those but weve got to get the channels to get us to these new markets george k f tong  piper jaffray  co broker very helpful and then lastly in global ecommerce can you discuss your plans to launch any potential new outbound shipping countries beyond the us and uk and any other discussions youve had to add new large marketplaces to supplement growth michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah so george we just announced in the last week that we are beginning outbound from australia so we have a number of retailers that were beginning that process with so we continue to look at opportunities to expand globally that is our next and newest market and well continue to look at other markets as we go forward marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director i would also say our thinking has shifted a touch on this subject in that if you wouldve asked me a year ago what were our primary drivers of growth in ecommerce i wouldve said the addition of more outbound countries actually im now starting to think that the best and closest opportunity for growth is what i said before and that is outbound from the united states outbound from the uk outbound from australia but into markets like china and india given the consumer and the middleclass evolution in those places coupled with the strong brands that we have partnerships with in the us the uk that has become the most obvious nearterm opportunity for growth so well double down on some of those outbound range from markets were already in in order to facilitate growth into markets that have good engines of growth george k f tong  piper jaffray  co broker very helpful thank you operator our next question comes from the line of shannon cross cross research please go ahead shannon cross your line is open shannon s cross  cross research llc oh sorry about that marc i wanted to follow up on the last question or actually the last comment you made because im curious what specifically can you do to drive more sales outbound into china and india what do you think the retailers need from a support standpoint and just sort of how does that market ramp up marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director so i think therell be a couple of different levels to it if you look at china as an example well work to facilitate partnerships with companies in china potentially marketplaces but other partners as well that can carry the brand that we have from the us and uk into those markets i would see it as an expansion of partnerships that we already have and as you know we have relationships with alipay and tmall in china well look for more activity with those partners in those spaces and likewise in india china becomes a pretty good metaphor for the kinds of partnerships so what can you do with marketplaces in india that help carry the very strong brands from us and uk into those marketplaces michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer shannon i would add to that that because we present their whole portfolio of goods from often the us uk outbound we can also help them selectively present certain product categories into certain markets where we know theres a high propensity for buy against that so when you think about the broader pitney bowes portfolio and our ability to help clients identify growth opportunities in that with our customer engagement solutions and the like one of the benefit is helping them get the right products to the right market not necessarily their entire portfolio or even the retailer brand itself but subsets of their offerings into given market so we see that as a significant valueadd beyond the traditional process of just pricing and outbound transaction and getting it delivered shannon s cross  cross research llc okay great and then im curious on sga whats the kind of a normalized level for sga i assume it was down a little bit more than normal this quarter because you had the missed sales but obviously  is getting down closer to the low  level youve talked about maybe high s at one point that goes back a long time but im just kind of curious as to how youre thinking about with the erp implementation and all the puts and takes with the branding in that how we should think about sga when we get out a year or so michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah clearly the benefits that we will get from the implementation of our platform will show up predominantly in the sga line so we believe that on a percentage of revenue basis well continue to drive that number down as we go out obviously the fourth quarter will see more improvement than the third quarter and then to your point of a year out as we begin to get the larger share of the benefits of that system we should see that number coming down further shannon s cross  cross research llc okay and then mike how are you thinking about cash flow on sort of – again i hate to keep using the word normalized because we never – the world is never normal but when you think about cash flow you reduced it a bit this year with some puts and takes in that how should we think about maybe working capital benefits offset by i dont know investment just can you give us some color i know you dont want to guide a year out but michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer i would say the simplest way to look at it and we talked about this at our last analyst day is that the single biggest variable going forward will be the growth in earnings and so if you think about the way our balance sheets evolving financed receivables as the mailing business stabilizes should stabilize more thats one of the drivers of free cash flow coming down over the last few years we have less inventory dependency on the businesses that grow the cash cycles for those businesses are shorter so we should see a fairly stable contribution of working capital and other balance sheetdriven items and the big variable will be earnings growth shannon s cross  cross research llc okay great and then my final question is just on the canadian labor negotiations how do we think about the potential impact there is it mainly on the shipping side or is there something that could come through on the smb mailing as well michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer i would say its principally on the ecommerce side so to the extent that there was concern about using canada post by ecommerce players they might divert transactions away from them or slow down their ecommerce activity early on in this process there was id say more noise about a disruption both sides have indicated they want to negotiate this so we continue to monitor that and well see what the potential impact is but were hopeful that that will come to resolution shannon s cross  cross research llc great thank you very much michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer thank you operator we have a question from the line of allen klee sidoti please go ahead allen klee  sidoti  co llc yes good morning how would you characterize the impact of the advertising campaigns that youve done and any thoughts on changing your prior guidance of kind of the spend on it marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director well ill take the first half and ill let mike take the second half as i had mentioned i believe earlier in the year i did some brand health work after the advertising had been launched and we saw i would say meaningful improvements in consideration rates and thats precisely what we had hoped for so this is something that well roll out over years not months or quarters but early indications are that investments in the brand have paid off so well contemplate how we move forward with investments given the realities of our business in the second half but theres no doubt that this is something that our focus is going to continue to be on enhancing our brand michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer so in terms of how to look at it in the financials i think early on we had talked about sort of the first and fourth quarters being more elevated last quarter we said we would pull some of that second half forward to the second quarter which we did do so we expect kind of second half to be more in line with the prior year spend and then as marc said going into  well evaluate the level of spend going forward allen klee  sidoti  co llc thank you and then any commentary on the performance of your digital stamp and multicarrier solutions marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director i would say in sort of digital stamp we have two products one is more of a postal oriented product pbsmartpostage and we recently launched sendpro which is a multicarrier shipping saas platform we had good success that just launched in late april good early success with the shipping platform selling into our customer base and really expanding the value proposition there in pbsmartpostage we continue to add new customers there albeit were still a relatively small part or a small share in that overall market so we do see continuing opportunity on both those fronts allen klee  sidoti  co llc okay thanks and then as you – part of your strategy in software is to push the channel do you think that has an impact on the longerterm margin outlook for software michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer no well it will rebalance the margin between cost and expense so what you may find in some of these relationships that we offer some discounts off of the pricing of our software as a benefit to these systems integrators but the flipside is that it allows us to have a different sga profile so from a net perspective it will work out the same although it might be slightly rebalanced allen klee  sidoti  co llc okay and lastly for your erp rollout internationally how do we think about when youre timing that for next year michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer well probably update further at the analyst day that were going to have in the early part of december but were continuing to look at balancing the opportunities to enhance the north american piece with the international rollout the other important piece of it is the data cleansing process and so were in the midst of that now so well finalize the timing of that as we go forward and well give a further update in december but we feel good about the opportunities in north america for getting our cost benefits as we go out allen klee  sidoti  co llc thank you operator we have a question from the line of glenn mattson ladenburg thalmann please go ahead glenn g mattson  ladenburg thalmann  co inc broker hi just with regards to australia can you say is that something you expect to contribute this year also can you tell us how big you expect that outbound market could get and then lastly in the past you talked about rolling out other markets in line with your biggest customer in ecommerce or your biggest partner and now youre saying the thinking has changed a little bit so i just wonder has their thinking changed also or how is that going michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer so in terms of australia when you think about the largest outbound markets obviously the us and uk are either the largest or top five types of markets australia is one of the top  markets but obviously smaller than the us and uk as weve seen in both the us and uk theres a ramping process that takes some time to roll itself out and once you get the first few retailers out there then we look to add around that weve been very pleased with the ramp up of the uk and so well expect over time australia to grow i dont expect it to be a huge contributor in the second half of the year but certainly begin to lay the ground work for some sustainable revenue over time in terms of expansions into other markets i think as marc mentioned were obviously going to go where our partners and all see opportunity and want us to go where we think we can create a reasonable footprint and a profitable business but were going to balance that with the opportunities to really optimize the outbound opportunity around the world id add that both in the uk and the us weve expanded the number of countries were outbound to in the uk its now over  markets in the us its over  markets glenn g mattson  ladenburg thalmann  co inc broker okay thanks very much michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer thank you operator and our last question is from chapin mechem with ne investors please go ahead chapin potter mechem  northeast investors trust yeah hi good morning im wondering if you can address your plans for the pbih preferred shares michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah were still evaluating that we think theres likely an opportunity to refinance that with traditional pbi debt but were in the midst of finalizing our plan for that now as we speak chapin potter mechem  northeast investors trust okay and just a followup with that so with the step up the  step up every six months my rough math if you keep them out is about  a share in the next year is that the sum right michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer i dont have the number off the top of my head i would say its probably in the ballpark our expectation is we have an opportunity to refinance this chapin potter mechem  northeast investors trust great and just one more thing on that sorry just to clarify after  you could still take them out anytime at par is that right if its not that done by the end of october michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer thats correct chapin potter mechem  northeast investors trust great thank you michael monahan  executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer thank you operator and mr lautenbach do you have any closing remarks marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director i do thank you id like to build off of allens question because i think its an opportune segue to a degree for the last several years i feel like weve been slogging uphill between market exits channel shifts the deployment of new systems and youre all very familiar with the rest with the deployment of our business platform in the united states i feel like weve got some clear water in front of us and were anxious to take advantage of that so from my perspective well make a judgment about when we roll out the rest of the business platform but my priority is moving towards having some clear water so we can begin to yield on investments that weve made so im not particularly pleased with our results financially in the first half that being said if you look at this transformation in the context that i always have and that is what we are doing to improve the longterm ability of this business to create value i couldnt be more pleased so thats kind of where we are as we move into the second half i believe we are poised to begin to yield on some of the investments that weve made over the last quarters the last several years whether itd be the investments in the brand investments and our system investments in our channels and were anxious to take advantage of that so well certainly update you more as the year goes on but i think thats kind of a synopsis of where we are right now so i look forward to speaking with you again in  days operator

start with a few opening remarks marc marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director thank you charlie and good morning everyone thanks for joining us today earlier this year i told you that  was going to be a pivotal year in our transformation i also told you that we would move forward with the same disciplined focused required for the longterm success of the company the objective of our transformation has been and continues to be to create longterm value in the second quarter we took several actions to transform pitney bowes and to create value we closed on the sale of our world headquarters building and also closed on the sale of our marketing services business both of these transactions are clear evidence of our disciplined focus to unlock the value of our business and to be good stewards of our shareholders capital in the case of our marketing services business it was and is a great business it fit with our overall portfolio but is simply worth more to red ventures than it was to us this is a clear demonstration of the kinds of actions we will take in order to create value for our shareholders on the other side of the ledger and ill come back to this later in my comments we acquired borderfree borderfree is a perfect fit with our ecommerce business and is highly synergistic moreover it positions pitney bowes as a clear leader in a fastgrowing multibillion dollar marketplace the actions which we took which build on the work we did during the previous two years have strengthened our hand they improved our competitive positions in key markets and made us more focused and more efficient as a result were now at in inflection point in our transformation the cumulative effects of the steps weve taken over the past three months will begin to fuel sustained longterm growth and profitability in terms of the second quarter mike will give you the specific details but i would characterize the results as mixed our presort business continued to perform very well our north american smb business continued to improve and our north american software business executed well conversely our ecommerce business growth rates were negatively affected by the strong dollar and i would say our overall performance in europe was below what we had expected and in general the strong dollar continued to have a negative impact on our top and our bottomline in the nearterm the progress we made in the first half of the year sets us up for improved performance in the second half as for the longer term we will talk more about that at our analyst day in september let me now comment on the progress of our longterm strategic initiatives first the stabilization of our mail business in the second quarter the decline of our smb business continued to moderate and is now approaching the levels of performance we were experiencing before we adjusted our gotomarket albeit with a much more efficient and effective expense structure we expect to see continued progress in our north american smb business in the second half of the year likewise the progress we have made in our north american smb business reaffirms our conviction that we are on the right track with the changes we have made in europe although clearly the changes have caused temporary disruptions also of note we made an important product announcement on july th we announced relay multichannel communication suite relay is a major step forward in providing small and medium business with an integrated solution that creates communications for both digital and physical channels this product announcement is more than it may seem on first blush for a couple of reasons first this product announcement is an example of innovation in our legacy business this announcement is the first of several we are planning second and perhaps even more importantly this is a great example of taking our digital capabilities and then driving them into our legacy business and ultimately our  million clients initial responses from our clients from around the world have been very positive and we believe this product will provide a lift to our business in the second half of the year more and more our focus is how we make our individual businesses accretive to one another much more on this as we get to analyst day second our continued efforts to drive operational excellence into our business as ive always said operational excellence is only important if you can find the evidence in your balance sheet your income statement or your work with clients we are seeing progress in all of these measures our sga as a percent of revenue continued to improve in the second quarter and our debt levels were  million lower than a year ago the net of this is our gross and net margins continued to improve towards historically high levels also of note we removed two layers of management and structure in our european smb business we believe these actions will reduce bureaucracy improve our speed and accountability and obviously will reduce our overall expense structure finally we continued to make progress on our systems projects we exited an important phase of our systems test and entered into the next phase of testing with a focus on implementing in canada later this year this project will provide substantial benefits to our business unlock value and provide the right platform to better serve our clients the net impact of all of these changes is that we are dramatically simplifying our business and building an effective and efficient platform for growth finally growing our business through digital commerce the big highlight in the second quarter for this strategic initiative was the acquisition of borderfree mike will give you the specifics but this is one of the most exciting acquisitions ive been involved with borderfree had developed great capabilities for etailers and coupled with our bestofclass capabilities for emarketplaces the two businesses are highly synergistic in addition to providing more complete capabilities to the market there are substantial synergies with respect to cost and expense structures going forward we have bestofclass capabilities firstmover advantage in a multibillion dollar marketplace growing at double digit plus rates again we will talk more about this business at analyst day and once again our shipping software business had a good quarter growing at double digit rates were using our smb channel to sell the software product this is another example of how we use our capabilities in one business to make another business better one business being accretive to another business and using our global distribution to take our product quickly around the world also in the second quarter we consummated a smaller transaction that probably flew under the radar screen this acquisition was within our communications engagement software business we acquired a small company that does personalized video billing the acquisition increases the attractiveness of our core business and provides a very important capability to businesses that are creating bills the shortterm results have been very encouraging weve built a strong pipeline around the world and this is a great example of buying a capability that is accretive to our core business our software business had mixed results in the quarter we did have a difficult compare as we landed a few large transactions last year in the second quarter in the second quarter of this year we do not have the benefit of particularly large deals and our software business in europe performed below our expectations i expect these dynamics to improve in the fourth quarter finally one last comment on our marketing services business at one level it would have been easier to retain this business it was a good business fit and made substantial improvements to our business in the last two years and was clearly helping our top line and bottom line that said as stewards of our shareholders capital selling this business was the right thing to do today were also updating our guidance to balance a stronger outlook for the second half with the results through the first half of the year a key reason for our first half outcome was the deleterious impact currency had on our ecommerce business we expect these disruptions to be temporary and we are very encouraged by the deals we have signed since april and the pipeline for the second half of the year bottom line we expect the currency issues to stabilize and this business to be back on the growth path going forward therefore we are adjusting our fullyear revenue guidance to  to  mike will provide greater detail on our second half outlook in his remarks the important point is we always choose the creation of longterm shareholder value over the more expedient path so let me summarize while id characterize the second quarter and to an extent the first half results as mixed we do believe the second half of the year will be on a much different track and most importantly we will continue to take the actions that drive longterm value to our shareholders we have not and will not take the expedient path to optimize a quarter or even a year it would certainly be easier to avoid making the necessary investments in our systems investments in our brand forgo disruptions in our gotomarket to protect a quarter or to retain a business that was contributing to our quarterly results that is not what this management team this story or this company is all about as we get to the back half of this transformation the value and the benefits of our work is clearly in sight and my conviction and resolve about our path going forward is stronger than ever i will now turn the podium to mike michael monahan  chief financial officer chief operating officer  executive vice president thank you marc and good morning as we said when we originally provided guidance  is a transition year on the companys major transformation to unlock additional value for shareholders and clients as marc noted we are now at an inflection point in the business during the quarter we completed two significant transactions closed a number of open items continued to streamline operations and we saw our north american mailing revenue further stabilize as a result of our gotomarket changes accordingly ill spend a little more time this quarter delayering our results to clarify our operational progress and how we are positioned for an improving outlook beginning in the second half of the year during the first half of this year we remained focused on three key objectives to stabilize mail grow digital commerce and improve operational excellence in north american mailing we experienced a slowing rate of decline in revenue which was the lowest rate of decline in the last five quarters because of this trend and as the sales force becomes more productive we have higher confidence of continued improvement in revenue trends for this segment going forward globally the gotomarket transition is complete in most of our major markets we are now implementing our transition in france we expect these markets to improve in line with our north american experience additionally weve completed several changes in our geographic footprint to exit low margin countries the impact of which will annualize in the second half of this year we will continue to evaluate the best markets to maintain a direct business presence as a result of these and several other actions we have taken we have significantly reduced our cost structure throughout the business which has improved the companys overall margin while at the same time helping us to operate more efficiently we have yet to recognize the full benefits of some of these initiatives while we are seeing sga benefits of gotomarket changes across the portfolio we intend to leverage these new selling capabilities with new value propositions over the past several weeks and months we have brought to market several new products and services across our businesses that allow us to bring our technologies and platforms to different segments of our client base as marc mentioned we recently launched a saasbased smb relay communications hub which leverages our production mail and document security capabilities and also introduced our personal interactive video solutions for high volume mailers we will discuss these and other product plans further at our analyst day on september  weve also taken significant actions to reposition our portfolio focusing on high growth opportunities in the global digital commerce markets we exited our marketing services business for which we got good value and reinvested the proceeds in borderfree which significantly enhances our capabilities and positioning in crossborder ecommerce in addition to our operational progress we resolved a couple of open items we sold our former world headquarters building freeing up approximately  million of capital and reached a settlement in principle to resolve a previously disclosed outstanding matter with the department of justice weve also made substantial progress on our erp program and are preparing for an initial pilot we accomplished a lot in the second quarter our path forward is clear on how we will improve our operational performance additionally we have a stable capital structure that gives us flexibility in our capital allocation decisions so with that let me breakdown our second quarter results for you once again currency and the businesses we divested in europe last year had a meaningful impact on the comparison of our reported results for the quarter during the quarter currency translation adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by  million or  and our earnings per share by nearly  yeartodate currency reduced revenue by  million and earnings per share by  these impacts are a result of the rapid strengthening of the us dollar over the last year beyond the translation effects currency also continued to impact the volume of us outbound crossborder purchases in our ecommerce business additionally the divested revenues related to the strategic actions in europe from last year adversely impacted our revenue comparisons by more than  million or about  adjusting for currency and the businesses we divested in europe last year revenue would have declined about  these headwinds will annualize in the second half of the year let me now take you though the details of our income statement and then ill review our business segment results as a reminder the companys secondquarter earningsrelated documents which include our press release financial statements and slides can be found on our investor relations website also note we revised our segment reporting to reflect how we are now operating the company the digital commerce solutions segment group is now comprised of our software solutions and global ecommerce segment the global ecommerce segment results include our crossborder and shipping businesses a new segment called other includes the results of our recently divested marketing services business all other segments remain unchanged this will enhance investors ability to follow the performance of our key digital commerce growth initiatives going forward the reclassified segment reporting on a historical basis can also be found on our investor website turning to the income statement revenue for the quarter totaled  million which was a decline of  on a constant currency basis and  on a reported basis total revenue declined  compared to the prior year when adjusted for currency and the businesses we divested in europe last year on a constant currency basis and adjusted for the divested revenues in europe revenue declined  in smb solutions and  in enterprise business solutions revenue grew  in digital commerce solutions driven by growth in global ecommerce revenue declined  in the other segment as a result of the sale of marketing services during the quarter reported revenue including the significant impact of currency during the quarter declined  in smb solutions  in enterprise business solutions and was flat in the digital commerce solutions and declined  in other sga this quarter includes a onetime stockbased compensation charge of  million directly associated with the borderfree acquisition sga also includes one months worth of amortization of borderfree related intangibles of about  million adjusting for these items sga declined  million from the prior year and as a percent of revenue improved by about  basis points net interest expense which includes financing interest was  million which was a decline of more than  million when compared to the prior year adjusted ebit was  million and adjusted ebit margin improved to  or a  basis point improvement over prior year despite the inclusion of currency impacts loss of one month of imagitas income and amortization of borderfreerelated intangibles adding back depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda was  million the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was  compared to  in the prior year the lower tax rate this quarter is mostly due to the mix of earnings turning to earnings per share despite the lower revenue we were still able to deliver adjusted ebit margin improvement and earnings per share in line with our expectations gaap earnings per share were  for the quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were  included in adjusted eps is  per share of negative impact from currency adjusted eps excludes  per share of other income due to the net gain from the sale of imagitas  per share of other expense for transaction costs and fees related to the borderfree and imagitas transactions and the settlement in principle to resolve a previously disclosed outstanding matter with the department of justice  per share of compensation expense related to divesting of options associated with the borderfree acquisitions and  per share for restructuring and asset impairment charges including the sale of our former world headquarters building a reconciliation of our gaap eps to adjusted eps can be found in our earnings press release and earnings slides looking at free cash flow in the balance sheet free cash flow during the quarter was  million and  million on a gaap basis in comparison to the prior year second quarter free cash flow was lower primarily due to timing of working capital requirements lower reserve account deposits and less of a decline in finance receivables at the end of the quarter we had  billion of debt which was about  million lower than the prior year and we had  million of cash in shortterm investments on the balance sheet average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about  million lower than the prior year the average interest rate this quarter was  which was flat to the prior year during the quarter we returned  million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends made  million in restructuring payments and received approximately  million of cash related to the sale of our former world headquarters building also we have  million of share repurchase authorization remaining as share repurchases have become a higher priority in our capital allocation strategy we expect to begin utilizing this authorization in the third quarter and intend to complete the share repurchases that are currently authorized by the end of the year also at the end of the quarter we continued to have  million in commercial paper outstanding turning to our business segment results in north american mailing revenue for the quarter was  million and ebit was a  million revenue declined  on a constant currency basis and  on a reported basis while ebit increased  the decline in revenue was the lowest rate of decline in five quarters reflecting a continuation of the stabilization in results equipment sales declined at a low singledigit rate as the disruption from the change in gotomarket subside and as the sales organization becomes more productive recurring revenue streams trends were in line with prior quarters ebit margin was  and improved  basis points versus the prior year due to continued benefits from the mix of business organizational streamlining and other ongoing cost reduction initiatives in international mailing revenue for the quarter was  million and ebit was  million revenue declined  on a constant currency basis and  on a reported basis revenue declined  excluding currency and the divested revenues i mentioned earlier during the quarter results continued to be impacted by the implementation of the gotomarket initiative with most of our major markets now complete france is out of consultation and is now implementing its gotomarket transition revenue comparison was also adversely impacted by the timing of postal rate changes in a number of countries ebit margin was  which was a decline of  basis points versus the prior year due primarily to lower mail finishing equipment sales the impact of currency on some supply chain costs and the timing of postal rate changes turning to the enterprise business solutions group in production mail revenue for the quarter was  million and ebit was  million revenue declined  on a constant currency basis and  on a reported basis revenue would have declined  excluding currency and the divested revenues in europe related to this segment the decline this quarter was due to lower support services revenue and fewer equipment sales in europe and asia us equipment sales grew as a result of an increase in the number of inserting equipment installations ebit margin was  which was an improvement of  basis points versus the prior year due to favorable geographic mix and highermargin equipment sales as well as ongoing cost reduction initiatives in presort services revenue for the quarter was a  million and ebit was  million revenue grew  on both a constant currency and reported basis revenue benefited from higher volume of firstclass mail process versus the prior year ebit margin was  which was an improvement of  basis points versus the prior year due to revenue growth and ongoing operational productivity initiatives turning to the digital commerce solutions group for the software services segment revenue was  million and ebit was  million revenue declined  on a constant currency basis and  on a reported basis revenue was impacted by lower licensing and services sales in europe and asia pacific which offset growth in licensing revenue in the americas however as a result of gotomarket initiatives as well as new product introductions the business is signing on a larger number of quality midsized deals which will reduce dependency on onetime large deals and drive new client acquisition we are seeing this consistency and efficiencies in the business model playing out in substantially improved profitability in the software business this along with focused cost reduction initiatives to streamline the operations resulted in an ebit immediate margin of  which was an improvement of  basis points versus the prior year for the global ecommerce segment revenue was  million and ebit was  million revenue grew  on a constant currency basis and  on a reported basis revenue includes the borderfree acquisition late in the quarter and expansion of the ebay uk outbound crossborder service however outbound package shipments from the us continue to be pressured by the strong us dollar shipping solutions revenue continued to strengthen as a result of additional new clients the shipping business is also benefiting directly from sales improvement in the smb channel that markets its solutions to small and midsize companies ebit margin was  which was a decline of  basis points from the prior year as a result of ongoing operational cost and integration investments related to the borderfree acquisition as well as continued investment in the companys crossborder platforms within the other segment revenue was  million and ebit was  million revenue declined  on a constant currency and reported basis as a result of the sale of the marketing services business in may we recognized only two months of reported revenue this quarter versus a full quarter of revenue in the prior year that concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter now id like to discuss our annual guidance and provide some insights on our outlook as we continue to drive the transformation of the company as i mentioned in my opening remarks our accomplishments in the second quarter are expected to help drive improved results in the second half of the year we expect the consolidated revenue growth on a constant currency basis will improve in the third quarter from the current trend with more significant growth in the fourth quarter both driven by further stabilization of our mailrelated businesses benefits of new products and services and increased growth in our global ecommerce solutions the fourth quarter is also expected to benefit from growth in software solutions and the annualization of the impacts of the european market exits in  based on yeartodate results and our expectations of constant currency growth of  to  in the second half of the year we are adjusting our annual revenue guidance to a decline of  to growth of  when compared to  on a constant currency basis were increasing annual gaap eps guidance to be in the range of  to  this guidance includes the following  per share of other income related to the net gain from the sale of imagitas  per share of other expense for the settlement in principle of an outstanding matter with the department of justice and transaction costs and fees related to the borderfree and imagitas transactions and  per share of restructuring and asset impairment charges  per share of compensation expense related to the vesting of options associated with the borderfree acquisition  per share reduced earnings as a result of the sale of imagitas and  per share of reduced earnings related to borderfree which principally includes amortization of intangibles and integration in investments net of early savings from expected synergies we are also updating annual adjusted eps and free cash flow guidance solely to reflect the impacts of the borderfree acquisition and imagitas sale adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of  to  included in adjusted earnings per share is the assumption that currency will have a  per share negative impact for the full year free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of  million to  million this adjustment of  million simply reflects the impacts of the borderfree acquisition and the imagitas sale bottom line our adjusted earnings outlook remains unchanged except for the direct impacts of the two transactions while we have included a modest level of synergies this year related to the borderfree integration as well as the investments to realize benefits we are focused in the nearterm on driving a successful holiday season that said we see leverage across these highly complementary ecommerce businesses and we are targeting a run rate synergy benefits of  million to  million in  months through the elimination of public company costs logistics leverage and the consolidation of infrastructure well provide greater details regarding our ecommerce growth strategy and related growth prospects at our analyst day in september again as marc and i both noted we view this quarter as an inflection point weve taken a number of actions and made decisions that we believe will keep us on track to increase the longterm value of our company were confident that our performance our products and our portfolio actions will deliver on the strategic initiatives we laid out more than two years ago that concludes my remarks operator can you please open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you very much and our first question in queue will come from ananda baruah with brean capital please go ahead ananda p baruah  brean capital llc hi good morning guys thanks for taking the questions i guess a few if i could the first is mike could you just sort of walk us through the components of the adjusted eps guide down there is a number of things in the gaap adjustments and just trying to make sure we understand the components to the adjusted eps change in guidance thanks and i have some followups michael monahan  chief financial officer chief operating officer  executive vice president sure in terms of the adjusted eps guidance forward there are really simply two items that are adjustments to our prior guidance one is  related to the imagitas business sale that would be the earnings of that business in the second half of the year and you would note that in that business typically there are big  there is a third quarter because of the move season around the summer time but that specifically relates to their earnings the second is related to the borderfree acquisition of  adjustment that really reflects principally the amortization of the intangibles that are related to the acquisition the amortization for the – basically for the seven months of the year that we would own the business theres net about an additional penny related to investments associated with integration of the business offset by some early synergies associated with the business so the net change is  in the adjusted earnings eps range and thats specifically related to those two items ananda p baruah  brean capital llc got it and just as a housekeeping question in that context i believe last quarter you had talked about an incremental – baked into the old guidance incremental expense for ongoing erp and marketing programs has that changed at all or is that still – it wasnt called out this quarter but just want to make sure that nothing has changed there in it michael monahan  chief financial officer chief operating officer  executive vice president it continues to be in our base some of the obviously components vary from quartertoquarter we continue on track with both of those initiatives and well continue to incur costs related to those in the second half but those are in our guidance assumptions ananda p baruah  brean capital llc okay got it thanks and then – the  to  constant currency growth for the second half of the year is pretty strong i realized there is – some of it is you have stuff ramping and theres some kind of easy compares stuffs in there as well but generally speaking do you have more confidence now based on what youve seen in the pipeline that what has been your constant currency guidance which i – i believe has been kind of  to  is a reasonable way to think about the normalized run rate of the business once you get through you know sort of all the – sort of normalized model i guess kind of comping this and transacting that marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director the short answer is yes we do think thats a reasonable going forward expectation the reason we are more the reason we are confident in the second half projections really breaks into two categories first of all from a macroeconomic perspective you know as you look around the world clearly the expectations for higher gdp growth that will inevitably help us secondly we do think some of the effects of currency and will either begin to wrap andor stabilize so you are in presumably a better macroeconomic environment the part that gives us the most confidence however is with is whats within our own grasp and ill – ill point to a couple of topics first of all as you look at our channel maturation for smb in north america as well as europe exfrance youre another quarter along i expect north america to be more or less kind of back on the horse in the second half of the year and europe smb exfrance again to be performing more in line with our longterm expectations in the second half of the year the pipeline indicates that kind of what weve seen in the business so far in the case thats point one point two as it relates to ecommerce in particular if you look at the clients that were signed in the second quarter coupled with whats in the pipeline you can touch and feel those revenue streams as they come online so that gives us a high degree of confidence there and then finally you mentioned personal but that will help we got the two new product announcements that will help so we got a lot of things are in flight – currently in flight that are already out there that will begin to help in the third quarter and help substantially in the fourth quarter michael monahan  chief financial officer chief operating officer  executive vice president and then i just wanted to add one thing to reinforce a point i made earlier which is we are talking first half second half but obviously there are factors that will impact the third quarter and then i highlighted some factors that will be more significant in the fourth quarter so we expect a progression the third quarter to be better than the second and the fourth to be better than the third based on the rollout of these opportunities ananda p baruah  brean capital llc thats really useful guys just one last quick one here can you just put some a little bit greater context around how you guys envision ongoing improvements in north american smb because it sounds like you have two things working for you now you have  you have the gotomarket kind of programs in place but then you guys also have sort of the new products that are rolled out and i guess if you could just sort of like i dont know i know youre going to give guidance on the analyst day on this but just give us some sense of how material each of those things could be and then just a second thing on ecommerce is marc your comments on the call just now about about new wins in the business that you kind have lines of sight of revenue is that legacy pitney ecommerce or does some of that also include borderfree and then ill cede the floor thanks marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director so in reverse order its both both legacy pitney bowes as well as borderfree had some very important signings in the second quarter which will begin to deliver benefits as we get into the back half of the year specifically december as we get to the fourth quarter and the holiday season as it relates to north american smb if you look at the original guidance that we had talked about in terms of our longterm model we have a set goal post of between minus  and minus  in the second quarter ex currency we were at  minus  as mike indicated that decline was the best performance that we had in five quarters parenthetically its the second best performance we have had since i have been here that said we do see continued improvement in that business in the second half of the year our objective has been and continues to be to operate on right side of that football field between minus  and minus  we are not there yet but we are getting closer and its in our sights and id say the product announcement will help and the channel maturation really helps as well ananda p baruah  brean capital llc thanks a lot guys congrats michael monahan  chief financial officer chief operating officer  executive vice president thank you operator thank you our next question in queue that will come from george tong with piper jaffray please go ahead george k f tong  piper jaffray  co broker hi good morning michael monahan  chief financial officer chief operating officer  executive vice president good morning george k f tong  piper jaffray  co broker can you provide some additional details on how the sales of your process is progressing in france and what the key issues are there and when you expect growth trends there to be stabilized michael monahan  chief financial officer chief operating officer  executive vice president sure as weve talked about in the last quarter in terms of france there is a works council process that you must work through we completed the consultation phase and were now in the transition phase meaning we are moving resources into the new model we are hiring in new sales people in some cases and we expect all that to be in place by september so that as we finish the third quarter and enter the fourth quarter we will have that program fully in place george k f tong  piper jaffray  co broker got it and turning to international smb more broadly now that the gotomarket changes are largely complete do you expect revenue growth to revert back to levels prior to the restructure and whats the timeline michael monahan  chief financial officer chief operating officer  executive vice president yeah in terms of international clearly we expect there to be quartertoquarter improvement in the growth rates as we go forward as we talked about different countries are in different sort of stages of completion on this i would say the uk through the first half of the year has already seen stabilization in their revenue germany is a little bit behind that but fully completed in the transition and now really enhancing productivity i would say the nordics are in the same place and then france really rounds out the major markets in europe so we do see that probably the biggest challenge for us is behind us in terms of the international business and well look for quartertoquarter continued improvement in that as the organizations sort to settle in and drive productivity marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director one other point that i should have mentioned just to add on to mikes i mean we obviously wrap on the divestitures in the international markets as we get into the second half of the year so well have a little bit of that in our results in the third quarter but fourth quarter is pretty clean and thats been a  million or so headwind each quarter so thats substantial to international mailing but its not immaterial to the overall portfolio george k f tong  piper jaffray  co broker got it thats helpful and then lastly can you talk a little bit about the channel synergies that youre already starting to see between borderfree and your existing ecommerce business and how do you free up potential revenue synergies from complementary product and sales channels between borderfree and ecommerce marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director its a great question i mean so if you were to reflect back on mikes description of the synergies what you observe is those are all cost and expense that he described so i would parenthetically comment that that gives you a higher degree confidence that those synergies that were outlined are something that we have within our grasp importantly we didnt predicate those synergies on revenue top side opportunities that wasnt because we didnt see them it was just because we wanted to base the synergies on what we could describe with a high degree of confidence the revenue synergies will come from principally the following if you think about our respective development and innovation roadmaps there was a reasonable amount of overlap in what they were trying to innovate around and what were trying to innovate around as you go forward youll able to rationalize those respective development plans so youll be able to innovative even faster in the respective emarketplaces and etailers so i think thats principally where we see the opportunities we see this as a very exciting space to be able to innovate for our clients and to solve a real a reallife problem and i think with the two leaders in this very nascent market together theres just a lot of top side opportunity we didnt bank on it in the business case but its not because we dont think its there george k f tong  piper jaffray  co broker great thanks very much operator thank you our next question is queue will come from shannon cross with cross research please go ahead shannon s cross  cross research llc thank you very much for taking my question i just had a couple the first is – are you done with divestures and acquisitions at this point do you think you kind of got the assets or are there any other pieces you might be able to – to spinoff marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director i looked up the questions and answers from the first quarter and that was the same question you asked in the first quarter you are very consistent so its good to be able to count on some things in the life ill give you the shannon s cross  cross research llc i try i try marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director ill give you the same answer in that value in the marketplace has continued to evolve therefore your portfolio needs to continue to evolve there is – you know i had always articulated two criteria for staying in the portfolio one was you got an acceptable level of return and second were strategically coherent and i guess what marketing services taught me was i really should have articulated a third criteria in that if a business is worth substantially more to someone else than it is to you then its the right thing to do for your shareholders to consummate that transaction so as i look at our portfolio today i like how everything fits and clearly were on the path of making acceptable returns i will not preclude those dynamics changing and its certainly hard to predict the dynamics of how one enterprise sees value versus how you see it in terms of acquisitions we continue to look at our development plans for the next five years and we look at make versus buy decisions weve got a series of i would characterize as mostly smaller types of transactions that we look at and if we can get those for the right price well do it but again i do not see in our future anything that would be characterized as acquisitions that are outside of our strike zone shannon s cross  cross research llc okay great and then my second question is just with regard to the share repurchase which you said youre now going to be completing by the end of the year do you look at that as something from an ongoing standpoint you want to keep the program in place going forward i just – it goes under cash usage which you just talked about acquisitions but i guess how do you think about cash return to shareholders going forward michael monahan  chief financial officer chief operating officer  executive vice president i think in terms of cash return to shareholders as weve really done a lot of work on our balance sheet as we look at sort of the balance of growth opportunities in the business the additional leverage we should get as we go forward and implement our impact program we feel good about the free cash flow profile of the business as we go forward so we see return of capital as an ongoing component of our capital allocation program as we move forward that said obviously if theres a particular opportunity for reinvestment in the business were always going to look at that as well and its total impact on shareholder return marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director you can discern from our actions where our view is of how to drive shareholder value at this point in time but its always predicated on whats going on in the marketplace what your stock price is at what other opportunities you have for that cash what youre seeing is kind of our view of that dynamic right now and i believe that will continue for the foreseeable future but it is a fairly dynamic market shannon s cross  cross research llc great thank you very much michael monahan  chief financial officer chief operating officer  executive vice president thank you operator thank you next in queue is glenn mattson with ladenburg thalmann please go ahead glenn g mattson  ladenburg thalmann  co inc broker hi good morning guys a question  a little bit more on the borderfree i was curious when the ecommerce business really took off a couple of years back there were occasional references to the idea that there may be other very large partners out there beyond ebay that would also benefit from this service is part of the maybe extreme upside case on the borderfree acquisition  the part of the idea there that perhaps this could help you finalize or close some of those larger deals with larger partners marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director well listen ill say a couple of things first of all the legacy pitney bowes business made some reasonable progress on that front in the second quarter well talk more about that as we get into the back half of the year i would say more importantly that going forward combination of the two businesses provides the possibility of more compelling value propositions to our clients glenn g mattson  ladenburg thalmann  co inc broker okay great and then  i think i know the answer but just to check the box the – do you anticipate any disruption role from the ebays split up with paypal michael monahan  chief financial officer chief operating officer  executive vice president there is – theres obviously been an ongoing working relationship and dialogue with ebay and so thats continued throughout the process that theyve gone through and we would expect that to remain a good working relationship glenn g mattson  ladenburg thalmann  co inc broker right great okay thanks guys michael monahan  chief financial officer chief operating officer  executive vice president thank you operator yeah at this time if theres no additional questions in queue i will turn the conference back to our presenter for any closing comments marc bradley lautenbach  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator id like to close on three points first of all im not terribly pleased with how we executed in the quarter there were some bright spots in the north america smb did better presort continued to do reasonably well and the north america software business performed reasonably that being said on balance we should have done better and we are taking actions to improve our execution as we get into the second half of the year the second point i think its the more important point is that we really made substantial progress on our longterm strategy in the second quarter the acquisition of borderfree i believe will be game changing we are the market leader with first mover advantage in a very substantial and fast growing market also worth noting and we havent talked a lot about this but we have a worldclass management team in that business right now that gives me even more confidence you will see more about this but it is something that gives us great optimism in our smb business the new market approach is settling down we see clearly within our sites improvements both in the north american smb business as well as international mailing again setting us up for the longterm very very well finally we continued to drive operational excellence and thereby unlock substantial shareholder value continue to become efficient simplifying our business and rationalizing our portfolio significantly we continued to make real progress with our systems work and as mike indicated the benefits are now crowing in our sides i said in my prepared remarks that our focus is to create shareholder value and well always choose the creation of shareholder value over a more expedient path of protecting a quarter or a year ill make the point that strategies are necessarily longterm in nature ive now been at this about  months we describe this as a three year to five year transformation and you can see as you get to the back half of that transformation the benefits are clearly within our grasp as i said at the outset i am very very pleased with where we are in our overall transformation and as i said the benefits are now in our sights i look forward to giving you a more detailed update at our analyst day in september until then we will see you thank you operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen this conference

products and solutions this aligns our physical and digital capabilities along with our mobile location and ecommerce technologies with all the endtoend requirements that drive commerce to my mind this was more than a product announcement this is the foundation for all of our future products and solutions adding digital capabilities and webbased solutions that span all of our business units it is also a demonstration of how were redefining and transforming pitney bowes by expanding our reach as we cement existing client relationships and cultivate new ones and it broadens our addressable market for our  million clients by an order of magnitudethis is a substantial opportunity for our company and is consistent with the strategy weve been pursuing for the past three years while our competitors may have parts for the commerce solution were the only company that provides such a broad range of commerce solutions that deliver the functionality speed and agility our clients need from small businesses to large global companies in addition to the launch of the commerce cloud we achieved a number of milestones during the first quarter that will further advance our transformationin january we launched our first major television advertising campaign in  years we completed our move to a dealer market in mexico south africa and five markets in asia and finally we deployed our newly designed business processes and the accompanying technology in april while we sometimes refer to this as an erp project it is much bigger it is a complete redesign of our business processes as weve said this product is key for us to realize the benefits of the investments we have made and delivered new products such as those enabled by our commerce cloud those benefits are clearly in our sights and we are evaluating the feasibility of accelerating our business caseturning to the results for our first quarter our financial performance was largely consistent and in line with our expectations save our software solutions businesses we turned in another strong performance in presort and global ecommerce businesses while smb revenue trends continued to stabilize and improve smb new equipment sales a leading indicator of our future reoccurring revenue streams were positive highlighted by the largest growth in north america equipment sales in several yearshowever our software solutions business performance was disappointing simply put we did not execute and while the business issues we see are not complicated we need to fix them im confident that the new leadership team will we have the right products and our software solutions strategy is resonating with our clients during the quarter we added a new president a new leader to drive our channel strategy and a new head of marketing in december we appointed a new worldwide sales leader to drive sales efficiency and productivity globally we expect that this business can and should be better while the market conditions in the technology industry are currently not great im confident that we will see a slow and steady improvement in our software solutions business throughout the yearnow as i have a recorder  let me update
