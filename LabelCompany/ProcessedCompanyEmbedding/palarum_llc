dude abides man navigation menu our mission palm products llc is a growing and dynamic ecommerce retailer we track analyze and use our years of experience to manage market and retail products for some of nation’s top manufacturers we are committed to a mutual success between us and our brand partnerssuppliers through versatility adaptability and most importantly…quality relationships our strategies there is no such thing as a “one size fits all” approach…especially when it comes to ecommerce every product we take on deserves a different approach tailored ultimately for the consumer seeking the purchase with online shopping there is no need for the old marketing methods of “broadcasting” in hopes to build a topofmind name recognition for when then consumer is ultimately making a buying decision we focus on a “narrowcasting” approach that seeks to serve as an informational resource for consumers shopping for that product this can be done through a mix of search engine optimization keyword strategies and channel distribution our insights our years of experience in online retailing have taught us a couple things first too many retailers use price as their sole marketing method especially online it becomes a race to the bottom with pricing by trying to gain a market share strictly through being the lowest price this is the easy way to do it and takes the least amount of work strategy and knowhow we believe this will ultimately hurt the brand in both perception to consumer and bottom line of the income statement second we “narrowcast” this is probably something you will hear us say a lot when focusing on reaching consumers we try and be as specific as possible for instance instead of building an advertising campaign focused on a generality like women ages  to 0 we believe in building a more focused approach like women ages  to  who live in the northeast and watch grey’s our future the future is bright we are excited for the direction that our company is moving and the partnerships that we have built the dynamics of today’s marketplace mean that we are constantly searching and refining what our strategies focuses and channels will be in the future copyright

virginia washington west virginia wisconsin wyoming   zip code   what is an llc like a corporation a limited liability company or llc is a separate and distinct legal entity  this means that an llc can have its own tax identification number and bank account  the primary advantage of an llc is that its owners have limited liability meaning that under most circumstances the owners are not personally liable for the liabilities and debts of the llc  for example if an llc is forced into bankruptcy the owners will not be required to pay the llcs debts with their own money  if the assets of the llc are not enough to cover the debts and liabilities the creditors generally cannot look to the owners managers or officers for relief an llc can be taxed either as a passthrough entity like a sole proprietorship or partnership or as a regular corporation  by default an llc is taxed as a passthrough entity where the owners just pay taxes on the profits of the llc at their individual tax rates  this is different from a regular c corporation which pays a corporate tax on its net income before distributing profits to the stockholders the owners as dividends  when the corporation distributes profits the stockholders also must pay income tax on these dividends  most llc owners choose to have the profits passthrough so that taxes are only paid once on the profits totallegal™ has
