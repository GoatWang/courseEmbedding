north american microcap equity – pacific view asset management llc home contact us select page los angeles ca london uk – london bridge opportunity  philosophy investment strategy product offered investment team investment strategy north american microcap equity opportunity  philosophy the objective of our north american microcap equity strategy is long term absolute capital appreciation our philosophy is based upon the notion that microcap companies are a neglected asset class providing ample opportunities for researchminded investors our goal is to capitalize on this anomaly by maintaining a nimble capital base conducting rigorous due diligence on all companies under consideration performing thorough channel checks and maintaining regular dialogue with management teams the microcap segment of the north american us and canadian public equities market – businesses with market capitalizations of  million or less – is a target rich environment a vast universe of approximately  companies or  of all north american public equities fall within the microcap segment this layer of the market tends to sit beyond the reach of many institutional investors given the liquidity constraints and utter lack of wall street research coverage we believe the experience of our portfolio managers provides us with a distinct advantage in this asset class having spent the majority of their careers investing in microcaps  years for jim boucherat and  years for david lasalle they have developed an impressive network of longterm oriented investors and corporate management teams making it easier for us to source vet and pursue opportunities in this notoriously inefficient asset class this is a buy and hold investment strategy that has been extremely taxefficient we anticipate that the strategy will close at approximately  million of assets under management investment strategy our investment process is predicated upon deepdive fundamental research we are in pursuit of quality businesses with strong balance sheets which typically equates to little or no debt and net cash from a portfolio perspective our holdings tend to be selffunding generating positive free cash flow we purchase shares of these businesses when they are relatively unknown and selling at very low multiples to cash flow generally less than x  year out evebitda but growing operating income at approximately  annually or better moreover we look to incorporate investment themes within our work which leads us to businesses benefiting from a sustained undercurrent of capital spending such as fiscal expenditure initiatives changes in government regulation or highly disruptive technological advances given our orientation toward companies with solid balance sheets strong financials and low valuations our work is highly focused on a subset of the microcap universe that does not suffer from quantitative or qualitative opacity generally speaking we do not invest in financials utilities pharmabiotech or oil and gas producers product offered pvam perlus microcap strategy the pvam perlus microcap strategy invests in the microcap segment of the north american us and canadian public equities market our portfolio holds shares of approximately  –  businesses with market capitalizations of typically  million or less our portfolio allocations are based entirely upon the availability of investment opportunities if valuations are attractive for the asset class and we are finding an abundance of interesting companies the portfolio will be close to fully invested conversely if valuations become less enticing and individual positions are trimmed or eliminated or where there is a shortage of attractively priced opportunities we will allow our cash position to
