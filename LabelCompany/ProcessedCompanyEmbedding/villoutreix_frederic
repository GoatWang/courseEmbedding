release are available on the investor relations section of our website wwwswmintlcom ill now turn the call over to frederic frederic villoutreix thank you mark and good morning everyone we finished  on a strong note with full quarter adjusted eps of  driving full year adjusted eps to  above annual guidance of  echoing comments on recent quarters for the year indiscernible plan excellent cost management and solid manufacturing execution as well as very strong performance from our niche wrapper and binder reconstituted tobacco products provided powerful upset to the expected volume declines in lip and rtl also for full year  argotec delivered an efficient target and currency translation was less impactful than we assumed the primarily areas of underperformance were delstar top and bottom line and the other oil contribution of our chinese joint venture operating cash flow of  million was about  lower than  and weve lowered our total capex of about  million free cash finished at roughly  million one significant item relating to gaap eps but excluded from adjusted eps was  noncash impairment charge related to rebranding activities within ams which we will elaborate on shortly looking back on  we made significant strides in our strategic transformation highlighted by the late fourth quarter announcement of the conwed acquisition which just closed in january conwed adds scale to our ams platform and its an attractive standalone business with solid growth prospects and the trailing ebitda margin of  more importantly though conwed is expected to be a most synergistic acquisition to date as its specialty netting products and manufacturing operations are highly complementary with those of delstar while the effective purchase multiple was less than  times ebitda when considering the sizable cash tax benefit of the deal structure that multiple could end at being below  times if we achieve targeted synergies with conwed annualized ams segment sales are well over  million and conweds existing margin structure coupled with synergy potential yield a clear path to several ams segment margin expansion ams now participates in five key end markets filtration infrastructure and construction transportation industrial and medical and in several of these areas we believe our specialty applications at industry leading positions and high longterm growth prospects more broadly speaking our total nontobacco sales including nontobacco papers are expected to grow from  million or  of total sales in  to about  million or approximately  in  we consider  threshold a significant milestone in swm expectation efforts other recent highlights and actions include the initiation of rebranding activities in the ams segment progress on global erp system implementation in the ams derisking part of filtering rates debt structure and other dividend increase regarding the rebranding initiative as part of our vision to optimize the operations of the acquired businesses and one ams as one seamlessly integrated segments we made a strategic decision to rebrand and to have a corporate swm name in  and move away from the legacy corporate names of delstar argotec and now conwed while we will keep the vast majority of the product brand names recognized in the marketplace well continue in customer service the decision to rebrand at a high level to trigger the impairment of the acquired trade names these noncash impairment affected our gaap financial results however we believe it is positive move that we deliver our long term benefits as we transition from a legacy tobacco paper company to a more diversified manufacturer of engineering materials it is important that we shape swm marketplace image as a producer of customized solutions with multiple fiber and resin based technologies for specialty applications across industries furthermore these actions will facilitate stronger customer relationships and cost selling opportunities as our realigned ams sales organization we focused on selling products from across ams platform as oppose to selling mostly products on their respective legacy operations supporting those cost selling efforts as well as our other segment optimization plants is the ongoing rollout of shared erp system which well think values operational aspects across those things consistent with our actions to manage ams more holistically we have also begin communicating about ams in a new manner of beginning with first quarter results we will focus more on our five key end markets and application performance as oppose to the delstar and argotec businesses the engineered paper segment delivered solid fourth quarter and full year despite the expected lip and rtl volume declines cigarette paper volumes including our chinese joint venture ctm were down  in the fourth quarter and  for the year lip volumes were down sharply as a year ago quarter was the initial inventory built by our rlt and lip customers ahead of changing packaging regulations making this an especially top comparison while sales orders have resumed in a more normalized level we will face another difficult comparison in the first quarter of  fourth quarter recon volumes including our chinese joint venture cts were down  and down  for the fullyear we had communicated an expected  plus decline for the year thus we did somewhat outperform our forecast customer reblending decisions materialized as anticipated however we expect the full annualized impact will continue to affect the results into the first half of  separately  volumes from our french mill benefited on the favorable timing of certain orders into china which will likely create a difficult comparison in  lastly during the fourth quarter and throughout the year we had better than expected performance from our niche wrapper and binder reconstituted tobacco products which finally serve the us cigar markets other than domestic facility this business was expected to decline in  however we had strong sales growth in these high margins specialty products which contributed nicely to overall earnings performance unfortunately it is hour ph to assume this sustainable and a project that also adds further pressure to the comparison for  nontobacco paper volumes continue to show strong growth and include profit margins partly due to some price increases with respect to our chinese joint ventures full quarter strong with an  eps contribution however weakness earlier in  was not recovered and they finished the year with a  eps contribution little over  in  and well below our expected world plants results of our multinational customers continue to indicate annuals smoking attrition in europe and the us remains lower relative to historical norms and market data suggest the chinese cigarette market continue to contract from peak  levels regarding execution of our ep segment priorities cost actions in the asia operations were far liability to deliver strong ep segment results as we combated lower volumes while new products that leverage our paper and reconstitution technology did not contribute to financial results in  we have made headway on several fronts in the first half of  we completed  million investment to modify an existing data machine to produce a specialty inflation paper we delivered positive results in production trials and expect to begin customer qualifications in the second half of the year with commercial sales potentially beginning in  this marks the first major cost selling synergy of legacy swm and ams leveraging ph products leveraging our ep segment paper technology and capacity with ams commercial relationships and filtration separately while too early to assume significant sales in  customer trails are on the way with reconstitution technology in the cosmetics and packaging industries furthermore swm reconstituted tobacco plays a permanent role in certain heatnotburn reduced risk tobacco products we are working with several major cigarette manufactures on this rapidly emerging reputation and are already gearing sales to one two partner with an expected rampup beginning this year long term increased consumer adoption of this technology may represent a significant opportunity to recoup some of the last profits on recent rtl weaknesses now switching to ams for the fourth quarter net sales were up  while organic sales were down  and essentially flat on a constant currency basis similar to recent quarters water filtration remains soft but we saw offsetting growth in other filtration areas for the full year the most impactful item that drove the  constant currency organic sales decline was lower sales in the industrial channel much of which we exited intentionally certain products and customers carried low possibility argotec delivered another solid quarter and for the full year delivered sales growth at the high end of our stated longterm expectation of  to  driven by automotive paint protection products argotec largest and fastest growing product line regarding  strategic priorities argotec delivered on plan and was highly accretive as expected integration went smoothly and we are progressing on a more holistic segment wide optimization plan conwed also now fits into these plans as we further leverage our assets and capabilities to grow sales improve manufacturing operations and ultimately drive margin higher with respect to volatility we had previously experienced in filtration sales related to the oil gas and mining industries we are encouraged by the stabilization and return to growth in this other filtration markets which include both in the energy and commodity industry but also other areas of liquid filtration we will begin referring to these nonwater filtration applications as processed filtration on the commercial synergies front we have laid the groundwork for enhanced ability to crosssell with a state rollout of a new erp system and increase cost business engagement of our rd teams and sales organizations furthermore the ams segment reblending activities mentioned earlier are also expected to enable more cost selling as we look ahead to  our outlook of  of adjusted eps represents a slight decline of  versus  the most significant items incorporated in our  outlooks are the projected accretion on the conwed acquisition and the expected offsetting weakness in the recon business as described earlier based on performance of our niche wrapper and binder product line is likely to reverse and we expect that sales timing of rtl sales and our french mill into china will negatively impact yearoveryear comparisons these two factors add to the carryover effect of customer reblending decisions that impacted us in  although customer discussions are particularly limited to one year for our volume commitments our best indication are currently for a return to a more normalized business conditions beyond  to the extent this business stabilize although the longterm  although our financial results should benefit from reduced volatility as a significant portion of engineered papers headwinds in recent years relate to the consequences of the belgium lease other supply though less significant indeed really there also settled puts and takes the cost of business that factor into our outlook on the positive side we anticipate a year of resumed ams segment organic growth within delstar we expect growth across the business with the exception of some share loss with one customer we are working on technology improvements within this business as well as other initiatives to find opportunities to replace this large volume in a possible manner in addition to improve organic sales growth we anticipate higher margin on operational improvements and cost reduction actions we have taken in response to sales softness in the past year another area of expected profit growth is our chinese joint ventures we faced challenges last year and fell short of our goals but we expect strong doubledigit profit growth from the  of eps contribution we delivered in  with respect to some of the headwinds factored into guidance the operational ones stand mostly from the recon business as well as one other item in the engineered papers segment as part of our longterm contract with an lip competitor the royalty rate we receive will decrease in  by about half third the contract the reduced rate will remain and to our key patterns escalation in  the other negative factors were largely nonoperating thus we have entered into a new interest rate swap which will result in higher interest rate expenses though it will reduce our exposure to rise in interest rates second with our fewer tax credits and due to tax flow changes in europe we no longer receive payable tax treatment at our lip printing facility in poland in summary with conwed and rtl offsetting each other and most of the other operating and financing related items balancing out our projected decline is approximately equal to the tax driven headwinds though we see it as a prudent at this early stage to be conservative with our  guidance should some of the positive trends in engineered paper carrying into  specifically sales momentum of niche reconstituted tobacco products and the strong cost management of across our business that could be upside to this guidance segment priorities remain largely unchanged from  in ams we will be highly focused on integrating conwed and delivering on expected synergies these actions are part of the larger goal of optimizing the entire ams segment operations to unlock the value of running the highly complementary business of delstar argotec and conwed as one units within engineered papers we will continue to maximize cash flow by efficiently managing our capacity selectively trading price concessions on market share and making prudent investments to monetize our paper assets and technology i will now turn the call over to allison allison aden thank you frederic ill now review some financial highlights for the fourth quarter net sales declined  or  on a constant currency basis the quarter benefited from the addition of argotec however that was more than offset by the expected sales weakness from lower lip and rtl volumes fourth quarter ep segment net sales were down  or  on a constant currency basis we know that given the strong lip volumes in the fourth quarter of  this was anticipated within the ams segment net sales were up  in the fourth quarter however excluding the effect of the argotec acquisitions sales declined with  due to unfavorable currency movement the engineered paper segment adjusted operating margin was up  basis points in the fourth quarter consistent with strong recent trends in overall segment profitability as we manage our cost structure efficiently the ams segment adjusted operating profit margin improved by  basis points and benefited from the argotec acquisition and lower revenue cost consolidated adjusted operating margin was  in the fourth quarter for the full year we highlight that despite higher corporate cost and the operating challenges of lower lip and rtl volumes we see margin expansion not only within the paper business within our consolidated results as well regarding items excluded from our adjusted operating profit which typically only include restructuring charges and noncash amortization of intangibles we recorded trade name impairment in conjunction with the rebranding activities discussed earlier the pretax expense was approximately  million shifting to consolidated earnings fourth quarter  gaap eps was  down from  in the prior year driven primarily by the operational trends already discussed and the trade name impairment restructuring and impairment expenses intangible asset amortization and certain favorable tax items are excluded from adjusted eps which was  down from  in the prior year to clarify the tax benefits we received during the fourth quarter were excluded from adjusted eps most had to do with the late  legislative tax change in france in short legislation tax that will lower our effective tax rate beginning in  while there is no  tax rate benefit the expectation of lower future taxes for significant reductions in deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheet creating positive gaap earnings had it not been received and several relatively smaller items our effective tax rate for  would have been approximately  which is a good proxy for  expectations moving on from tax the impact of currency translation was negative  to both gaap and adjusted eps of the fourth quarter while fourth quarter sales and adjusted eps were down results exceeded our expectation and contributed to exceeding our annual guidance of  by  fullyear gaap eps of  was slightly lower than the  implied by our guidance as the fourth quarter trade and impairments and the onetime tax benefits were not known at a time we issued that outlook  free cash flow was just under a  million down to about  million a year ago the key factor in this decrease was a working capital outflow of revenue versus an inflow of  million in  resulting in a negative  million yearoveryear impact a decrease in income tax payable accounted nearly be entire impact for business related working capital items such as inventories receivables and payables were essentially net neutral from a leverage perspective for the terms of our credit facility we were at two times net debt adjusted ebitda at the end of  down from  times at the beginning of the year however more importantly immediately following the close of conwed transaction in january pro forma leverage was at  times and as communicated at the time we announced the conwed transaction we expect to return to the mid two times range by the end of  now back to frederic frederic villoutreix thank you allison outside of our  results and  outlook i would like to address the significant progress of swms strategic transformation when we announced our intention to diversify the business and reposition the company as a more growth oriented enterprise back in  we had only about  million in sales outside of our tobacco operations with conwed we expect to be around  million this year most of which is in the advanced materials and structures growth platform we have executed a plan we would characterize as patience and discipline and while our passed has had obstacles along the way we are quite pleased with the acquisitions we made and the opportunities ahead ams is a portfolio of highly complementary businesses it has attractive sales flow prospects and the potential for adjusted operating margins to expand another several hundred basis points into the high teens the key element of realizing this opportunity is exhibiting on the conwed integration and synergy plans this year as we stated when we announced the acquisition conwed has been an acquisition target since late  when we acquired delstar given the two businesses highly synergistic fit we believe this acquisition represents exceptional value to our shareholders in the context of swm order why we are disappointed that our  guidance reflects a slight decrease in earnings we are not losing sight of our estimated goals to reposition the company for structural longterm profit growth we define this as ams having enough scale and growth to offset the normal attrition challenges of the tobacco business and believe we are nearing that tipping point through this transition cash flow has remained relatively strong balance sheet leverage remains comfortable despite several sizable acquisitions we have steadily increased our dividends and we have made many positive organizational changes to better equip swm to deliver on that goal of long term profit growth we will work diligently to execute our plans this year and aim to deliver above guidance as we did in  but more importantly as we look forward to setting the stage for input long term results we appreciate your continued interest and support that concludes our remarks glenda please open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of julie li from drexel hamilton your line is now open julie li good morning thank you so much for taking my questions my first question is about rtls sales decline can you give us a little bit more color in  rtl do you see the  sales reduction in fourth quarter would continue lets say maybe first half of  there will be similar level of decline and then over the whole year  there will be low double digit decline in rtl or do you see  we are already at  the worst time and soon rtl would properly maintain the same sales levels in fourth quarter frederic villoutreix first of all i think fourth quarters are usually week quarters that is a typical time of a year where customers adjust their inventories and also shutdown  lower their production so i don’t believe we can take last quarter as an indication of how we are going to start  just let me recap maybe some of the key drivers we are  the continuation in the first half of  of the consequence volume drop due to reblending decisions that were made over a year ago resulting from the other supply of the belgium tobacco leaf on the other hand we have add the strong activity on wrapper and binder for machinemade small cigars and there is a solvency has to be outlook going forward but we finished the year  with total momentum and that will not disappear immediately so netnet our weak – recons of cigarette due to the reblending decision but  as to when we will see a weakening of wrapper and binder sales during the course of  kind of neutralize some of the effects that you described in your question i think what we can say is that we are projecting an overall year of decline and will be qualified in  plus the two upsides are the wrapper and binder situation i just described but also the ramp of heatnotburn rlt grade if you want and theres been a lot of discussions by our customers about the momentum we are seeing in their own sales of the numbers reduce risk products and this is going to be a tailwind to our results this year but i think apparently in the years to come and that really is what fuel some of the projections that we have made in our prepared remarks as we look at  and beyond where we see rtl stabilize both because the other supply of leaf is going to be progressively corrected but also because of the potential for recovery in both volume and profit coming from the ramp up of this big number and reduce risk tobacco products julie li and continue on that question can you give us a sense as to how difficult for rtl revenue to come back if the virgin leaf prices going up and do you see that could happen in maybe next two years time frame frederic villoutreix all the players the tobacco dealers and ourselves i think we intend to be somewhat cautious because in order this correction of the market has been expected for already in excess of two years there are some signs that due to linear effect in south america the size of the crop in   coming out of brazil is much smaller than normal which will help with the tightening other markets but i think its difficult at this stage its too early to really say there is going to be a change in the dynamics demand supply in the leaf market what is clear to me though is that the hit number on demand is going to be a long term prospectus for us which this coupled with no view and discussion with customers of any major replanting decision that could affect future years would lead to more stable and hopefully improving revenue and the revenue  and profit from rtl in years to come and obviously as you know just stabilizing this piece of our business weve tremendous policy impact to the overall performance compared to dealers julie li so from the news that philip morris has been investing large amounts of money in the new heatnotburn tobacco systems the devices so do you have any sales in that product right now for rtl frederic villoutreix for confidential reason we can not specify to whom we sale our rtl product heatnotburn applications but where we materialized some revenue in  but most importantly we are seeing some strong ramp in demand in  and thats built in the guidance i think just building on your question i think its important to mention that customer like philip morris see a tremendous potential in the heatnotburn category whats already just testing in the few markets more than  of their worldwide sales in last quarter and they see a day where possibly they can be selling more number than we do sales conventional cigarettes and the heatnotburn as a reminder is sticks that putting those devices are pure concentrated tobacco materials and rtl our rtl is a very good vehicle for all that so  of this stick actually be made of rtl type products as oppose to conventional cigarette rtl is only a small amount of whole tobacco blend so big potential its too early to really have strong forecast because we obviously following the successes of our customers that something to well keep talking quarterafterquarter julie li and the next question is about your ip business we saw  decline in fourth quarter from cigarette paper sales and you have also mentioned the royalty revenue due to deteriorating competitor issue made it the revenue decrease about half and there is also returning back to normalize level from elevated supply condition in early  first quarter of  so among these two reasons what do you think is the key reason causes decline is more of a deteriorating compared to frederic villoutreix yes i think first of all our lip franchise did very strongly for the last two years the decline is all you mentioning is really due to a very tough comparison with this inventory build in europe that’s started in the fourth quarter of  what we have said in our prepared remarks is that the top comparison will continue for another quarter first quarter of  comparing to which will be normalized there is no build there is no build but it is compared to third quarter of  where our inventory build was into full motion that being said we are continue to gain market share on the lip halt and our cost performance is very good and it’s a big part of the fact that in spite of negative mix in  for both lower volume of lip due to the build and lower volume of rtl which we just discussed copy margin expanded over a  basis points for engineered paper so a favorable mix and yet our profit margins are expanding  basis point plus the really one new challenge and i would say the only challenge in lip in  is this reset of the lip of royalty so for everyone on the call this agreement  this loyalty agreement based on  with our largest competitor worldwide royalty agreement on lip paper and this is an agreement that will run through the course  the life of the patterns which is  follow that agreement was that as a way through that mix of  year royalty agreement it would be lowering of royalty rates which takes place in  and which reduced by half of the income with the life on this agreement but then that new royalty rate will stay flat through  now because of us gaining incremental shares in  to lip i think my sense is we can absorb the lower royalty rates due to increase market share by rate gained on the lip side so lip is strong we just add this knowledge coming from the build unbuild and that will be gone by the end of this coming quarter but on the other hand we continue to gain market share and do quite well in terms of delivering strong cash flows from lip sales julie li and thanks for the color and my final question is about ams business is among good service protection business and could you tell us about filtration business and the new conwed business which piece of business you think have the strongest growth rate thanks very much frederic villoutreix so if i look back at  and clearly the argotec franchise did extremely well it was on the high end of our land of  to  growth and our expectation is that this momentum continues in  as with penetration of this firm on the new card  still remains low in the us and we have the entire rest of the world to compare in large initiatives to pull that in these areas in  on the filtration side obviously we had a challenging period with a oil and gas balance cycles that we have recovered on that and as we said positive filtration delivered growth in  and expect that to continue to improve in  we have sales mix in the water filtration segments and right now and its driven primarily by china and in china its really slowing down new infrastructure projects due to the uncertain economy and other factors but this is on the temporary and certainly if we know that water filtration will clean solid growth of a midterm just to keep us with the population and the need to increase the amount of drinkable water around the world so no major concern there julie li thank you so much ill jump back in the queue operator operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of dan jacome from sidoti  company your line is now open dan jacome good morning how are you good appreciate the time as always i just wanted to stay on the rtl subject a little bit it looks like the market is still sloppy but then longerterm you have these potential tailwinds from the hmb i was just trying to understand better what you think is going to happen to like industry wide capacity over the next  at least over the next year i think you guys still have half of the market whats your line of sight on what other competitors might be doing either because of the demand slack or maybe because of buildup due to the hmb longer term any color there frederic villoutreix i think this is very good question because obviously there is significant excess capacity in the rtl sector as a reminder its mostly the excess capacity is obviously us because we have unused capacity in france but i think the situation we are seeing in the us those assets are owned by cigarette companies and as we have said there would be a time where industry consolidation will of interest to various players and it could be a positive for us now that doesnt  its not necessarily tied to hit hmb number down necessarily because it is really  paper making technology is the same but the design of the product is extremely different on conventional and obviously pmi has their own channels relatively integrated and i would say we have the eyes on it dan jacome got it so you said pmi did its own rtl frederic villoutreix as they communicated that they are  it is a different type of rtl but the entire heatnotburn product that pmi  manufacturer by pmi so far but as you know there are other capacities you have read in the publication due to the very successful and production of that product and we have been in talks with them for several years in terms of being another source dan jacome okay got it and then just one more the heatnotburn i dont want to make it topic in the entire call but you said there is  you need  times as much rtl for an hmb product versus a traditional cigarette so im just wondering if this thing takes off will you going to be able to meet that future demand if it happens with your current capacity i think you have  tons of rtl or you would have to build out some more what is your best call in that frederic villoutreix it is not  times more its around five times of that dan jacome got it sorry frederic villoutreix so it is multiple time and the amount of hitting on the sticks rate being sold today still small so there is plenty of capacity for years to come to meet that demand even if its exponential increase dan jacome okay great and then return to ams i think the press release said that the water filtration market is a little bit soft and that would kind of be in line with some of your peers are saying can you just give us a little bit better understanding of what is happening there do you think that is going that pressure might continue or is it just maybe some growing pains for the industry thanks frederic villoutreix sure thats the point i was making earlier its really driven by china or asia in general and its the slowdown of new large infrastructure of projects in terms of desalination new desalination capacity and probably its kind of a growth thing that has been significant investment made in the last five years we had a record year and i think the industry had a record year i mean in  and that industry goes to cycles due to a very capital intensive nature of new infrastructure dan jacome okay i appreciate and then last one quick housekeeping question i think you guided capex to  million you did  million in  what  in  so just what exactly  that wasn’t incremental part of the capex is it all because of the recent acquisitions or is there something else that i missed allison aden capex in  when we take into account the software its about little over  million and the increase  million to  million prior of it will be due to investment and acquisitions and then just continue the production growth dan jacome okay that should i figure okay all right thanks a lot i appreciate everything operator thank you and im showing no further questions over the phone lines at this time i would like to turn the call back over to frederic villoutreix for closing remarks frederic villoutreix thank you glenda thank you all for attending the call we certainly appreciate your interest in swm allison mark and i will be in our offices today and if you have

the appendix of this presentation and the earnings release unless stated otherwise financial and operational metric comparisons are to the prior year period and relate to continuing operations this presentation and earnings release are available on the investor relations section of our website wwwswmintlcom ill now turn the call over to frédéric frédéric villoutreix thank you mark and good morning everyone we are pleased to report a healthy start to the year with first quarter adjusted eps of  in terms of business fundamentals ams exhibited positive top and bottom line momentum in the base business and benefited from the conwed acquisition these positive factors were offset by lip and rtl volume challenges in the paper segment which unfolded as anticipated and impacted sales and operating margins one isolated comparison item was a  gain in first quarter  related to the sale of water rights we generated no such comparable gain in the first quarter of  free cash flow in the first quarter typically a low period for us was minimal due in large part to timing of capital spending we still expect robust free cash flow for the full year generally in line with the  million we generated in  for the first quarter ams net sales were up  overall and  excluding acquisitions as we noted in recent quarters the inclusion of argotec in reported organic sales growth was expected to push this metric back into positive territory surface protection products which are mainly sold into the transportation end markets continue to perform very well these specialty sales are using automotive paint protection and glass lamination applications both of which saw doubledigit sales growth in the quarter global channel developments and adoption progress has created positive momentum in our paint protection film business although this product line has relatively low penetration we estimate only about  in us and even less overseas we see opportunity for strong sustained domestic and international growth other key end markets were fairly mixed filtration sales were flattish while growth in industrial was offset by softness in medical regarding the industrial endmarket growth we highlight that these sales grew overall despite continued deprioritization of certain lowmargin sales specialty sales for industrial customers performed well with new business gains in materials using cleanroom inspection robotics and a strong increase in wastecontainments applications the increases in our portfolio of highperformance films had positive mix impact from sales and margins while we dont report segment gross margins we saw several hundred basis points of ams gross margin expansion conwed which serves mostly the construction and infrastructure end markets delivered growth and margins consistent with assumptions embedded in our accretion estimate cables and control products led the way with doubledigit growth benefiting from continued strength in highway development we also progressed on earlystage synergy targets in sga and resin procurements though we have only owned the business for a few months the recently implemented organizational integration should deliver strong savings on these  buckets for the remainder of  we also initiated the first major project under our footprint optimization plan with a planned consolidation of one legacy ams facility this will be a phased approach with completion expected next year this is another critical step towards achieving our  million synergy growth by the end of  we intend to absorb the majority of the volume across other ams sites which we expect will increase capacity utilization of our bestperforming plants and reduce fixed cost such decisions are never easy however we expect this will unlock significant value for swm the first quarter was  also marked a significant milestone for ams its first  million quarter of revenue and we are on the path to be well over  million in segment sales this year this increased scale supports reference opportunities to optimize operations and expands segment margins one point on how we discuss ams you will notice we are progressing a way on attributing performance to delstar the medical and air filtration boltons and argotec rather our comments are now geared to key applications and bold end markets we serve to provide a clear picture on segment growth drivers including conwed ams sales obviously it is fairly evenly across filtration construction and infrastructure transportation and the combination of medical and industrial areas switching to engineered papers first quarter saw a decline in sales and profits as expected segment volume was down  driving a sales decrease of  lower pricing and lip royalties accounted for the remaining  points of sales decline consistent with the factors we communicated in february but were incorporated into our  outlook the yearoveryear lip comparisons remained a headwind in the first quarter given the elevated sales in the yearago quarter the comparison not only impacted these highmargin sales but the elevated production a year ago led to exceptional margin performance where we expect the manufacturing efficiencies and other absorption in our plants while absolutely  absolute sales levels at already normalized their unusual comparisons to prior year are now behind us adding to this already difficult comparison were certain operating efficiencies in several plants during the first quarter of  after the plants yearend shutdowns we experienced a small handful of line restock issues which were a lag on operational performance during the first quarter these issues were addressed during the quarter they are no longer expected to impact segment margins regarding rtl volumes they declined as anticipated and the full year outlook for a doubledigit volume decline remains unchanged on a positive note the strong sales of highmargin wrapper and binder recon products continues from last year and we did not see a dropoff in the other patterns as we had expected nontobacco paper volumes increased though these clearer volumes had a limited impact on profitability beginning this quarter and going forward we are reporting consolidated segment volume and elaborating on performance of rtl and lip sales mix price and other factors such as royalties and currency throughout different style to sales performance furthermore our volume disclosure now only includes the ep reporting segments and will no longer include the chinese joint venture this is intended to increase transparency of segment operating metrics and financials to set a baseline for their major product lines within engineered papers of the  million in total  segment sales cigarette papers were approximately  with lip accounting for more than half of a category total reconstituted tobacco products were about  of segment sales with a large majority of those sales related to traditional rtl and the reminder  remainder opportunity wrapper and binder lastly nontobacco paper comprised approximately  of segment sales our investor deck will be updated to provide the sale speeds as well regarding execution of our ep segment priorities we remain actively focused on managing costs across our sites to match capacity with demand we have also largely completed the line verifications at the french mill for the production of specialty filtration paper in these early indiscernible reduced risk tobacco products the industry remains optimistic about consumer adoption major cigarette manufacturers continue to provide productivity updates we have in test markets new rollouts capacity expansions and the general strategic importance of this innovative new product category we remain in close discussions with our primary strategic partner and are currently supplying reconstituted tobacco as the tobacco materials for their product in addition we think the competitive environment among the major cigarette companies is favorable for us as those manufacturers were not in the market with a product may be highly motivated to launch quickly we think our current technology and available capacity offer an attractive and expeditious option we look forward to providing more details later this year as we see results of more widespread market introductions consumer reaction and updated  forecasts from industry players i will now turn the call over to allison allison aden thank you frederic ill now review our financial results starting with segment performance in the first quarter ams net sales increased  to  million organic sales grew  and the conwed acquisition drove the remainder of the growth gaap operating profit was  million or  of sales adjusted operating profit was  million or  of sales up  basis points the margin expansion was largely driven by organic sales growth and favorable mix as mentioned both the strength of surface protection products and exiting lowmargin industrial sales provided mixed benefits versus q of last year the addition of conweds highmargin operations also provided a solid lift to prior years adjusted segment operating margin of  as did the realization of approximately  million of earlystage synergies the engineered papers segments net sales were down  driven mostly by volumes as well as pricing concessions and decreased royalties the adjusted operating margin was  down  basis points due primarily to the previously discussed impact of lower lip and rtl volumes and the associated impact on overhead absorption compared to last year as well as the manufacturing inefficiencies we expect ep segment adjusted operating margins to improve from the first quarter level and finish the year in the low  range corporate unallocated expenses were up slightly to  million ceo transition expenses resulted in approximately  million incremental costs and offset declines in other areas on a consolidated basis net sales increased  but decreased  excluding conwed adjusted operating profits were nearly  million down  million from the yearago quarter the adjusted operating margin was  down  basis points currency movements were not impactful to consolidated sales and operating profits regarding items excluded from adjusted operating profit ams segment noncash purchase accounting expenses more than doubled to nearly  million this increase was due to the added intangible asset amortization and onetime inventory stepup charges related to the conwed acquisition in engineered papers restructuring expenses decreased to  million from nearly  million a year ago shifting to consolidated earnings first quarter  gaap eps was  down from  in the prior year adjusted eps was  down from  in the prior and excludes restructuring and impairment charges and purchase accounting expenses as mentioned a notable yearoveryear comparison factor was a  gain in q of  from the sale of water rights whereas we had no comparable items this year in addition we experienced an increase in our quarterly effective tax rate to  driven by a higher proportion of earnings generated in the us lower foreign tax credits an increase in tax rates in certain geographies and some discrete items as disclosed last quarter the previously low tax rate for our lip printing facility in poland increased significantly due to a change in tax regulations after the discrete items the first quarter  effective tax rate would have been  the impact of currency translation was negative  to both gaap and adjusted eps in the first quarter while first quarter earnings were lower versus last year we note that first quarter adjusted eps of  was basically in line with our expectations in the context of our full year adjusted eps guidance of  this would imply the combined eps for the remaining  quarters would be stable compared with last years result over the course of the year we expect continued organic sales growth and margin expansion in ams continued conwed integration and synergy realization lip comparisons to become more favorable continued rtl declines and a pickup in paper segment margins compared to the first quarter first quarter  free cash flow was essentially neutral historically first quarter is a seasonally low cashflow period compounding the seasonal factors was anticipated higher investments in growthrelated capex we called out we began upgrading the paper line in  to produce new specialty filtration paper and were pleased to report the project is now largely complete this project contributed to total capital spending of about  million this quarter versus only  million last year we expect stronger free cash flow through the remainder of the year from a leverage perspective per the terms of our credit facility we were at x net debt to adjusted ebitda at the end of the first quarter up from x at the yearend  driven by the increase in debt with the closing of the conwed acquisition in january as communicated at the time we announced the conwed acquisition we expect to return to the midx range by the end of  now back to frédéric frédéric villoutreix thank you allison before we conclude the call i would like to introduce jeff kramer who as of tomorrow will assume the role of sole ceo since informing the board of my decision to retire from swm it has been a true team effort to find the right executive to lead the next phase of swm strategic transformation and we are highly confident we arrived at the ideal successor jeffs combination of leadership style technical expertise and market exposure and global experience will serve him well and over the quarter the next several quarters of getting to know him i believe you will all reach the same conclusion jeffrey kramer thank you frédéric joining swm at this juncture is such a unique opportunity with exciting developments across both of our businesses this is also an ideal time for transition giving the clear execution plan for the next  to  months with our operating priorities in place i look forward to spending the next several months assessing our global capabilities meeting our employees and learning more about our customers products and operations across both segments despite the significant changes at swm with the creation of the ams growth platform the story is far from complete integration and execution on the tangible opportunities within reach today is clearly the immediate focus however our sights remain on continued evolution of the business to drive sustainable longterm growth frédéric villoutreix in closing i would like to express my most sincere gratitude for the opportunity to lead swm over the past plus years it has been a great pleasure to work with our employees around the world support our loyal customers collaborate with my fellow senior management team and board members and share the swm story with the investment community we appreciate your continued interest and support that concludes our remarks james please open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of zhuoli li from drexel hamilton go ahead please your line is open zhuoli li thank you very much team good morning my first question is on argotec could you provide some update about that part of business the paint protection business any color on the ordering activity and market trends is appreciated frédéric villoutreix sure as we reported in our prepared remarks the film for the transportation end market had a very strong performance thats a combination of continued progress from the us market well penetration rate is still in the  level but we are also seeing a lot of momentum in taking our technology to other markets overseas and other channels of distribution like the window tinting business and with great success in asia so we are very bullish about the outlook for not only the balance of the year but also years to come due to the fact that our penetration rate is still extremely low and the market that we are tapping in especially in asia are very large zhuoli li okay and how about the integration of conwed and also for oil gas ep customers do you have any update on that business trend frédéric villoutreix sure so the integration of conwed is going very well its  days into the process as we have reported we have now realigned our organization integrated from an organization point of view conwed into ams as a result of that were starting to generate some tangible sga cost improvements we have completed the study of how to optimize the manufacturing footprint in the us and ive initiated the free stage closure of our facility in texas and moving production to other sites in the us which will be the lions share of the  million of synergy growth that we announced so  and we also are moving forward to one brand thats a global brand for ams with very good reception by our key customers so everything is progressing well still a lot of work ahead but good momentum as we are getting into the second quarter as it relates to oil and gas all revenue thats starting to bounce back from lower  over a year ago and were also optimistic that we should see continued recovery in the quarters to come zhuoli li thats great color frédéric my next question is on the ep side i was expecting a doubledigit decline during the quarter but actually we see the results were better why  whats your opinion on this and should we expect better performance in ep going forward and are you trying to be conservative on the guidance by your reaffirming the guidance frédéric villoutreix looking at  from our viewpoint we performed at the level expected in terms of revenue performance we  a little disappointed by the profit margin achievement as we explained essentially due to these inefficiencies with restarting a few machines now the problem is behind us and we had a very strong comparison a year ago in terms of the mix and the volume of activity in our plants when i look at the rtl to say i think our plans stays in line with what we guided in february there is some beginning of some momentum with the heatnotburn revenue and were also continuing to see a good quarter from the wrapper and binder side so there are smaller elements of the business that are moving in the right direction but we have to be cautious because theyre still small and wait for i would say two or three quarter to have a better view of  as i indicated as it relates to heatnotburn i see the end of the year as a critical time to assess the effect  the positive effect that this new product line will have on our rtl segment zhuoli does that address your question operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of dan jacome from sidoti go ahead please your line is open daniel jacome good morning i appreciate the time lets just stay on the heatnotburn actually because that it was  you didnt have it in the last press release you did put in this one which is encouraging and it looks like that could be a pretty large addressable market for you guys so i just want to know exactly what gives you more confidence now versus say february were youre putting it in the press release im assuming its just a lot of your customers are already playing in this part of the industry or did you have conversations with them or what can you tell us about that frédéric villoutreix sure and what im going to share with you is public information as reported by our customers japan as you may recall has been the first market or country where pmi has introduced their heatnotburn product after a yearandchange they have now achieved a  market share which is obviously very large and exceeded their goals they are adding capacity as a result of not only the success in japan but also in production to many other markets they mentioned  markets around the world where they are testing and introducing heatnotburn and just to give an idea their capacity expansion from  billion stick units produced in december of  theyre targeting  billion so a sevenfold increase in  by the end of  so its an exponential curve and the other customers are following suit and bat has introduced in japan in as  in one region of japan achieving a  market share so  for pmi  for bat gives you the idea of the potential and we are starting to  we are in commercial mode today the production is expected to increase sharply by the end of the year the question we  for us  and what i was referring to is in light of the attrition of the conventional rtl business we need the certain size of volume for heatnotburn to more than offset now that attrition and my sense is by the end of the year and looking at the projections from the customers to continue to introduce heatnotburn around the world we have a good sense of what impact heatnotburn will have on our franchise for the years to come and starting with  communicate it at that point daniel jacome great and its still  the idea is still that it uses a lot more rtl frédéric villoutreix correct daniel jacome okay now im going to turn over to ams obviously nice job on the margin expansion but i see in the press release you closed the plant just wondering as we  going for  are there others to close and then what typically is  how long does it take before you can get the capacity in the closing plant to get absorbed by another one frédéric villoutreix yes so the  think about our plan as a threephase downsizing and incremental production transfer to other sites that would be completed in the second half of  so its an month process three phases so  and the transfer will tap on existing capacity at the other sites but also we are relocating and upgrading production lines so net benefit is that we are moving the business to lowercost production centers and obviously making a stepchange in reducing the total overhead for production in the us so its a very rational plan that we are following and very confident in starting to see the first benefits of this plan in the latter part of this year daniel jacome okay thats helpful and then i wanted to turn it over to capital structure just real quick question obviously the debt is up acquisition driven when you did the conwed deal in december you kind of provided us with some sort of time line of where you wanted to get leverage ratio back to in a certain number of months or maybe it was quarters can you just give us an update on that are you still sticking to the plan that you provided then allison aden yes dan what we mentioned previously is that we see ourselves in a position to exit  in the midx net ebitda range and so we very much see ourselves tracking to that early days daniel jacome x by mid allison aden by end of  daniel jacome by the end of  so okay i just wanted to doublecheck that alright great thank you very much operator operator instructions and you have a question again from the line of dan jacome from sidoti daniel jacome hi again i thought id followup just to  dr kramer look forward to working with you and obviously welcome just very highlevel questions just on this call but im interested in your background and given the chemicals and the petro and then tying that into the resinheavy businesses that swm has been over the last couple years just wondering i dont know if you cant maybe provide us with a little bit on your background and how you think that might dovetail nicely to what swm and the portfolio that the company has been building over the last couple years if possible but i understand if you cant speak on this call jeffrey kramer no id be happy to and first of all thank you for the kind words i look forward to working closely with you as well ill try to give you a brief background so im an engineer by training and ive had numerous technical and business leadership roles throughout my career ive led global businesses that have manufactured products for use in paper manufacturing nonwoven manufacturing polyurethanes and so ive had previous experience in those markets as well as experience in the oil and gas industries ive also spent about half my career living overseas both in europe and asia so i have ontheground experience growing businesses in international geographies which will represent good growth opportunities for us and then finally ive had executive positions involving leadership in both strategy development mergers and acquisitions and ive led successful acquisitions and integration activities all around the world so when i step back i think my background will greatly complement the alreadystrong leadership we have here at swm and im really looking forward to the opportunity to make a contribution to work with the team to grow the company going forward daniel jacome okay really helpful and welcome again thank you operator and there are no further questions at this time i turn the call back over to the presenters frédéric villoutreix thank you james and thank you all for attending the call we certainly appreciate your interest in swm jeff allison mark and i will be in our offices today and if you have any followup questions please give us a call have a nice day operator this concludes todays conference you may now disconnect copyright policy all transcripts on this site are the copyright of seeking
