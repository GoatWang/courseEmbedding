nowgo»gray fox petroleum a promoted stock at risk for a trading haltmar   about grey fox gfox fraud research institute short onlyfraud research institute on twittereditors note this article covers a stock trading at less than  per share andor with less than a  million market cap please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks the fraud research institute has completed its investigation into gray fox petroleum inc otcpkgfox and holds a very strong opinion that since its inception this public entity has been cultivated by stock promoters for the sole purpose of acquiring dirtcheap shares and liquidating them at artificially inflated prices as we recently have witnessed the stocks most frequently suspended from trading by the securities and exchange commission seem to be heavily promoted penny stocks that own few assets aside from intangibles such as oilandgas lease agreements or propertypurchase agreements some examples of those stocks centor energy inc otcpkcnto nevada gold corp otcnvgc sovereign lithium inc otcslco norstra energy inc otcnorx southern usa resources inc otcsusa polar petroleum corp otcpolr guar global ltd otcggbl arx gold corp otcducp far vista petroleum otcfvsta we are of the opinion that for several reasons which are outlined in this report gfox is at risk of an sec trading halt even if the stock is not halted it most certainly will collapse once the stock promotion campaign ends and shares revert to their intrinsic value which probably is less than  per share we fully expect shares of gfox to drop by  percent very soon and in the long term we expect shares to decline by  percent from current prices highlights a lease purchase agreement with ffmj llc is highly questionable because the nevada secretary of state considered ffmj llc to be in default at the time the agreement was signed david lubin the attorney who assisted in the filing of the companys s registration statement also assisted two promoted penny stocks which eventually were halted by the sec including biozoom inc otcbizm gfox boasts an million market cap but operations are very limited and their primary asset consists of an oilandgas lease acquired for  the company has zero employees besides its year old president  ceo the company entered into six share purchase agreements with rooftop investment ltd we have reason to believe that all six contain at least one material misrepresentation an offshore entitys name is misspelled in all gfox filings the director of that entity has spelled his own name differently in separate sec filings and the corporate address for the offshore entity suspiciously has been redacted there is a possibility of illegal unregistered shares entering the marketplace because of an unjustified reliance on an exemption from registration which reminds us of the bizm debacle an offshore financier of gfox has participated in several dubious penny stock dealings one of which was suspended by the sec the promotional advertisements featuring gfox are incredibly deceptive omit material information about the company and appear to violate the federal trade commissions truthinadvertising rules the companys headquarters is a virtual office in dallas tx owned by regus and we have attempted to contact them via telephone for over one week and have been unable to get a response from their investor relations team an email sent to irgrayfoxpetrocom has also gone unanswered companys history gray fox petroleum corp otcpkgfox originally was incorporated in nevada as viatech corporation on sept   the companys founder and sole officer at that time was viatcheslav gelshteyn who was issued  million shares at a price of share the original business plan was to provide d rendering architectural animation and visualization services on may   with the help of david lubin the company filed its s registration statement that statement became effective on sept   as part of the statement the company raised  by issuing  shares at a cost of share approximately one year after gfox filed its registration statement the founder sold his  million shares to lawrence pemble for  at the time pemble was a year old residing in the united kingdom and working for east african gold plc shortly after pemble purchased the  million shares he canceled  million of them executed an for forward split and changed the companys name to gray fox petroleum corporation by june  after the issuance of the founders shares the s capital raise pembles million share cancellation and the for forward split the capital structure for gray fox petroleum looked like this shares authorized  shares shares outstanding  shares lawrence pemble  shares restricted s capital raise   share  shares freetrading about gray fox petroleum on july   gray fox petroleum purchased  separate oilandgas leases from ffmj llc for a price of  gfox maintains a percent working interest and an percent revenue interest in the acre prospect located in the butte valley oil play region of north central nevada this lease purchase agreement marked gfoxs entrance into the oilandnaturalgas industry but we must question the validity of the transaction the agreement was dated july   but according to a nevada secretary of state business entity search ffmj llc already was in default at that time therefore we question whether ffmj llc was able to transact business and execute the lease purchase agreement with gray fox petroleum gray fox petroleum corp is a going concern company with no revenues and zero employees besides pemble its year old president so far during its exploration phase the company has accumulated a deficit of  gfoxs balance sheet lists  cash and equivalents as of dec   despite atrocious financials and such minimal operations to date pemble took  in salary for the nine months ending dec   the companys most recent quarterly report released on jan   clearly states that gray fox petroleum is a shell company as defined by rule b of the exchange act between july   and feb   the company entered into six separate securities purchase agreements with rooftop investment ltd issuing an aggregate  shares to the investor for total proceeds of   per share we will discuss these purchase agreements in much greater detail in a later section but they consist of the following date  shares purchased proceeds purchaseprice feb     share jan     share nov     share oct     share sept     share july     share during the next  months gfox intends to conduct geological mapping gravity surveying and d seismic coverage on the west ranch prospect and develop an initial exploration plan to identify drilling targets according to the companys website gray fox has developed an phase exploration program for the west ranch prospect which is designed to identify new drilling targets on the acre project an initial exploration plan has been developed to identify those new drilling locations and the company currently is in search of additional sources of capital for the funding of shortterm operations on jan   gfox engaged gaffney cline  associates to assist the company with an independent technical and economic due diligence report for the west ranch prospect suspicious share purchase agreements with a foreign entity a common practice with promoted penny stocks is to raise capital via regulation s enabling an individual or legal entity residing outside of the us to acquire shares of common stock that do not have to be registered under the securities act of  generally when a company raises capital through an initial or secondary offering those shares must be registered by filing a registration statement lately it has become increasingly difficult and time consuming to register shares a fact that most likely is the result of a crackdown by the sec in an effort to curb unscrupulous promoters however when raising capital via regulation s and relying on an exemption from the securities act such as rule  shares do not have to be registered regulation s clearly states that sales of securities outside the us must be made in good faith and not as a means of circumventing registration provisions of the securities act we believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest rooftop investment ltd did not act in good faith and clearly misrepresented material facts within each of the stockpurchase agreements listed below simply put we believe rooftop investment ltd was incorporated in the marshall islands for the sole purpose of enabling it to participate in stock purchase agreements with gray fox petroleum without being subject to the registration provisions of the securities act a clear abuse of regulation s below is a copy of article  from the stock purchase agreements the highlighted portion is the alleged misrepresentation below is a list of stock purchase agreements we believe contain misrepresentations of article  july   securities purchase agreement between gray fox petroleum corp and rooftop investment ltd sept   securities purchase agreement between gray fox petroleum corp and rooftop investment ltd oct   securities purchase agreement between rooftop investment ltd and gray fox petroleum corp nov   securities purchase agreement between gray fox petroleum corp and rooftop investment ltd jan   securities purchase agreement between gray fox petroleum corp and rooftop investment ltd feb   securities purchase agreement between gray fox petroleum corp and rooftop investment ltd first we must point out the inconsistency in the spelling of the name of rooftop investments ltd within the text of each of the securities purchase agreements to which we link above the purchaser is listed as rooftop investments ltd with an s at the end of investments however a marshall islands corporate entity search yields only one result for a corporation containing the word rooftop the marshall islands entity incorporated on may   the one that has entered into numerous share purchase agreements with gray fox petroleum is named rooftop investment ltd  no s at the end of investment we also should point out that in more recent stock purchase agreements the name of rooftop investment ltds director is spelled differently in the earliest of the six agreements to which we linked above the director is identified as renee berlinger in the five subsequent agreements he is identified as rene berlinger with only one e at the end of his first name arousing even more suspicion is the fact rooftop investment ltds address has been redacted in our opinion article  of every stock purchase agreement between rooftop investment ltd and gray fox petroleum has been misrepresented specifically it appears rooftop investment ltd was formed solely for the purpose of acquiring shares of gray fox petroleum note that rooftop was incorporated just a few weeks before july   the date of the first of these stock purchase agreements adding to our suspicion is the lack of google search results for rooftop investment ltd or rooftop investments ltd other than the ones pertaining to the stock purchase agreements with gray fox petroleum it appears rooftop investment ltd conducts no other business the likelihood substantially increases that rooftop investment ltd was incorporated for the sole purpose of entering into stock purchase agreements with gfox when you consider berlingers past dealings with penny stocks on dec   seahorse investments ltd was incorporated in the marshall islands several weeks later it entered into a consulting agreement with harmonic energy inc asuv proof that berlinger is a principal of seahorse investments ltd can be found in a consulting agreement dated may   which superseded the previous contract as we have shown there is reasonable evidence to suspect rooftop investment ltd was formed for the sole purpose of acquiring gfox shares through stock purchase agreements if that is true shares acquired would not be exempt from registration and any open market sales would be illegal it reminds us of the biozoom inc trading suspension except that in that case it was rule  that was unjustifiably relied upon rather than misrepresentations and an abuse of regulation s tobin smith gfox promoter recently fired by fox news despite awful financials and a going concern designation gfox shares have nearly tripled during the past few months and the company now commands a lofty million market cap we believe the stocks movement is entirely due to promotional propaganda led by terminated fox news contributor and dubious stock pitchman tobin smith the gray fox petroleum promotional landing page begins by suggesting that a twoway bidding war between noble energy inc nysenbl and eog resources inc nyseeog may already be in the works representatives for both companies denied these suggestions and neither had heard of gray fox petroleum tobin smith enthusiastically urges investors to buy the stock up to  per share and argues for a  shortterm price target primarily based on the location of gray fox petroleums west ranch prospect and its proximity to several major oil producers alluding to the proximity of major producers is a common practice for oilandgas promoters smith used the same tactic in his north american oil  gas corp otcnamg promotional campaign by referencing nearby leases owned by occidental petroleum corp nyseoxy in addition to alluding to the proximity of major oil companies smith uses a number of deceptive and misleading statements in the gfox promotional advertisement gfox could be sitting on anywhere between  billion to  billion of oil gfox properties could hold a potential reserve of  million barrels of oil an early  investment could return  within weeks the paid propaganda even includes a hypothetical chart showing gfoxs share price moving from  to as much as  based on pieinthesky oil recovery projections that will never come true in the eyes of the stocks promoters whether or not oil actually is discovered is irrelevant promoters like tobin smith are getting paid in cash to publish advertisements containing outlandish and misleading statements in order to convince naive investors to buy shares of penny stocks like gfox the advertisements are paid for by large shareholders who are selling stock to those naive buyers the gfox promotional brochure and the statements made by smith are more great examples of the type of deceptive advertising we discussed in a previous report as we explained the major crackdown on unscrupulous penny stock promotions is coming from all angles in addition to the possibility of an sec suspension the highly misleading gfox advertisements may lead to an investigation by the federal trade commission ftc while the ftc never has scrutinized penny stock promotional brochures the gfox advertisement featuring tobin smith appears to be both deceptive and in violation of truthinadvertising rules past tobin smith promotions tobin smith the former fox news contributor has been involved in many penny stock promotions through his stock promotion company nbt equities research not surprisingly every single public company nbt equities research has been paid to promote has declined considerably in share price gfox will be no different we began receiving north american oil  gas corp promotional advertisements featuring smith on july   when the stock was trading at  within several weeks that companys stock peaked at  it currently trades at  we began receiving brazil minerals inc otcpkbmix promotional advertisements featuring smith on may   when that companys stock was trading at  within days the stock peaked at  and it currently trades at  we began receiving petrosonic energy inc otcpkpson promotional advertisements featuring smith on sept   when that companys stock was trading at  within several months the stock peaked at  and it currently trades at  we began receiving western graphite inc otcpkwsgp promotional advertisements featuring smith on april   when that companys stock was trading at  within days the stock peaked at  and it currently trades at  we began receiving gray fox petroleum corp promotional advertisements featuring smith on nov   when gfox stock was trading at  two months later the stock peaked at  it currently trades at  below is a comparison of all penny stocks recently promoted by smith and his nbt equity group ticker start date start price peak price current price  drop from peak namg      bmix      wsgp      pson      gfox      smiths four promoted stocks prior to gfox dropped by an average of  percent from their peaks assuming gfox already has peaked we urge investors to get out immediately because the stock is only  percent off of its highs and still has a tremendous amount of downside conclusion since the inception of the fraud research institute we have published six shortbiased research reports on small public companies that were subjected to some form of stock promotion to date all six of these short ideas have yielded potential returns ranging from  percent to  percent we analyze trends daily in this small marketplace and take great pride in always trying to stay ahead of future trends most recently the biggest trend in the otc marketplace that cant be ignored is the large number of sec trading suspensions depending on which end of the trade you are on sec suspensions can be highly profitable or highly devastating take cnto for example the sec suspended trading at  and when trading resumed two weeks later the stock dropped to  within one week for short sellers these returns are impeccable gray fox petroleum undoubtedly is high on the secs radar in our opinion it is the promoted penny stock most likely to be suspended next however gray fox petroleum shares will be slashed by more than  percent in the short term with or without a trading suspension minimal assets possible misrepresentations made within share purchase agreements a severe lack of ongoing business activity and a very misleading and deceptive multimillion dollar advertising campaign designed to sell stock to naive investors are just some of the reasons we hold such a strong opinion about the impending collapse of gray fox petroleum disclosure i am short gfox i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not

petroleum corp announces initial exploration strategy for west ranch prospect december    et  source gray fox petroleum corp dallas dec   globe newswire  gray fox petroleum corp otcbbgfox herein after gray fox andor the company is pleased to announce its initial exploration plan to identify drilling targets on its acre west ranch prospect  working interest  net revenue interest the prospect is comprised of  federal leases in the butte valley oil play region of northcentral nevada located in elko and white pine counties  miles north of ely nv an independent report on gray foxs west ranch prospect conducted in may  indicates the prospect offers potential for oil discovery over two large anticlinal structures within multiple prospective horizons the two main targets are the mississippian diamond peak sandstones and the deeper devonian guilmette dolomitic carbonates while the exploration program has the potential to result in the discovery of additional structures its main focus is to refine the structural parameters of the two anticlinal structures already identified while simultaneously reaching the crest of both structures previously two test wells were drilled within the boundaries of what is now the companys west ranch prospect oil and gas lease position according to a report undertaken by gray foxs head of exploration consultant geologist william j ehni while neither well penetrated the deeper guilmette horizon the permian section has in fact returned multiple oil showings for both wells indicating the potential for commercial accumulations of oil and gas near both well sites the companys initial exploration plan is designed to identify new drilling locations targeting the peak of the structural closures the phase exploration plan is designed to systematically reduce risk and optimize selection of one or more new drilling targets by incorporating the results of the two wells drilled to date see below for full exploration plan details exploration plan outline phase  – acquire gravity and magnetic data all available nonexclusive gravity and magnetic data in the areas of interest will be acquired as well as any additional proprietary data this data will then be used to reinterpret the prospects geology with a more complete data set than was initially used when selecting the two older wells this action has the potential to reveal any targets the original two older wells may have missed currently available nonexclusive data includes gravity data spanning  gravity stations and over  line miles of magnetic data supplemental data will include an additional  new gravity stations phase  – interpretation of gravity mag and surface mapping gray fox will use all data sets combined with surface geology and an airphoto interpretation to refine the structural parameters of the two already identified anticlinal structures the aim of this is to reach the crest of those structures while simultaneously identifying any additional structures that might host commercial quantities of oil and gas this will be achieved through the use of gravity data to identify faults structural highs and tertiary basin geometry magnetic data will also be used to delineate faults and a magnetic basement structure this interpretation will rely on ground truth established in the two existing wells while focusing on possible structural highs that are updip from oil shows observed near these wells both historic wells have excellent oil shows and exploring for structural highs near these wells andor moving updip from these will be the main focus of the companys exploration efforts phase  – seismic permitting a contractorseismic company will be hired to handle the bureau of land management blm and stateprivate property permitting process for seismic data acquisition this process occurs at the point of acquisition phase  – acquire and conduct seismic seismic data will be acquired as available across any potential traps or structures near the two existing wells this will be done in order to map any structures identified in the gravity and magnetic data as accurately as possible while also reducing the risk of any subsequent drilling efforts it is estimated that at least  miles of existing data will be located and acquired in order to satisfactorily evaluate the companys sizeable lease block and tie the two existing wells together with outcrop control at least  miles of new seismic data will be required phase  – interpret data sets a complete geologic and geophysical interpretation will enhance the possibility of locating a successful oil and gas drill site the shows reported on the two existing wells have been extremely encouraging and either one or both of the wells might have missed a commercial accumulation of oil by only a few hundred feet through the acquisition of additional seismic and gravity data drilling targets of wells that might have been missed will be identified in turn the company might be able to reach the crest of the two identified anticlinal structures phase  – define drilling locations and reserves assessment define exploration well locations the company will obtain a petroleum engineers assessment of potential reserves for targethorizons through an independent third party phase  – commence well permitting process commence well permitting process  surface and target locations may be revised amended at a later stage phase  – decide on drilling strategy during this phase the company may decide to a pursue drilling on an individual basis b seek an outside drilling partner or c forego drilling at this time see below for further details a finalize well permit for drilling a go to tender for well a spud drill and test well if the well proves to be unsuccessful the company will move ahead with option a if the well proves to be successful the company will move ahead with option a a evaluate alternative well locations and reimplement stages a to a or move to option b or move to option c a fully define a field development plan unitize leases and commence production b identify prospective drilling partner companies and engage in discussions with the objective of pursuing options a to a as listed above or c decide on whether or not to retain lease acreage for additional information read more about the west ranch prospect and additional information about the company and
