transaction overview of business the company is focused on the research design development and manufacturing of advanced energy efficient indoor horticulture lighting and ancillary equipment our vision is to apply the latest advances in high efficiency lighting and controls technology as well as effective manufacturing techniques to deliver highly differentiated products with clear benefits at competitive prices to the greenhouse and indoor horticulture markets the company through its wholly owned subsidiary is in the operations of designing developing and sourcing a line of solis tek digital ballasts intended for use in high intensity lighting systems used for horticulture an electrical ballast is a device intended to limit the amount of current in an electric circuit a familiar and widely used example is the inductive ballast used in fluorescent lamps to limit the current through the tube which would otherwise rise to destructive levels due to the tubes negative resistance characteristic since the commencement of operations our product line has evolved from digital ballasts to a line of lighting products including a line of specialty ballasts ranging from  watts to  watts with various features a line of specialty metal halide digital lamps a line of reflectors high intensity lighting accessories critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods not all of the accounting policies require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates however the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the companys assessment of the collectability of customer accounts the company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience the age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality economic conditions that may affect a customers ability to pay and expected default frequency rates trade receivables are written off at the point when they are considered uncollectible inventories the company provides inventory reserves based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts the write down amount is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis recent

payablerelated party of  and payments on loans payable and capital lease obligation we estimate the company currently has sufficient cash and liquidity to meet its anticipated working capital for the next twelve months historically we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of common stock a line of credit and loans from a third party financial institution related parties and operations we anticipate that our primary capital source will be positive cash flow from operations if our sales goals do not materialize as planned we believe that the company can reduce its operating costs and achieve positive cash flow from operations however we may not generate sufficient revenues from product sales in the future to achieve profitable operations if we are not able to achieve profitable operations at some point in the future we may have insufficient working capital to maintain our operations as we presently intend to conduct them or to fund our expansion marketing and product development plans there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms or at all on march   the board of directors of the company authorized a

under this offering nongaap measure  adjusted ebitda in addition to our gaap results we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance however adjusted ebitda is not a recognized measurement under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation nongaap adjustments to our results prepared in accordance with gaap are itemized below you are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating adjusted ebitda you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss for the three months ended march   and  three months ended march   march   net income loss      add interest expense   provision for income taxes   depriciation and amortization   stockbased compensation   adjusted ebitda      we present adjusted ebitda because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool which includes among others the following  adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debts and  although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements offbalance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues and

a line of specialty metal halide digital lamps our “lamp products” a line of reflectors high intensity lighting accessories and a new line of light emitting diode “led” lighting technologies            we sell our products primarily to retailers in the united states and international markets who specialize in hydroponic horticulture currently we have approximately  retailers that sell our products we have five full time sales employees and four wholesale distributors who cover us canada spain and the united kingdom   the company believes that almost all of the end users that use this type of products have used the equipment for the growing of cannabis currently there are  states and the district of columbia that have laws andor regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment in addition the states of colorado washington alaska oregon california massachusetts nevada and the district of columbia have recently approved the recreational use of cannabis many other states are considering legislation to similar effect as of july   the policy and regulations of the federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of state law active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of our end user customers to continue to grow cannabis active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus directly and adversely affect revenues and profits   however the company’s products can be and are used for the hydroponic and indoor growing of other horticultural products such as hothouse vegetables decorative plant nurseries indoor aquariums and industrial painting facilities the company intends to continue to expand and improve its products for use in as many applications as possible and to market its products to the entire indoor horticultural industry as well as other industrial applications that require artificial lighting   in  solis tek east corporation “ste” was incorporated in the state of new jersey as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company ste was formed for the purpose of commencing its operations and servicing and supplying the eastern part of north america with our products in september  ste leased a  square foot office and warehouse facility in south hackensack new jersey also in  growpro solutions inc “growpro” was incorporated in the state of california as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company growpro was formed to develop and sell plant nutrients to help expand the market reach and maximize the revenue potential of the company growpro is sharing facility with sti in carson ca   our ballast products are manufactured in china by a manufacturer that is partially owned by a related party to alan lien our president our lamp products are manufactured to our specifications and supplied by an unrelated manufacturer in china our lamp ancillary products and equipment are also manufactured to our designs in china   license agreement   in may of  we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with gas technologies incorporated “gas” of kapolei hawaii pursuant to which we agreed to pay gas a minimum royalty of  per year plus of sales of products licensed by gas to us over a fixed amount of licensed products sale per calendar year in  and  the company owed an additional  and  respectively under the amended agreement the license grants to us an exclusive worldwide license to produce manufacture have manufactured use import sell market distribute and sell the products and systems the “licensed products” and any further products and systems that may be developed by the licensor for use in the horticulture and hydroponic industries the “industries” such products include our “single ended and “double ended” metal halide digital lamps and a new line of light emitting diode “led” lighting technologies and products   the cannabis industry and government regulation   currently there are twentyeight states plus the district of columbia that have laws andor regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment in addition the states of colorado washington alaska oregon california massachusetts nevada as well as the district of columbia have recently approved the recreational use of cannabis the state laws are in conflict with the federal controlled substances act which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level the trump administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct law federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by statedesignated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana and we do not have a clear reading from possible changes in the trump administration additionally any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders            indoor lighting industry   light and plant growth   light is essential for plant growth natural sunlight is the cheapest source available but for horticulture it is not always attainable in sufficient quantities therefore the uses of artificial or alternative light sources have become very common in order to increase production and quality predominantly in indoor or greenhouse environments plants have a completely different sensitivity to light spectrum than humans every plant has their own sensitivity for colors and intensity of light using these alternate light sources for plants effective light recipes are essential to obtain the optimal results in plant production   grow lights   a grow light or plant light is an artificial light source generally an electric light designed to stimulate plant growth by emitting an electromagnetic spectrum appropriate for photosynthesis grow lights are used in applications where there is either no naturally occurring light or where supplemental light is required for example in the winter months when the available hours of daylight may be insufficient for the desired plant growth lights are used to extend the time the plants receive light   grow lights either attempt to provide a light spectrum similar to that of the sun or to provide a spectrum that is more tailored to the needs of the plants being cultivated outdoor conditions are mimicked with varying color temperatures and spectral outputs from the grow light as well as varying the lumen output intensity and par output of the lamps depending on the type of plant being cultivated the stage of cultivation eg the germinationvegetative phase or the floweringfruiting phase and the photoperiod required by the plants specific ranges of spectrum luminous efficacy and color temperature are desirable for use with specific plants and time periods   specially designed artificial light sources can improve diverse growth parameters these all depends on several factors like crop environmental circumstances light recipe and many more the following is a list of benefits that can be achieved with specially designed artificial lighting     ● increased production and yield         ● increased aromatic flavor and higher potency         ● shortening of the total growth cycle         ● better plant uniformity         ● better space utility         ● improved plant quality         ● energy savings         ● better germination rate         ● higher multiplication factor         ● higher survival rate in rooting         ● improvedcontrolled stretching process         ● accelerated hardening phase   hydroponics   the great majority of our customers are retailers that specialize in hydroponics and sell our products to hydroponic enclosed farm operators hydroponics is a method of growing plants in mineral nutrient solutions in water without soil terrestrial plants may be grown with their roots in the mineral nutrient solution only or in an inert medium such as polite gravel expanded clay pebbles or coconut husks            some of the reasons why hydroponics is being adapted around the world for plant production are the following     ● no soil is needed for hydroponics         ● the water stays in the system and can be reused  thus a lower water requirement         ● it is possible to control the nutrition levels in their entirety thus lower nutrition requirements         ● no nutrition pollution is released into the environment because of the controlled system         ● stable and high yields         ● pests and diseases are easier to get rid of than in soil because of the container’s mobility         ● ease of harvesting         ● no pesticide damage   our business strategy   due to the expected increase in the number of states where the use of cannabis both for medical and recreational use is being legalized the company intends to take advantage of what we believe is our premium brand image within the cannabis farming industry we believe that as participation in the cannabis farming industry grows in order to supply increasing demand caused by legalization our solis tek brand equipment will be sought out by existing and new cannabis farms and businesses further we intend to broaden our marketing efforts to the noncannabis lighting market which includes among others hothouse vegetables decorative plant nurseries indoor aquariums and industrial painting facilities our strategy is to maintain and increase our market share by expanding our marketing efforts and by introducing new and improved lighting technology to help the industry become more efficient in addition the company has started market and sell a new line of plant nutrients and fertilizers through its wholly owned subsidiary growpro solutions inc to help expand the market reach and maximize the revenue potential of the company   products   ballasts   ballasts provide the proper starting voltage operating voltage and current to the lamp to initiate and sustain its arc high intensity discharge hid lamps have negative resistance which causes them to draw an increasing amount of current hence they require a currentlimiting device the ballast provides the following functions   it provides starting voltage and in some cases ignition pulses all ballasts must provide some specific minimum voltage to ignite the lamp in the case of pulse start lamps an additional high voltage pulse is needed to ionize the gases within the lamp these pulses are superimposed near the peak starting voltage waveform it regulates the lamp’s current and power the ballast limits the current through the lamp once it has started the ballast’s current is set to a level that delivers the proper power to the lamp in addition the ballast regulates the lamp’s current through the range of typical line voltage variations thereby keeping the lamp’s power fairly stable to maximize the lamp’s life and performance and it provides appropriate sustaining voltage and current wave shape to achieve the lamp’s rated life the ballast provides sufficient voltage to sustain the lamp as it ages   solis tek digital ballasts were designed to with “ignition control” sequential lamp ignition and “sensesmart” self diagnostic safety systems solis tek digital ballasts are software based that makes our ballasts more versatile and enables us to incorporate special features such as sequential ballast ignition technology “ignition control” and sensesmart technologies that ignites metal halide lamps one at a time based on load stability ignition control is a main feature of our ballasts that comes as a standard feature in all of our ballasts ignition control assures that no matter how many lamps are contained in a lighting array attached to one power source only one lamp will turn on at a predetermined time this technology not a randomized ignition startup detects the voltage and amperage frequencies of the electrical circuit and ignites an array of metal halide or sodium lamps when the load for each lamp is most stable we believe that solistek digital ballasts are the only ballasts capable of this technology the use of our technology prevents surges and spikes in electrical environment in which an array of ballasts operate and also prevents the overloading of circuit breakers   our sensesmart selfdiagnosing system feature enables our ballasts to internally safety check for overunder voltage overheating open circuits short circuits and more smartsense will recognize an unsafe condition and take predetermined actions to alleviate the safety issue            we offer a line of remote ballasts that include w v w v w v w v with remote control and timer w v only and w v   a w complete fixture   beginning in  we introduced a new a complete fixture equipped with ballast reflector and double ended lamp   digital lamps   metal halide lamps are a type of hid high intensity discharge lamp mercury vapor and highpressure sodium lamps are also hid lamps light is generated by creating an arc between the two electrodes located inside the inner arc tube the inner arc tube is typically made of quartz and this is a very harsh environment with high temperatures approaching °c and pressures of  or  atmospheres to start a metal halide lamp a high starting voltage is applied to the lamp’s electrodes to ionize the gas before current can flow and start the lamp   solis tek digital lamps are designed to be specifically tuned and matched with solis tek digital ballasts our lamps feature color enhanced full balanced spectrums prolonged lamp life  less depreciation of lumen output over time and precise gas combinations for increased blues reds and ultra violet output our lamps emit a full spectrum of light tuned specifically for particular types of plants as well our lamps provide ample ultra violet light that plants thrive upon we have designed our lamps using special low iron glass envelopes so as to prevent the blockage of the full spectrum of light that our lamps are designed to provide using solis tek lamps growers can expect superior photochemical reactions proper uv balance advanced hid lamp designed especially for plant growth plant quality and plant yield   we offer a select variety of spectrums in both high pressure sodium hps metal halides mh and ceramic metal halides cmh   led technology   led light emitting diode lighting supports sustainable design in several ways it uses less energy than most other types of lamps produces less heat lasts longer which means less frequent replacement and therefore reduced waste is mercuryfree and is housed in special semiconductor “chips” designed for easier configuration disassembly and recycling   in our ongoing research and development program we have designed and developed our next generation of high intensity lighting our led technology unlike other led lighting sources uses an advanced uv ultra violet diode phosphor combination to make our high intensity led based lighting systems our led systems will be available in the same light spectrums as our current hid lamps our design will emit lighting equivalent to the high pressure sodium spectrum and ultraviolet spectrums and eliminate the inadequacies of current led offerings to the horticultural industry ie a low intensity b lack of proper spectrum for particular plants and c longevity our led “chips” will provide from one led a full spectrum of light that mimics sunlight as compared to other led manufacturers of leds who provide arrays of several color specific leds in an attempt to cover the full light spectrum   led lighting produces significantly less heat than conventional hid and hps lamps so growers can control their greenhouse climate more accurately less heat also means more effective use of light for example by increasing light levels extending lighting periods or by using led light in greenhouses on warmer days without having to ventilate less heat also means you can place the light source closer to plants reducing light loss            solis tek reflectors   our line of “reflectors” is designed for use with our digital ballasts and lamps however they have standard sockets so that lamps and ballasts manufactured by others may also be used each reflector features air cooling heavily tinned wiring low iron glass for less filtering of light and utilize highly reflective aluminum to reflect light in the desired direction   we offer five different variations and sizes of reflectors   plant nutrients and fertilizers   growpro has developed “terpenez” which is a proprietary product formulated from all organic botanical extracts and is designed to assist plants with processes associated with oil and resin production terpenez is all natural and has organic inputs aimed at enhancing the aromatic experience of cultivation growpro commenced test marketing terpenez in late    marketing   we currently market our products directly and through distributors to hydroponic retailers through direct contacts online email advertising social media trade magazine advertising trade show promotions and crosspromotional offerings our officers along with five sales representatives and four distributors are engaged in marketing our products in addition we work with a select few wholesale distributors who cover parts of the united states canada spain and the united kingdom approximately  and  of our revenues were derived from nonus sources in  and  respectively   manufacturing and supply   all of our current products are manufactured to our specifications in china we currently rely upon one manufacturer and supplier of our ballast products the family of our president’s spouse owns a thirty per cent  interest in the manufacturer with the balance of ownership owned by nonrelated parties we believe that the prices charged by this supplier is on terms no more favorable than terms generally available to terms that we may pay to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances all of our other products including our lamps are manufactured and supplied by unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers   our reliance upon manufacturers and suppliers located in china subjects us to various political economic and other risks and uncertainties inherent in importing products from this country including among other risks exportimport duties quotas and embargoes domestic and international customs and tariffs changing taxation policies foreign exchange restrictions and political conditions and governmental regulations there can be no assurance that if there were an interruption of our supply lines from china that we would be able to find replacement suppliers of our products domestically or from other countries and even if we found replacement suppliers that we would be able to obtain the products at the quality and prices we currently pay   technology and development   we have entered into an agreement with gas technologies inc “gas” pursuant to which gas will provide design supply and engineering services to the company as well as exclusively license to the company certain products for the horticultural industry including all digital lighting products the “gas agreement” developed by gas the gas agreement gives the company the exclusive right to manufacture market and distribute all of the licensed technology among the technologies licensed are gas’s designs for some of the company’s led products   the gas agreement provides that the company will pay to licensor a minimum royalty at the rate of  per year the “minimum annual royalty” commencing on the date of this agreement plus seven per cent  of all net sales in excess of a fixed amount per calendar year the “additional royalty”   intellectual property   we own number of trademarks and rely on a combination of copyright and trade secrets as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we rely on copyright laws to protect copy on our web site wwwsolistekcom and all marketing materials   from time to time we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and reputation or our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming            government regulation   almost all of end users of our products have used our products for the growing of cannabis currently there are twentyeight states plus the district of columbia that have laws andor regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment in addition the states of colorado washington california massachusetts alaska nevada and oregon as well as the district of columbia have recently approved the recreational use of cannabis many other states are considering legislation to similar effect as of june   the policy and regulations of the federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of state law active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of our end user customers to continue to grow cannabis active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus directly and adversely affect revenues   competition   our lighting products segment currently faces competition from traditional lighting fixture companies lamp manufacturers and from nontraditional companies focused on led lighting systems including fixtures and lamps lighting companies such as acuity brands inc the cooper lighting division of eaton corporation plc general electric company hubbell incorporated philips osram gavita sunlight supply and hydrofarm are the main competitors in this market increasingly however other companies ie startups are beginning to emerge in the led lighting markets in which we compete we compete on the basis of product features quality product availability and price   our led lighting products will compete against traditional lighting products using incandescent fluorescent halogen ceramic metal halide or other lighting technology our led lighting products compete against traditional lighting products based upon superior energy savings extended life improved lighting quality and lower total cost of ownership also our led lighting products have a reduced impact on the environment as compared to fluorescent and compact fluorescent technologies that contain mercury   we will also compete with ledbased products from traditional and nontraditional lamp and fixture companies some of which are customers for our led chips and led components our products compete on the basis of color quality and consistency superior light output reduced energy consumption brand and lower total cost of ownership   patents trademarks franchises concessions royalty agreements   we own number of trademarks and rely on a combination of copyright and trade secrets as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we will rely on copyright laws to protect copy on our web site wwwsolistekcom and all marketing materials   from time to time we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and reputation or our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming   employees   as of december   the company has  fulltime employees employed by us in various capacities including two executive officers five in sales four administrative three in the warehouse and one in research and development in addition from time to time we employ temporary personal to meet the business needs            item a  risk factors   risk factors   risks related to marijuana laws   our business is dependent on laws pertaining to the marijuana industry   continued development of the marijuana industry is dependent upon continued legislative authorization of marijuana at the state level any number of factors could slow or halt progress in this area further progress while encouraging is not assured while there may be ample public support for legislative action numerous factors impact the legislative process any one of these factors could slow or halt use of marijuana which would negatively impact our business   currently there are twentyeight states plus the district of columbia that have laws andor regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment in addition the states of colorado washington california massachusetts alaska nevada and oregon as well as the district of columbia have recently approved the recreational use of cannabis the state laws are in conflict with the federal controlled substances act which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level the trump administration has indicated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct law federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by statedesignated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana however there is no guarantee that the trump administration will not change its stated policy regarding the lowpriority enforcement of federal laws additionally any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders   federal enforcement practices could change with respect to participants in the cannabis industry which could adversely impact us if the federal government were to change its practices or were to expand its resources attacking providers in the cannabis industry such action could have a materially adverse effect on our operations our customers or the sales of our products   it is possible that additional federal or state legislation could be enacted in the future that would prohibit our customers from selling cannabis and if such legislation were enacted such customers may discontinue the use of our services our potential source of customers would be reduced causing revenues to decline further additional government disruption in the cannabis industry could cause potential customers and users to be reluctant to use our services which would be detrimental to the company   we cannot predict the nature of any future laws regulations interpretations or applications nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures when and if promulgated could have on our business   laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations   local state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on its operations in addition it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our proposed business we cannot predict the nature of any future laws regulations interpretations or applications nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures when and if promulgated could have on its business            risks related to our business   our manufacturing is concentrated with two key manufacturers and if our relationship with either or both of them terminates or is otherwise impaired we would likely experience increased costs disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of our products and a material loss of net sales   we have no longterm contracts with our manufacturers and as a result our manufacturers could cease to provide products to us with no notice two of our manufacturers shenzhen jayo technologies co ltd and zhuhai relite co ltd together accounted for approximately  of our cost of goods sold in  and  respectively each of these manufacturers is the sole source supplier for the products that it produces we purchase from these two manufacturers on a purchase order basis with orders generally filled between  and  days after our purchase order is placed a loss of either or both of these manufacturers or other key manufacturers would result in delayed deliveries to our retailers and distributors would adversely impact our net sales and may require the establishment of new manufacturing relationships additionally we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers including reductions in the availability of production capacity errors in complying with product specifications insufficient quality control failures to meet production deadlines increases in manufacturing costs and increased lead times   risk of reliance on suppliers and manufacturers in china for production of our lighting related products   all of our products are imported from and manufactured in china for this reason a major change in the political economic andor legal environment or a natural disaster in china or another center of production could have an impact on our ability to supply products   we face business political operational financial and economic risks because a portion of our net sales are generated internationally and substantially all of our products are manufactured outside of the united states   we face business political operational financial and economic risks inherent in international business many of which are beyond our control including difficulties obtaining domestic and foreign export import and other governmental approvals permits and licenses and compliance with foreign laws which could halt interrupt or delay our operations if we cannot obtain such approvals permits and licenses and that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations difficulties encountered by our international distributors or us in staffing and managing foreign operations or international sales including higher labor costs which could increase our expenses and decrease our net sales and profitability transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels which could halt interrupt or delay our operations longer payment cycles for and greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable which could reduce our net sales and harm our financial results trade restrictions higher tariffs currency fluctuations or the imposition of additional regulations relating to import or export of our products especially in china where substantially all of our products are manufactured which could force us to seek alternate manufacturing sources or increase our expenses either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations political and economic instability including wars terrorism political unrest boycotts curtailment of trade and other business restrictions any of which could materially and adversely affect our net sales and results of operations and natural disasters which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   any of these factors could reduce our net sales decrease our gross margin or increase our expenses should we establish our own operations in international territories where we currently utilize a distributor we will become subject to greater risks associated with operating outside of the united states   any shortage of raw materials or components could impair our ability to ship orders of our products in a costefficient manner or could cause us to miss the delivery requirements of our retailers or distributors which could harm our business   the ability of our manufacturers to supply our products is dependent in part upon the availability of raw materials and certain components our manufacturers may experience shortages in the availability of raw materials or components which could result in delayed delivery of products to us or in increased costs to us any shortage of raw materials or components or inability to control costs associated with manufacturing could increase the costs for our products or impair our ability to ship orders in a timely costefficient manner as a result we could experience cancellation of orders refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in our prices and margins any of which could harm our financial performance and results of operations            our business could suffer if any of our manufacturers fail to use acceptable labor practices   we do not control our manufacturers or their labor practices the violation of labor or other laws by a manufacturer utilized by us or the divergence of an independent manufacturer’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or legal in the united states could damage our reputation or disrupt the shipment of finished products to us if such manufacturer is ordered to cease its manufacturing operations due to violations of laws or if such manufacturer’s operations are adversely affected by such failure to use acceptable labor practices if this were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations   foreign currency risk   for most products imported for our core business transactions are conducted in us dollars many major movements in exchange rates that persist for prolonged periods could have an adverse impact on our business results   we may elect from time to time to make changes to our pricing service hiring and marketing decisions that could increase our expenses affect our revenues and impact our financial results   because our expense levels in any given quarter are based in part on management’s expectations regarding future revenues if revenues are below expectations the effect on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for a shortfall in revenues the extent to which expenses are not subsequently followed by increased revenues would harm our operating results and could seriously impair our business   if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or are unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing to meet our working capital requirements we may have to curtail our business operations sharply or cease business altogether   we have a relatively short operating history on which to evaluate our potential for future success this makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risk of success or failure of our business   we incorporated in june of  and your evaluation of our business and prospects will be based on our limited history consequently our short history and results of operations may not give you an accurate indication of our future results of operations or prospects you must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we will encounter as an earlystage company in a highly competitive market we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties which could materially harm our business and operating results   as we grow our business we cannot guarantee our business strategies will be successful or that our revenues will ever increase sufficiently to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis   defects or disruptions in the delivery if our service could diminish demand decrease market acceptance or decrease customer satisfaction of our service and subject us to substantial liability   we may from time to time find defects in our products service may be detected in the future any defects with our products could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation            our inability to effectively manage our growth could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition   our strategy envisions growing our business we plan to expand our product sales administrative and marketing organizations any growth in or expansion of our business is likely to continue to place a strain on our management and administrative resources infrastructure and systems as with other growing businesses we expect that we will need to further refine and expand our business development capabilities our systems and processes and our access to financing sources we also will need to hire train supervise and manage new employees these processes are time consuming and expensive will increase management responsibilities and will divert management attention we cannot assure you that we will be able to     ● expand our products offerings effectively or efficiently or in a timely manner         ● allocate our human resources optimally         ● meet our capital needs         ● identify and hire qualified employees or retain valued employees or         ● incorporate effectively the components of any business or product line that we may acquire in our effort to achieve growth   our inability or failure to manage our growth and expansion effectively could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition   our operating results may fluctuate significantly based on customer acceptance of our products as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are unlikely to provide a good indication of our future performance   management expects that we will experience substantial variations in our net sales and operating results from quarter to quarter due to customer acceptance of our products if customers do not accept our products our sales and revenues will decline resulting in a reduction in our operating income   customer interest for our products could also be impacted by the timing of our introduction of new products if our competitors introduce new products around the same time that we issue new products and if such competing products are superior to our own customers’ desire for our products could decrease resulting in a decrease in our sales and revenues to the extent that we introduce new products and customers decide not to migrate to our new products from our older products our revenues could be negatively impacted due to the loss of revenue from those customers in the event that our newer products do not sell as well as our older products we could also experience a reduction in our revenues and operating income   as a result of fluctuations in our revenue and operating expenses that may occur management believes that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are unlikely to provide a good indication of our future performance   if we do not successfully generate additional products and services or if such products and services are developed but not successfully commercialized we could lose revenue opportunities   our future success depends in part on our ability to expand our product offerings to that end we have engaged in the process of identifying new product opportunities to provide additional products to our customers the process of identifying and commercializing new products is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we may have to commit significant resources to commercializing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept furthermore we may not execute successfully on commercializing those products because of errors in product planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and a reduction in net sales and earnings   the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive            our inability to effectively protect our intellectual property would adversely affect our ability to compete effectively our revenue our financial condition and our results of operations   we may be unable to obtain intellectual property rights to effectively protect our technology our ability to compete effectively may be affected by the nature and breadth of our intellectual property rights while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that any such actions will adequately protect our interests if we are unable to secure intellectual property rights to effectively protect our technology our revenue and earnings financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected   we may be adversely affected by the financial condition of our retailers and distributors   some of our retailers and distributors have experienced financial difficulties in the past a retailer or distributor experiencing such difficulties will generally not purchase and sell as many of our products as it would under normal circumstances and may cancel orders in addition a retailer or distributor experiencing financial difficulties generally increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables we extend credit to our retailers and distributors based on our assessment of their financial condition generally without requiring collateral while such credit losses have historically been within our reserves we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case financial difficulties on the part of our retailers or distributors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition   our industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete   we are involved in a highly competitive industry where we may compete with numerous other companies who offer alternative methods or approaches who have far greater resources more experience and personnel perhaps more qualified than we do such resources may give our competitors an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or products that make our products obsolete there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against these other entities   we will be required to attract and retain top quality talent to compete in the marketplace   we believe our future growth and success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial product development sales and marketing and finance personnel there can be no assurance of success in attracting and retaining such personnel shortages in qualified personnel could limit our ability to increase sales of existing products and launch new product and service offerings   our future success depends on our ability to grow and expand our customer base our failure to achieve such growth or expansion could materially harm our business   to date our revenue growth has been derived primarily from the sale of our products our success and the planned growth and expansion of our business depend on us achieving greater and broader acceptance of our products and expanding our customer base there can be no assurance that customers will purchase our products or that we will continue to expand our customer base if we are unable to effectively market or expand our product offerings we will be unable to grow and expand our business or implement our business strategy this could materially impair our ability to increase sales and revenue and materially and adversely affect our margins   weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations    our overall performance will depend in part on worldwide economic conditions the united states and other key international economies have been impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit going concern threats to major multinational companies and medium and small businesses poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets and bankruptcies these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our proposed enterprise cloud computing application service delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect renewal rates all of which could adversely affect our operating results            if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed   due to our evolving business model the unpredictability of new markets that we intend to enter and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis   we may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights   the lighting industry are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others we may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights our technologies may not be able to withstand any thirdparty claims against their use the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain any intellectual property claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to change our technology change our business practices andor pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available in the future at the same terms or at all in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results or cash flows or both in a particular quarter   supporting a growing customer base could strain our personnel and corporate infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan   our current management and human resources infrastructure is comprised of our ceo president and executive vice president and several outsourced consultants our success will depend in part upon the ability of our management to manage our proposed business effectively to do so we will need to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage the expected domestic growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we will be unable to execute our business plan   we are dependent on our ceo president and executive vice president and the loss of one or more of these individuals could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner   our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer president chief financial officer and executive vice president “evp” we have an employment agreement with our ceo however we do not have employment agreements with our president and evp our officers are “at will” employees and could terminate their employment with us at any time we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on our ceo president and evp the loss of the services of our ceo president and evp could seriously harm our business   failure to manage growth properly could seriously harm our business   we have experienced and may continue to experience significant growth in our business if we do not effectively manage our growth the quality of our business may suffer which could negatively affect our reputation and demand for our offerings our growth has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our managerial administrative operational and financial resources and our infrastructure our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage growth effectively among other things this will require us to implement additional management information systems further develop our operating administrative legal financial and accounting systems and controls hire additional personnel develop additional levels of management within our company locate additional office space maintain and improve coordination among our engineering product operations legal finance sales marketing and customer service and support organizations and manage our expanding international operations            moreover as our sales increase we may be required to concurrently deploy our business infrastructure at multiple additional locations andor provide increased levels of customization as a result we may lack the resources to deploy our products on a timely and costeffective basis failure to accomplish any of these requirements could impair our ability to deliver our products in a timely fashion fulfill existing customer commitments or attract and retain new customers   our ability to grow our business may depend on developing a positive brand reputation and member loyalty   establishing and maintaining a positive brand reputation and nurturing customer loyalty is critical to attracting new customers we expect to expend reasonable but limited resources to develop maintain and enhance our brand in the near future in addition nurturing customer loyalty will depend on our ability to provide highquality products which we may not do successfully if we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand reputation and customer loyalty our ability to attract new marketplace participants will be harmed   there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete against the numerous direct indirect and partial competitors many of which have valuable industry relationships and access to greater resources than we do   our retail and online distribution channels compete for customers and sales with many different companies and products that are competitive today and likely to be even more competitive in the future accordingly it is essential that we continue to develop improve and refine our products and the value propositions that are offered to customers   we also face competition from other companies that offer equipment moreover as the negative stigma associated with cannabis horticulture diminishes it is very possible that other better capitalized public and private companies many enter the market and may effectively challenge the value proposition offered by us these competitors may be able to attract customers more easily because of their financial resources our larger competitors can also devote substantially more resources to business development and may adopt more aggressive pricing policies there can be no assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing our business initiatives or that we will be able to maintain significant levels of revenues or recognize net income from the sale of our products and services   we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future   we anticipate that we will retain all future earnings and other cash resources for the future operation and development of our business and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future future payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account many factors including our operating results financial condition and capital requirements corporations that pay dividends may be viewed as a better investment than corporations that do not   we are dependent to some extent on our chief technology consultant for new and improved products   the company’s chief technology consultant is gas technologies incorporated “gast” should gast or any other participating technology providers be unable to execute their portion of the development effort new development of exclusive products of solis tek or any of its future plans could be delayed until a replacement is found   legal contingencies   from time to time we may be involved in routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business the ultimate amount of liability if any for any claims of any type either alone or in the aggregate may materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity in addition the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain any outcome whether favorable or unfavorable may materially and adversely affect us due to legal costs and expenses diversion of management attention and other factors we expense legal costs in the period incurred we cannot assure you that additional contingencies of a legal nature or contingencies having legal aspects will not be asserted against us in the future and these matters could relate to prior current or future transactions or events except as described below we are not currently a party to any material litigation            we may need to raise additional capital if we are unable to raise additional capital we may not be able to achieve our business plan   we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings as well as obtain credit from vendors to be able to fully execute our business plan any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute current shareholders’ ownership interest we may not be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain additional funds or credit from our vendors we will be unable to execute our business plan and you could lose your investment the company has recently embarked on a private placement and there is no assurance that the company will be able to fill the private placement effort   we have limited protection of our intellectual property   there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our trade secrets in the event competitors independently develop or otherwise obtain access to our knowhow concepts or trade secrets we may be adversely affected   risks related to ownership of our common stock   there is minimal active liquid trading market for the company’s common stock   the company common stock is quoted on the otcqb however there is minimal regular active trading market in the company’s common stock and we cannot give an assurance that a more active trading market will develop if a more active market for the company’s common stock develops there is a significant risk that the company’s stock price may fluctuate dramatically in the future in response to any of the following factors some of which are beyond our control such as     ● actual or anticipated variations in our operating results including whether we have achieved our key business targets andor earnings estimates and prospects         ● announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors         ● announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions business achievements strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments         ● additions or departures of key personnel         ● introduction of new services by us or our competitors         ● sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market particularly if overall trading volume is not high         ● general market conditions and broader political and economic conditions         ● actual or anticipated monetization’s of our patents and         ● other events or factors many of which are beyond our control              our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  million shares of “blank check” preferred stock the issuance of any preferred stock may adversely affect the holders of common stock   our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock with designations rights and preferences determined from time to time by its board of directors accordingly our board of directors is empowered without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with dividend liquidation conversion voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock in the event of issuance the preferred stock could be utilized under certain circumstances as a method of discouraging delaying or preventing a change in control of the company although we have no present intention to issue any shares of our authorized preferred stock there can be no assurance that the company will not do so in the future   future issuance of our common stock could dilute the interests of existing shareholders   we may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future the issuance of a substantial

difficult to sell their stock   it is expected our common stock will be trading at less than  per share and is therefore subject to the sec penny stock rules penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account the brokerdealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity if any in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in our securities which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of our securities these requirements may restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock   if we are unable to establish appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations result in the restatement of our financial statements harm our operating results subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our common stock   effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting which is defined as a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles   as a public company we have significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls we will be required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting the process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company            we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify areas requiring improvement in our internal control over financial reporting we cannot assure you that the measures we will take to remediate any areas in need of improvement will be successful or that we will implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future as we continue our growth if we are unable to

costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the sarbanesoxley act we may need to hire additional financial reporting internal controls and other finance staff or consultants in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures   we will incur increased costs as a public company which may affect our profitability   solis tek inc previously operated as a private company in california as a public company we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses we are subject to the sec’s rules and regulations relating to public disclosure sec disclosures generally involve a substantial expenditure of financial resources compliance with these rules and regulations will significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and some activities will become more timeconsuming and costly management may need to increase compensation for senior executive officers engage additional senior financial officers who are able to adopt financial reporting and control procedures allocate a budget for an investor and public relations program and increase our financial and accounting staff in order to meet the demands and financial reporting requirements as a public reporting company such additional personnel public relations reporting and compliance costs may negatively impact our financial results   public company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors   the sarbanesoxley act and rules implemented by the sec require changes in corporate governance practices of public companies as a public company these rules and regulations increase our compliance costs and make certain activities more time consuming and costly as a public company these rules and regulations make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers   because our directors and executive officers are among our largest shareholders they can exert significant control over our business and affairs and have actual or potential interests that may depart from those of shareholders   our directors and executive officers own or control a significant percentage of the common stock additionally the holdings of our directors and executive officers may increase in the future if they otherwise acquire additional shares of our common stock the interests of such persons may differ from the interests of our other shareholders as a result in addition to their board seats and offices such persons will have significant influence over and control all corporate actions requiring shareholder approval irrespective of how the company’s other shareholders including purchasers in the offering may vote including the following actions     ● to elect or defeat the election of our directors         ● to amend or prevent amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws              ● to effect or prevent a merger sale of assets or other corporate transaction and         ● to control the outcome of any other matter submitted to our shareholders for vote   such persons’ stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to impairment of longlived assets including finite lived intangible assets accrued liabilities fair value of warrant derivatives and certain expenses we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the

they are considered uncollectible            inventories   the company provides inventory reserves based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by historical sales and future demand forecasts the write down amount is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis   inventories under warranty claims   in the ordinary course of business the company receives product returns from its customers the

taxes using a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than  percent likely of being realized upon settlement the company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the

date valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the company uses a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable to measure fair value     ● level  — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities         ● level  — inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities         ● level  — unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities   the carrying amounts of financial instruments such as cash accounts receivable inventories and accounts

based on the framework in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” based on management’s evaluation under the framework management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december              we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting primarily attributable to i lack of segregation of incompatible duties and ii insufficient board of directors representation these weaknesses are due to our inadequate staffing during the period covered by this report and our lack of working capital to hire additional staff management has retained an outside independent financial consultant to record and review all financial data as well as prepare our financial reports in order to mitigate this weakness although management will periodically reevaluate this situation at this point it considers that the risk associated with such lack of segregation of duties and the potential benefits of adding employees to segregate such duties are not cost justified we intend to hire additional accounting personnel to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow   this annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial

demanded that the company’s founders devote more and more of their time to growth and development creating a need in the areas of business management with particular attention to the public company sector the company’s search for key executives to fill these growth needs demands that the company find a seasoned high level executive with broad based multinational experience in a growth industry

subsidiary of the company “merger sub” providing for the merger of merger sub with and into sti the “merger” with sti surviving the merger as a whollyowned subsidiary of the company the merger was accounted for as a recapitalization of the company with sti being deemed the accounting acquirer   overview of business   solis tek inc is focused on the research design development and manufacturing

per share calculations   basic earnings loss per share are computed by dividing income loss available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of common shares available shares of restricted stock subject to vesting are included in basic weighted average common shares outstanding from the time they vest diluted earnings loss per share is computed similar to basic earnings loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive weighted average number of shares outstanding has been retroactively restated for the equivalent number of shares received by the accounting acquirer as a result of the reverse merger as if these shares had been outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest period presented options to acquire  shares of common stock have been excluded from the calculation of weighted average common shares outstanding at march   as their effect would have been antidilutive   use of estimates   the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and

provided that evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss have passed to the customer fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title to the company’s products primarily is transferred to the customer once the product is shipped from the company’s warehouses products are not shipped until there is a written agreement with the customer with a specified payment arrangement any discounts that are offered are done as a reduction of the invoiced amount at the time of billing payments received before all of the relevant criteria

exchange commission “sec” defines “critical accounting policies” as those that require application of management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods not all of the accounting policies require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates however the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition   allowance for doubtful accounts   the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the company’s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts the company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience the age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates trade receivables are written off at the point when they are considered uncollectible   inventories   the company provides inventory reserves based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts the write down amount is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis        recent accounting pronouncements   see note  of the condensed financial statements for management’s discussion of recent accounting pronouncements   results of operations   results of operations for the three months ended march   compared to the three months ended march     revenue and cost of goods sold   revenue for the three months ended march   and  was  and  respectively an

percentage was due to higher revenue and product mix   selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the three months ended march   and  was  and  respectively an increase of  or  the increase in sga expenses was due to increase in payroll marketing travel trade shows outbound freight and sales commission to support the increase in revenues and

expenses   research and development “rd” expenses for the three months ended march   and  was  and  respectively an increase of  or  the increase in rd expenses was primarily due to fair value of

was  compared to net income of  for the three months ended march   the net loss for the three months ended march   was due to significant noncash costs of  that resulted in the increase in sga and rd and was offset in part with increase in gross profit compared to the three months ended march          liquidity and capital resources   liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures   cash flows used in operating activities   during the three months ended march   the company used  in operating activities

payablerelated party of  and payments on loans payable and capital lease obligation   we estimate the company currently has sufficient cash and liquidity to meet its anticipated working capital for the next twelve months   historically we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of common stock a line of credit and loans from a third party financial institution related parties and operations we anticipate that our primary capital source will be positive cash flow from operations if our sales goals do not materialize as planned we believe that the company can reduce its operating costs and achieve positive cash flow from operations however we may not generate sufficient revenues from product sales in the future to achieve profitable operations if we are not able to achieve profitable operations at some point in the future we may have insufficient working capital to maintain our operations as we presently intend to conduct them or to fund our expansion marketing and product development plans there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms or at all   on march   the board of directors of the company

ebitda is not a recognized measurement under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation nongaap adjustments to our results prepared in accordance with gaap are itemized below you are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating adjusted ebitda you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items   set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss for the three months ended march   and        three months ended       march       march                   net income loss            add                 interest expense               provision for income taxes               depriciation and amortization               stockbased compensation               adjusted ebitda              we present adjusted ebitda because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool which includes among others the following     ● adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments         ● adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs         ● adjusted ebitda does not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debts and         ● although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements   offbalance

control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” based on management’s evaluation under the framework management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of september     we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting primarily attributable to i lack of segregation of incompatible duties and ii insufficient board of directors representation these weaknesses are due to our inadequate staffing during the period covered by this report and our lack of working capital to hire additional staff management has retained an outside independent financial consultant to record and review all financial data as well as prepare our financial reports in order to mitigate this weakness although management will periodically reevaluate this situation at this point it considers that

organization   solis tek inc the “company” was originally incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on march   as cinjet inc “cinjet” effective september   cinjet changed its corporate name to solis tek inc on june   the company entered into an agreement of merger and plan of reorganization the “agreement” with solis tek inc a california corporation “sti” and cja acquisition corp a california corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company “merger sub” providing for the merger of merger sub with and into sti the “merger” with sti surviving the merger as a whollyowned subsidiary of the company the merger agreement was approved by the company’s board of directors and the sole director of the company effective june   the merger closed on june     at the effective time of the merger each share of sti common stock issued and outstanding was converted automatically into the right to receive  shares of the common stock of the company with an aggregate of  shares of the company’s common stock issued to the former shareholders of sti   upon the closing of the merger sti paid a total of  to four shareholders of the company for the cancellation of a total of  shares of the company’s common stock also at the closing of the merger sti paid  to the company to settle and pay liabilities of  which represented all of the then current liabilities of the company after the closing a total of  shares of the company were outstanding   upon completion of the merger the former stockholders of sti owned approximately  of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock and the holders of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock prior to the merger owned the balance as the former owners and management of sti have voting and operating control of the company after the merger the transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization with the sti deemed the acquiring companies for accounting purposes and the company deemed the legal acquirer due to the change in control the consolidated financial statements reflect the historical results of sti prior to the merger and that of the combined company following the merger common stock and the corresponding capital amounts of the company premerger have been retroactively restated as capital stock shares reflecting the exchange ratio in the merger no stepup in basis or intangible assets or goodwill will be recorded in this transaction and the cash paid by the company of  including  of transaction costs has been reflected as a cost of the transaction   overview of business   solis tek inc is focused on the research design development and manufacturing of advanced energy efficient indoor horticulture lighting and ancillary equipment our vision is to apply the latest advances in high efficiency lighting and controls technology as well as effective manufacturing techniques to deliver highly differentiated products with clear benefits at competitive prices to the greenhouse and indoor horticulture markets   our subsidiary solis tek inc a california corporation was formed in june of  its operations consists of designing developing and sourcing of a line of solis tek digital ballasts intended for use in high intensity lighting systems used for horticulture an electrical ballast is a device intended to limit the amount of current in an electric circuit a familiar and widely used example is the inductive ballast used in fluorescent lamps to limit the current through the tube which would otherwise rise to destructive levels due to the tube’s negative resistance characteristic since the commencement of operations our product line has evolved from digital ballasts to a line of lighting products including a line of specialty ballasts ranging from  watts to  watts with various features a line of specialty metal halide digital lamps our “lamp products” a line of reflectors high intensity lighting accessories and a new line of double ended lamps ceramic metal halide lamps and light emitting diode “led” lighting technologies            we market our products primarily to retailers in the united states who specialize in hydroponic horticulture currently we have approximately  retailers that sell our products in addition we work with a few wholesale distributors who cover canada spain australia germany italy austria czech republic france and the united kingdom   historically the company believes that a majority percentage of the end users that use this type of products have used the equipment for the growing of specialty crops such as cannabis currently there are  states and the district of columbia that have laws andor regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment in addition the states of colorado washington alaska oregon and the district of columbia have recently approved the recreational use of cannabis many other states are considering legislation to similar effect as of july   the policy and regulations of the federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of state law active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of our end user customers to continue to grow cannabis active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus directly and adversely affect revenues and profits   however the company’s products can be and are used for the hydroponic and indoor growing of other horticultural products such as green house vegetables decorative plant nurseries indoor aquariums and industrial painting facilities the company intends to continue to expand and improve its products for use in as many applications as possible and to market its products to the entire indoor horticultural industry as well as other industrial applications that require artificial lighting   in august of  solis tek east corporation “ste” was incorporated in the state of new jersey as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company ste was formed for the purpose of commencing its operations and servicing and supplying the eastern part of north america with our products in september  ste leased a  square foot office and warehouse facility in south hackensack new jersey   our ballast products are manufactured in china by a manufacturer that is partially owned by a related party to alan lien our chief executive officer our lamp products are manufactured to our specifications and supplied by an unrelated manufacturer in china our lamp ancillary products and equipment are also manufactured to our designs in china   license agreement   in may of  we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with gas technologies incorporated “gas” of kapolei hawaii pursuant to which we agreed to pay gas a minimum royalty of  per year and an additional  of sales of products licensed by gas to us over and above  sales of the licensed products in  and  were  and  respectively thus only the minimum royalty amount of  was due for  in  the company owed an additional  under the amended agreement the license grants to us an exclusive worldwide license to produce manufacture have manufactured use import sell market distribute and sell the products and systems the “licensed products” and any further products and systems that may be developed by the licensor for use in the horticulture and hydroponic industries the “industries” such products include our “single ended and “double ended” metal halide digital lamps and a new line of light emitting diode “led” lighting technologies and products   the cannabis industry and government regulation   currently there are twentythree states plus the district of columbia that have laws andor regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment in addition the states of colorado washington alaska oregon as well as the district of columbia have recently approved the recreational use of cannabis the state laws are in conflict with the federal controlled substances act which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level the obama administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct law federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by statedesignated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana however there is no guarantee that the obama administration will not change its stated policy regarding the lowpriority enforcement of federal laws additionally any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders            indoor lighting industry   light and plant growth   light is essential for plant growth natural sunlight is the cheapest source available but for horticulture it is not always attainable in sufficient quantities therefore the uses of artificial or alternative light sources have become very common in order to increase production and quality predominantly in indoor or greenhouse environments plants have a completely different sensitivity to light spectrum than humans every plant has their own sensitivity for colors and intensity of light using these alternate light sources for plants effective light recipes are essential to obtain the optimal results in plant production   grow lights   a grow light or plant light is an artificial light source generally an electric light designed to stimulate plant growth by emitting an electromagnetic spectrum appropriate for photosynthesis grow lights are used in applications where there is either no naturally occurring light or where supplemental light is required for example in the winter months when the available hours of daylight may be insufficient for the desired plant growth lights are used to extend the time the plants receive light   grow lights either attempt to provide a light spectrum similar to that of the sun or to provide a spectrum that is more tailored to the needs of the plants being cultivated outdoor conditions are mimicked with varying color temperatures and spectral outputs from the grow light as well as varying the lumen output intensity and par output of the lamps depending on the type of plant being cultivated the stage of cultivation eg the germinationvegetative phase or the floweringfruiting phase and the photoperiod required by the plants specific ranges of spectrum luminous efficacy and color temperature are desirable for use with specific plants and time periods   specially designed artificial light sources can improve diverse growth parameters these all depends on several factors like crop environmental circumstances light recipe and many more the following is a list of benefits that can be achieved with specially designed artificial lighting     ● increased production and yield         ● increased aromatic flavor and higher potency         ● shortening of the total growth cycle         ● better plant uniformity         ● better space utility         ● improved plant quality         ● energy savings         ● better germination rate         ● higher multiplication factor         ● higher survival rate in rooting         ● improvedcontrolled stretching process         ● accelerated hardening phase   hydroponics   the great majority of our customers are retailers that specialize in hydroponics and sell our products to hydroponic enclosed farm operators hydroponics is a method of growing plants in mineral nutrient solutions in water without soil terrestrial plants may be grown with their roots in the mineral nutrient solution only or in an inert medium such as polite gravel expanded clay pebbles or coconut husks            some of the reasons why hydroponics is being adapted around the world for plant production are the following     ● no soil is needed for hydroponics         ● the water stays in the system and can be reused  thus a lower water requirement and waste         ● it is possible to control the nutrition levels in their entirety thus lower nutrition requirements         ● no nutrition pollution is released into the environment because of the controlled system         ● stable and high yields         ● pests and diseases are easier to get rid of than in soil because of the container’s mobility         ● ease of harvesting         ● no pesticide damage   our business strategy   due to the expected increase in the number of states where the use of cannabis both for medical and recreational use is being legalized the company intends to take advantage of what we believe is our premium brand image within the cannabis farming industry we believe that as participation in the cannabis farming industry grows in order to supply increasing demand caused by legalization our solis tek brand equipment will be sought out by existing and new cannabis farms and businesses further we intend to broaden our marketing efforts to the noncannabis lighting market which includes among others green house vegetables decorative plant nurseries indoor aquariums and industrial painting facilities our strategy is to maintain and increase our market share by expanding our marketing efforts and by introducing new and improved lighting technology to help the industry become more efficient in addition the company has also intends to market and sell a new line of plant nutrients fertilizers and grow media to help expand the market reach and maximize the revenue potential of the company   products   ballasts   ballasts provide the proper starting voltage operating voltage and current to the lamp to initiate and sustain its arc high intensity discharge hid lamps have negative resistance which causes them to draw an increasing amount of current hence they require a currentlimiting device the ballast provides the following functions   it provides starting voltage and in some cases ignition pulses all ballasts must provide some specific minimum voltage to ignite the lamp in the case of pulse start lamps an additional high voltage pulse is needed to ionize the gases within the lamp these pulses are superimposed near the peak starting voltage waveform it regulates the lamp’s current and power the ballast limits the current through the lamp once it has started the ballast’s current is set to a level that delivers the proper power to the lamp in addition the ballast regulates the lamp’s current through the range of typical line voltage variations thereby keeping the lamp’s power fairly stable to maximize the lamp’s life and performance and it provides appropriate sustaining voltage and current wave shape to achieve the lamp’s rated life the ballast provides sufficient voltage to sustain the lamp as it ages   solis tek digital ballasts were designed with “ignition control” sequential lamp ignition and “sensesmart” self diagnostic safety systems solis tek digital ballasts are software based compared to competitors products that are controlled by hard wired microchips dictating commands to their ballasts because our ballasts are software based our ballasts are more versatile and enables us to incorporate special features such as sequential ballast ignition technology “ignition control”and sensesmart technologies that ignites metal halide lamps one at a time based on load stability ignition control is a main feature of our ballasts that comes as a standard feature in all of our ballasts ignition control assures that no matter how many lamps are contained in a lighting array attached to one power source only one lamp will turn on at a predetermined time this technology not a randomized ignition startup detects the voltage and amperage frequencies of the electrical circuit and ignites an array of metal halide or sodium lamps when the load for each lamp is most stable we believe that solistek digital ballasts are the only ballasts capable of this technology the use of our technology prevents surges and spikes in electrical environment in which an array of ballasts operate and also prevents the overloading of circuit breakers   our sensesmart selfdiagnosing system feature enables our ballasts to internally safety check for overunder voltage overheating open circuits short circuits and more smartsense will recognize an unsafe condition and take predetermined actions to alleviate the safety issue            we offer a line of remote ballasts that include w v w v w v w v with remote control and timer w v only and w v   a w complete fixture   beginning in  we introduced a new a complete fixture equipped with ballast reflector and double ended lamp   digital lamps   metal halide lamps are a type of hid high intensity discharge lamp mercury vapor and highpressure sodium lamps are also hid lamps light is generated by creating an arc between the two electrodes located inside the inner arc tube the inner arc tube is typically made of quartz and this is a very harsh environment with high temperatures approaching °c and pressures of  or  atmospheres to start a metal halide lamp a high starting voltage is applied to the lamp’s electrodes to ionize the gas before current can flow and start the lamp   solis tek digital lamps are designed to be specifically tuned and matched with solis tek digital ballasts our lamps feature color enhanced full balanced spectrums prolonged lamp life  less depreciation of lumen output over time and precise gas combinations for increased blues reds and ultra violet output our lamps emit a full spectrum of light tuned specifically for particular types of plants as well our lamps provide ample ultra violet light that plants thrive upon we have designed our lamps using special low iron glass envelopes so as to prevent the blockage of the full spectrum of light that our lamps are designed to provide using solis tek lamps growers can expect superior photochemical reactions proper uv balance advanced hid lamp that is designed especially for plant growth plant quality and plant yield   we offer a select variety of spectrums in both high pressure sodium hps metal halides mh and ceramic metal halids cmh   led technology   led light emitting diode lighting supports sustainable design in several ways it uses less energy than most other types of lamps produces less heat lasts longer which means less frequent replacement and therefore reduced waste is mercuryfree and is housed in special semiconductor “chips” designed for easier configuration disassembly and recycling   in our ongoing research and development program we have designed and developed our next generation of high intensity lighting our led technology unlike other led lighting sources uses an advanced uv ultra violet diode phosphor combination to make our high intensity led based lighting systems our led systems will be available in the same light spectrums as our current hid lamps our patent pending and proprietary design will emit lighting equivalent to the high pressure sodium spectrum and ultraviolet spectrums and eliminate the inadequacies of current led offerings to the horticultural industry ie a low intensity b lack of proper spectrum for particular plants and c longevity our led “chips” will provide from one led a full spectrum of light that mimics sunlight as compared to other led manufacturers of leds who provide arrays of several color specific leds in an attempt to cover the full light spectrum   led lighting produces significantly less heat than conventional hid and hps lamps so growers can control their greenhouse climate more accurately less heat also means more effective use of light for example by increasing light levels extending lighting periods or by using led light in greenhouses on warmer days without having to ventilate less heat also means you can place the light source closer to plants reducing light loss            solis tek reflectors   our line of “reflectors” is designed for use with our digital ballasts and lamps however they have standard sockets so that lamps and ballasts manufactured by others may also be used each reflector features air cooling heavily tinned wiring low iron glass for less filtering of light and utilize highly reflective aluminum to reflect light in the desired direction   we currently offer five different variations and sizes of reflectors   marketing   we currently market our products directly and through distributors to hydroponic retailers through direct contacts online email advertising social media trade magazine advertising trade show promotions and crosspromotional offerings our officers along with four sales representatives and four distributors are engaged in marketing our products in addition we work with a select few wholesale distributors who cover parts of the united states canada spain and the united kingdom approximately  of our revenues were derived from nonus sources in    manufacturing and supply   all of our current products are manufactured to our specifications in china we currently rely upon one manufacturer and supplier of our ballast products the family of our chief executive officer’s spouse owns a thirty per cent  interest in the manufacturer with the balance of ownership owned by nonrelated parties we believe that the prices charged by this supplier is on terms no more favorable than terms generally available to terms that we may pay to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances all of our other products including our lamps are manufactured and supplied by unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers   our reliance upon manufacturers and suppliers located in china subjects us to various political economic and other risks and uncertainties inherent in importing products from this country including among other risks exportimport duties quotas and embargoes domestic and international customs and tariffs changing taxation policies foreign exchange restrictions and political conditions and governmental regulations there can be no assurance that if there were an interruption of our supply lines from china that we would be able to find replacement suppliers of our products domestically or from other countries and even if we found replacement suppliers that we would be able to obtain the products at the quality and prices we currently pay   technology and development   we have entered into an agreement with gas technologies inc “gas” pursuant to which gas will provide design supply and engineering services to the company as well as exclusively license to the company certain products for the horticultural industry including all digital lighting products the “gas agreement” developed by gas the gas agreement gives the company the exclusive right to manufacture market and distribute all of the licensed technology among the technologies licensed are gas’s designs for some of the company’s led products   the gas agreement provides that the company will pay to licensor a minimum royalty at the rate of  per year the “minimum annual royalty” commencing on the date of this agreement plus seven per cent  of all net sales in excess of  per calendar year the “additional royalty”   intellectual property   we do not presently have any patents or trademarks we will rely on a combination of copyright and trade secrets as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we will rely on copyright laws to protect copy on our web site wwwsolistekcom and all marketing materials   from time to time we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and reputation or our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming            government regulation   historically a majority percentage of end users of our products have used our products for the growing of specialty crops such as cannabis currently there are  states plus the district of columbia that have laws andor regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment in addition the states of colorado washington and oregon as well as the district of columbia have recently approved the recreational use of cannabis many other states are considering legislation to similar effect as of june   the policy and regulations of the federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of state law active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of our end user customers to continue to grow cannabis active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus directly and adversely affect revenues   competition   our lighting products segment currently faces competition from traditional lighting fixture companies lamp manufacturers and from nontraditional companies focused on led lighting systems including fixtures and lamps lighting companies such as acuity brands inc the cooper lighting division of eaton corporation plc general electric company hubbell incorporated philips osram gavita sunlight supply and hydrofarm are the main competitors in this market increasingly however other companies ie startups are beginning to emerge in the hid and led lighting markets in which we compete we compete on the basis of product features quality and price   our led lighting products will compete against traditional lighting products using incandescent fluorescent halogen ceramic metal halide or other lighting technology our led lighting products compete against traditional lighting products based upon superior energy savings extended life improved lighting quality and lower total cost of ownership also our led lighting products have a reduced impact on the environment as compared to fluorescent and compact fluorescent technologies that contain mercury   we will also compete with ledbased products from traditional and nontraditional lamp and fixture companies some of which are customers for our led chips and led components our products compete on the basis of color quality and consistency superior light output reduced energy consumption brand and lower total cost of ownership   patents trademarks franchises concessions royalty agreements   we do not presently have any patents we do own trademarks on certain of our products and our logo we will rely on a combination of copyright and trade secrets as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we will rely on copyright laws to protect copy on our web site wwwsolistekcom and all marketing materials   from time to time we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and reputation or our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming   employees   as of the date hereof the company has  fulltime employees working for us in various capacities including two executive officers four in sales five administrative three in the warehouse and one in research and development            item a  risk factors   risk factors   risks related to marijuana laws   our business is dependent on laws pertaining to the marijuana industry   continued development of the marijuana industry is dependent upon continued legislative authorization of marijuana at the state level any number of factors could slow or halt progress in this area further progress while encouraging is not assured while there may be ample public support for legislative action numerous factors impact the legislative process any one of these factors could slow or halt use of marijuana which would negatively impact our business   currently there are twentythree states plus the district of columbia that have laws andor regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment in addition the states of colorado washington alaska oregon as well as the district of columbia have recently approved the recreational use of cannabis the state laws are in conflict with the federal controlled substances act which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level the obama administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct law federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by statedesignated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana however there is no guarantee that the obama administration will not change its stated policy regarding the lowpriority enforcement of federal laws additionally any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders   federal enforcement practices could change with respect to participants in the cannabis industry which could adversely impact us if the federal government were to change its practices or were to expand its resources attacking providers in the cannabis industry such action could have a materially adverse effect on our operations our customers or the sales of our products   it is possible that additional federal or state legislation could be enacted in the future that would prohibit our customers from selling cannabis and if such legislation were enacted such customers may discontinue the use of our services our potential source of customers would be reduced causing revenues to decline further additional government disruption in the cannabis industry could cause potential customers and users to be reluctant to use our services which would be detrimental to the company   we cannot predict the nature of any future laws regulations interpretations or applications nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures when and if promulgated could have on our business   laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations   local state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on its operations in addition it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our proposed business we cannot predict the nature of any future laws regulations interpretations or applications nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures when and if promulgated could have on its business            risks related to our business   our manufacturing is concentrated with two key manufacturers and if our relationship with either or both of them terminates or is otherwise impaired we would likely experience increased costs disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of our products and a material loss of net sales   we have no longterm contracts with our manufacturers and as a result our manufacturers could cease to provide products to us with no notice two of our manufacturers shenzhen jayo technologies co ltd and zhuhai relite co ltd together accounted for approximately  of our cost of goods sold in  and  respectively each of these manufacturers is the sole source supplier for the products that it produces we purchase from these two manufacturers on a purchase order basis with orders generally filled between  and  days after our purchase order is placed a loss of either or both of these manufacturers or other key manufacturers would result in delayed deliveries to our retailers and distributors would adversely impact our net sales and may require the establishment of new manufacturing relationships additionally we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers including reductions in the availability of production capacity errors in complying with product specifications insufficient quality control failures to meet production deadlines increases in manufacturing costs and increased lead times   risk of reliance on suppliers and manufacturers in china for production of our lighting related products   all of our products are imported from and manufactured in china for this reason a major change in the political economic andor legal environment or a natural disaster in china or another center of production could have an impact on our ability to supply products   we face business political operational financial and economic risks because a portion of our net sales are generated internationally and substantially all of our products are manufactured outside of the united states   we face business political operational financial and economic risks inherent in international business many of which are beyond our control including difficulties obtaining domestic and foreign export import and other governmental approvals permits and licenses and compliance with foreign laws which could halt interrupt or delay our operations if we cannot obtain such approvals permits and licenses and that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations difficulties encountered by our international distributors or us in staffing and managing foreign operations or international sales including higher labor costs which could increase our expenses and decrease our net sales and profitability transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels which could halt interrupt or delay our operations longer payment cycles for and greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable which could reduce our net sales and harm our financial results trade restrictions higher tariffs currency fluctuations or the imposition of additional regulations relating to import or export of our products especially in china where substantially all of our products are manufactured which could force us to seek alternate manufacturing sources or increase our expenses either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations political and economic instability including wars terrorism political unrest boycotts curtailment of trade and other business restrictions any of which could materially and adversely affect our net sales and results of operations and natural disasters which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   any of these factors could reduce our net sales decrease our gross margin or increase our expenses should we establish our own operations in international territories where we currently utilize a distributor we will become subject to greater risks associated with operating outside of the united states   any shortage of raw materials or components could impair our ability to ship orders of our products in a costefficient manner or could cause us to miss the delivery requirements of our retailers or distributors which could harm our business   the ability of our manufacturers to supply our products is dependent in part upon the availability of raw materials and certain components our manufacturers may experience shortages in the availability of raw materials or components which could result in delayed delivery of products to us or in increased costs to us any shortage of raw materials or components or inability to control costs associated with manufacturing could increase the costs for our products or impair our ability to ship orders in a timely costefficient manner as a result we could experience cancellation of orders refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in our prices and margins any of which could harm our financial performance and results of operations            our business could suffer if any of our manufacturers fail to use acceptable labor practices   we do not control our manufacturers or their labor practices the violation of labor or other laws by a manufacturer utilized by us or the divergence of an independent manufacturer’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or legal in the united states could damage our reputation or disrupt the shipment of finished products to us if such manufacturer is ordered to cease its manufacturing operations due to violations of laws or if such manufacturer’s operations are adversely affected by such failure to use acceptable labor practices if this were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations   foreign currency risk   for most products imported for our core business transactions are conducted in us dollars many major movements in exchange rates that persist for prolonged periods could have an adverse impact on our business results   we may elect from time to time to make changes to our pricing service hiring and marketing decisions that could increase our expenses affect our revenues and impact our financial results   because our expense levels in any given quarter are based in part on management’s expectations regarding future revenues if revenues are below expectations the effect on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for a shortfall in revenues the extent to which expenses are not subsequently followed by increased revenues would harm our operating results and could seriously impair our business   if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or are unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing to meet our working capital requirements we may have to curtail our business operations sharply or cease business altogether   we have a relatively short operating history on which to evaluate our potential for future success this makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risk of success or failure of our business   we incorporated in june of  and your evaluation of our business and prospects will be based on our limited history consequently our short history and results of operations may not give you an accurate indication of our future results of operations or prospects you must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we will encounter as an earlystage company in a highly competitive market we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties which could materially harm our business and operating results   as we grow our business we cannot guarantee our business strategies will be successful or that our revenues will ever increase sufficiently to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis   defects or disruptions in the delivery if our service could diminish demand decrease market acceptance or decrease customer satisfaction of our service and subject us to substantial liability   we may from time to time find defects in our products service may be detected in the future any defects with our products could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation            our inability to effectively manage our growth could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition   our strategy envisions growing our business we plan to expand our product sales administrative and marketing organizations any growth in or expansion of our business is likely to continue to place a strain on our management and administrative resources infrastructure and systems as with other growing businesses we expect that we will need to further refine and expand our business development capabilities our systems and processes and our access to financing sources we also will need to hire train supervise and manage new employees these processes are time consuming and expensive will increase management responsibilities and will divert management attention we cannot assure you that we will be able to     ● expand our products offerings effectively or efficiently or in a timely manner         ● allocate our human resources optimally         ● meet our capital needs         ● identify and hire qualified employees or retain valued employees or         ● incorporate effectively the components of any business or product line that we may acquire in our effort to achieve growth   our inability or failure to manage our growth and expansion effectively could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition   our operating results may fluctuate significantly based on customer acceptance of our products as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are unlikely to provide a good indication of our future performance   management expects that we will experience substantial variations in our net sales and operating results from quarter to quarter due to customer acceptance of our products if customers do not accept our products our sales and revenues will decline resulting in a reduction in our operating income   customer interest for our products could also be impacted by the timing of our introduction of new products if our competitors introduce new products around the same time that we issue new products and if such competing products are superior to our own customers’ desire for our products could decrease resulting in a decrease in our sales and revenues to the extent that we introduce new products and customers decide not to migrate to our new products from our older products our revenues could be negatively impacted due to the loss of revenue from those customers in the event that our newer products do not sell as well as our older products we could also experience a reduction in our revenues and operating income   as a result of fluctuations in our revenue and operating expenses that may occur management believes that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are unlikely to provide a good indication of our future performance   if we do not successfully generate additional products and services or if such products and services are developed but not successfully commercialized we could lose revenue opportunities   our future success depends in part on our ability to expand our product offerings to that end we have engaged in the process of identifying new product opportunities to provide additional products to our customers the process of identifying and commercializing new products is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we may have to commit significant resources to commercializing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept furthermore we may not execute successfully on commercializing those products because of errors in product planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and a reduction in net sales and earnings   the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive            our inability to effectively protect our intellectual property would adversely affect our ability to compete effectively our revenue our financial condition and our results of operations   we may be unable to obtain intellectual property rights to effectively protect our technology our ability to compete effectively may be affected by the nature and breadth of our intellectual property rights while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that any such actions will adequately protect our interests if we are unable to secure intellectual property rights to effectively protect our technology our revenue and earnings financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected   we may be adversely affected by the financial condition of our retailers and distributors   some of our retailers and distributors have experienced financial difficulties in the past a retailer or distributor experiencing such difficulties will generally not purchase and sell as many of our products as it would under normal circumstances and may cancel orders in addition a retailer or distributor experiencing financial difficulties generally increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables we extend credit to our retailers and distributors based on our assessment of their financial condition generally without requiring collateral while such credit losses have historically been within our reserves we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case financial difficulties on the part of our retailers or distributors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition   our industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete   we are involved in a highly competitive industry where we may compete with numerous other companies who offer alternative methods or approaches who have far greater resources more experience and personnel perhaps more qualified than we do such resources may give our competitors an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or products that make our products obsolete there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against these other entities   we will be required to attract and retain top quality talent to compete in the marketplace   we believe our future growth and success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial product development sales and marketing and finance personnel there can be no assurance of success in attracting and retaining such personnel shortages in qualified personnel could limit our ability to increase sales of existing products and launch new product and service offerings   our future success depends on our ability to grow and expand our customer base our failure to achieve such growth or expansion could materially harm our business   to date our revenue growth has been derived primarily from the sale of our products our success and the planned growth and expansion of our business depend on us achieving greater and broader acceptance of our products and expanding our customer base there can be no assurance that customers will purchase our products or that we will continue to expand our customer base if we are unable to effectively market or expand our product offerings we will be unable to grow and expand our business or implement our business strategy this could materially impair our ability to increase sales and revenue and materially and adversely affect our margins   weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations    our overall performance will depend in part on worldwide economic conditions the united states and other key international economies have been impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit going concern threats to major multinational companies and medium and small businesses poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets and bankruptcies these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our proposed enterprise cloud computing application service delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect renewal rates all of which could adversely affect our operating results            if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed   due to our evolving business model the unpredictability of new markets that we intend to enter and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis   we may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights   the lighting industry are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others we may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights our technologies may not be able to withstand any thirdparty claims against their use the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain any intellectual property claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to change our technology change our business practices andor pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available in the future at the same terms or at all in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results or cash flows or both in a particular quarter   supporting a growing customer base could strain our personnel and corporate infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan   our current management and human resources infrastructure is comprised of our ceo our coo and several outsourced consultants our success will depend in part upon the ability of our management to manage our proposed business effectively to do so we will need to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage the expected domestic growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we will be unable to execute our business plan   we are dependent on our ceo and coo and the loss of one or more of these individuals could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner   our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer and chief operating officers we do not have employment agreements with our ceo and coo therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on our ceo or coo the loss of the services of our ceo and coo could seriously harm our business   failure to manage growth properly could seriously harm our business   we have experienced and may continue to experience significant growth in our business if we do not effectively manage our growth the quality of our business may suffer which could negatively affect our reputation and demand for our offerings our growth has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our managerial administrative operational and financial resources and our infrastructure our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage growth effectively among other things this will require us to implement additional management information systems further develop our operating administrative legal financial and accounting systems and controls hire additional personnel develop additional levels of management within our company locate additional office space maintain and improve coordination among our engineering product operations legal finance sales marketing and customer service and support organizations and manage our expanding international operations            moreover as our sales increase we may be required to concurrently deploy our business infrastructure at multiple additional locations andor provide increased levels of customization as a result we may lack the resources to deploy our products on a timely and costeffective basis failure to accomplish any of these requirements could impair our ability to deliver our products in a timely fashion fulfill existing customer commitments or attract and retain new customers   our ability to grow our business may depend on developing a positive brand reputation and member loyalty   establishing and maintaining a positive brand reputation and nurturing customer loyalty is critical to attracting new customers we expect to expend reasonable but limited resources to develop maintain and enhance our brand in the near future in addition nurturing customer loyalty will depend on our ability to provide highquality products which we may not do successfully if we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand reputation and customer loyalty our ability to attract new marketplace participants will be harmed   there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete against the numerous direct indirect and partial competitors many of which have valuable industry relationships and access to greater resources than we do   our retail and online distribution channels compete for customers and sales with many different companies and products that are competitive today and likely to be even more competitive in the future accordingly it is essential that we continue to develop improve and refine our products and the value propositions that are offered to customers   we also face competition from other companies that offer equipment moreover as the negative stigma associated with cannabis horticulture diminishes it is very possible that other better capitalized public and private companies many enter the market and may effectively challenge the value proposition offered by us these competitors may be able to attract customers more easily because of their financial resources our larger competitors can also devote substantially more resources to business development and may adopt more aggressive pricing policies there can be no assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing our business initiatives or that we will be able to maintain significant levels of revenues or recognize net income from the sale of our products and services   we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future   we anticipate that we will retain all future earnings and other cash resources for the future operation and development of our business and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future future payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account many factors including our operating results financial condition and capital requirements corporations that pay dividends may be viewed as a better investment than corporations that do not   we are dependent to some extent on our chief technology consultant for new and improved products   the company’s chief technology consultant is gas technologies incorporated “gast” should gast or any other participating technology providers be unable to execute their portion of the development effort new development of exclusive products of solis tek or any of its future plans could be delayed until a replacement is found   legal contingencies   from time to time we may be involved in routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business the ultimate amount of liability if any for any claims of any type either alone or in the aggregate may materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity in addition the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain any outcome whether favorable or unfavorable may materially and adversely affect us due to legal costs and expenses diversion of management attention and other factors we expense legal costs in the period incurred we cannot assure you that additional contingencies of a legal nature or contingencies having legal aspects will not be asserted against us in the future and these matters could relate to prior current or future transactions or events except as described below we are not currently a party to any material litigation            we may need to raise additional capital if we are unable to raise additional capital we may not be able to achieve our business plan   we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings as well as obtain credit from vendors to be able to fully execute our business plan any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute current shareholders’ ownership interest we may not be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain additional funds or credit from our vendors we will be unable to execute our business plan and you could lose your investment   we have limited protection of our intellectual property   there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our trade secrets in the event competitors independently develop or otherwise obtain access to our knowhow concepts or trade secrets we may be adversely affected   risks related to ownership of our common stock   there is not an active liquid trading market for the company’s common stock   the company common stock is quoted on the otcqb however there is no regular active trading market in the company’s common stock and we cannot give an assurance that an active trading market will develop if an active market for the company’s common stock develops there is a significant risk that the company’s stock price may fluctuate dramatically in the future in response to any of the following factors some of which are beyond our control such as     ● actual or anticipated variations in our operating results including whether we have achieved our key business targets andor earnings estimates and prospects         ● announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors         ● announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions business achievements strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments         ● additions or departures of key personnel         ● introduction of new services by us or our competitors         ● sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market particularly if overall trading volume is not high         ● general market conditions and broader political and economic conditions         ● actual or anticipated monetization’s of our patents and         ● other events or factors many of which are beyond our control            our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  million shares of “blank check” preferred stock the issuance of any preferred stock may adversely affect the holders of common stock   our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock with designations rights and preferences determined from time to time by its board of directors accordingly our board of directors is empowered without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with dividend liquidation conversion voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock in the event of issuance the preferred stock could be utilized under certain circumstances as a method of discouraging delaying or preventing a change in control of the company although we have no present intention to issue any shares of our authorized preferred stock there can be no assurance that the company will not do so in the future   future issuance of our common stock could dilute the interests of existing shareholders   we may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future the issuance of a substantial amount of common stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our shareholders in addition the sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in an acquisition which received such common stock as consideration or by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock   we have no plans to pay dividends   to date we have paid no cash dividends on our common shares for the foreseeable future earnings generated from our operations will be retained for use in our business and not to pay dividends   the application of the securities and exchange commission’s “penny stock” rules to our common stock could limit trading activity in the market and our shareholders may find it more difficult to sell their stock   it is expected our common stock will be trading at less than  per share and is therefore subject to the sec penny stock rules penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account the brokerdealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity if any in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in our securities which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of our securities these requirements may restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock   if we are unable to establish appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations result in the restatement of our financial statements harm our operating results subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our common stock   effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting which is defined as a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles   as a public company we have significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls we will be required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting the process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company            we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify areas requiring improvement in our internal control over financial reporting we cannot assure you that the measures we will take to remediate any areas in need of improvement will be successful or that we will implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future as we continue our growth if we are unable to establish appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations result in the restatement of our financial statements harm our operating results subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our common stock   lack of experience as officers of publiclytraded companies of our management team may hinder our ability to comply with sarbanesoxley act   it may be time consuming difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the sarbanesoxley act we may need to hire additional financial reporting internal controls and other finance staff or consultants in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures   we will incur increased costs as a public company which may affect our profitability   solis tek inc previously operated as a private company in california as a public company we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses we are subject to the sec’s rules and regulations relating to public disclosure sec disclosures generally involve a substantial expenditure of financial resources compliance with these rules and regulations will significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and some activities will become more timeconsuming and costly management may need to increase compensation for senior executive officers engage additional senior financial officers who are able to adopt financial reporting and control procedures allocate a budget for an investor and public relations program and increase our financial and accounting staff in order to meet the demands and financial reporting requirements as a public reporting company such additional personnel public relations reporting and compliance costs may negatively impact our financial results   public company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors   the sarbanesoxley act and rules implemented by the sec require changes in corporate governance practices of public companies as a public company these rules and regulations increase our compliance costs and make certain activities more time consuming and costly as a public company these rules and regulations make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers   because our directors and executive officers are among our largest shareholders they can exert significant control over our business and affairs and have actual or potential interests that may depart from those of shareholders   our directors and executive officers own or control a significant percentage of the common stock additionally the holdings of our directors and executive officers may increase in the future if they otherwise acquire additional shares of our common stock the interests of such persons may differ from the interests of our other shareholders as a result in addition to their board seats and offices such persons will have significant influence over and control all corporate actions requiring shareholder approval irrespective of how the company’s other shareholders including purchasers in the offering may vote including the following actions     ● to elect or defeat the election of our directors         ● to amend or prevent amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws              ● to effect or prevent a merger sale of assets or other corporate transaction and         ● to control the outcome of any other matter submitted to our shareholders for vote   such persons’ stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over our stock price   item  description of property   the company does

financial condition and results of operations   the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions see “note regarding forwardlooking statements” our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors discussed in “risk factors” and elsewhere in this report   the following discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based on the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles you should read this discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto   critical accounting policies and estimates   management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to impairment of longlived assets including finite lived intangible assets accrued liabilities fair value of warrant derivatives and certain expenses we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  to our financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements   allowance for doubtful accounts   the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the company’s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts the company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience the age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates trade receivables are written off at the point when they are considered uncollectible            inventories   the company provides inventory reserves based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts the write down amount is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis   inventories under warranty claims   in the ordinary course of business the company receives product returns from its customers the product returns are almost entirely ballasts since its inception the company has purchased its ballasts from two chinese manufacturers and one of them a related entity see note  offers a three year warranty on its products through december   that manufacturer was not able to repair the company’s ballasts as the company could not return the products to the manufacturer’s facility due to chinese customs reasons as such in late  the related party vendor issued the company a credit memo for the entire amount of their returned product totaling  the company is planning to send the products to a free trade zone in hong kong or to another location in china to repair or replace the defective products as the manufacturer has issued the company a credit for all of the defective product the company has not recorded a reserve on any of those products but the company has recorded a reserve on the other manufacturer’s products   results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december     revenue and cost of goods sold   revenue for the years ended december   and  was  and  respectively the increase of  was primarily due to more market penetration within our hydroponic customers and commercial facilities during  as compared to    cost of sales for the years ended december   and  was  and  respectively gross profit for the years ended december   and  was  and  respectively the gross profit increase of  was primarily due to the increase in revenue but the company’s gross profit margin also increased from  during  to  during  the increase in profit margin related to the sales of higher margin products during the  period primarily lamp products   research and development expenses   research and development “rd” expenses for the years ended december   and  was  and  respectively the increase in rd expenses of  was due primarily to the addition of an employee dedicated to rd activities beginning in the first quarter of    selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the years ended december   and  was  and  respectively the increase in sga expenses of  partially related to the opening of our two new subsidiaries in late  primarily our east coast subsidiary and its related facility sga expenses for our two new subsidiaries in  were  and are included in the variances to follow the increase in sga expenses was due primarily to the increase in labor costs of  trade show and promotional costs of  rent and facility costs of  and bad debt expense of  plus other sga expenses            other income and expenses   other expenses net for the years ended december   and  was  and  respectively the increase in other expenses net in  of  related to merger costs incurred in  of  and the increase in interest expense of  offset by an impairment of a loan receivable in  in the amount of  the increase in interest expense in  related to the amortization of loan fees recorded as interest expense in  of    net loss   our net loss for the years ended december   and  was  and  respectively the decrease in net loss of  was due to the increase in gross profit of  and the increase in the benefit for income taxes of  offset by the increase in rd expenses of  the increase in sga expenses of  and the increase in other expenses net of    liquidity and capital resources   cash and liquidity   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the company will continue as a going concern such assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the year ended december   the company recorded a net loss of  and utilized cash in operations of  during  the company experienced losses in connection with professional and other fees incurred in connection with its reverse merger in addition the company increased its inventory levels to acquire new products and to meet anticipated sales demand these factors combined to significantly utilize existing cash on hand and maximize utilization of our credit facilities   we estimate the company currently has sufficient cash and liquidity to meet its anticipated working capital for the next twelve months the company’s secured working capital facility will expire in may  which will need to be replaced with another similar facility the company believes it can successfully obtain a new loan to replace its existing bank loan but there is no assurance that such facility will be available to us if the company cannot obtain such financing the company’s two officersshareholders have made available to the company a  line of credit which we will be able to draw upon if needed   historically we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of common stock a line of credit and loans from a third party financial institution and related parties we anticipate that our primary capital source will be positive cash flow from operations if our sales goals do not materialize as planned we believe that the company can reduce its operating costs and achieve positive cash flow from operations however we may not generate sufficient revenues from product sales in the future to achieve profitable operations if we are not able to achieve profitable operations at some point in the future we may have insufficient working capital to maintain our operations as we presently intend to conduct them or to fund our expansion marketing and product development plans there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms or at all   the company has a revolving line of credit with a bank in which it can borrow up to  the line of credit expired april   but has been extended until may   borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at  the outstanding balance on the line of credit was  at december   and  the line of credit is secured by substantially all assets of the company and a personal guarantee from one of the company’s officersshareholders including his personal residence   in september  the company entered into a business loan and security agreement under which the company can borrow up to  the loan matures in september  and is secured by credit card collections and certain company assets the agreement requires the company to repay the loan from the credit card deposits it receives from its customers the repayment rate is  of each deposit the loan does not accrue interest but includes a nonrefundable fee of  which can be reduced if paid early in september  the company borrowed  under the agreement at december    was owed on the loan            comparison of years ended

used in operating activities   during the year ended december   the company used cash flows in operating activities of  compared to  used in the year ended december   the reasons for the decrease in cash used in operating activities in the amount of  was due mainly to the increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and due to related parties of  plus the reduction in inventories under

directors as of the close of business on september   as a result of the stock split every one issued and outstanding share of the company’s common stock was changed and converted into six shares of common stock all share related information presented in these financial statements and accompanying footnotes has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reduced number of shares resulting from this action   loss per share calculations   basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of common shares available diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive weighted average number of shares outstanding has been retroactively restated for the equivalent number of shares received by the accounting acquirer as a result of the reverse merger as if these shares had been outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest period presented   the company’s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the years ended december   and  as the inclusion of any potential shares would have had an antidilutive effect due to the company generating a

recognition   the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of the company’s products to its customers provided that evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss have passed to the customer fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title to the company’s products primarily is transferred to the customer once the product is shipped from the company’s warehouses in certain cases the products are shipped directly from the company’s vendors directly to the company’s customer in which case title is transferred once the product is received by the customer products are not shipped until there is a written agreement with the customer with a specified payment arrangement any discounts that are offered are done as a reduction of the invoiced amount at the time of billing   payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as customer deposits customer deposits were  at december   there were no customer deposits at december     the company does not offer a general right of return on any of its sales and considers all sales as final the company generally provides a

advertising costs were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively   use of estimates   the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates are used in valuing our allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory valuations among others actual results could differ from these estimates   accounts receivable   the company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors in circumstances where the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the company believes will ultimately be collected in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts bad debt charges are recorded based on the company’s historical losses and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding   the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns is established through a provision reducing the carrying value of receivables at december   and december   the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns was  and  respectively     f        solis tek inc and subsidiaries

about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis the company recorded a write down of inventories of  and  during the

concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december              we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting primarily attributable to i lack of segregation of incompatible duties and ii insufficient board of directors representation these weaknesses are due to our inadequate staffing during the period covered by this

organizational history solis tek inc the “company” was originally incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on march   as cinjet inc “cinjet” effective september   cinjet changed its corporate name to solis tek inc on june   the company entered into an agreement of merger and plan of reorganization the “agreement” with solis tek inc a california corporation “sti” and cja acquisition corp a california corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company “merger sub” providing for the merger of merger sub with and into sti the “merger” with sti surviving the merger as a whollyowned subsidiary of the company the merger agreement was approved by the company’s board of directors and the sole director of the company effective june   the merger closed on june   at the effective time of the merger each share of sti common stock issued and outstanding was converted automatically into the right to receive  shares of the common stock of the company with an aggregate of  shares of the company’s common stock issued to the former shareholders of sti upon the closing of the merger sti paid a total of  to four shareholders of the company for the cancellation of a total of  shares of the company’s common stock also at the closing of the merger sti paid  to the company to settle and pay liabilities of  which represented all of the then current liabilities of the company after the closing a total of  shares of the company were outstanding upon completion of the merger the former stockholders of sti owned approximately  of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock and the holders of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock prior to the merger owned the balance as the former owners and management of sti have voting and operating control of the company after the merger the transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization with the sti deemed the acquiring companies for accounting purposes and the company deemed the legal acquirer due to the change in control the consolidated financial statements reflect the historical results of sti prior to the merger and that of the combined company following the merger common stock and the corresponding capital amounts of the company premerger have been retroactively restated as capital stock shares reflecting the exchange ratio in the merger no stepup in basis or intangible assets or goodwill will be recorded in this transaction and the cash paid by the company of  including  of transaction costs has been reflected as a cost of the transaction overview of business the company is focused on the research design development and manufacturing of advanced energy efficient indoor horticulture lighting and ancillary equipment our vision is to apply the latest advances in high efficiency lighting and controls technology as well as effective manufacturing techniques to deliver highly differentiated products with clear benefits at competitive prices to the greenhouse and indoor horticulture markets the company through its wholly owned subsidiary is in the operations of designing developing and sourcing a line of solis tek digital ballasts intended for use in high intensity lighting systems used for horticulture an electrical ballast is a device intended to limit the amount of current in an electric circuit a familiar and widely used example is the inductive ballast used in fluorescent lamps to limit the current through the tube which would otherwise rise to destructive levels due to the tube’s negative resistance characteristic since the commencement of operations our product line has evolved from digital ballasts to a line of lighting products including a line of specialty ballasts ranging from  watts to  watts with various features a line of specialty metal halide digital lamps a line of reflectors high intensity lighting accessories critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission “sec” defines “critical accounting policies” as those that require application of management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods not all of the accounting policies require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates however the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the company’s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts the company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience the age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates trade receivables are written off at the point when they are considered uncollectible inventories the company provides inventory reserves based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts the write down amount is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis recent accounting

percentage of revenue gross profit for the three months ended march   was  compared to  for the three months ended march   the increase in gross profit percentage was due to higher revenue and product mix selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the three months ended march   and  was  and  respectively an increase of  or  the increase in sga expenses was due to increase in payroll marketing travel trade shows outbound freight and sales commission to support the increase in revenues and stock compensation costs and increase in bad debt

the three months ended march   and  was  and  respectively an increase of  or  the increase in rd expenses was primarily due to fair value of common stock  issued to an employee the rd expense was incurred for the improvement in existing products and development of new products net income loss net loss for the three months ended march   was  compared to net income of  for the three months ended march   the net loss for the three months ended march   was due to significant noncash costs of  that resulted in the increase in sga and rd and was offset in part with increase in gross profit compared to the three months ended march   liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures cash flows used in operating activities during the three months ended march   the company used  in operating activities compared to cash provided by operating activities of  during the three months ended march   during the three months ended march   cash was primarily used in increase in accounts receivable to support higher revenue advance to suppliers for the purchase of inventory reduction in related party vendor and was offset in part with reduction in inventory and increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses cash flows used in investing activities during the three months ended march   the company used  in the property and equipment for purchase of certain molds cash flows provided by financing activities during the three months ended march   the company generated  from financing activities compared to cash used in financing activities of  for the three months ended march   for the three months ended march   the company raised a  through an issuance of common stock and proceeds from notes payable to related parties of  and part of the proceeds were used to pay notes payablerelated party of  and payments on loans payable and capital lease obligation we estimate the company currently has sufficient cash and liquidity to meet its anticipated working capital for the next twelve months historically we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of common stock a line of credit and loans from a third party financial institution related parties and operations we anticipate that our primary capital source will be positive cash flow from operations if our sales goals do not materialize as planned we believe that the company can reduce its operating costs and achieve positive cash flow from operations however we may not generate sufficient revenues from product sales in the future to achieve profitable operations if we are not able to achieve profitable operations at some point in the future we may have insufficient working capital to maintain our operations as we presently intend to conduct them or to fund our expansion marketing and product development plans there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms or at all on march   the board of directors of the company authorized a private placement offering per reg d of up to  in shares of common stock to accredited investors for the three months ended march   the company has raised a total of  through an issuance of  shares under this offering nongaap measure – adjusted ebitda in addition to our gaap results we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance however adjusted ebitda is not a recognized measurement under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation nongaap adjustments to our results prepared in accordance with gaap are itemized below you are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating adjusted ebitda you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss for the three months ended march   and  three months ended march   march   net income loss      add interest expense   provision for income taxes   depriciation and amortization   stockbased compensation   adjusted ebitda      we present adjusted ebitda because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool which includes among others the following  adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debts and  although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements offbalance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues and results of operations liquidity or capital expenditures leave a reply cancel reply your email address will

lives of the assets the company has determined the estimated useful lives of its property and equipment as follows   machinery and equipment  years computer equipment  years furniture and fixtures

amount that will more likely than not be realized the company recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of september   and december     the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than  percent likely of being realized upon settlement the company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the company anticipates payment or receipt of cash within one year interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes               solis tek

determines the fair value of its assets and liabilities based on the exchange price in us dollars that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the company uses a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable to measure fair value     ● level  — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities     ● level  — inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities     ●  level  — unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities   the carrying amounts of financial instruments such as cash accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate the related fair values due to the
