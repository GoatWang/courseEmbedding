strategies  value strategy value strategy discovering opportunities seeking underpriced upandcomers the  capital management value strategy starts with systematic bottomup research facetoface meetings we meet with many companies each week gathering information about companies’ prospects for future growth competitive positioning of their products new product initiatives cash flow generation to selffund growth and changes in their cost structure these meetings give us realtime data points we can use to develop themes that will provide companies a tailwind for growth screening each week we run a screen of the small cap universe for example  million to  billion market capitalization we look for dividend paying companies with a strong balance sheet emphasizing tangible book value we focus on their cash flow generation dividend payout policy and ability to selffund future growth the screens include debt levels insider ownership and financial ratios incorporating balance sheet oriented enterprise value we are seeking companies that are trading below their intrinsic value looking at both absolute and relative valuation finally looking beyond the headline theme we look for derivative themes that will benefit from the same economic tailwind with better valuation the small cap value team is led by rodney hathaway rodney has been following small cap stocks for over  years as an analyst and portfolio manager  small cap value strategy brochure  pdf     view the small cap value fact sheet  pdf thematic investing from a value strategy perspective through individual company research and screening we develop “realtime” themes which we believe will provide a catalyst for future revenue and earnings growth as we look horizontally at competitors and vertically at the supply chain we identify others positioned to capitalize on a given theme our thematic approach enables us to… focus our research efforts quickly identify companies meeting our valuation criteria and also have a catalyst for future growth and the realization of full value more nimbly enter and exit positions due to the diversification it provides generally we will buy a number of companies across a specific theme so as to diversify single company risk over time we envision that the stocks related to a theme will outperform their industry peers due to superior valuation and that the theme will outperform the broader market we are index aware but do not use an index to determine our sector weightings weightings are arrived at as a result of the individual stock selection that takes place due to our bottomup research process security selection our process informs our selections the goal is to select stocks that are trading below their intrinsic value on a relative and absolute basis we focus on companies with strong cash flow paying a dividend balance sheet strength supporting earnings growth shareholderfriendly management distinct competitive advantage in pricing or products a  margin of safety a present catalyst to realize full valuation eg change in management product introduction technology paradigm shift ma only the companies that we believe have the best management business model and valuation are chosen to go into the portfolio since we are taking advantage of owning a number of companies within a theme individual stock position size generally does not exceed  of a diversified portfolio we take a private market valuation approach to the public companies in which we wish to invest the valuation process can be described by looking at the key aspects of each of the three important financial statements income balance sheet cash flow income statement normalized earnings – we consider a company’s peaktrough profitability throughout an entire market cycle and measure the current level’s distance from that level a low enterprise value to sales ratio indicating downside protection when earnings are less predictable enterprise value to ebitda indicating the true value of a company balance sheet price to tangible book value – discount intangible assets such as goodwill high cash balances and low debt statement of cash flow self funding growth improving asset utilization to maximize earnings data from these three statements is used to “triangulate” a target price this price then must be at least  below where we believe fair value for the stock is
