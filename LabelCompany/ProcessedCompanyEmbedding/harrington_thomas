chassis and prior to world war i began to specialise in commercial vehicles buses and coaches after the armistice the company concentrated on luxury coaches supplementing these with some singledeck bus bodies and other general coachbuilding activity during world war ii they were selected by the war ministry to build a specialised aircraft design and during their history they also produced ¼  scale streetlegal model coaches to entertain children pioneered a minibus that bus operators found practical and legal to use and droveforward coach design they had an open outlook on developments in technology and an excellent grasp of marketing opportunities and an eye for a catchy press advertisement they nurtured relationships with customers one at least bought nothing other than harrington for its entire existence in  it was decided to close the factory although not a part of the rootes group the operations were owned by a rootes family investment company production ceased in april  after which plaxton purchased spares stock in trade and goodwill the cavalier – and grenadier  luxury coach bodies for underfloorengined chassis jointly won the classic bus reader poll as the most stylish coach of all time many harrington vehicles are preserved and harrington devotees have a gathering of their own the sedit there were huge numbers of small to mediumsized professional coachbuilders in existence around britain as thomas harrington  sons ltd moved into its new hove factory the management of harringtons decided that two things were necessary to stand them in good stead in this crowded market the first was building good relationships with bluechip customers and the second was to produce designs with a distinctive harrington look instances of the first were their longterm supply to high–class coach firms in the private and large company sectors such private customers included greygreen of stamford hill london charlies cars of bournemouth and silver star of porton down the large firms included the tilling groups north western road car company of stockport and betgroup member devon general of exeter but perhaps the most enduring relationship of all was as supplier to the local bet coaching powerhouse southdown motor services the styling distinctiveness was a major selling point a harrington body had a clear look at a time when many coachbuilders duple especially would oblige customers and produce an astounding variety of outlines from the conservative to the totally bizarre sometimes building to order straight copies of another coachbuilders style by the mids the harrington look included a half cab with no canopy over the engine and a stepped window line all arranged in a distinctive flowing series of curves by the end of the decade when streamlining was the vogue harrington had devised and patented a new feature called the dorsal fin this appurtenance looked like a truncated aircraft tail and when applied to the rear of the vehicle allowed a rakishly curved reardome outline without compromising passenger access to the rear bench seat and was designed to act as an airextractor as the vehicle moved stale air exited the coach saloon due to the suction effect of the low pressure areas created behind the fin world war ii new products new materials new methodsedit but at this time europe was returning to war and coach operations ceased many operators having their vehicles impressed into military service by the middle of  all nonessential production had been frozen on government orders and the entire vehiclebuilding industry had to turn to war work harrington were allocated the westland lysander aircraft to build this was a short take off and landing stol singleengine type designed as an artillery spotter which became noteworthy for its use in covert operations to and from occupied france as well as the benefits of this to the war effort it gave harringtons workforce new skills in jigbuilding using lightweight alloy sections and extrusions postwaredit after the war demand for new buses and coaches was somewhat pentup as few had been delivered during the war however the country had a massive war debt to pay and all manufacturing industries were exhorted to devote at least  of output to export harrington was able to build a satisfactory export trade particularly to south american operators and to those in british african colonies for the home market most bodies were framed in steelreinforced hardwood because all the established firms were trying to export and thus were not able to offer even their most loyal customers acceptable leadtimes the period from  to the early s caused a mushrooming of small coachbuilders there were many new models and styles of coach in harringtons case these included from  the normal control leyland comet cpo with its small capacity  cu in directinjection diesel and the commer avenger fullfronted forward control lightweight coach with its big humber petrol engine tilted over to  degrees so it hid under the coach floor commer was part of the rootes group later the rootes family bought harrington and john c beadle for customers wanting a return to prewar glamour the dorsal fin was available as an option even on the next generation the wayfareredit this was designed for the new underfloorengined chassis from aec leyland and others but was also to be found on three of the foden rear engined coach chassis the wayfarer ran to four marks and was produced from  to  the longest life of any harrington design it was the first to the new dimensions of  ft long by  ft wide and the first harrington coach to feature a marque name greygreen bought every version of the type and also took harringtonbodied bedfords throughout the s silver star took marks   and  on leyland southdown only took the mark one on royal tiger in  and then deserted harrington until  charlies cars took harringtonbodied albion victors and in  had two wayfarer mark  on albion aberdonian north western had been transferred from tilling to bet during world war ii and took wayfarers of marks   and  for its touring coaches but went elsewhere for express types notably toward the end of the decade to alexander mini coaches and minibusesedit from the early s until the mids harrington employee and former southdown driver ernie johnstone constructed  quarterscale roadlegal coaches to give novelty rides to young children many of these were powered by villiers cc twostroke petrol engines bodies on  of these working models were constructed by harrington the rest he did himself with two friends in his spare time during the s harrington like plaxton and readings offered small party coaches on karrier and commer delivery van chassis whilst from the late s until the factorys closure harrington was responsible for producing the rootes groups inhouse psv conversion of the commer  minbus after harringtons demise the minibus work went to the former tillingstevens works in maidstone customers of the minibus included crosville the first time the state sector had been served by harrington since  when united automobile services took a batch of bristol coaches bodied in hove for their prestigious newcastlelondon service the stateowned bus firms lack of interest in outside suppliers had one overriding reason in  ecw and bristol were served with a statutory ban on selling bodies to other than wholly governmentowned organisations and thus ecw took care of almost all of the tilling groups bus  coach body needs produced london transports first genuine coaches and supplied some bodies to the sheffield transport c fleet and the scottish bus group the contender in a contracting marketedit from  to  former tillingstevens factory built the commer ts a compact if noisy twostroke opposedpiston diesel engine adopted in commer commercials and later marks of their avenger bus chassis harrington like beadle employed units from the avenger together with a midmounted ts engine in its contender range of integral buses and coaches of the mids some of these resembled the wayfarer and others had the standard bus outline of the time but there was a special design built for boac this had a straight waistrail and a multipaned lanterntype windscreen one at least of these were powered by an eightcylinder rollsroyce petrol engine of military pattern driving torqueconverter transmission an odd choice of propulsion in the fueleconomy obsessed s but they were probably a lot lighter on petrol than a boeing stratocruiser or a lockheed super constellation this style of contender was sold in   scale model by dinky toys as their boac coach  boac took  of which nineteen were used overseas making them the largest customer for the contender maidstone and district were second with  buses and one coach although during its short life the contender was less successful than beadles integral coaches beadles comparable chatham range were by  almost their only line and when the bet group decided to reduce the number of its recommended suppliers only southdowns liking for their coach body on the leyland tiger cub kept the dartford body lines going but then southdown switched to weymann and briefly burlingham having taken harrington wayfarer mark ones in small numbers and then deserted harrington for most of the s and that was the end of beadle in the coachwork game rootes decided that the cardealership chain beadle also ran was a better business during the life of the wayfarer all of the mushroom coachbuilding businesses disappeared the clear number one in coach bodies by  was duple at hendon who by  also had a bus factory in the east midlands at kegworth and in  purchased the bus builder willowbrook in nearby loughborough duple was strong in the lightweight end of the market being first choice for bodies on the marketleading bedford but was facing competition in the premium underfloor engined class from plaxton and burlingham of blackpool like harringtons these were primarily builders of coach bodies who also did buses burlingham built double as well as single deck vehicles and had a respected if small list of customers for these weymann roe and alexander were on the other hand bus builders who also did coaches continental inspiration more new materialsedit during the run of the wayfarer and the contender harringtons coachbuilders developed expertise in handling increasingly large and complex glassreinforced plastic grp mouldings the management were keeping abreast of european trends in design and had formed an especial friendship with their opposite numbers at the italian firm of orlandi these changes set the seed for future progress this combination of alloy frame mainly aluminium panelling and grp for coachwork features requiring complex compound curvature enabled stronger lighter and more durable coach bodies besides harrington alexander ecw yeates of loughborough and in  park royal were going down this route the development of durable laminates for interior panel finish such as wareite and formica was another feature that harrington started to pioneer a belated change to the uk government construction and use rules in  allowed fixed rather than opening drivers windscreens on public service vehicle psv bodies this together with advances in toughened glass manufacture at last made it possible to have a coach windscreen with a threedimensional curvature early examples of this by duple plaxton and particularly burlingham on the bedford commer and ford thames lightweight coaches from  were apt to be over the top echoing similar goldfishbowl windscreens on large saloon cars by the usowned carmakers such as the vauxhall cresta pa harrington did not slavishly adopt it considered the next design from old shoreham road retained flatglazed optionallyopening windscreens the crusader classic times aheadedit until  harrington designs for lightweight coaches such as the bedford sb and the commer avenger had been unnamed but in  the crusader was launched it used large glassfibre mouldings for the front and rear panels it was slightly ungainly in its original form but the mark  was a fine looking vehicle updated as mark  with larger cavaliersized side and rear windows the final mark  was perhaps a retrograde step but no worse than equivalent plaxton or duple offerings of the time it was built on the above two chassis and the ford thames e customers included northern general transport garelochhead coach service and southdown who took a batch of  commers in  the crusader was the only classicera harrington coach body to be purchased new by the stateowned operators transport holding company subsidiary thames valley taking a small batch of mark  on bedford sb for its south midland coaching operation in  although that same year wilts  dorset took over silver star adding wayfarers and cavaliers to its coach fleet barton transports  grenadierbodied reliances are justly famous but they also took  crusader  on bedford sb  bvoc harrington alpine the carsedit when rootes group entered the twoseat sports car market in  with the sunbeam alpine some customers complained to the dealers that unlike some rival makes such as mg and jaguar there was not a hardtop coupé version harrington were a rootes dealer and had more expertise than remaining full rootes subsidiaries in the use of grp moulding techniques and thus produced these for sale through selected rootes dealerships they were known as harrington alpines they also did a similar conversion to the triumph tr for wimbledonbased dove garages this was called the dové gtr the success of the alpine programme including an encouraging performance at le mans led commer to entrust harrington with the psv conversion of the  van which included a complete one piece fibreglass roof panel of clerestory outline the cavalier compared to its competitorsedit launched at the end of  the cavalier was ahead of the opposition in many if not all respects certainly its outside appearance was of classic beauty combining curves sharp angles and peaks in harmony which combined with understated use of bright trim in a way that made it stand out from the opposition by combining style with good taste the double curvature windscreen was not only wholly in line with the style of the body but it helped nighttime coach drivers by dispelling interior reflections the plaxton panorama launched in production guise in  had a basically rather boxlike shape and a very flashy grille but it did pioneer smiths instruments jetvent forced ventilation system allowing fixed windows and a cleaner side outline the duple britannia  on its third facelift for the  season had an excessively droopy outline and tiny windows and was very little different from duples gaudy super vegayeomancorinthian for cheap coach chassis duple probably didnt care the brittania was not where the jam lay the duple midland donington was really just a bus tricked out with more chrome the willowbrook viscount new for  had puzzling trim lines stopping and starting in the middle of nowhere and an overlybulky outline whilst the optional reverserake rear glass was a feature that was already dated at the time of its launch and today simply looks odd alexander sold coaches south of the border to north western and barton transport and had a pair of fairly conservative though aluminiumalloy framed designs the curvedwaist style which barton had taken since  was discontinued in  after its other major customer western smt had stopped ordering it north western took the straightwaisted variant for most of its coach applications even taking its first batch of  ft see later leopards to this outline weymann built its fanfare design for sale through mcw from  to  without alteration at the end of its run it was a dated looking body roe had during the s a coach renaissance selling versions of its dalesman style to independents and company fleets almost exclusively on the aec reliance in  the dalesman iv had trapezoidal glazing and a straight waistrail the biggest customer for this style being black  white motorways of cheltenham the masterly execution of the cavalier stood out most against burlinghams seagull  its closest contemporary and a body very similar in construction and basic outline comparing the two the seagull s detailing was crude and overemphasised whereas that of the cavallier was sharply delineated making the whole coach look lean and sculpted by comparison with the burlingham style some would say that they summed up the difference between blackpool and hove during that season duple purchased burlingham and renamed it duple northern the yeates europa from  on first facelift for  combined a similarly dumpy volume to the willowbrook made in the same town with deliberately tasteless detailing and riotous paint schemes in a way that operators and passengers either loved or loathed but it was easily the brashest option  salesedit the cavalier was initially offered at  ft long by  ft wide to fit any suitable underfloor engined chassis as was normal with harrington the previous wayfarer mark  coach remained available if requested for the next couple of years but it was clear the advantage was with the cavalier by the time lloyds of nuneatons ue was shown at the  commercial motor show at earls court  cavaliers had been sold to seven bet fleets ten independents and local charity st dunstans home for the blind these were mainly on aec reliance but charlies cars of bournemouth took six albion aberdonian east yorkshire took five on leyland tiger cub and ellen smith of rochdale took the sole leyland leopard the cavalier was a clear success already with a number of influential customers well out of harringtons heartland sales were both more geographically widespread and in many cases to customers who had not taken harrington bodies before the output from hendon on equivalent chassis that season was   salesedit between january and november   cavaliers were sold there were repeat orders for the cavalier from eight operators including st dunstans of the six bet operators three were new customers for the style both of the largest taking leopards for their most prestigious touring duties southdowns first order was for forty bodies and ribble motor services who had favoured local builder burlingham for the past decade took  the largest repeat order was from northern general who again took ten touring coaches this time on leopard and independents adding further cavaliers were abbott of blackpool ellen smith of rochdale flight of birmingham and harris of greys the most important new independent customer was yelloway a conquest from the duple group taking six reliances in terms of chassis on which to build harringtons fortune had definitely swung in the direction of farington with  leopards and a tiger cub being bodied in contrast with only  reliances the albion aberdonian had been discontinued the previous year so it would from now on be a straight fight between lancashire and middlesex duples  season total for the brittania on its final facelift was  all but five on reliance the donington had got bigger windows and brittanialike trim but between them the expanded duple group were building not only the brittania and the donington but also the viscount and the seagull  the differences were not just skindeep either all the duple bodies had steelreinforced hardwood frames also plaxtons structural method the loughboroughbuilt donington and viscount both used framesections made from rolled steel tubes whilst burlinghams bodies like those of harrington and yeates were of jigbuilt aluminium plaxton had refined the panorama with subtler detailing and inward sloping pillars above the waistrail for the  season like harrington they also offered a more conservative option in their case an embassy body with twice as many side windows a more conservative option definitely wasnt yeates style instead they introduced a more radical one if the europa was insufficiently inyourface they could offer you the fiesta now with trapezoid glazing yeates was always going to be a minority choice and as yeates sold everyone elses coachwork their core business being dealership perhaps they wanted it that way  proved though that on the premium chassis harrington was now second only to plaxton although duple vastly outstripped either and the burlingham operation they now owned in the market for lightweight daytrip coaches during  the legal maximum width and length limits for buses and coaches was relaxed new maxima were  ft by  ft ½in to take effect from january   leyland and aec had suitable models on the stocks by the end of the year whilst continuing production of the shorterwheelbase models these could legally carry a slightly longer body than  ft and the first season cavalier delivered in december  a repeat order for keith coaches of aylesbury on reliance was the first cavalier  so called because it was  ft in longer than the previous model which enabled harrington to fit  of its own seats into the coach rather than the previous maximum of  duple and plaxton had offered a seat plan within the older length limits but their seats were a bit skimpier on padding and even so came close to infringing legal minimum length requirements during  the original cavalier was still offered as was the cavalier  to the new maximum length the  carried most of its extra length in a longer first side window whilst the  ft version had this plus an extra shallower window just aft of the first bay which unlike the rest of the side glazing had a horizontal lower edge the waistrail now resuming its dip at the third bay this saved on the cost of extra tooling and made the cavalier a truly modular range of coach bodies although it certainly did not look that way the longer first bay window to the same depth as the windscreen and with a forward sloping pillar made the front of the  coach look better balanced although the longer version was not as happy as the extended panorama tending to look slightly droopy it neither looked as fussy as blackpools continental or addlestones castillian nor was it quite as distracting as the europa or fiesta at the new length harringtons cleverness in construction was necessary for as well as three variants of the cavalier old shoreham road had to find space for car and minibus conversion work production of mark  crusader and bus bodies on aec reliance and albion nimbus chassis it was perhaps good news that maidstone and district had finally been weaned off the wayfarer mark  and that model could be buried after a good innings still the end of the wayfarer mark  meant that the less timid customers would be wanting something more up to date than even the revised cavalier also plans came from luton for a bedford chassis for the new maximum length market sector this was going to be radical in concept and not suitable to the cavalier outline nor that of any cavalier mark  still less would it suit an extended crusader so not only was the factory floor busy so were the designers in the drawing office  salesedit in its final year the  foot cavalier sold  all on reliance maidstone  district took ten south wales two and trent motor traction another bet firm took  one of which was a replacement body on an accidentsalvaged chassis built in   of the  ft in version were sold all to existing customers in the bet group southdown took  more leopards greenslades had three reliances and thomas brothers of port talbot added a further reliance of the independents gliderways took another tiger cub keith of aylesbury harris of greys and summerbees of southampton took more reliances a further reliance was sold to stanley hughes the bradford dealer who leased it for the  season to wallace arnold coaches of leeds as well as these  short cavaliers a further  of the  foot model were sold harrington also soldoff rnj the original cavalier demonstrator replacing it with a foot reliance  registered vpm which in turn was sold in  to hall bros of south shields there were two different sorts of long aec reliance the  type mu used the litre engine of the shorter version at a peak rating of  bhp whilst the  type u used a litre  bhp engine as in the export aec regal vi chassis southdown chose two  seater leopards to the new length whilst greenslades added to its collection of cavaliers with three reliance s and a new bet customer was neath and cardiff coaches with two long reliance s seating the maximum  the independent buyers of the cavalier  in its first season placing repeat orders for the style were abbot ellen smith yelloway and hawkey of newquay and new cavalier customers included greygreen hudson of horncastle ayres of dover liss  district in hampshire and straws of leicester formerly a plaxton loyalist grey green had its first foot cavalier on express service a month after the length was legal the benefits of longer coaches were clearer for express services than for tours especically tours to more remote scenic areas yelloways  footers had an option peculiar to the operator of additional destination displays over the second and fourth nearside windows for express work there was also an optional destination box in the roof dome as well as yelloway grey green were among the operators who specified this fifty seven cavaliers sold new was exactly half the  performance but the coach market was in a downturn in comparison duple sold only nineteen britannias on short reliances and four on short leopard two of the aecs and one leopard had oldfashioned central entrances blackpool built no further seagull s but built  of its  ft duple northern continental on reliances  on leopard including six for ribble and one royal tiger worldmaster a cancelled export order for happiways of manchester  salesedit in the  season the cavalier faced internal competition from the grenadier see below but  of the  ft in version and  of the  ft were sold existing customers who placed repeat orders for the short cavalier were southdown  leopard l greenslades another reliance grey greens orders included a short reliance and ten leopard l and harris of greys summerbee of southampton and mcintyre of aberdeen all took further reliances harris being a rebody of a  chassis damaged in an accident new customers for the  ft in cavalier were munden of bristol leopard l and crump of pinner reliance a new option was fixed side glazing and forced ventilation southdown having this on its leopards all but one of the bet customers for the long cavalier had taken the style before neath and cardiff had two reliance  and east yorkshire four leopard psu ribble had  on leopard psu with the new forced ventialation option the other three were for a newly acquired ribble subsidiary scout motor services of preston to the same specification as the ribble examples grey green had one leopard psu and one reliance  the latter with forced ventilation the other repeat orders from independents were from yelloway who took  reliance  with the jetvent system as well as the additional side destination screens and ellen smith also of rochdale with a leopard fitted with  reclining seats yelloway standardising on this luxurious option on its reliances the short ones seating only  as a result new purchasers of the cavalier  in its second season were anglocontinental of tunbridge wells  reliance  valliant of ealing  reliance  and regent of redditch

there was an optional solid coach door and brighwork grille marshall and weymann also built bet style express coaches in contrast plaxton had a further revised panorama with barely perceptible waist curvature and only three main side window bays on the  ft body the dome was refined and thinner trim strips were used producing a body of unusual restraint for a plaxton it was an instant sales success ribble for one placing large orders another competitive body was alexander y type first shown in  which in coach form had four trapezoid windows on each straightwaisted side and double

cavalier  sales comprised  leopard psu  reliance  u and  reliance  mu plus the demonstrator which was sold after a year to hall bros of south shields who became a loyal grenadier customer the grenadier an apotheosisedit to supplement the cavalier for the  season the grenadier was introduced initially available on the longer chassis it was outwardly similar but a tauterlooking body the structure was similar but the glazing was revised employing one fewer window per side and dipping less toward the rear a larger windscreen was fitted with a more prominent peak only the rear glass was carried over from the cavalier revised front and rear grp mouldings were employed that at the front accenting the horizontal and carrying a larger destination box that at the rear having horizontal rather than vertical light clusters the forcedventilation set up was standard intakes for it being fitted in the front peak rather than in plaxtonstyle airscoops on the roof these changes adding further to the cleanliness of line the bright trim was of a similar layout to that of the cavalier the skirt mouldings being carried over virtually unchanged although roof quarter glazing was a common option on cavaliers the less rounded roofline of the grenadier ensured grenadiers with this option were rare  salesedit the first two grenadiers were a reliance  for harris of greys and a leopard psu for grey green both of which were shown at the  earls court commercial motor show in the initial season a further  ft reliance  went to abbott of blackpool two leopards to gliderways of smethwick five

timpson of catford southdown specified the dash panels of the cavalier on their batch the return of north western was maybe a surprise as they were a major supporter of the m alexander y type but they obviously wanted something shorter and a bit classier for their extended tours their two leopard l had illuminated offside and nearside name badges under the second bay the two new bet customers were

of  the bedford val was a twinsteering chassis with a long front overhang designed for an entrance ahead of the steering axles a unique feature of the type was that the wheels were only inch in diameter which in turn reduced the floor height of bodied examples the radiator was mounted at the front and immediately behind it was the  bhp leyland o engine the harrington legionnaire was a squarerigged body with straight waistrail and five deep windows per side one less than the duple vega major and one more than the plaxton val it also differed from the cavalier and grenadier by having plated window surrounds there was a large brightwork grille and twin headlights a grenadier style front windscreen was used with a similar sized one at the rear above the windscreen was a destination box or illuminated nameboard and above that a prominent peak at the rear the illuminated nameboard was inside the rear glass and this was fitted the other way about to the front meaning the first and last pillars had a pronounced forward rake to them whilst all the others were vertical the cantrail was flat above it was a roof section of very shallow curvature the mark two which followed in  for the final two seasons omitted this flat cantrail and had a roof of compound curvature which reduced the tall square effect of the original but reduced space in the overhead luggage racks the legionnaire was built on the bedford val the more conventional ford thames  and there were also two specials on guy victory trambus chassis the legionnaire took its fame from the  film the italian job

overviewedit the company began with the construction of horsedrawn carriages with the rise of motor vehicle thomas harrington began building on motor car chassis and prior to world war i began to specialise in commercial vehicles buses and coaches after the armistice the company concentrated on luxury coaches supplementing these with some singledeck bus bodies and other general coachbuilding activity during world war ii they were selected by the war ministry to build a specialised aircraft design and during their history they also produced ¼  scale streetlegal model coaches to entertain children pioneered a minibus that bus operators found practical and legal to use and droveforward coach design they had an open outlook on developments in technology and an excellent grasp of marketing opportunities and an eye for a catchy press advertisement they nurtured relationships with customers one at least bought nothing other than harrington for its entire existence in  it was decided to close the factory although not a part of the rootes group the operations were owned by a rootes family investment company production ceased in april  after which plaxton purchased spares stock in trade and goodwill the cavalier – and grenadier  luxury coach bodies for underfloorengined chassis jointly won the classic bus reader poll as the most stylish coach of all time many harrington vehicles are preserved and harrington devotees have a gathering of their own the sedit there were huge numbers of small to mediumsized professional coachbuilders in existence around britain as thomas harrington  sons ltd moved into its new hove factory the management of harringtons decided that two things were necessary to stand them in good stead in this crowded market the first was building good relationships with bluechip customers and the second was to produce designs with a distinctive harrington look instances of the first were their longterm supply to high–class coach firms in the private and large company sectors such private customers included greygreen of stamford hill london charlies cars of bournemouth and silver star of porton down the large firms included the tilling groups north western road car company of stockport and betgroup member devon general of exeter but perhaps the most enduring relationship of all was as supplier to the local bet coaching powerhouse southdown motor services the styling distinctiveness was a major selling point a harrington body had a clear look at a time when many coachbuilders duple especially would oblige customers and produce an astounding variety of outlines from the conservative to the totally bizarre sometimes building to order straight copies of another coachbuilders style by the mids the harrington look included a half cab with no canopy over the engine and a stepped window line all arranged in a distinctive flowing series of curves by the end of the decade when streamlining was the vogue harrington had devised and patented a new feature called the dorsal fin this appurtenance looked like a truncated aircraft tail and when applied to the rear of the vehicle allowed a rakishly curved reardome outline without compromising passenger access to the rear bench seat and was designed to act as an airextractor as the vehicle moved stale air exited the coach saloon due to the suction effect of the low pressure areas created behind the fin world war ii new products new materials new methodsedit but at this time europe was returning to war and coach operations ceased many operators having their vehicles impressed into military service by the middle of  all nonessential production had been frozen on government orders and the entire vehiclebuilding industry had to turn to war work harrington were allocated the westland lysander aircraft to build this was a short take off and landing stol singleengine type designed as an artillery spotter which became noteworthy for its use in covert operations to and from occupied france as well as the benefits of this to the war effort it gave harringtons workforce new skills in jigbuilding using lightweight alloy sections and extrusions postwaredit after the war demand for new buses and coaches was somewhat pentup as few had been delivered during the war however the country had a massive war debt to pay and all manufacturing industries were exhorted to devote at least  of output to export harrington was able to build a satisfactory export trade particularly to south american operators and to those in british african colonies for the home market most bodies were framed in steelreinforced hardwood because all the established firms were trying to export and thus were not able to offer even their most loyal customers acceptable leadtimes the period from  to the early s caused a mushrooming of small coachbuilders there were many new models and styles of coach in harringtons case these included from  the normal control leyland comet cpo with its small capacity  cu in directinjection diesel and the commer avenger fullfronted forward control lightweight coach with its big humber petrol engine tilted over to  degrees so it hid under the coach floor commer was part of the rootes group later the rootes family bought harrington and john c beadle for customers wanting a return to prewar glamour the dorsal fin was available as an option even on the next generation the wayfareredit this was designed for the new underfloorengined chassis from aec leyland and others but was also to be found on three of the foden rear engined coach chassis the wayfarer ran to four marks and was produced from  to  the longest life of any harrington design it was the first to the new dimensions of  ft long by  ft wide and the first harrington coach to feature a marque name greygreen bought every version of the type and also took harringtonbodied bedfords throughout the s silver star took marks   and  on leyland southdown only took the mark one on royal tiger in  and then deserted harrington until  charlies cars took harringtonbodied albion victors and in  had two wayfarer mark  on albion aberdonian north western had been transferred from tilling to bet during world war ii and took wayfarers of marks   and  for its touring coaches but went elsewhere for express types notably toward the end of the decade to alexander mini coaches and minibusesedit from the early s until the mids harrington employee and former southdown driver ernie johnstone constructed  quarterscale roadlegal coaches to give novelty rides to young children many of these were powered by villiers cc twostroke petrol engines bodies on  of these working models were constructed by harrington the rest he did himself with two friends in his spare time during the s harrington like plaxton and readings offered small party coaches on karrier and commer delivery van chassis whilst from the late s until the factorys closure harrington was responsible for producing the rootes groups inhouse psv conversion of the commer  minbus after harringtons demise the minibus work went to the former tillingstevens works in maidstone customers of the minibus included crosville the first time the state sector had been served by harrington since  when united automobile services took a batch of bristol coaches bodied in hove for their prestigious newcastlelondon service the stateowned bus firms lack of interest in outside suppliers had one overriding reason in  ecw and bristol were served with a statutory ban on selling bodies to other than wholly governmentowned organisations and thus ecw took care of almost all of the tilling groups bus  coach body needs produced london transports first genuine coaches and supplied some bodies to the sheffield transport c fleet and the scottish bus group the contender in a contracting marketedit from  to  former tillingstevens factory built the commer ts a compact if noisy twostroke opposedpiston diesel engine adopted in commer commercials and later marks of their avenger bus chassis harrington like beadle employed units from the avenger together with a midmounted ts engine in its contender range of integral buses and coaches of the mids some of these resembled the wayfarer and others had the standard bus outline of the time but there was a special design built for boac this had a straight waistrail and a multipaned lanterntype windscreen one at least of these were powered by an eightcylinder rollsroyce petrol engine of military pattern driving torqueconverter transmission an odd choice of propulsion in the fueleconomy obsessed s but they were probably a lot lighter on petrol than a boeing stratocruiser or a lockheed super constellation this style of contender was sold in   scale model by dinky toys as their boac coach  boac took  of which nineteen were used overseas making them the largest customer for the contender maidstone and district were second with  buses and one coach although during its short life the contender was less successful than beadles integral coaches beadles comparable chatham range were by  almost their only line and when the bet group decided to reduce the number of its recommended suppliers only southdowns liking for their coach body on the leyland tiger cub kept the dartford body lines going but then southdown switched to weymann and briefly burlingham having taken harrington wayfarer mark ones in small numbers and then deserted harrington for most of the s and that was the end of beadle in the coachwork game rootes decided that the cardealership chain beadle also ran was a better business during the life of the wayfarer all of the mushroom coachbuilding businesses disappeared the clear number one in coach bodies by  was duple at hendon who by  also had a bus factory in the east midlands at kegworth and in  purchased the bus builder willowbrook in nearby loughborough duple was strong in the lightweight end of the market being first choice for bodies on the marketleading bedford but was facing competition in the premium underfloor engined class from plaxton and burlingham of blackpool like harringtons these were primarily builders of coach bodies who also did buses burlingham built double as well as single deck vehicles and had a respected if small list of customers for these weymann roe and alexander were on the other hand bus builders who also did coaches continental inspiration more new materialsedit during the run of the wayfarer and the contender harringtons coachbuilders developed expertise in handling increasingly large and complex glassreinforced plastic grp mouldings the management were keeping abreast of european trends in design and had formed an especial friendship with their opposite numbers at the italian firm of orlandi these changes set the seed for future progress this combination of alloy frame mainly aluminium panelling and grp for coachwork features requiring complex compound curvature enabled stronger lighter and more durable coach bodies besides harrington alexander ecw yeates of loughborough and in  park royal were going down this route the development of durable laminates for interior panel finish such as wareite and formica was another feature that harrington started to pioneer a belated change to the uk government construction and use rules in  allowed fixed rather than opening drivers windscreens on public service vehicle psv bodies this together with advances in toughened glass manufacture at last made it possible to have a coach windscreen with a threedimensional curvature early examples of this by duple plaxton and particularly burlingham on the bedford commer and ford thames lightweight coaches from  were apt to be over the top echoing similar goldfishbowl windscreens on large saloon cars by the usowned carmakers such as the vauxhall cresta pa harrington did not slavishly adopt it considered the next design from old shoreham road retained flatglazed optionallyopening windscreens the crusader classic times aheadedit until  harrington designs for lightweight coaches such as the bedford sb and the commer avenger had been unnamed but in  the crusader was launched it used large glassfibre mouldings for the front and rear panels it was slightly ungainly in its original form but the mark  was a fine looking vehicle updated as mark  with larger cavaliersized side and rear windows the final mark  was perhaps a retrograde step but no worse than equivalent plaxton or duple offerings of the time it was built on the above two chassis and the ford thames e customers included northern general transport garelochhead coach service and southdown who took a batch of  commers in  the crusader was the only classicera harrington coach body to be purchased new by the stateowned operators transport holding company subsidiary thames valley taking a small batch of mark  on bedford sb for its south midland coaching operation in  although that same year wilts  dorset took over silver star adding wayfarers and cavaliers to its coach fleet barton transports  grenadierbodied reliances are justly famous but they also took  crusader  on bedford sb  bvoc harrington alpine the carsedit when rootes group entered the twoseat sports car market in  with the sunbeam alpine some customers complained to the dealers that unlike some rival makes such as mg and jaguar there was not a hardtop coupé version harrington were a rootes dealer and had more expertise than remaining full rootes subsidiaries in the use of grp moulding techniques and thus produced these for sale through selected rootes dealerships they were known as harrington alpines they also did a similar conversion to the triumph tr for wimbledonbased dove garages this was called the dové gtr the success of the alpine programme including an encouraging performance at le mans led commer to entrust harrington with the psv conversion of the  van which included a complete one piece fibreglass roof panel of clerestory outline the cavalier compared to its competitorsedit launched at the end of  the cavalier was ahead of the opposition in many if not all respects certainly its outside appearance was of classic beauty combining curves sharp angles and peaks in harmony which combined with understated use of bright trim in a way that made it stand out from the opposition by combining style with good taste the double curvature windscreen was not only wholly in line with the style of the body but it helped nighttime coach drivers by dispelling interior reflections the plaxton panorama launched in production guise in  had a basically rather boxlike shape and a very flashy grille but it did pioneer smiths instruments jetvent forced ventilation system allowing fixed windows and a cleaner side outline the duple britannia  on its third facelift for the  season had an excessively droopy outline and tiny windows and was very little different from duples gaudy super vegayeomancorinthian for cheap coach chassis duple probably didnt care the brittania was not where the jam lay the duple midland donington was really just a bus tricked out with more chrome the willowbrook viscount new for  had puzzling trim lines stopping and starting in the middle of nowhere and an overlybulky outline whilst the optional reverserake rear glass was a feature that was already dated at the time of its launch and today simply looks odd alexander sold coaches south of the border to north western and barton transport and had a pair of fairly conservative though aluminiumalloy framed designs the curvedwaist style which barton had taken since  was discontinued in  after its other major customer western smt had stopped ordering it north western took the straightwaisted variant for most of its coach applications even taking its first batch of  ft see later leopards to this outline weymann built its fanfare design for sale through mcw from  to  without alteration at the end of its run it was a dated looking body roe had during the s a coach renaissance selling versions of its dalesman style to independents and company fleets almost exclusively on the aec reliance in  the dalesman iv had trapezoidal glazing and a straight waistrail the biggest customer for this style being black  white motorways of cheltenham the masterly execution of the cavalier stood out most against burlinghams seagull  its closest contemporary and a body very similar in construction and basic outline comparing the two the seagull s detailing was crude and overemphasised whereas that of the cavallier was sharply delineated making the whole coach look lean and sculpted by comparison with the burlingham style some would say that they summed up the difference between blackpool and hove during that season duple purchased burlingham and renamed it duple northern the yeates europa from  on first facelift for  combined a similarly dumpy volume to the willowbrook made in the same town with deliberately tasteless detailing and riotous paint schemes in a way that operators and passengers either loved or loathed but it was easily the brashest option  salesedit the cavalier was initially offered at  ft long by  ft wide to fit any suitable underfloor engined chassis as was normal with harrington the previous wayfarer mark  coach remained available if requested for the next couple of years but it was clear the advantage was with the cavalier by the time lloyds of nuneatons ue was shown at the  commercial motor show at earls court  cavaliers had been sold to seven bet fleets ten independents and local charity st dunstans home for the blind these were mainly on aec reliance but charlies cars of bournemouth took six albion aberdonian east yorkshire took five on leyland tiger cub and ellen smith of rochdale took the sole leyland leopard the cavalier was a clear success already with a number of influential customers well out of harringtons heartland sales were both more geographically widespread and in many cases to customers who had not taken harrington bodies before the output from hendon on equivalent chassis that season was   salesedit between january and november   cavaliers were sold there were repeat orders for the cavalier from eight operators including st dunstans of the six bet operators three were new customers for the style both of the largest taking leopards for their most prestigious touring duties southdowns first order was for forty bodies and ribble motor services who had favoured local builder burlingham for the past decade took  the largest repeat order was from northern general who again took ten touring coaches this time on leopard and independents adding further cavaliers were abbott of blackpool ellen smith of rochdale flight of birmingham and harris of greys the most important new independent customer was yelloway a conquest from the duple group taking six reliances in terms of chassis on which to build harringtons fortune had definitely swung in the direction of farington with  leopards and a tiger cub being bodied in contrast with only  reliances the albion aberdonian had been discontinued the previous year so it would from now on be a straight fight between lancashire and middlesex duples  season total for the brittania on its final facelift was  all but five on reliance the donington had got bigger windows and brittanialike trim but between them the expanded duple group were building not only the brittania and the donington but also the viscount and the seagull  the differences were not just skindeep either all the duple bodies had steelreinforced hardwood frames also plaxtons structural method the loughboroughbuilt donington and viscount both used framesections made from rolled steel tubes whilst burlinghams bodies like those of harrington and yeates were of jigbuilt aluminium plaxton had refined the panorama with subtler detailing and inward sloping pillars above the waistrail for the  season like harrington they also offered a more conservative option in their case an embassy body with twice as many side windows a more conservative option definitely wasnt yeates style instead they introduced a more radical one if the europa was insufficiently inyourface they could offer you the fiesta now with trapezoid glazing yeates was always going to be a minority choice and as yeates sold everyone elses coachwork their core business being dealership perhaps they wanted it that way  proved though that on the premium chassis harrington was now second only to plaxton although duple vastly outstripped either and the burlingham operation they now owned in the market for lightweight daytrip coaches during  the legal maximum width and length limits for buses and coaches was relaxed new maxima were  ft by  ft ½in to take effect from january   leyland and aec had suitable models on the stocks by the end of the year whilst continuing production of the shorterwheelbase models these could legally carry a slightly longer body than  ft and the first season cavalier delivered in december  a repeat order for keith coaches of aylesbury on reliance was the first cavalier  so called because it was  ft in longer than the previous model which enabled harrington to fit  of its own seats into the coach rather than the previous maximum of  duple and plaxton had offered a seat plan within the older length limits but their seats were a bit skimpier on padding and even so came close to infringing legal minimum length requirements during  the original cavalier was still offered as was the cavalier  to the new maximum length the  carried most of its extra length in a longer first side window whilst the  ft version had this plus an extra shallower window just aft of the first bay which unlike the rest of the side glazing had a horizontal lower edge the waistrail now resuming its dip at the third bay this saved on the cost of extra tooling and made the cavalier a truly modular range of coach bodies although it certainly did not look that way the longer first bay window to the same depth as the windscreen and with a forward sloping pillar made the front of the  coach look better balanced although the longer version was not as happy as the extended panorama tending to look slightly droopy it neither looked as fussy as blackpools continental or addlestones castillian nor was it quite as distracting as the europa or fiesta at the new length harringtons cleverness in construction was necessary for as well as three variants of the cavalier old shoreham road had to find space for car and minibus conversion work production of mark  crusader and bus bodies on aec reliance and albion nimbus chassis it was perhaps good news that maidstone and district had finally been weaned off the wayfarer mark  and that model could be buried after a good innings still the end of the wayfarer mark  meant that the less timid customers would be wanting something more up to date than even the revised cavalier also plans came from luton for a bedford chassis for the new maximum length market sector this was going to be radical in concept and not suitable to the cavalier outline nor that of any cavalier mark  still less would it suit an extended crusader so not only was the factory floor busy so were the designers in the drawing office  salesedit in its final year the  foot cavalier sold  all on reliance maidstone  district took ten south wales two and trent motor traction another bet firm took  one of which was a replacement body on an accidentsalvaged chassis built in   of the  ft in version were sold all to existing customers in the bet group southdown took  more leopards greenslades had three reliances and thomas brothers of port talbot added a further reliance of the independents gliderways took another tiger cub keith of aylesbury harris of greys and summerbees of southampton took more reliances a further reliance was sold to stanley hughes the bradford dealer who leased it for the  season to wallace arnold coaches of leeds as well as these  short cavaliers a further  of the  foot model were sold harrington also soldoff rnj the original cavalier demonstrator replacing it with a foot reliance  registered vpm which in turn was sold in  to hall bros of south shields there were two different sorts of long aec reliance the  type mu used the litre engine of the shorter version at a peak rating of  bhp whilst the  type u used a litre  bhp engine as in the export aec regal vi chassis southdown chose two  seater leopards to the new length whilst greenslades added to its collection of cavaliers with three reliance s and a new bet customer was neath and cardiff coaches with two long reliance s seating the maximum  the independent buyers of the cavalier  in its first season placing repeat orders for the style were abbot ellen smith yelloway and hawkey of newquay and new cavalier customers included greygreen hudson of horncastle ayres of dover liss  district in hampshire and straws of leicester formerly a plaxton loyalist grey green had its first foot cavalier on express service a month after the length was legal the benefits of longer coaches were clearer for express services than for tours especically tours to more remote scenic areas yelloways  footers had an option peculiar to the operator of additional destination displays over the second and fourth nearside windows for express work there was also an optional destination box in the roof dome as well as yelloway grey green were among the operators who specified this fifty seven cavaliers sold new was exactly half the  performance but the coach market was in a downturn in comparison duple sold only nineteen britannias on short reliances and four on short leopard two of the aecs and one leopard had oldfashioned central entrances blackpool built no further seagull s but built  of its  ft duple northern continental on reliances  on leopard including six for ribble and one royal tiger worldmaster a cancelled export order for happiways of manchester  salesedit in the  season the cavalier faced internal competition from the grenadier see below but  of the  ft in version and  of the  ft were sold existing customers who placed repeat orders for the short cavalier were southdown  leopard l greenslades another reliance grey greens orders included a short reliance and ten leopard l and harris of greys summerbee of southampton and mcintyre of aberdeen all took further reliances harris being a rebody of a  chassis damaged in an accident new customers for the  ft in cavalier were munden of bristol leopard l and crump of pinner reliance a new option was fixed side glazing and forced ventilation southdown having this on its leopards all but one of the bet customers for the long cavalier had taken the style before neath and cardiff had two reliance  and east yorkshire four leopard psu ribble had  on leopard psu with the new forced ventialation option the other three were for a newly acquired ribble subsidiary scout motor services of preston to the same specification as the ribble examples grey green had one leopard psu and one reliance  the latter with forced ventilation the other repeat orders from independents were from yelloway who took  reliance  with the jetvent system as well as the additional side destination screens and ellen smith also of rochdale with a leopard fitted with  reclining seats yelloway standardising on this luxurious option on its reliances the short ones seating only  as a result new purchasers of the cavalier  in its second season were anglocontinental of tunbridge wells  reliance  valliant of ealing  reliance  and regent of redditch with a single reliance  in  duple had three new styles for underfloorengined chassis the alpine continental was a longerwindowed version of the continental whilst the dragonfly was a  ft central entrance coach both were built at blackpool the latter having a steel reinforced hardwood body frame for the shorter aecs and leylands the britannia was finally replaced by the hendonbuilt commodore which was a modification of the mass market bella vista body being  ft in longer with a front entrance and a maximum capacity of  total continentalalpine continental sales were  while only six dragonflies were built two leyland demonstrators on leopard and four for bet coach operator samuelson of victoria the commodore was also a sales disappointment eight reliance and three leopard l being sold willowbrook however were gaining expresscoach orders for its version of the betstandard single decker in coach form four main bays were fitted as was fixed glazing and forced ventilation and there was an optional solid coach door and brighwork grille marshall and weymann also built bet style express coaches in contrast plaxton had a further revised panorama with barely perceptible waist curvature and only three main side window bays on the  ft body the dome was refined and thinner trim strips were used producing a body of unusual restraint for a plaxton it was an instant sales success ribble for one placing large orders another competitive body was alexander y type first shown in  which in coach form had four trapezoid windows on each straightwaisted side and double curvature glazing front and rear as well as selling massively to the scottish bus group bet fleets who took the style from  were north western and east midland followed in later seasons by trent potteries the northern general group hebble yorkshire traction yorkshire woolen and stratford blue whilst three independents purchased the style over its lifetime scottish cooperative wholsale society had four reliances venture of consett took  reliances and  leopards with eight more on order when northern took them over whilst premier travel of cambridge had sixteen on reliance bet favoured steeltube body framing and as introduced the y type featured this alexanders reverting to aluminum framework from   sales and totalsedit the  season short cavaliers for bet fleets greenslades  reliance and devon general grey cars  reliance were notable in being to  ft in width and having grenadier style dash panels grey green took eleven leopard l crump of pinner took another reliance and hutchings  cornelius with one reliance became the last new customer for the cavalier  of the short version were built in its final season there were eleven of the longer version six were for yelloway on reliance  grey green took four leopard psu valliant of ealing had two reliance  and ellen smith took a seat leopard psu the only bet customer was thomas brothers of port talbot with a seat reliance  in  yelloway took the last six foot cavaliers on reliance  in all  cavaliers had been built one  ft demonstrator one  ft and  coaches sold of which  were  ft   ft in and   ft there were   ft cavaliers sold plus a demonstrator on aec reliance mu chassis  on leyland leopard lt seven on leyland tiger cub psuct and six on albion aberdonian mrl cavalier  sales totalled  reliances and  leopards cavalier  sales comprised  leopard psu  reliance  u and  reliance  mu plus the demonstrator which was sold after a year to hall bros of south shields who became a loyal grenadier customer the grenadier an apotheosisedit to supplement the cavalier for the  season the grenadier was introduced initially available on the longer chassis it was outwardly similar but a tauterlooking body the structure was similar but the glazing was revised employing one fewer window per side and dipping less toward the rear a larger windscreen was fitted with a more prominent peak only the rear glass was carried over from the cavalier revised front and rear grp mouldings were employed that at the front accenting the horizontal and carrying a larger destination box that at the rear having horizontal rather than vertical light clusters the forcedventilation set up was standard intakes for it being fitted in the front peak rather than in plaxtonstyle airscoops on the roof these changes adding further to the cleanliness of line the bright trim was of a similar layout to that of the cavalier the skirt mouldings being carried over virtually unchanged although roof quarter glazing was a common option on cavaliers the less rounded roofline of the grenadier ensured grenadiers with this option were rare  salesedit the first two grenadiers were a reliance  for harris of greys and a leopard psu for grey green both of which were shown at the  earls court commercial motor show in the initial season a further  ft reliance  went to abbott of blackpool two leopards to gliderways of smethwick five to northern general the only bet order and a unique  ft grenadier went to hawkey of newquay on a reliance  with specially reduced front and rear overhangs it was registered saf and sat   salesedit for the  season a  ft in option for the shorter chassis was introduced  of these went to six bet companies and seven independents previous harrington customers were north western southdown trent and timpson of catford southdown specified the dash panels of the cavalier on their batch the return of north western was maybe a surprise as they were a major supporter of the m alexander y type but they obviously wanted something shorter and a bit classier for their extended tours their two leopard l had illuminated offside and nearside name badges under the second bay the two new bet customers were western welsh and black  white motorways of cheltenham both taking short reliances straw of leicester had previously taken the cavalier and specified a cavalier dash on its reliance conquest sales for

of  the bedford val was a twinsteering chassis with a long front overhang designed for an entrance ahead of the steering axles a unique feature of the type was that the wheels were only inch in diameter which in turn reduced the floor height of bodied examples the radiator was mounted at the front and immediately behind it was the  bhp leyland o engine the harrington legionnaire was a squarerigged body with straight waistrail and five deep windows per side one less than the duple vega major and one more than the plaxton val it also differed from the cavalier and grenadier by having plated window surrounds there was a large brightwork grille and twin headlights a grenadier style front windscreen was used with a similar sized one at the rear above the windscreen was a destination box or illuminated nameboard and above that a prominent peak at the rear the illuminated nameboard was inside the rear glass and this was fitted the other way about to the front meaning the first and last pillars had a pronounced forward rake to them whilst all the others were vertical the cantrail was flat above it was a roof section of very shallow curvature the mark two which followed in  for the final two seasons omitted this flat cantrail and had a roof of compound curvature which reduced the tall square effect of the original but reduced space in the overhead luggage racks the legionnaire was built on the bedford val the more conventional ford thames  and there were also two specials on guy victory trambus chassis the legionnaire took its fame from the  film the italian job the ending of the film involves a mkii legionnaire alr b hanging over a cliff in the alps as the driver had taken the coach into a skid and lost control a remake model can be seen at the de la warr pavilion art gallery the harrington societyedit many harrington vehicles buses coaches cars and miniature coaches survive ranging from a late s leyland to cavaliers grenadiers and five legionnaires

overviewedit the company began with the construction of horsedrawn carriages with the rise of motor vehicle thomas harrington began building on motor car chassis and prior to world war i began to specialise in commercial vehicles buses and coaches after the armistice the company concentrated on luxury coaches supplementing these with some singledeck bus bodies and other general coachbuilding activity during world war ii they were selected by the war ministry to build a specialised aircraft design and during their history they also produced ¼  scale streetlegal model coaches to entertain children pioneered a minibus that bus operators found practical and legal to use and droveforward coach design they had an open outlook on developments in technology and an excellent grasp of marketing opportunities and an eye for a catchy press advertisement they nurtured relationships with customers one at least bought nothing other than harrington for its entire existence in  it was decided to close the factory although not a part of the rootes group the operations were owned by a rootes family investment company production ceased in april  after which plaxton purchased spares stock in trade and goodwill the cavalier – and grenadier  luxury coach bodies for underfloorengined chassis jointly won the classic bus reader poll as the most stylish coach of all time many harrington vehicles are preserved and harrington devotees have a gathering of their own the sedit there were huge numbers of small to mediumsized professional coachbuilders in existence around britain as thomas harrington  sons ltd moved into its new hove factory the management of harringtons decided that two things were necessary to stand them in good stead in this crowded market the first was building good relationships with bluechip customers and the second was to produce designs with a distinctive harrington look instances of the first were their longterm supply to high–class coach firms in the private and large company sectors such private customers included greygreen of stamford hill london charlies cars of bournemouth and silver star of porton down the large firms included the tilling groups north western road car company of stockport and betgroup member devon general of exeter but perhaps the most enduring relationship of all was as supplier to the local bet coaching powerhouse southdown motor services the styling distinctiveness was a major selling point a harrington body had a clear look at a time when many coachbuilders duple especially would oblige customers and produce an astounding variety of outlines from the conservative to the totally bizarre sometimes building to order straight copies of another coachbuilders style by the mids the harrington look included a half cab with no canopy over the engine and a stepped window line all arranged in a distinctive flowing series of curves by the end of the decade when streamlining was the vogue harrington had devised and patented a new feature called the dorsal fin this appurtenance looked like a truncated aircraft tail and when applied to the rear of the vehicle allowed a rakishly curved reardome outline without compromising passenger access to the rear bench seat and was designed to act as an airextractor as the vehicle moved stale air exited the coach saloon due to the suction effect of the low pressure areas created behind the fin world war ii new products new materials new methodsedit but at this time europe was returning to war and coach operations ceased many operators having their vehicles impressed into military service by the middle of  all nonessential production had been frozen on government orders and the entire vehiclebuilding industry had to turn to war work harrington were allocated the westland lysander aircraft to build this was a short take off and landing stol singleengine type designed as an artillery spotter which became noteworthy for its use in covert operations to and from occupied france as well as the benefits of this to the war effort it gave harringtons workforce new skills in jigbuilding using lightweight alloy sections and extrusions postwaredit after the war demand for new buses and coaches was somewhat pentup as few had been delivered during the war however the country had a massive war debt to pay and all manufacturing industries were exhorted to devote at least  of output to export harrington was able to build a satisfactory export trade particularly to south american operators and to those in british african colonies for the home market most bodies were framed in steelreinforced hardwood because all the established firms were trying to export and thus were not able to offer even their most loyal customers acceptable leadtimes the period from  to the early s caused a mushrooming of small coachbuilders there were many new models and styles of coach in harringtons case these included from  the normal control leyland comet cpo with its small capacity  cu in directinjection diesel and the commer avenger fullfronted forward control lightweight coach with its big humber petrol engine tilted over to  degrees so it hid under the coach floor commer was part of the rootes group later the rootes family bought harrington and john c beadle for customers wanting a return to prewar glamour the dorsal fin was available as an option even on the next generation the wayfareredit this was designed for the new underfloorengined chassis from aec leyland and others but was also to be found on three of the foden rear engined coach chassis the wayfarer ran to four marks and was produced from  to  the longest life of any harrington design it was the first to the new dimensions of  ft long by  ft wide and the first harrington coach to feature a marque name greygreen bought every version of the type and also took harringtonbodied bedfords throughout the s silver star took marks   and  on leyland southdown only took the mark one on royal tiger in  and then deserted harrington until  charlies cars took harringtonbodied albion victors and in  had two wayfarer mark  on albion aberdonian north western had been transferred from tilling to bet during world war ii and took wayfarers of marks   and  for its touring coaches but went elsewhere for express types notably toward the end of the decade to alexander mini coaches and minibusesedit from the early s until the mids harrington employee and former southdown driver ernie johnstone constructed  quarterscale roadlegal coaches to give novelty rides to young children many of these were powered by villiers cc twostroke petrol engines bodies on  of these working models were constructed by harrington the rest he did himself with two friends in his spare time during the s harrington like plaxton and readings offered small party coaches on karrier and commer delivery van chassis whilst from the late s until the factorys closure harrington was responsible for producing the rootes groups inhouse psv conversion of the commer  minbus after harringtons demise the minibus work went to the former tillingstevens works in maidstone customers of the minibus included crosville the first time the state sector had been served by harrington since  when united automobile services took a batch of bristol coaches bodied in hove for their prestigious newcastlelondon service the stateowned bus firms lack of interest in outside suppliers had one overriding reason in  ecw and bristol were served with a statutory ban on selling bodies to other than wholly governmentowned organisations and thus ecw took care of almost all of the tilling groups bus  coach body needs produced london transports first genuine coaches and supplied some bodies to the sheffield transport c fleet and the scottish bus group the contender in a contracting marketedit from  to  former tillingstevens factory built the commer ts a compact if noisy twostroke opposedpiston diesel engine adopted in commer commercials and later marks of their avenger bus chassis harrington like beadle employed units from the avenger together with a midmounted ts engine in its contender range of integral buses and coaches of the mids some of these resembled the wayfarer and others had the standard bus outline of the time but there was a special design built for boac this had a straight waistrail and a multipaned lanterntype windscreen one at least of these were powered by an eightcylinder rollsroyce petrol engine of military pattern driving torqueconverter transmission an odd choice of propulsion in the fueleconomy obsessed s but they were probably a lot lighter on petrol than a boeing stratocruiser or a lockheed super constellation this style of contender was sold in   scale model by dinky toys as their boac coach  boac took  of which nineteen were used overseas making them the largest customer for the contender maidstone and district were second with  buses and one coach although during its short life the contender was less successful than beadles integral coaches beadles comparable chatham range were by  almost their only line and when the bet group decided to reduce the number of its recommended suppliers only southdowns liking for their coach body on the leyland tiger cub kept the dartford body lines going but then southdown switched to weymann and briefly burlingham having taken harrington wayfarer mark ones in small numbers and then deserted harrington for most of the s and that was the end of beadle in the coachwork game rootes decided that the cardealership chain beadle also ran was a better business during the life of the wayfarer all of the mushroom coachbuilding businesses disappeared the clear number one in coach bodies by  was duple at hendon who by  also had a bus factory in the east midlands at kegworth and in  purchased the bus builder willowbrook in nearby loughborough duple was strong in the lightweight end of the market being first choice for bodies on the marketleading bedford but was facing competition in the premium underfloor engined class from plaxton and burlingham of blackpool like harringtons these were primarily builders of coach bodies who also did buses burlingham built double as well as single deck vehicles and had a respected if small list of customers for these weymann roe and alexander were on the other hand bus builders who also did coaches continental inspiration more new materialsedit during the run of the wayfarer and the contender harringtons coachbuilders developed expertise in handling increasingly large and complex glassreinforced plastic grp mouldings the management were keeping abreast of european trends in design and had formed an especial friendship with their opposite numbers at the italian firm of orlandi these changes set the seed for future progress this combination of alloy frame mainly aluminium panelling and grp for coachwork features requiring complex compound curvature enabled stronger lighter and more durable coach bodies besides harrington alexander ecw yeates of loughborough and in  park royal were going down this route the development of durable laminates for interior panel finish such as wareite and formica was another feature that harrington started to pioneer a belated change to the uk government construction and use rules in  allowed fixed rather than opening drivers windscreens on public service vehicle psv bodies this together with advances in toughened glass manufacture at last made it possible to have a coach windscreen with a threedimensional curvature early examples of this by duple plaxton and particularly burlingham on the bedford commer and ford thames lightweight coaches from  were apt to be over the top echoing similar goldfishbowl windscreens on large saloon cars by the usowned carmakers such as the vauxhall cresta pa harrington did not slavishly adopt it considered the next design from old shoreham road retained flatglazed optionallyopening windscreens the crusader classic times aheadedit until  harrington designs for lightweight coaches such as the bedford sb and the commer avenger had been unnamed but in  the crusader was launched it used large glassfibre mouldings for the front and rear panels it was slightly ungainly in its original form but the mark  was a fine looking vehicle updated as mark  with larger cavaliersized side and rear windows the final mark  was perhaps a retrograde step but no worse than equivalent plaxton or duple offerings of the time it was built on the above two chassis and the ford thames e customers included northern general transport garelochhead coach service and southdown who took a batch of  commers in  the crusader was the only classicera harrington coach body to be purchased new by the stateowned operators transport holding company subsidiary thames valley taking a small batch of mark  on bedford sb for its south midland coaching operation in  although that same year wilts  dorset took over silver star adding wayfarers and cavaliers to its coach fleet barton transports  grenadierbodied reliances are justly famous but they also took  crusader  on bedford sb  bvoc harrington alpine the carsedit when rootes group entered the twoseat sports car market in  with the sunbeam alpine some customers complained to the dealers that unlike some rival makes such as mg and jaguar there was not a hardtop coupé version harrington were a rootes dealer and had more expertise than remaining full rootes subsidiaries in the use of grp moulding techniques and thus produced these for sale through selected rootes dealerships they were known as harrington alpines they also did a similar conversion to the triumph tr for wimbledonbased dove garages this was called the dové gtr the success of the alpine programme including an encouraging performance at le mans led commer to entrust harrington with the psv conversion of the  van which included a complete one piece fibreglass roof panel of clerestory outline the cavalier compared to its competitorsedit launched at the end of  the cavalier was ahead of the opposition in many if not all respects certainly its outside appearance was of classic beauty combining curves sharp angles and peaks in harmony which combined with understated use of bright trim in a way that made it stand out from the opposition by combining style with good taste the double curvature windscreen was not only wholly in line with the style of the body but it helped nighttime coach drivers by dispelling interior reflections the plaxton panorama launched in production guise in  had a basically rather boxlike shape and a very flashy grille but it did pioneer smiths instruments jetvent forced ventilation system allowing fixed windows and a cleaner side outline the duple britannia  on its third facelift for the  season had an excessively droopy outline and tiny windows and was very little different from duples gaudy super vegayeomancorinthian for cheap coach chassis duple probably didnt care the brittania was not where the jam lay the duple midland donington was really just a bus tricked out with more chrome the willowbrook viscount new for  had puzzling trim lines stopping and starting in the middle of nowhere and an overlybulky outline whilst the optional reverserake rear glass was a feature that was already dated at the time of its launch and today simply looks odd alexander sold coaches south of the border to north western and barton transport and had a pair of fairly conservative though aluminiumalloy framed designs the curvedwaist style which barton had taken since  was discontinued in  after its other major customer western smt had stopped ordering it north western took the straightwaisted variant for most of its coach applications even taking its first batch of  ft see later leopards to this outline weymann built its fanfare design for sale through mcw from  to  without alteration at the end of its run it was a dated looking body roe had during the s a coach renaissance selling versions of its dalesman style to independents and company fleets almost exclusively on the aec reliance in  the dalesman iv had trapezoidal glazing and a straight waistrail the biggest customer for this style being black  white motorways of cheltenham the masterly execution of the cavalier stood out most against burlinghams seagull  its closest contemporary and a body very similar in construction and basic outline comparing the two the seagull s detailing was crude and overemphasised whereas that of the cavallier was sharply delineated making the whole coach look lean and sculpted by comparison with the burlingham style some would say that they summed up the difference between blackpool and hove during that season duple purchased burlingham and renamed it duple northern the yeates europa from  on first facelift for  combined a similarly dumpy volume to the willowbrook made in the same town with deliberately tasteless detailing and riotous paint schemes in a way that operators and passengers either loved or loathed but it was easily the brashest option  salesedit the cavalier was initially offered at  ft long by  ft wide to fit any suitable underfloor engined chassis as was normal with harrington the previous wayfarer mark  coach remained available if requested for the next couple of years but it was clear the advantage was with the cavalier by the time lloyds of nuneatons ue was shown at the  commercial motor show at earls court  cavaliers had been sold to seven bet fleets ten independents and local charity st dunstans home for the blind these were mainly on aec reliance but charlies cars of bournemouth took six albion aberdonian east yorkshire took five on leyland tiger cub and ellen smith of rochdale took the sole leyland leopard the cavalier was a clear success already with a number of influential customers well out of harringtons heartland sales were both more geographically widespread and in many cases to customers who had not taken harrington bodies before the output from hendon on equivalent chassis that season was   salesedit between january and november   cavaliers were sold there were repeat orders for the cavalier from eight operators including st dunstans of the six bet operators three were new customers for the style both of the largest taking leopards for their most prestigious touring duties southdowns first order was for forty bodies and ribble motor services who had favoured local builder burlingham for the past decade took  the largest repeat order was from northern general who again took ten touring coaches this time on leopard and independents adding further cavaliers were abbott of blackpool ellen smith of rochdale flight of birmingham and harris of greys the most important new independent customer was yelloway a conquest from the duple group taking six reliances in terms of chassis on which to build harringtons fortune had definitely swung in the direction of farington with  leopards and a tiger cub being bodied in contrast with only  reliances the albion aberdonian had been discontinued the previous year so it would from now on be a straight fight between lancashire and middlesex duples  season total for the brittania on its final facelift was  all but five on reliance the donington had got bigger windows and brittanialike trim but between them the expanded duple group were building not only the brittania and the donington but also the viscount and the seagull  the differences were not just skindeep either all the duple bodies had steelreinforced hardwood frames also plaxtons structural method the loughboroughbuilt donington and viscount both used framesections made from rolled steel tubes whilst burlinghams bodies like those of harrington and yeates were of jigbuilt aluminium plaxton had refined the panorama with subtler detailing and inward sloping pillars above the waistrail for the  season like harrington they also offered a more conservative option in their case an embassy body with twice as many side windows a more conservative option definitely wasnt yeates style instead they introduced a more radical one if the europa was insufficiently inyourface they could offer you the fiesta now with trapezoid glazing yeates was always going to be a minority choice and as yeates sold everyone elses coachwork their core business being dealership perhaps they wanted it that way  proved though that on the premium chassis harrington was now second only to plaxton although duple vastly outstripped either and the burlingham operation they now owned in the market for lightweight daytrip coaches during  the legal maximum width and length limits for buses and coaches was relaxed new maxima were  ft by  ft ½in to take effect from january   leyland and aec had suitable models on the stocks by the end of the year whilst continuing production of the shorterwheelbase models these could legally carry a slightly longer body than  ft and the first season cavalier delivered in december  a repeat order for keith coaches of aylesbury on reliance was the first cavalier  so called because it was  ft in longer than the previous model which enabled harrington to fit  of its own seats into the coach rather than the previous maximum of  duple and plaxton had offered a seat plan within the older length limits but their seats were a bit skimpier on padding and even so came close to infringing legal minimum length requirements during  the original cavalier was still offered as was the cavalier  to the new maximum length the  carried most of its extra length in a longer first side window whilst the  ft version had this plus an extra shallower window just aft of the first bay which unlike the rest of the side glazing had a horizontal lower edge the waistrail now resuming its dip at the third bay this saved on the cost of extra tooling and made the cavalier a truly modular range of coach bodies although it certainly did not look that way the longer first bay window to the same depth as the windscreen and with a forward sloping pillar made the front of the  coach look better balanced although the longer version was not as happy as the extended panorama tending to look slightly droopy it neither looked as fussy as blackpools continental or addlestones castillian nor was it quite as distracting as the europa or fiesta at the new length harringtons cleverness in construction was necessary for as well as three variants of the cavalier old shoreham road had to find space for car and minibus conversion work production of mark  crusader and bus bodies on aec reliance and albion nimbus chassis it was perhaps good news that maidstone and district had finally been weaned off the wayfarer mark  and that model could be buried after a good innings still the end of the wayfarer mark  meant that the less timid customers would be wanting something more up to date than even the revised cavalier also plans came from luton for a bedford chassis for the new maximum length market sector this was going to be radical in concept and not suitable to the cavalier outline nor that of any cavalier mark  still less would it suit an extended crusader so not only was the factory floor busy so were the designers in the drawing office  salesedit in its final year the  foot cavalier sold  all on reliance maidstone  district took ten south wales two and trent motor traction another bet firm took  one of which was a replacement body on an accidentsalvaged chassis built in   of the  ft in version were sold all to existing customers in the bet group southdown took  more leopards greenslades had three reliances and thomas brothers of port talbot added a further reliance of the independents gliderways took another tiger cub keith of aylesbury harris of greys and summerbees of southampton took more reliances a further reliance was sold to stanley hughes the bradford dealer who leased it for the  season to wallace arnold coaches of leeds as well as these  short cavaliers a further  of the  foot model were sold harrington also soldoff rnj the original cavalier demonstrator replacing it with a foot reliance  registered vpm which in turn was sold in  to hall bros of south shields there were two different sorts of long aec reliance the  type mu used the litre engine of the shorter version at a peak rating of  bhp whilst the  type u used a litre  bhp engine as in the export aec regal vi chassis southdown chose two  seater leopards to the new length whilst greenslades added to its collection of cavaliers with three reliance s and a new bet customer was neath and cardiff coaches with two long reliance s seating the maximum  the independent buyers of the cavalier  in its first season placing repeat orders for the style were abbot ellen smith yelloway and hawkey of newquay and new cavalier customers included greygreen hudson of horncastle ayres of dover liss  district in hampshire and straws of leicester formerly a plaxton loyalist grey green had its first foot cavalier on express service a month after the length was legal the benefits of longer coaches were clearer for express services than for tours especically tours to more remote scenic areas yelloways  footers had an option peculiar to the operator of additional destination displays over the second and fourth nearside windows for express work there was also an optional destination box in the roof dome as well as yelloway grey green were among the operators who specified this fifty seven cavaliers sold new was exactly half the  performance but the coach market was in a downturn in comparison duple sold only nineteen britannias on short reliances and four on short leopard two of the aecs and one leopard had oldfashioned central entrances blackpool built no further seagull s but built  of its  ft duple northern continental on reliances  on leopard including six for ribble and one royal tiger worldmaster a cancelled export order for happiways of manchester  salesedit in the  season the cavalier faced internal competition from the grenadier see below but  of the  ft in version and  of the  ft were sold existing customers who placed repeat orders for the short cavalier were southdown  leopard l greenslades another reliance grey greens orders included a short reliance and ten leopard l and harris of greys summerbee of southampton and mcintyre of aberdeen all took further reliances harris being a rebody of a  chassis damaged in an accident new customers for the  ft in cavalier were munden of bristol leopard l and crump of pinner reliance a new option was fixed side glazing and forced ventilation southdown having this on its leopards all but one of the bet customers for the long cavalier had taken the style before neath and cardiff had two reliance  and east yorkshire four leopard psu ribble had  on leopard psu with the new forced ventialation option the other three were for a newly acquired ribble subsidiary scout motor services of preston to the same specification as the ribble examples grey green had one leopard psu and one reliance  the latter with forced ventilation the other repeat orders from independents were from yelloway who took  reliance  with the jetvent system as well as the additional side destination screens and ellen smith also of rochdale with a leopard fitted with  reclining seats yelloway standardising on this luxurious option on its reliances the short ones seating only  as a result new purchasers of the cavalier  in its second season were anglocontinental of tunbridge wells  reliance  valliant of ealing  reliance  and regent of redditch with a single reliance  in  duple had three new styles for underfloorengined chassis the alpine continental was a longerwindowed version of the continental whilst the dragonfly was a  ft central entrance coach both were built at blackpool the latter having a steel reinforced hardwood body frame for the shorter aecs and leylands the britannia was finally replaced by the hendonbuilt commodore which was a modification of the mass market bella vista body being  ft in longer with a front entrance and a maximum capacity of  total continentalalpine continental sales were  while only six dragonflies were built two leyland demonstrators on leopard and four for bet coach operator samuelson of victoria the commodore was also a sales disappointment eight reliance and three leopard l being sold willowbrook however were gaining expresscoach orders for its version of the betstandard single decker in coach form four main bays were fitted as was fixed glazing and forced ventilation and there was an optional solid coach door and brighwork grille marshall and weymann also built bet style express coaches in contrast plaxton had a further revised panorama with barely perceptible waist curvature and only three main side window bays on the  ft body the dome was refined and thinner trim strips were used producing a body of unusual restraint for a plaxton it was an instant sales success ribble for one placing large orders another competitive body was alexander y type first shown in  which in coach form had four trapezoid windows on each straightwaisted side and double curvature glazing front and rear as well as selling massively to the scottish bus group bet fleets who took the style from  were north western and east midland followed in later seasons by trent

rather than vertical light clusters the forcedventilation set up was standard intakes for it being fitted in the front peak rather than in plaxtonstyle airscoops on the roof these changes adding further to the cleanliness of line the bright trim was of a similar layout to that of the cavalier the skirt mouldings being carried over virtually unchanged although roof quarter glazing was a common

of  the bedford val was a twinsteering chassis with a long front overhang designed for an entrance ahead of the steering axles a unique feature of the type was that the wheels were only inch in diameter which in turn reduced the floor height of bodied examples the radiator was mounted at the front and immediately behind it was the  bhp leyland o engine the harrington legionnaire was a squarerigged body with straight waistrail and five deep windows per side one less than the duple vega major and one more than the plaxton val it also differed from the cavalier and grenadier by having plated window surrounds there was a large brightwork grille and twin headlights a grenadier style front windscreen was used with a similar sized one at the rear above the windscreen was a destination box or illuminated nameboard and above that a prominent peak at the rear the illuminated nameboard was inside the rear glass and this was fitted the other way about to the front meaning the first and last pillars had a pronounced forward rake to them whilst all the others were vertical the cantrail was flat above it was a roof section of very shallow curvature the mark two which followed in  for the final two seasons omitted this flat cantrail and had a roof of compound curvature which reduced the tall square effect of the original but reduced space in the overhead luggage racks the legionnaire was built on the bedford val the more conventional ford thames  and there were also two specials on guy victory trambus chassis the legionnaire took its fame from the  film the italian job the ending of the film involves a mkii legionnaire alr b hanging over a cliff in the alps as the driver had taken the coach into a skid and lost control a remake model can be seen at the de la warr pavilion art gallery the harrington societyedit many harrington vehicles buses coaches cars and miniature coaches survive ranging from a late s leyland to cavaliers grenadiers and five legionnaires

overviewedit the company began with the construction of horsedrawn carriages with the rise of motor vehicle thomas harrington began building on motor car chassis and prior to world war i began to specialise in commercial vehicles buses and coaches after the armistice the company concentrated on luxury coaches supplementing these with some singledeck bus bodies and other general coachbuilding activity during world war ii they were selected by the war ministry to build a specialised aircraft design and during their history they also produced ¼  scale streetlegal model coaches to entertain children pioneered a minibus that bus operators found practical and legal to use and droveforward coach design they had an open outlook on developments in technology and an excellent grasp of marketing opportunities and an eye for a catchy press advertisement they nurtured relationships with customers one at least bought nothing other than harrington for its entire existence in  it was decided to close the factory although not a part of the rootes group the operations were owned by a rootes family investment company production ceased in april  after which plaxton purchased spares stock in trade and goodwill the cavalier – and grenadier  luxury coach bodies for underfloorengined chassis jointly won the classic bus reader poll as the most stylish coach of all time many harrington vehicles are preserved and harrington devotees have a gathering of their own the sedit there were huge numbers of small to mediumsized professional coachbuilders in existence around britain as thomas harrington  sons ltd moved into its new hove factory the management of harringtons decided that two things were necessary to stand them in good stead in this crowded market the first was building good relationships with bluechip customers and the second was to produce designs with a distinctive harrington look instances of the first were their longterm supply to high–class coach firms in the private and large company sectors such private customers included greygreen of stamford hill london charlies cars of bournemouth and silver star of porton down the large firms included the tilling groups north western road car company of stockport and betgroup member devon general of exeter but perhaps the most enduring relationship of all was as supplier to the local bet coaching powerhouse southdown motor services the styling distinctiveness was a major selling point a harrington body had a clear look at a time when many coachbuilders duple especially would oblige customers and produce an astounding variety of outlines from the conservative to the totally bizarre sometimes building to order straight copies of another coachbuilders style by the mids the harrington look included a half cab with no canopy over the engine and a stepped window line all arranged in a distinctive flowing series of curves by the end of the decade when streamlining was the vogue harrington had devised and patented a new feature called the dorsal fin this appurtenance looked like a truncated aircraft tail and when applied to the rear of the vehicle allowed a rakishly curved reardome outline without compromising passenger access to the rear bench seat and was designed to act as an airextractor as the vehicle moved stale air exited the coach saloon due to the suction effect of the low pressure areas created behind the fin world war ii new products new materials new methodsedit but at this time europe was returning to war and coach operations ceased many operators having their vehicles impressed into military service by the middle of  all nonessential production had been frozen on government orders and the entire vehiclebuilding industry had to turn to war work harrington were allocated the westland lysander aircraft to build this was a short take off and landing stol singleengine type designed as an artillery spotter which became noteworthy for its use in covert operations to and from occupied france as well as the benefits of this to the war effort it gave harringtons workforce new skills in jigbuilding using lightweight alloy sections and extrusions postwaredit after the war demand for new buses and coaches was somewhat pentup as few had been delivered during the war however the country had a massive war debt to pay and all manufacturing industries were exhorted to devote at least  of output to export harrington was able to build a satisfactory export trade particularly to south american operators and to those in british african colonies for the home market most bodies were framed in steelreinforced hardwood because all the established firms were trying to export and thus were not able to offer even their most loyal customers acceptable leadtimes the period from  to the early s caused a mushrooming of small coachbuilders there were many new models and styles of coach in harringtons case these included from  the normal control leyland comet cpo with its small capacity  cu in directinjection diesel and the commer avenger fullfronted forward control lightweight coach with its big humber petrol engine tilted over to  degrees so it hid under the coach floor commer was part of the rootes group later the rootes family bought harrington and john c beadle for customers wanting a return to prewar glamour the dorsal fin was available as an option even on the next generation the wayfareredit this was designed for the new underfloorengined chassis from aec leyland and others but was also to be found on three of the foden rear engined coach chassis the wayfarer ran to four marks and was produced from  to  the longest life of any harrington design it was the first to the new dimensions of  ft long by  ft wide and the first harrington coach to feature a marque name greygreen bought every version of the type and also took harringtonbodied bedfords throughout the s silver star took marks   and  on leyland southdown only took the mark one on royal tiger in  and then deserted harrington until  charlies cars took harringtonbodied albion victors and in  had two wayfarer mark  on albion aberdonian north western had been transferred from tilling to bet during world war ii and took wayfarers of marks   and  for its touring coaches but went elsewhere for express types notably toward the end of the decade to alexander mini coaches and minibusesedit from the early s until the mids harrington employee and former southdown driver ernie johnstone constructed  quarterscale roadlegal coaches to give novelty rides to young children many of these were powered by villiers cc twostroke petrol engines bodies on  of these working models were constructed by harrington the rest he did himself with two friends in his spare time during the s harrington like plaxton and readings offered small party coaches on karrier and commer delivery van chassis whilst from the late s until the factorys closure harrington was responsible for producing the rootes groups inhouse psv conversion of the commer  minbus after harringtons demise the minibus work went to the former tillingstevens works in maidstone customers of the minibus included crosville the first time the state sector had been served by harrington since  when united automobile services took a batch of bristol coaches bodied in hove for their prestigious newcastlelondon service the stateowned bus firms lack of interest in outside suppliers had one overriding reason in  ecw and bristol were served with a statutory ban on selling bodies to other than wholly governmentowned organisations and thus ecw took care of almost all of the tilling groups bus  coach body needs produced london transports first genuine coaches and supplied some bodies to the sheffield transport c fleet and the scottish bus group the contender in a contracting marketedit from  to  former tillingstevens factory built the commer ts a compact if noisy twostroke opposedpiston diesel engine adopted in commer commercials and later marks of their avenger bus chassis harrington like beadle employed units from the avenger together with a midmounted ts engine in its contender range of integral buses and coaches of the mids some of these resembled the wayfarer and others had the standard bus outline of the time but there was a special design built for boac this had a straight waistrail and a multipaned lanterntype windscreen one at least of these were powered by an eightcylinder rollsroyce petrol engine of military pattern driving torqueconverter transmission an odd choice of propulsion in the fueleconomy obsessed s but they were probably a lot lighter on petrol than a boeing stratocruiser or a lockheed super constellation this style of contender was sold in   scale model by dinky toys as their boac coach  boac took  of which nineteen were used overseas making them the largest customer for the contender maidstone and district were second with  buses and one coach although during its short life the contender was less successful than beadles integral coaches beadles comparable chatham range were by  almost their only line and when the bet group decided to reduce the number of its recommended suppliers only southdowns liking for their coach body on the leyland tiger cub kept the dartford body lines going but then southdown switched to weymann and briefly burlingham having taken harrington wayfarer mark ones in small numbers and then deserted harrington for most of the s and that was the end of beadle in the coachwork game rootes decided that the cardealership chain beadle also ran was a better business during the life of the wayfarer all of the mushroom coachbuilding businesses disappeared the clear number one in coach bodies by  was duple at hendon who by  also had a bus factory in the east midlands at kegworth and in  purchased the bus builder willowbrook in nearby loughborough duple was strong in the lightweight end of the market being first choice for bodies on the marketleading bedford but was facing competition in the premium underfloor engined class from plaxton and burlingham of blackpool like harringtons these were primarily builders of coach bodies who also did buses burlingham built double as well as single deck vehicles and had a respected if small list of customers for these weymann roe and alexander were on the other hand bus builders who also did coaches continental inspiration more new materialsedit during the run of the wayfarer and the contender harringtons coachbuilders developed expertise in handling increasingly large and complex glassreinforced plastic grp mouldings the management were keeping abreast of european trends in design and had formed an especial friendship with their opposite numbers at the italian firm of orlandi these changes set the seed for future progress this combination of alloy frame mainly aluminium panelling and grp for coachwork features requiring complex compound curvature enabled stronger lighter and more durable coach bodies besides harrington alexander ecw yeates of loughborough and in  park royal were going down this route the development of durable laminates for interior panel finish such as wareite and formica was another feature that harrington started to pioneer a belated change to the uk government construction and use rules in  allowed fixed rather than opening drivers windscreens on public service vehicle psv bodies this together with advances in toughened glass manufacture at last made it possible to have a coach windscreen with a threedimensional curvature early examples of this by duple plaxton and particularly burlingham on the bedford commer and ford thames lightweight coaches from  were apt to be over the top echoing similar goldfishbowl windscreens on large saloon cars by the usowned carmakers such as the vauxhall cresta pa harrington did not slavishly adopt it considered the next design from old shoreham road retained flatglazed optionallyopening windscreens the crusader classic times aheadedit until  harrington designs for lightweight coaches such as the bedford sb and the commer avenger had been unnamed but in  the crusader was launched it used large glassfibre mouldings for the front and rear panels it was slightly ungainly in its original form but the mark  was a fine looking vehicle updated as mark  with larger cavaliersized side and rear windows the final mark  was perhaps a retrograde step but no worse than equivalent plaxton or duple offerings of the time it was built on the above two chassis and the ford thames e customers included northern general transport garelochhead coach service and southdown who took a batch of  commers in  the crusader was the only classicera harrington coach body to be purchased new by the stateowned operators transport holding company subsidiary thames valley taking a small batch of mark  on bedford sb for its south midland coaching operation in  although that same year wilts  dorset took over silver star adding wayfarers and cavaliers to its coach fleet barton transports  grenadierbodied reliances are justly famous but they also took  crusader  on bedford sb  bvoc harrington alpine the carsedit when rootes group entered the twoseat sports car market in  with the sunbeam alpine some customers complained to the dealers that unlike some rival makes such as mg and jaguar there was not a hardtop coupé version harrington were a rootes dealer and had more expertise than remaining full rootes subsidiaries in the use of grp moulding techniques and thus produced these for sale through selected rootes dealerships they were known as harrington alpines they also did a similar conversion to the triumph tr for wimbledonbased dove garages this was called the dové gtr the success of the alpine programme including an encouraging performance at le mans led commer to entrust harrington with the psv conversion of the  van which included a complete one piece fibreglass roof panel of clerestory outline the cavalier compared to its competitorsedit launched at the end of  the cavalier was ahead of the opposition in many if not all respects certainly its outside appearance was of classic beauty combining curves sharp angles and peaks in harmony which combined with understated use of bright trim in a way that made it stand out from the opposition by combining style with good taste the double curvature windscreen was not only wholly in line with the style of the body but it helped nighttime coach drivers by dispelling interior reflections the plaxton panorama launched in production guise in  had a basically rather boxlike shape and a very flashy grille but it did pioneer smiths instruments jetvent forced ventilation system allowing fixed windows and a cleaner side outline the duple britannia  on its third facelift for the  season had an excessively droopy outline and tiny windows and was very little different from duples gaudy super vegayeomancorinthian for cheap coach chassis duple probably didnt care the brittania was not where the jam lay the duple midland donington was really just a bus tricked out with more chrome the willowbrook viscount new for  had puzzling trim lines stopping and starting in the middle of nowhere and an overlybulky outline whilst the optional reverserake rear glass was a feature that was already dated at the time of its launch and today simply looks odd alexander sold coaches south of the border to north western and barton transport and had a pair of fairly conservative though aluminiumalloy framed designs the curvedwaist style which barton had taken since  was discontinued in  after its other major customer western smt had stopped ordering it north western took the straightwaisted variant for most of its coach applications even taking its first batch of  ft see later leopards to this outline weymann built its fanfare design for sale through mcw from  to  without alteration at the end of its run it was a dated looking body roe had during the s a coach renaissance selling versions of its dalesman style to independents and company fleets almost exclusively on the aec reliance in  the dalesman iv had trapezoidal glazing and a straight waistrail the biggest customer for this style being black  white motorways of cheltenham the masterly execution of the cavalier stood out most against burlinghams seagull  its closest contemporary and a body very similar in construction and basic outline comparing the two the seagull s detailing was crude and overemphasised whereas that of the cavallier was sharply delineated making the whole coach look lean and sculpted by comparison with the burlingham style some would say that they summed up the difference between blackpool and hove during that season duple purchased burlingham and renamed it duple northern the yeates europa from  on first facelift for  combined a similarly dumpy volume to the willowbrook made in the same town with deliberately tasteless detailing and riotous paint schemes in a way that operators and passengers either loved or loathed but it was easily the brashest option  salesedit the cavalier was initially offered at  ft long by  ft wide to fit any suitable underfloor engined chassis as was normal with harrington the previous wayfarer mark  coach remained available if requested for the next couple of years but it was clear the advantage was with the cavalier by the time lloyds of nuneatons ue was shown at the  commercial motor show at earls court  cavaliers had been sold to seven bet fleets ten independents and local charity st dunstans home for the blind these were mainly on aec reliance but charlies cars of bournemouth took six albion aberdonian east yorkshire took five on leyland tiger cub and ellen smith of rochdale took the sole leyland leopard the cavalier was a clear success already with a number of influential customers well out of harringtons heartland sales were both more geographically widespread and in many cases to customers who had not taken harrington bodies before the output from hendon on equivalent chassis that season was   salesedit between january and november   cavaliers were sold there were repeat orders for the cavalier from eight operators including st dunstans of the six bet operators three were new customers for the style both of the largest taking leopards for their most prestigious touring duties southdowns first order was for forty bodies and ribble motor services who had favoured local builder burlingham for the past decade took  the largest repeat order was from northern general who again took ten touring coaches this time on leopard and independents adding further cavaliers were abbott of blackpool ellen smith of rochdale flight of birmingham and harris of greys the most important new independent customer was yelloway a conquest from the duple group taking six reliances in terms of chassis on which to build harringtons fortune had definitely swung in the direction of farington with  leopards and a tiger cub being bodied in contrast with only  reliances the albion aberdonian had been discontinued the previous year so it would from now on be a straight fight between lancashire and middlesex duples  season total for the brittania on its final facelift was  all but five on reliance the donington had got bigger windows and brittanialike trim but between them the expanded duple group were building not only the brittania and the donington but also the viscount and the seagull  the differences were not just skindeep either all the duple bodies had steelreinforced hardwood frames also plaxtons structural method the loughboroughbuilt donington and viscount both used framesections made from rolled steel tubes whilst burlinghams bodies like those of harrington and yeates were of jigbuilt aluminium plaxton had refined the panorama with subtler detailing and inward sloping pillars above the waistrail for the  season like harrington they also offered a more conservative option in their case an embassy body with twice as many side windows a more conservative option definitely wasnt yeates style instead they introduced a more radical one if the europa was insufficiently inyourface they could offer you the fiesta now with trapezoid glazing yeates was always going to be a minority choice and as yeates sold everyone elses coachwork their core business being dealership perhaps they wanted it that way  proved though that on the premium chassis harrington was now second only to plaxton although duple vastly outstripped either and the burlingham operation they now owned in the market for lightweight daytrip coaches during  the legal maximum width and length limits for buses and coaches was relaxed new maxima were  ft by  ft ½in to take effect from january   leyland and aec had suitable models on the stocks by the end of the year whilst continuing production of the shorterwheelbase models these could legally carry a slightly longer body than  ft and the first season cavalier delivered in december  a repeat order for keith coaches of aylesbury on reliance was the first cavalier  so called because it was  ft in longer than the previous model which enabled harrington to fit  of its own seats into the coach rather than the previous maximum of  duple and plaxton had offered a seat plan within the older length limits but their seats were a bit skimpier on padding and even so came close to infringing legal minimum length requirements during  the original cavalier was still offered as was the cavalier  to the new maximum length the  carried most of its extra length in a longer first side window whilst the  ft version had this plus an extra shallower window just aft of the first bay which unlike the rest of the side glazing had a horizontal lower edge the waistrail now resuming its dip at the third bay this saved on the cost of extra tooling and made the cavalier a truly modular range of coach bodies although it certainly did not look that way the longer first bay window to the same depth as the windscreen and with a forward sloping pillar made the front of the  coach look better balanced although the longer version was not as happy as the extended panorama tending to look slightly droopy it neither looked as fussy as blackpools continental or addlestones castillian nor was it quite as distracting as the europa or fiesta at the new length harringtons cleverness in construction was necessary for as well as three variants of the cavalier old shoreham road had to find space for car and minibus conversion work production of mark  crusader and bus bodies on aec reliance and albion nimbus chassis it was perhaps good news that maidstone and district had finally been weaned off the wayfarer mark  and that model could be buried after a good innings still the end of the wayfarer mark  meant that the less timid customers would be wanting something more up to date than even the revised cavalier also plans came from luton for a bedford chassis for the new maximum length market sector this was going to be radical in concept and not suitable to the cavalier outline nor that of any cavalier mark  still less would it suit an extended crusader so not only was the factory floor busy so were the designers in the drawing office  salesedit in its final year the  foot cavalier sold  all on reliance maidstone  district took ten south wales two and trent motor traction another bet firm took  one of which was a replacement body on an accidentsalvaged chassis built in   of the  ft in version were sold all to existing customers in the bet group southdown took  more leopards greenslades had three reliances and thomas brothers of port talbot added a further reliance of the independents gliderways took another tiger cub keith of aylesbury harris of greys and summerbees of southampton took more reliances a further reliance was sold to stanley hughes the bradford dealer who leased it for the  season to wallace arnold coaches of leeds as well as these  short cavaliers a further  of the  foot model were sold harrington also soldoff rnj the original cavalier demonstrator replacing it with a foot reliance  registered vpm which in turn was sold in  to hall bros of south shields there were two different sorts of long aec reliance the  type mu used the litre engine of the shorter version at a peak rating of  bhp whilst the  type u used a litre  bhp engine as in the export aec regal vi chassis southdown chose two  seater leopards to the new length whilst greenslades added to its collection of cavaliers with three reliance s and a new bet customer was neath and cardiff coaches with two long reliance s seating the maximum  the independent buyers of the cavalier  in its first season placing repeat orders for the style were abbot ellen smith yelloway and hawkey of newquay and new cavalier customers included greygreen hudson of horncastle ayres of dover liss  district in hampshire and straws of leicester formerly a plaxton loyalist grey green had its first foot cavalier on express

grenadier an apotheosisedit to supplement the cavalier for the  season the grenadier was introduced initially available on the longer chassis it was outwardly similar but a tauterlooking body the structure was similar but the glazing was revised employing one fewer window per side and dipping less toward the rear a larger windscreen was fitted with a more prominent peak only the rear glass was carried over from the cavalier revised front and rear grp mouldings were employed that at the front accenting the horizontal and carrying a larger destination box that at the rear having horizontal rather than vertical light clusters the forcedventilation set up was standard intakes for it being fitted in the front peak rather than in plaxtonstyle airscoops on the roof these changes adding further to the cleanliness of line the bright trim was of a similar layout to that of the cavalier the skirt mouldings being carried over virtually unchanged although roof quarter glazing was a common option on cavaliers the less rounded roofline of the grenadier ensured grenadiers with this option were rare  salesedit the first two grenadiers were a reliance  for harris of greys and a leopard psu for grey green both of which were shown at the  earls court commercial motor show in the initial season a further  ft reliance  went to abbott of blackpool two leopards to gliderways of smethwick five

timpson of catford southdown specified the dash panels of the cavalier on their batch the return of north western was maybe a surprise as they were a major supporter of the m alexander y type but they obviously wanted something shorter and a bit classier for their extended tours their two leopard l had illuminated offside and nearside name badges under the second bay the two new bet customers were western welsh and black  white motorways of cheltenham both taking short reliances straw of leicester had previously taken the cavalier and specified a cavalier dash on its reliance conquest sales for

of  the bedford val was a twinsteering chassis with a long front overhang designed for an entrance ahead of the steering axles a unique feature of the type was that the wheels were only inch in diameter which in turn reduced the floor height of bodied examples the radiator was mounted at the front and immediately behind it was the  bhp leyland o engine the harrington legionnaire was a squarerigged body with straight waistrail and five deep windows per side one less than the duple vega major and one more than the plaxton val it also differed from the cavalier and grenadier by having plated window surrounds there was a large brightwork grille and twin headlights a grenadier style front windscreen was used with a similar sized one at the rear above the windscreen was a destination box or illuminated nameboard and above that a prominent peak at the rear the illuminated nameboard was inside the rear glass and this was fitted the other way about to the front meaning the first and last pillars had a pronounced forward rake to them whilst all the others were vertical the cantrail was flat above it was a roof section of very shallow curvature the mark two which followed in  for the final two seasons omitted this flat cantrail and had a roof of compound curvature which reduced the tall square effect of the original but reduced space in the overhead luggage racks the legionnaire was built on the bedford val the more conventional ford thames  and there were also two specials on guy victory trambus chassis the legionnaire took its fame from the  film the italian job the ending of the film involves a mkii legionnaire alr b hanging over a cliff in the alps as the driver had taken the coach into a skid and lost control a remake model can be seen at the de la warr pavilion art gallery the harrington societyedit many harrington vehicles buses coaches cars and miniature coaches survive ranging from a late s leyland to cavaliers grenadiers and five legionnaires

overviewedit the company began with the construction of horsedrawn carriages with the rise of motor vehicle thomas harrington began building on motor car chassis and prior to world war i began to specialise in commercial vehicles buses and coaches after the armistice the company concentrated on luxury coaches supplementing these with some singledeck bus bodies and other general coachbuilding activity during world war ii they were selected by the war ministry to build a specialised aircraft design and during their history they also produced ¼  scale streetlegal model coaches to entertain children pioneered a minibus that bus operators found practical and legal to use and droveforward coach design they had an open outlook on developments in technology and an excellent grasp of marketing opportunities and an eye for a catchy press advertisement they nurtured relationships with customers one at least bought nothing other than harrington for its entire existence in  it was decided to close the factory although not a part of the rootes group the operations were owned by a rootes family investment company production ceased in april  after which plaxton purchased spares stock in trade and goodwill the cavalier – and grenadier  luxury coach bodies for underfloorengined chassis jointly won the classic bus reader poll as the most stylish coach of all time many harrington vehicles are preserved and harrington devotees have a gathering of their own the sedit there were huge numbers of small to mediumsized professional coachbuilders in existence around britain as thomas harrington  sons ltd moved into its new hove factory the management of harringtons decided that two things were necessary to stand them in good stead in this crowded market the first was building good relationships with bluechip customers and the second was to produce designs with a distinctive harrington look instances of the first were their longterm supply to high–class coach firms in the private and large company sectors such private customers included greygreen of stamford hill london charlies cars of bournemouth and silver star of porton down the large firms included the tilling groups north western road car company of stockport and betgroup member devon general of exeter but perhaps the most enduring relationship of all was as supplier to the local bet coaching powerhouse southdown motor services the styling distinctiveness was a major selling point a harrington body had a clear look at a time when many coachbuilders duple especially would oblige customers and produce an astounding variety of outlines from the conservative to the totally bizarre sometimes building to order straight copies of another coachbuilders style by the mids the harrington look included a half cab with no canopy over the engine and a stepped window line all arranged in a distinctive flowing series of curves by the end of the decade when streamlining was the vogue harrington had devised and patented a new feature called the dorsal fin this appurtenance looked like a truncated aircraft tail and when applied to the rear of the vehicle allowed a rakishly curved reardome outline without compromising passenger access to the rear bench seat and was designed to act as an airextractor as the vehicle moved stale air exited the coach saloon due to the suction effect of the low pressure areas created behind the fin world war ii new products new materials new methodsedit but at this time europe was returning to war and coach operations ceased many operators having their vehicles impressed into military service by the middle of  all nonessential production had been frozen on government orders and the entire vehiclebuilding industry had to turn to war work harrington were allocated the westland lysander aircraft to build this was a short take off and landing stol singleengine type designed as an artillery spotter which became noteworthy for its use in covert operations to and from occupied france as well as the benefits of this to the war effort it gave harringtons workforce new skills in jigbuilding using lightweight alloy sections and extrusions postwaredit after the war demand for new buses and coaches was somewhat pentup as few had been delivered during the war however the country had a massive war debt to pay and all manufacturing industries were exhorted to devote at least  of output to export harrington was able to build a satisfactory export trade particularly to south american operators and to those in british african colonies for the home market most bodies were framed in steelreinforced hardwood because all the established firms were trying to export and thus were not able to offer even their most loyal customers acceptable leadtimes the period from  to the early s caused a mushrooming of small coachbuilders there were many new models and styles of coach in harringtons case these included from  the normal control leyland comet cpo with its small capacity  cu in directinjection diesel and the commer avenger fullfronted forward control lightweight coach with its big humber petrol engine tilted over to  degrees so it hid under the coach floor commer was part of the rootes group later the rootes family bought harrington and john c beadle for customers wanting a return to prewar glamour the dorsal fin was available as an option even on the next generation the wayfareredit this was designed for the new underfloorengined chassis from aec leyland and others but was also to be found on three of the foden rear engined coach chassis the wayfarer ran to four marks and was produced from  to  the longest life of any harrington design it was the first to the new dimensions of  ft long by  ft wide and the first harrington coach to feature a marque name greygreen bought every version of the type and also took harringtonbodied bedfords throughout the s silver star took marks   and  on leyland southdown only took the mark one on royal tiger in  and then deserted harrington until  charlies cars took harringtonbodied albion victors and in  had two wayfarer mark  on albion aberdonian north western had been transferred from tilling to bet during world war ii and took wayfarers of marks   and  for its touring coaches but went elsewhere for express types notably toward the end of the decade to alexander mini coaches and minibusesedit from the early s until the mids harrington employee and former southdown driver ernie johnstone constructed  quarterscale roadlegal coaches to give novelty rides to young children many of these were powered by villiers cc twostroke petrol engines bodies on  of these working models were constructed by harrington the rest he did himself with two friends in his spare time during the s harrington like plaxton and readings offered small party coaches on karrier and commer delivery van chassis whilst from the late s until the factorys closure harrington was responsible for producing the rootes groups inhouse psv conversion of the commer  minbus after harringtons demise the minibus work went to the former tillingstevens works in maidstone customers of the minibus included crosville the first time the state sector had been served by harrington since  when united automobile services took a batch of bristol coaches bodied in hove for their prestigious newcastlelondon service the stateowned bus firms lack of interest in outside suppliers had one overriding reason in  ecw and bristol were served with a statutory ban on selling bodies to other than wholly governmentowned organisations and thus ecw took care of almost all of the tilling groups bus  coach body needs produced london transports first genuine coaches and supplied some bodies to the sheffield transport c fleet and the scottish bus group the contender in a contracting marketedit from  to  former tillingstevens factory built the commer ts a compact if noisy twostroke opposedpiston diesel engine adopted in commer commercials and later marks of their avenger bus chassis harrington like beadle employed units from the avenger together with a midmounted ts engine in its contender range of integral buses and coaches of the mids some of these resembled the wayfarer and others had the standard bus outline of the time but there was a special design built for boac this had a straight waistrail and a multipaned lanterntype windscreen one at least of these were powered by an eightcylinder rollsroyce petrol engine of military pattern driving torqueconverter transmission an odd choice of propulsion in the fueleconomy obsessed s but they were probably a lot lighter on petrol than a boeing stratocruiser or a lockheed super constellation this style of contender was sold in   scale model by dinky toys as their boac coach  boac took  of which nineteen were used overseas making them the largest customer for the contender maidstone and district were second with  buses and one coach although during its short life the contender was less successful than beadles integral coaches beadles comparable chatham range were by  almost their only line and when the bet group decided to reduce the number of its recommended suppliers only southdowns liking for their coach body on the leyland tiger cub kept the dartford body lines going but then southdown switched to weymann and briefly burlingham having taken harrington wayfarer mark ones in small numbers and then deserted harrington for most of the s and that was the end of beadle in the coachwork game rootes decided that the cardealership chain beadle also ran was a better business during the life of the wayfarer all of the mushroom coachbuilding businesses disappeared the clear number one in coach bodies by  was duple at hendon who by  also had a bus factory in the east midlands at kegworth and in  purchased the bus builder willowbrook in nearby loughborough duple was strong in the lightweight end of the market being first choice for bodies on the marketleading bedford but was facing competition in the premium underfloor engined class from plaxton and burlingham of blackpool like harringtons these were primarily builders of coach bodies who also did buses burlingham built double as well as single deck vehicles and had a respected if small list of customers for these weymann roe and alexander were on the other hand bus builders who also did coaches continental inspiration more new materialsedit during the run of the wayfarer and the contender harringtons coachbuilders developed expertise in handling increasingly large and complex glassreinforced plastic grp mouldings the management were keeping abreast of european trends in design and had formed an especial friendship with their opposite numbers at the italian firm of orlandi these changes set the seed for future progress this combination of alloy frame mainly aluminium panelling and grp for coachwork features requiring complex compound curvature enabled stronger lighter and more durable coach bodies besides harrington alexander ecw yeates of loughborough and in  park royal were going down this route the development of durable laminates for interior panel finish such as wareite and formica was another feature that harrington started to pioneer a belated change to the uk government construction and use rules in  allowed fixed rather than opening drivers windscreens on public service vehicle psv bodies this together with advances in toughened glass manufacture at last made it possible to have a coach windscreen with a threedimensional curvature early examples of this by duple plaxton and particularly burlingham on the bedford commer and ford thames lightweight coaches from  were apt to be over the top echoing similar goldfishbowl windscreens on large saloon cars by the usowned carmakers such as the vauxhall cresta pa harrington did not slavishly adopt it considered the next design from old shoreham road retained flatglazed optionallyopening windscreens the crusader classic times aheadedit until  harrington designs for lightweight coaches such as the bedford sb and the commer avenger had been unnamed but in  the crusader was launched it used large glassfibre mouldings for the front and rear panels it was slightly ungainly in its original form but the mark  was a fine looking vehicle updated as mark  with larger cavaliersized side and rear windows the final mark  was perhaps a retrograde step but no worse than equivalent plaxton or duple offerings of the time it was built on the above two chassis and the ford thames e customers included northern general transport garelochhead coach service and southdown who took a batch of  commers in  the crusader was the only classicera harrington coach body to be purchased new by the stateowned operators transport holding company subsidiary thames valley taking a small batch of mark  on bedford sb for its south midland coaching operation in  although that same year wilts  dorset took over silver star adding wayfarers and cavaliers to its coach fleet barton transports  grenadierbodied reliances are justly famous but they also took  crusader  on bedford sb  bvoc harrington alpine the carsedit when rootes group entered the twoseat sports car market in  with the sunbeam alpine some customers complained to the dealers that unlike some rival makes such as mg and jaguar there was not a hardtop coupé version harrington were a rootes dealer and had more expertise than remaining full rootes subsidiaries in the use of grp moulding techniques and thus produced these for sale through selected rootes dealerships they were known as harrington alpines they also did a similar conversion to the triumph tr for wimbledonbased dove garages this was called the dové gtr the success of the alpine programme including an encouraging performance at le mans led commer to entrust harrington with the psv conversion of the  van which included a complete one piece fibreglass roof panel of clerestory outline the cavalier compared to its competitorsedit launched at the end of  the cavalier was ahead of the opposition in many if not all respects certainly its outside appearance was of classic beauty combining curves sharp angles and peaks in harmony which combined with understated use of bright trim in a way that made it stand out from the opposition by combining style with good taste the double curvature windscreen was not only wholly in line with the style of the body but it helped nighttime coach drivers by dispelling interior reflections the plaxton panorama launched in production guise in  had a basically rather boxlike shape and a very flashy grille but it did pioneer smiths instruments jetvent forced ventilation system allowing fixed windows and a cleaner side outline the duple britannia  on its third facelift for the  season had an excessively droopy outline and tiny windows and was very little different from duples gaudy super vegayeomancorinthian for cheap coach chassis duple probably didnt care the brittania was not where the jam lay the duple midland donington was really just a bus tricked out with more chrome the willowbrook viscount new for  had puzzling trim lines stopping and starting in the middle of nowhere and an overlybulky outline whilst the optional reverserake rear glass was a feature that was already dated at the time of its launch and today simply looks odd alexander sold coaches south of the border to north western and barton transport and had a pair of fairly conservative though aluminiumalloy framed designs the curvedwaist style which barton had taken since  was discontinued in  after its other major customer western smt had stopped ordering it north western took the straightwaisted variant for most of its coach applications even taking its first batch of  ft see later leopards to this outline weymann built its fanfare design for sale through mcw from  to  without alteration at the end of its run it was a dated looking body roe had during the s a coach renaissance selling versions of its dalesman style to independents and company fleets almost exclusively on the aec reliance in  the dalesman iv had trapezoidal glazing and a straight waistrail the biggest customer for this style being black  white motorways of cheltenham the masterly execution of the cavalier stood out most against burlinghams seagull  its closest contemporary and a body very similar in construction and basic outline comparing the two the seagull s detailing was crude and overemphasised whereas that of the cavallier was sharply delineated making the whole coach look lean and sculpted by comparison with the burlingham style some would say that they summed up the difference between blackpool and hove during that season duple purchased burlingham and renamed it duple northern the yeates europa from  on first facelift for  combined a similarly dumpy volume to the willowbrook made in the same town with deliberately tasteless detailing and riotous paint schemes in a way that operators and passengers either loved or loathed but it was easily the brashest option  salesedit the cavalier was initially offered at  ft long by  ft wide to fit any suitable underfloor engined chassis as was normal with harrington the previous wayfarer mark  coach remained available if requested for the next couple of years but it was clear the advantage was with the cavalier by the time lloyds of nuneatons ue was shown at the  commercial motor show at earls court  cavaliers had been sold to seven bet fleets ten independents and local charity st dunstans home for the blind these were mainly on aec reliance but charlies cars of bournemouth took six albion aberdonian east yorkshire took five on leyland tiger cub and ellen smith of rochdale took the sole leyland leopard the cavalier was a clear success already with a number of influential customers well out of harringtons heartland sales were both more geographically widespread and in many cases to customers who had not taken harrington bodies before the output from hendon on equivalent chassis that season was   salesedit between january and november   cavaliers were sold there were repeat orders for the cavalier from eight operators including st dunstans of the six bet operators three were new customers for the style both of the largest taking leopards for their most prestigious touring duties southdowns first order was for forty bodies and ribble motor services who had favoured local builder burlingham for the past decade took  the largest repeat order was from northern general who again took ten touring coaches this time on leopard and independents adding further cavaliers were abbott of blackpool ellen smith of rochdale flight of birmingham and harris of greys the most important new independent customer was yelloway a conquest from the duple group taking six reliances in terms of chassis on which to build harringtons fortune had definitely swung in the direction of farington with  leopards and a tiger cub being bodied in contrast with only  reliances the albion aberdonian had been discontinued the previous year so it would from now on be a straight fight between lancashire and middlesex duples  season total for the brittania on its final facelift was  all but five on reliance the donington had got bigger windows and brittanialike trim but between them the expanded duple group were building not only the brittania and the donington but also the viscount and the seagull  the differences were not just skindeep either all the duple bodies had steelreinforced hardwood frames also plaxtons structural method the loughboroughbuilt donington and viscount both used framesections made from rolled steel tubes whilst burlinghams bodies like those of harrington and yeates were of jigbuilt aluminium plaxton had refined the panorama with subtler detailing and inward sloping pillars above the waistrail for the  season like harrington they also offered a more conservative option in their case an embassy body with twice as many side windows a more conservative option definitely wasnt yeates style instead they introduced a more radical one if the europa was insufficiently inyourface they could offer you the fiesta now with trapezoid glazing yeates was always going to be a minority choice and as yeates sold everyone elses coachwork their core business being dealership perhaps they wanted it that way  proved though that on the premium chassis harrington was now second only to plaxton although duple vastly outstripped either and the burlingham operation they now owned in the market for lightweight daytrip coaches during  the legal maximum width and length limits for buses and coaches was relaxed new maxima were  ft by  ft ½in to take effect from january   leyland and aec had suitable models on the stocks by the end of the year whilst continuing production of the shorterwheelbase models these could legally carry a slightly longer body than  ft and the first season cavalier delivered in december  a repeat order for keith coaches of aylesbury on reliance was the first cavalier  so called because it was  ft in longer than the previous model which enabled harrington to fit  of its own seats into the coach rather than the previous maximum of  duple and plaxton had offered a seat plan within the older length limits but their seats were a bit skimpier on padding and even so came close to infringing legal minimum length requirements during  the original cavalier was still offered as was the cavalier  to the new maximum length the  carried most of its extra length in a longer first side window whilst the  ft version had this plus an extra shallower window just aft of the first bay which unlike the rest of the side glazing had a horizontal lower edge the waistrail now resuming its dip at the third bay this saved on the cost of extra tooling and made the cavalier a truly modular range of coach bodies although it certainly did not look that way the longer first bay window to the same depth as the windscreen and with a forward sloping pillar made the front of the  coach look better balanced although the longer version was not as happy as the extended panorama tending to look slightly droopy it neither looked as fussy as blackpools continental or addlestones castillian nor was it quite as distracting as the europa or fiesta at the new length harringtons cleverness in construction was necessary for as well as three variants of the cavalier old shoreham road had to find space for car and minibus conversion work production of mark  crusader and bus bodies on aec reliance and albion nimbus chassis it was perhaps good news that maidstone and district had finally been weaned off the wayfarer mark  and that model could be buried after a good innings still the end of the wayfarer mark  meant that the less timid customers would be wanting something more up to date than even the revised cavalier also plans came from luton for a bedford chassis for the new maximum length market sector this was going to be radical in concept and not suitable to the cavalier outline nor that of any cavalier mark  still less would it suit an extended crusader so not only was the factory floor busy so were the designers in the drawing office  salesedit in its final year the  foot cavalier sold  all on reliance maidstone  district took ten south wales two and trent motor traction another bet firm took  one of which was a replacement body on an accidentsalvaged chassis built in   of the  ft in version were sold all to existing customers in the bet group southdown took  more leopards greenslades had three reliances and thomas brothers of port talbot added a further reliance of the independents gliderways took another tiger cub keith of aylesbury harris of greys and summerbees of southampton took more reliances a further reliance was sold to stanley hughes the bradford dealer who leased it for the  season to wallace arnold coaches of leeds as well as these  short cavaliers a further  of the  foot model were sold harrington also soldoff rnj the original cavalier demonstrator replacing it with a foot reliance  registered vpm which in turn was sold in  to hall bros of south shields there were two different sorts of long aec reliance the  type mu used the litre engine of the shorter version at a peak rating of  bhp whilst the  type u used a litre  bhp engine as in the export aec regal vi chassis southdown chose two  seater leopards to the new length whilst greenslades added to its collection of cavaliers with three reliance s and a new bet customer was neath and cardiff coaches with two long reliance s seating the maximum  the independent buyers of the cavalier  in its first season placing repeat orders for the style were abbot ellen smith yelloway and hawkey of newquay and new cavalier customers included greygreen hudson of horncastle ayres of dover liss  district in hampshire and straws of leicester formerly a plaxton loyalist grey green had its first foot cavalier on express service a month after the length was legal the benefits of longer coaches were clearer for express services than for tours especically tours to more remote scenic areas yelloways  footers had an option peculiar to the operator of additional destination displays over the second and fourth nearside windows for express work there was also an optional destination box in the roof dome as well as yelloway grey green were among the operators who specified this fifty seven cavaliers sold new was exactly half the  performance but the coach market was in a downturn in comparison duple sold only nineteen britannias on short reliances and four on short leopard two of the aecs and one leopard had oldfashioned central entrances blackpool built no further seagull s but built  of its  ft duple northern continental on reliances  on leopard including six for ribble and one royal tiger worldmaster a cancelled export order for happiways of manchester  salesedit in the  season the cavalier faced internal competition from the grenadier see below but  of the  ft in version and  of the  ft were sold existing customers who placed repeat orders for the short cavalier were southdown  leopard l greenslades another reliance grey greens orders included a short reliance and ten leopard l and harris of greys summerbee of southampton and mcintyre of aberdeen all took further reliances harris being a rebody of a  chassis damaged in an accident new customers for the  ft in cavalier were munden of bristol leopard l and crump of pinner reliance a new option was fixed side glazing and forced

psu ribble had  on leopard psu with the new forced ventialation option the other three were for a newly acquired ribble subsidiary scout motor services of preston to the same specification as the ribble examples grey green had one leopard psu and one reliance  the latter with forced ventilation the other repeat orders from independents were from yelloway who took  reliance  with the jetvent system as well as the additional side destination screens and ellen smith also of rochdale with a leopard fitted with  reclining seats yelloway standardising on this luxurious option on its reliances the short ones seating only  as a result new purchasers of the cavalier  in its second season were anglocontinental of tunbridge wells  reliance  valliant of ealing  reliance  and regent of redditch

there was an optional solid coach door and brighwork grille marshall and weymann also built bet style express coaches in contrast plaxton had a further revised panorama with barely perceptible waist curvature and only three main side window bays on the  ft body the dome was refined and thinner trim strips were used producing a body of unusual restraint for a plaxton it was an instant sales success ribble for one placing large orders another competitive body was alexander y type first shown in  which in coach form had four trapezoid windows on each straightwaisted side and double curvature glazing front and rear as well as selling massively to the scottish bus group bet fleets who took the style from  were north western and east midland followed in later seasons by trent

cavalier  sales comprised  leopard psu  reliance  u and  reliance  mu plus the demonstrator which was sold after a year to hall bros of south shields who became a loyal grenadier customer the grenadier an apotheosisedit to supplement the cavalier for the  season the grenadier was introduced initially available on the longer chassis it was outwardly similar but a tauterlooking body the structure was similar but the glazing was revised employing one fewer window per side and dipping less toward the rear a larger windscreen was fitted with a more prominent peak only the rear glass was carried over from the cavalier revised front and rear grp mouldings were employed that at the front accenting the horizontal and carrying a larger destination box that at the rear having horizontal rather than vertical light clusters the forcedventilation set up was standard intakes for it being fitted in the front peak rather than in plaxtonstyle airscoops on the roof these changes adding further to the cleanliness of line the bright trim was of a similar layout to that of the cavalier the skirt mouldings being carried over virtually unchanged although roof quarter glazing was a common option on cavaliers the less rounded roofline of the grenadier ensured grenadiers with this option were rare  salesedit the first two grenadiers were a reliance  for harris of greys and a leopard psu for grey green both of which were shown at the  earls court commercial motor show in the initial season a further  ft reliance  went to abbott of blackpool two leopards to gliderways of smethwick five to northern general the only bet order and a unique  ft grenadier went to hawkey of newquay on a reliance  with specially reduced front and rear overhangs it was registered saf and sat   salesedit for the  season a  ft in option for the shorter chassis was introduced  of these went to six bet companies and seven independents previous harrington customers were north western southdown trent and timpson of catford southdown specified the dash panels of the cavalier on their batch the return of north western was maybe a surprise as they were a major supporter of the m alexander y type but they obviously wanted something shorter and a bit classier for their extended tours their two leopard l had illuminated offside and nearside name badges under the second bay the two new bet customers were western welsh and black  white motorways of cheltenham both taking short reliances straw of leicester had previously taken the cavalier and specified a cavalier dash on its reliance conquest sales for

 ft version was on a modified reliance ura the legionnaireedit main article harrington legionnaire during  vauxhall motors told british coachbuilders about their new design to be produced from the end of  the bedford val was a twinsteering chassis with a long front overhang designed for an entrance ahead of the steering axles a unique feature of the type was that the wheels were only inch in diameter which in turn reduced the floor height of bodied examples the radiator was mounted at the front and immediately behind it was the  bhp leyland o engine the harrington legionnaire was a squarerigged body with straight waistrail and five deep windows per side one less than the duple vega major and one more than the plaxton val it also differed from the cavalier and grenadier by having plated window surrounds there was a large brightwork grille and twin headlights a grenadier style front windscreen was used with a similar sized one at the rear above the windscreen was a destination box or illuminated nameboard and above that a prominent peak at the rear the illuminated nameboard was inside the rear glass and this was fitted the other way about to the front meaning the first and last pillars had a pronounced forward rake to them whilst all the others were vertical the cantrail was flat above it was a roof section of very shallow curvature the mark two which followed in  for the final two seasons omitted this flat cantrail and had a roof of compound curvature which reduced the tall square effect of the original but reduced space in the overhead luggage racks the legionnaire was built on the bedford val the more conventional ford thames  and there were also two specials on guy victory trambus chassis the legionnaire took its fame from the  film the italian job the ending of the film involves a mkii legionnaire alr b hanging over a cliff in the alps as the driver had taken the coach into a skid and lost control a remake model can be seen at the de la warr pavilion art gallery the harrington societyedit many harrington vehicles buses coaches cars and miniature coaches survive ranging from a late s leyland to cavaliers grenadiers and five legionnaires

overviewedit the company began with the construction of horsedrawn carriages with the rise of motor vehicle thomas harrington began building on motor car chassis and prior to world war i began to specialise in commercial vehicles buses and coaches after the armistice the company concentrated on luxury coaches supplementing these with some singledeck bus bodies and other general coachbuilding activity during world war ii they were selected by the war ministry to build a specialised aircraft design and during their history they also produced ¼  scale streetlegal model coaches to entertain children pioneered a minibus that bus operators found practical and legal to use and droveforward coach design they had an open outlook on developments in technology and an excellent grasp of marketing opportunities and an eye for a catchy press advertisement they nurtured relationships with customers one at least bought nothing other than harrington for its entire existence in  it was decided to close the factory although not a part of the rootes group the operations were owned by a rootes family investment company production ceased in april  after which plaxton purchased spares stock in trade and goodwill the cavalier – and grenadier  luxury coach bodies for underfloorengined chassis jointly won the classic bus reader poll as the most stylish coach of all time many harrington vehicles are preserved and harrington devotees have a gathering of their own the sedit there were huge numbers of small to mediumsized professional coachbuilders in existence around britain as thomas harrington  sons ltd moved into its new hove factory the management of harringtons decided that two things were necessary to stand them in good stead in this crowded market the first was building good relationships with bluechip customers and the second was to produce designs with a distinctive harrington look instances of the first were their longterm supply to high–class coach firms in the private and large company sectors such private customers included greygreen of stamford hill london charlies cars of bournemouth and silver star of porton down the large firms included the tilling groups north western road car company of stockport and betgroup member devon general of exeter but perhaps the most enduring relationship of all was as supplier to the local bet coaching powerhouse southdown motor services the styling distinctiveness was a major selling point a harrington body had a clear look at a time when many coachbuilders duple especially would oblige customers and produce an astounding variety of outlines from the conservative to the totally bizarre sometimes building to order straight copies of another coachbuilders style by the mids the harrington look included a half cab with no canopy over the engine and a stepped window line all arranged in a distinctive flowing series of curves by the end of the decade when streamlining was the vogue harrington had devised and patented a new feature called the dorsal fin this appurtenance looked like a truncated aircraft tail and when applied to the rear of the vehicle allowed a rakishly curved reardome outline without compromising passenger access to the rear bench seat and was designed to act as an airextractor as the vehicle moved stale air exited the coach saloon due to the suction effect of the low pressure areas created behind the fin world war ii new products new materials new methodsedit but at this time europe was returning to war and coach operations ceased many operators having their vehicles impressed into military service by the middle of  all nonessential production had been frozen on government orders and the entire vehiclebuilding industry had to turn to war work harrington were allocated the westland lysander aircraft to build this was a short take off and landing stol singleengine type designed as an artillery spotter which became noteworthy for its use in covert operations to and from occupied france as well as the benefits of this to the war effort it gave harringtons workforce new skills in jigbuilding using lightweight alloy sections and extrusions postwaredit after the war demand for new buses and coaches was somewhat pentup as few had been delivered during the war however the country had a massive war debt to pay and all manufacturing industries were exhorted to devote at least  of output to export harrington was able to build a satisfactory export trade particularly to south american operators and to those in british african colonies for the home market most bodies were framed in steelreinforced hardwood because all the established firms were trying to export and thus were not able to offer even their most loyal customers acceptable leadtimes the period from  to the early s caused a mushrooming of small coachbuilders there were many new models and styles of coach in harringtons case these included from  the normal control leyland comet cpo with its small capacity  cu in directinjection diesel and the commer avenger fullfronted forward control lightweight coach with its big humber petrol engine tilted over to  degrees so it hid under the coach floor commer was part of the rootes group later the rootes family bought harrington and john c beadle for customers wanting a return to prewar glamour the dorsal fin was available as an option even on the next generation the wayfareredit this was designed for the new underfloorengined chassis from aec leyland and others but was also to be found on three of the foden rear engined coach chassis the wayfarer ran to four marks and was produced from  to  the longest life of any harrington design it was the first to the new dimensions of  ft long by  ft wide and the first harrington coach to feature a marque name greygreen bought every version of the type and also took harringtonbodied bedfords throughout the s silver star took marks   and  on leyland southdown only took the mark one on royal tiger in  and then deserted harrington until  charlies cars took harringtonbodied albion victors and in  had two wayfarer mark  on albion aberdonian north western had been transferred from tilling to bet during world war ii and took wayfarers of marks   and  for its touring coaches but went elsewhere for express types notably toward the end of the decade to alexander mini coaches and minibusesedit from the early s until the mids harrington employee and former southdown driver ernie johnstone constructed  quarterscale roadlegal coaches to give novelty rides to young children many of these were powered by villiers cc twostroke petrol engines bodies on  of these working models were constructed by harrington the rest he did himself with two friends in his spare time during the s harrington like plaxton and readings offered small party coaches on karrier and commer delivery van chassis whilst from the late s until the factorys closure harrington was responsible for producing the rootes groups inhouse psv conversion of the commer  minbus after harringtons demise the minibus work went to the former tillingstevens works in maidstone customers of the minibus included crosville the first time the state sector had been served by harrington since  when united automobile services took a batch of bristol coaches bodied in hove for their prestigious newcastlelondon service the stateowned bus firms lack of interest in outside suppliers had one overriding reason in  ecw and bristol were served with a statutory ban on selling bodies to other than wholly governmentowned organisations and thus ecw took care of almost all of the tilling groups bus  coach body needs produced london transports first genuine coaches and supplied some bodies to the sheffield transport c fleet and the scottish bus group the contender in a contracting marketedit from  to  former tillingstevens factory built the commer ts a compact if noisy twostroke opposedpiston diesel engine adopted in commer commercials and later marks of their avenger bus chassis harrington like beadle employed units from the avenger together with a midmounted ts engine in its contender range of integral buses and coaches of the mids some of these resembled the wayfarer and others had the standard bus outline of the time but there was a special design built for boac this had a straight waistrail and a multipaned lanterntype windscreen one at least of these were powered by an eightcylinder rollsroyce petrol engine of military pattern driving torqueconverter transmission an odd choice of propulsion in the fueleconomy obsessed s but they were probably a lot lighter on petrol than a boeing stratocruiser or a lockheed super constellation this style of contender was sold in   scale model by dinky toys as their boac coach  boac took  of which nineteen were used overseas making them the largest customer for the contender maidstone and district were second with  buses and one coach although during its short life the contender was less successful than beadles integral coaches beadles comparable chatham range were by  almost their only line and when the bet group decided to reduce the number of its recommended suppliers only southdowns liking for their coach body on the leyland tiger cub kept the dartford body lines going but then southdown switched to weymann and briefly burlingham having taken harrington wayfarer mark ones in small numbers and then deserted harrington for most of the s and that was the end of beadle in the coachwork game rootes decided that the cardealership chain beadle also ran was a better business during the life of the wayfarer all of the mushroom coachbuilding businesses disappeared the clear number one in coach bodies by  was duple at hendon who by  also had a bus factory in the east midlands at kegworth and in  purchased the bus builder willowbrook in nearby loughborough duple was strong in the lightweight end of the market being first choice for bodies on the marketleading bedford but was facing competition in the premium underfloor engined class from plaxton and burlingham of blackpool like harringtons these were primarily builders of coach bodies who also did buses burlingham built double as well as single deck vehicles and had a respected if small list of customers for these weymann roe and alexander were on the other hand bus builders who also did coaches continental inspiration more new materialsedit during the run of the wayfarer and the contender harringtons coachbuilders developed expertise in handling increasingly large and complex glassreinforced plastic grp mouldings the management were keeping abreast of european trends in design and had formed an especial friendship with their opposite numbers at the italian firm of orlandi these changes set the seed for future progress this combination of alloy frame mainly aluminium panelling and grp for coachwork features requiring complex compound curvature enabled stronger lighter and more durable coach bodies besides harrington alexander ecw yeates of loughborough and in  park royal were going down this route the development of durable laminates for interior panel finish such as wareite and formica was another feature that harrington started to pioneer a belated change to the uk government construction and use rules in  allowed fixed rather than opening drivers windscreens on public service vehicle psv bodies this together with advances in toughened glass manufacture at last made it possible to have a coach windscreen with a threedimensional curvature early examples of this by duple plaxton and particularly burlingham on the bedford commer and ford thames lightweight coaches from  were apt to be over the top echoing similar goldfishbowl windscreens on large saloon cars by the usowned carmakers such as the vauxhall cresta pa harrington did not slavishly adopt it considered the next design from old shoreham road retained flatglazed optionallyopening windscreens the crusader classic times aheadedit until  harrington designs for lightweight coaches such as the bedford sb and the commer avenger had been unnamed but in  the crusader was launched it used large glassfibre mouldings for the front and rear panels it was slightly ungainly in its original form but the mark  was a fine looking vehicle updated as mark  with larger cavaliersized side and rear windows the final mark  was perhaps a retrograde step but no worse than equivalent plaxton or duple offerings of the time it was built on the above two chassis and the ford thames e customers included northern general transport garelochhead coach service and southdown who took a batch of  commers in  the crusader was the only classicera harrington coach body to be purchased new by the stateowned operators transport holding company subsidiary thames valley taking a small batch of mark  on bedford sb for its south midland coaching operation in  although that same year wilts  dorset took over silver star adding wayfarers and cavaliers to its coach fleet barton transports  grenadierbodied reliances are justly famous but they also took  crusader  on bedford sb  bvoc harrington alpine the carsedit when rootes group entered the twoseat sports car market in  with the sunbeam alpine some customers complained to the dealers that unlike some rival makes such as mg and jaguar there was not a hardtop coupé version harrington were a rootes dealer and had more expertise than remaining full rootes subsidiaries in the use of grp moulding techniques and thus produced these for sale through selected rootes dealerships they were known as harrington alpines they also did a similar conversion to the triumph tr for wimbledonbased dove garages this was called the dové gtr the success of the alpine programme including an encouraging performance at le mans led commer to entrust harrington with the psv conversion of the  van which included a complete one piece fibreglass roof panel of clerestory outline the cavalier compared to its competitorsedit launched at the end of  the cavalier was ahead of the opposition in many if not all respects certainly its outside appearance was of classic beauty combining curves sharp angles and peaks in harmony which combined with understated use of bright trim in a way that made it stand out from the opposition by combining style with good taste the double curvature windscreen was not only wholly in line with the style of the body but it helped nighttime coach drivers by dispelling interior reflections the plaxton panorama launched in production guise in  had a basically rather boxlike shape and a very flashy grille but it did pioneer smiths instruments jetvent forced ventilation system allowing fixed windows and a cleaner side outline the duple britannia  on its third facelift for the  season had an excessively droopy outline and tiny windows and was very little different from duples gaudy super vegayeomancorinthian for cheap coach chassis duple probably didnt care the brittania was not where the jam lay the duple midland donington was really just a bus tricked out with more chrome the willowbrook viscount new for  had puzzling trim lines stopping and starting in the middle of nowhere and an overlybulky outline whilst the optional reverserake rear glass was a feature that was already dated at the time of its launch and today simply looks odd alexander sold coaches south of the border to north western and barton transport and had a pair of fairly conservative though aluminiumalloy framed designs the curvedwaist style which barton had taken since  was discontinued in  after its other major customer western smt had stopped ordering it north western took the straightwaisted variant for most of its coach applications even taking its first batch of  ft see later leopards to this outline weymann built its fanfare design for sale through mcw from  to  without alteration at the end of its run it was a dated looking body roe had during the s a coach renaissance selling versions of its dalesman style to independents and company fleets almost exclusively on the aec reliance in  the dalesman iv had trapezoidal glazing and a straight waistrail the biggest customer for this style being black  white motorways of cheltenham the masterly execution of the cavalier stood out most against burlinghams seagull  its closest contemporary and a body very similar in construction and basic outline comparing the two the seagull s detailing was crude and overemphasised whereas that of the cavallier was sharply delineated making the whole coach look lean and sculpted by comparison with the burlingham style some would say that they summed up the difference between blackpool and hove during that season duple purchased burlingham and renamed it duple northern the yeates europa from  on first facelift for  combined a similarly dumpy volume to the willowbrook made in the same town with deliberately tasteless detailing and riotous paint schemes in a way that operators and passengers either loved or loathed but it was easily the brashest option  salesedit the cavalier was initially offered at  ft long by  ft wide to fit any suitable underfloor engined chassis as was normal with harrington the previous wayfarer mark  coach remained available if requested for the next couple of years but it was clear the advantage was with the cavalier by the time lloyds of nuneatons ue was shown at the  commercial motor show at earls court  cavaliers had been sold to seven bet fleets ten independents and local charity st dunstans home for the blind these were mainly on aec reliance but charlies cars of bournemouth took six albion aberdonian east yorkshire took five on leyland tiger cub and ellen smith of rochdale took the sole leyland leopard the cavalier was a clear success already with a number of influential customers well out of harringtons heartland sales were both more geographically widespread and in many cases to customers who had not taken harrington bodies before the output from hendon on equivalent chassis that season was   salesedit between january and november   cavaliers were sold there were repeat orders for the cavalier from eight operators including st dunstans of the six bet operators three were new customers for the style both of the largest taking leopards for their most prestigious touring duties southdowns first order was for forty bodies and ribble motor services who had favoured local builder burlingham for the past decade took  the largest repeat order was from northern general who again took ten touring coaches this time on leopard and independents adding further cavaliers were abbott of blackpool ellen smith of rochdale flight of birmingham and harris of greys the most important new independent customer was yelloway a conquest from the duple group taking six reliances in terms of chassis on which to build harringtons fortune had definitely swung in the direction of farington with  leopards and a tiger cub being bodied in contrast with only  reliances the albion aberdonian had been discontinued the previous year so it would from now on be a straight fight between lancashire and middlesex duples  season total for the brittania on its final facelift was  all but five on reliance the donington had got bigger windows and brittanialike trim but between them the expanded duple group were building not only the brittania and the donington but also the viscount and the seagull  the differences were not just skindeep either all the duple bodies had steelreinforced hardwood frames also plaxtons structural method the loughboroughbuilt donington and viscount both used framesections made from rolled steel tubes whilst burlinghams bodies like those of harrington and yeates were of jigbuilt aluminium plaxton had refined the panorama with subtler detailing and inward sloping pillars above the waistrail for the  season like harrington they also offered a more conservative option in their case an embassy body with twice as many side windows a more conservative option definitely wasnt yeates style instead they introduced a more radical one if the europa was insufficiently inyourface they could offer you the fiesta now with trapezoid glazing yeates was always going to be a minority choice and as yeates sold everyone elses coachwork their core business being dealership perhaps they wanted it that way  proved though that on the premium chassis harrington was now second only to plaxton although duple vastly outstripped either and the burlingham operation they now owned in the market for lightweight daytrip coaches during  the legal maximum width and length limits for buses and coaches was relaxed new maxima were  ft by  ft ½in to take effect from january   leyland and aec had suitable models on the stocks by the end of the year whilst continuing production of the shorterwheelbase models these could legally carry a slightly longer body than  ft and the first season cavalier delivered in december  a repeat order for keith coaches of aylesbury on reliance was the first cavalier  so called because it was  ft in longer than the previous model which enabled harrington to fit  of its own seats into the coach rather than the previous maximum of  duple and plaxton had offered a seat plan within the older length limits but their seats were a bit skimpier on padding and even so came close to infringing legal minimum length requirements during  the original cavalier was still offered as was the cavalier  to the new maximum length the  carried most of its extra length in a longer first side window whilst the  ft version had this plus an extra shallower window just aft of the first bay which unlike the rest of the side glazing had a horizontal lower edge the waistrail now resuming its dip at the third bay this saved on the cost of extra tooling and made the cavalier a truly modular range of coach bodies although it certainly did not look that way the longer first bay window to the same depth as the windscreen and with a forward sloping pillar made the front of the  coach look better balanced although the longer version was not as happy as the extended panorama tending to look slightly droopy it neither looked as fussy as blackpools continental or addlestones castillian nor was it quite as distracting as the europa or fiesta at the new length harringtons cleverness in construction was necessary for as well as three variants of the cavalier old shoreham road had to find space for car and minibus conversion work production of mark  crusader and bus bodies on aec reliance and albion nimbus chassis it was perhaps good news that maidstone and district had finally been weaned off the wayfarer mark  and that model could be buried after a good innings still the end of the wayfarer mark  meant that the less timid customers would be wanting something more up to date than even the revised cavalier also plans came from luton for a bedford chassis for the new maximum length market sector this was going to be radical in concept and not suitable to the cavalier outline nor that of any cavalier mark  still less would it suit an extended crusader so not only was the factory floor busy so were the designers in the drawing office  salesedit in its final year the  foot cavalier sold  all on reliance maidstone  district took ten south wales two and trent motor traction another bet firm took  one of which was a replacement body on an accidentsalvaged chassis built in   of the  ft in version were sold all to existing customers in the bet group southdown took  more leopards greenslades had three reliances and thomas brothers of port talbot added a further reliance of the independents gliderways took another tiger cub keith of aylesbury harris of greys and summerbees of southampton took more reliances a further reliance was sold to stanley hughes the bradford dealer who leased it for the  season to wallace arnold coaches of leeds as well as these  short cavaliers a further  of the  foot model were sold harrington also soldoff rnj the original cavalier demonstrator replacing it with a foot reliance  registered vpm which in turn was sold in  to hall bros of south shields there were two different sorts of long aec reliance the  type mu used the litre engine of the shorter version at a peak rating of  bhp whilst the  type u used a litre  bhp engine as in the export aec regal vi chassis southdown chose two  seater leopards to the new length whilst greenslades added to its collection of cavaliers with three reliance s and a new bet customer was neath and cardiff coaches with two long reliance s seating the maximum  the independent buyers of the cavalier  in its first season placing repeat orders for the style were abbot ellen smith yelloway and hawkey of newquay and new cavalier customers included greygreen hudson of horncastle ayres of dover liss  district in hampshire and straws of leicester formerly a plaxton loyalist grey green had its first foot cavalier on express service a month after the length was legal the benefits of longer coaches were clearer for express services than for tours especically tours to more remote scenic areas yelloways  footers had an option peculiar to the operator of additional destination displays over the second and fourth nearside windows for express work there was also an optional destination box in the roof dome as well as yelloway grey green were among the operators who specified this fifty seven cavaliers sold new was exactly half the  performance but the coach market was in a downturn in comparison duple sold only nineteen britannias on short reliances and four on short leopard two of the aecs and one leopard had oldfashioned central entrances blackpool built no further seagull s but built  of its  ft duple northern continental on reliances  on leopard including six for ribble and one royal tiger worldmaster a cancelled export order for happiways of manchester  salesedit in the  season the cavalier faced internal competition from the grenadier see below but  of the  ft in version and  of the  ft were sold existing customers who placed repeat orders for the short cavalier were southdown  leopard l greenslades another reliance grey greens orders included a short reliance and ten leopard l and harris of greys summerbee of southampton and mcintyre of aberdeen all took further reliances harris being a rebody of a  chassis damaged in an accident new customers for the  ft in cavalier were munden of bristol leopard l and crump of pinner reliance a new option was fixed side glazing and forced ventilation southdown having this on its leopards all but one of the bet customers for the long cavalier had taken the style before neath and cardiff had two reliance  and east yorkshire four leopard psu ribble had  on leopard psu with the new forced ventialation option the other three were for a newly acquired ribble subsidiary scout motor services of preston to the same specification as the ribble examples grey green had one leopard psu and one reliance  the latter with forced ventilation the other repeat orders from independents were from yelloway who took  reliance  with the jetvent system as well as the additional side destination screens and ellen smith also of rochdale with a leopard fitted with  reclining seats yelloway standardising on this luxurious option on its reliances the short ones seating only  as a result new purchasers of the cavalier  in its second season were anglocontinental of tunbridge wells  reliance  valliant of ealing  reliance  and regent of redditch with a single reliance  in  duple had three new styles for underfloorengined chassis the alpine continental was a longerwindowed version of the continental whilst the dragonfly was a  ft central entrance coach both were built at blackpool the latter having a steel reinforced hardwood body frame for the shorter aecs and leylands the britannia was finally replaced by the hendonbuilt commodore which was a modification of the mass market bella vista body being  ft in longer with a front entrance and a maximum capacity of  total continentalalpine continental sales were  while only six dragonflies were built two leyland demonstrators on leopard and four for bet coach operator samuelson of victoria the commodore was also a sales disappointment eight reliance and three leopard l being sold willowbrook however were gaining expresscoach orders for its version of the betstandard single decker in coach form four main bays were fitted as was fixed glazing and forced ventilation and there was an optional solid coach door and brighwork grille marshall and weymann also built bet style express coaches in contrast plaxton had a further revised panorama with barely perceptible waist curvature and only three main side window bays on the  ft body the dome was refined and thinner trim strips were used producing a body of unusual restraint for a plaxton it was an instant sales success ribble for one placing large orders another competitive body was alexander y type first shown in  which in coach form had four trapezoid windows on each straightwaisted side and double curvature glazing front and rear as well as selling massively to the scottish bus group bet fleets who took the style from  were north western and east midland followed in later seasons by trent potteries the northern general group hebble yorkshire traction yorkshire woolen and stratford blue whilst three independents purchased the style over its lifetime scottish cooperative wholsale society had four reliances venture of consett took  reliances and  leopards with eight more on order when northern took them over whilst premier travel of cambridge had sixteen on reliance bet favoured steeltube body framing and as introduced the y type featured this alexanders reverting to aluminum framework from   sales and totalsedit the  season short cavaliers for bet fleets greenslades  reliance and devon general grey cars  reliance were notable in being to  ft in width and having grenadier style dash panels grey green took eleven leopard l crump of pinner took another reliance and hutchings  cornelius with one reliance became the last new customer for the cavalier  of the short version were built in its final season there were eleven of the longer version six were for yelloway on reliance  grey green took four leopard psu valliant of ealing had two reliance  and ellen smith took a seat leopard psu the only bet customer was thomas brothers of port talbot with a seat reliance  in  yelloway took the last six foot cavaliers on reliance  in all  cavaliers had been built one  ft demonstrator one  ft and  coaches sold of which  were  ft   ft in and   ft there were   ft cavaliers sold plus a demonstrator on aec reliance mu chassis  on leyland leopard lt seven on leyland tiger cub psuct and six on albion aberdonian mrl cavalier  sales totalled  reliances and  leopards cavalier  sales comprised  leopard psu  reliance  u and  reliance  mu plus the demonstrator which was sold after a year to hall bros of south shields who became a loyal grenadier customer the grenadier an apotheosisedit to supplement the cavalier for the  season the grenadier was introduced initially available on the longer chassis it was outwardly similar but a tauterlooking body the structure was similar but the glazing was revised employing one fewer window per side and dipping less toward the rear a larger windscreen was fitted with a more prominent peak only the rear glass was carried over from the cavalier revised front and rear grp mouldings were employed that at the front accenting the horizontal and carrying a larger destination box that at the rear having horizontal rather than vertical light clusters the forcedventilation set up was standard intakes for it being fitted in the front peak rather than in plaxtonstyle airscoops on the roof these changes adding further to the cleanliness of line the bright trim was of a similar layout to that of the cavalier the skirt mouldings being carried over virtually unchanged although roof quarter glazing was a common option on cavaliers the less rounded roofline of the grenadier ensured grenadiers with this option were rare  salesedit the first two grenadiers were a reliance  for harris of greys and a leopard psu for grey green both of which were shown at the  earls court commercial motor show in the initial season a further  ft reliance  went to abbott of blackpool two leopards to gliderways of smethwick five to northern general the only bet order and a unique  ft grenadier went to hawkey of newquay on a reliance  with specially reduced front and rear overhangs it was registered saf and sat   salesedit for the  season a  ft in option for the shorter chassis was introduced  of these went to six bet companies and seven independents previous harrington customers were north western southdown trent and timpson of catford southdown specified the dash panels of the cavalier on their batch the return of north western was maybe a surprise as they were a major supporter of the m alexander y type but they obviously wanted something shorter and a bit classier for their extended tours their two leopard l had illuminated offside and nearside name badges under the second bay the two new bet customers were western welsh and black  white motorways of cheltenham both taking short reliances straw of leicester had previously taken the cavalier and specified a cavalier dash on its reliance conquest sales for the short grenadier in the independent sector were to jones of aberbeeg birch brothers and motorways overseas both of london roman city of bath and wye valley of hereford the first three operators took reliances and the latter two tiger cubs roman citys was a rebodied  exribble coach whilst wye valleys two new examples had  coach seats not possible using harrington seats so plaxton seats were purchased and fitted for the long grenadier there was only one bet purchaser maidstone  district taking five reliance  boac took two of the same for its glasgowprestwick airport service the independent buyers were abbott of blackpool barton transport ltd bermuda of nuneaton gliderways hall brothers of south shields jones keith of aylesbury and motorways overseas of the  built  were on leopards all  reliances were of the  type bartons   vrr having cavalier type windscreens and a roof mounted destination box as well as air operation for the coach door enabling use as a bus hall bros

grenadierbodied reliances keith coaches had pp whilst the first of maidstone  district’s carried d a change to legal regulations to come into effect from  required additional emergency exits on bodies seating more than  on the grenadier  the offside first bay just aft of the drivers window was to be fitted with a tophinged exit door for its final two seasons edit southdown headed the bet list for short grenadiers taking another ten to its style on leopard l north western had a further three l and samuleson of victoria their garage is now the arrivals terminal for victoria coach station took four l the other bet purchasers chose the reliance timpson of catford taking four and their subsidiary bourne  balmer of croydon taking two private sector customers were on leopard grey green  and jones aberbeeg  ekcersley of st helens took a grenadier body on a reconditioned  tiger cub chassis whilst gliderways had two new tiger cubs the rest were on reliance bowen of birmingham had three and

headed by barton transport whose  featured a destination box below the windscreen in lieu of the illuminated name badge allowing the fitment of a standard grenadier windscreen but they retained the power doors they were registered bvoc and featured reliance ura airsuspended chassis a very rare option on the home market the only other airsprung chassis to receive harrington bodies were the

 ft version was on a modified reliance ura the legionnaireedit main article harrington legionnaire during  vauxhall motors told british coachbuilders about their new design to be produced from the end of  the bedford val was a twinsteering chassis with a long front overhang designed for an entrance ahead of the steering axles a unique feature of the type was that the wheels were only inch in diameter which in turn reduced the floor height of bodied examples the radiator was mounted at the front and immediately behind it was the  bhp leyland o engine the harrington legionnaire was a squarerigged body with straight waistrail and five deep windows per side one less than the duple vega major and one more than the plaxton val it also differed from the cavalier and grenadier by having plated window surrounds there was a large brightwork grille and twin headlights a grenadier style front windscreen was used with a similar sized one at the rear above the windscreen was a destination box or illuminated nameboard and above that a prominent peak at the rear the illuminated nameboard was inside the rear glass and this was fitted the other way about to the front meaning the first and last pillars had a pronounced forward rake to them whilst all the others were vertical the cantrail was flat above it was a roof section of very shallow curvature the mark two which followed in  for the final two seasons omitted this flat cantrail and had a roof of compound curvature which reduced the tall square effect of the original but reduced space in the overhead luggage racks the legionnaire was built on the bedford val the more conventional ford thames  and there were also two specials on guy victory trambus chassis the legionnaire took its fame from the  film the italian job the ending of the film involves a mkii legionnaire alr b hanging over a cliff in the alps as the driver had taken the coach into a skid and lost control a remake model can be seen at the de la warr pavilion art gallery the harrington societyedit many harrington vehicles buses coaches cars and miniature coaches survive ranging from a late s leyland to cavaliers grenadiers and five legionnaires
