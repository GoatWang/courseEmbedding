approved fridaythe merger puts atts john stankey in a new role as ceo of att entertainment  internet services where he will run both directv and atts home solutions operations stankey talked to usa today tech columnist edward c baig about what the deal means for att and for consumerscomments were edited for space and clarityusa today what is your vision for the new companystankey the simple vision is we want customers to take their premium entertainment experience and enjoy it anywhere our job as a company that provides connectivity whether its fixed or mobile is to make sure that they have that portabilitynobody else has the kind of toolset and breath that we now havescaled content world class mobile network broadband network the technical compatibilities to take all that out over an ip infrastructure thats the big strategic thrustand then theres the basic blocking and tackling thrust to take two big companies and get the benefits of being able to leverage product distribution remove redundancies between the two businesses and make it more cost efficient and more effective that ultimately generates more cash and when that cash is generated it will allow us to plow it back into building fiber and broadbandusa today will there be changes in brandingstankey youll see us of course start to move to make sure that people know that directv is part of the att family and youll see us evolving the branding over time our goal is to make sure that customers think about their entertainment with their connectivityusa today back when deal was announced att said it could take  to  months for new robust wireless offerings is that still the casestankey theres good news and bad news the bad news is that it took a long time to get this merger thing approved probably longer than it should the good news is that it gives you a little time to think about what you want to do and you should probably expect weeks from now youre going to start to see things in the market that will represent the integration and togetherness of those products im not going to tell you today what the price is and what those products are but they will be out there and i think youll be surprised by how fast we move out there weve had  months to think about it and  months within the bounds of the law to do some planningusa today will uverse and directv coexiststankey we sold to different customer bases theres some overlap in the markets but we played to the bundle game with uverse by consolidating product offerings directtv played to people who wanted to buy standalone video we now can start to cross market products and services over the long haul our goal is offer one video product in the market with one video channel lineup one set of programming relationships one video brandto do that we have to do integration work of the technical platforms i wouldnt think about it as one going away or the other one going away its about how the two of them arrive at a new place thats better building that new platform is going to take us  to  months our goal is if youre a consumer of ours today that this transition is done in way that is evolutionary and noninvasive this new platform is very software centric well be able to bring the customer new features and services incrementallyusa today does this deal change atts views on net neutrality or its open internet policystankey were still in favor of an open internet and still supportive of rules around nondiscrimination of traffic our issue is with title ii its not about whether we think the internet should be open and fair we think title ii is a regulatory overreach and it adds a degree of uncertainty into an investment marketplace when the fcc at any time can choose to reach in and reset the rules or regulate price or change performance metrics that create problems for consistency in business models this transaction doesnt change anything about our challenge around thatfcc approves atts acquisition of directvusa today what kind of clout does the directv deal give attstankey i think it s nice to be able to play in a league thats closer to what a vertically integrated comcast can play in we dont own content like they doour situation is we at least have volume scale it is important to generate returns to invest in fiber and bring more broadband to customers but we also want that ability so that we can go start working with the people who have the really attractive content to build these new distribution models if youre talking about  million homes that buy video — traditional linear video — and  million high quality handsets and customers that are out there many of whom have smartphones thats a whole other opportunity to distribute content that will allow us to do something with these guys that others who dont have this whole set of vertically integrated capabilities—home broadband mobile great tv product etc — can dousa today how does this benefit consumersstankey the fcc believed that another player in the market that had some scale would help to suppress the increase thats going on in rates so i think consumers are going to see an economic valueusa today big mergers often bring job loss to the new company what do you expectstankey obviously theres going to be some functions that are going to be redundant when you put two large businesses together like this theres two treasury organizations and two legal organizations but this is about us growing broadband and video share and making this business more competitive that growth is going to be really good for employees who are in operating roles when youre growing you need more technicians and more people to talk to customers on the phone and you do more investment with it so the vast majority of folks are going to have more than enough work to do over the next several months and years to get this business operating right aside from some of the corporate overheads that were going to have to manage

issued in november  and reissued at monthly intervals for the next  years the company produces numerous catalogues covering different countries regions and specialisms many of them are reissued annually the catalogues list all known adhesive postage stamp issues and include prices for used and unused stamps unlike other dealers catalogues stanley gibbons state that their catalogue is a retail price list in other words if they had that exact stamp in stock in the exact condition specified the current catalogue price is the price that they would charge for it this contrasts with most other catalogues which are produced by firms that do not sell stamps and therefore base their pricing on an average of market values in the country where the catalogue is published in practice the actual price charged by stanley gibbons for an individual stamp may be different from the catalogue price because the specimen for sale is of a different grade the market conditions have changed since the catalogue was produced the firm has a plentiful or restricted supply of that stamp or for a variety of other reasons magazinesedit gibbons stamp monthly gibbons stamp monthly is a magazine that

investment departmentedit since around  the company has actively offered stamps as investments and has set up a special office in guernsey for this activity the company had offered a similar service in the early s on a small scale sales of investment products have been strong in asia and the middle east and through the companys email database however sales in the united kingdom have been hampered by the fact that the companys philatelic investment products are not regulated by the uk financial services authority and therefore uk financial institutions and financial advisers have been reluctant to recommend the products as investors would not enjoy the same level of protection they receive when investing in regulated products gibbons have stated that they intend to launch a regulated investment fund in order to overcome this obstacle as recently as  the companys attitude to philatelic investment was that stamps were purely a hobby many in the stamp business still had unpleasant memories of the excesses of the s bubble some financial advisers and stamp dealers have doubted the wisdom of investing in stamps due to the relatively high prices charged by stanley gibbons compared to other dealers and the experience of the s when many investors lost out after a speculative bubble in stamps burst the relatively high initial costs have also provoked comment estimated at not less than  compared with less than  for many retail mutual fund type investments gibbons have responded by emphasising the high quality of their items and the longterm nature of their investment
