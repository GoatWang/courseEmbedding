this  biotech stock is a strong buy for   catalyst pharmaceutical partners inc nasdaqcprx  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»catalyst pharmaceuticals why this  biotech stock is a strong buy for jan   about catalyst pharmaceutical cprx hawkinvest value growth at reasonable price contrarian growthsummaryits a great time of year to buy beatendown small cap stocks that could rebound in january since taxloss selling is overbiotech and healthcare stocks might be one of the best sectors to buy because this group has been hit by election year politicscatalyst pharmaceuticals stock appears deeply undervalued based on the pipeline and the strong balance sheetthis company has about half its market cap in cash and strong potential for firdapse approval in  which could generate  million plus in annual revenueswith the stock trading at just over  per share and a recent analyst price target being set at  this suggests potential upside of about over the past several weeks stocks that have underperformed in  were getting hit even harder due to taxloss selling short sellers also hit certain stocks hard and many of them could be eager to cover their positions in early  since that means they can put off paying taxes for another year and also probably pay less tax under a trump administration these tax related factors are quite predictable and therefore it makes sense to look for stocks that could rebound in january since taxloss selling is over as well as to look for stocks that could see a potential short covering rally in the new year with the market rally we have seen since the election it is not easy to find bargains in wellknown and largecap stocks however it is possible to find undervalued stocks if you look at smallcap and low priced stocks that are off the radar for most investors and even many analysts biotech and healthcare stocks underperformed in  and that means this is a sector that could offer value and rebound potential in  with all of this in mind i have been looking for hidden gems in the biotech sector i have recently found a couple of very interesting investment opportunities that offer an excellent risk to reward ratio and one of the stocks i am bullish on now is catalyst pharmaceuticals inc nasdaqcprx as we can see from the chart below  was not a great year for the stock however it has clearly formed a solid base around the  level and that could be the foundation along with other upcoming pipeline catalysts in the coming months for a return to a much higher share price in  the pipeline catalyst pharmaceutical partners inc is a small biotech company that is developing specialty drugs which target rare neurological diseases and disorders its lead pipeline candidate is known as firdapse amifampridine phosphate this is for the treatment of lambert eaton myasthenic syndrome or lems which is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disorder lems causes the body to attack itself and interferes with the communication between the nerve and muscle cells as a result people afflicted with this disease suffer from severe muscle weakness and fatigue firdapse is the first and only approved drug in europe for the symptomatic treatment of lems firdapse has received breakthrough therapy designation from the us food and drug administration or fda the company recently enrolled its first patient for a second firdapse phase  study and it expects clinical results and to file for approval with the fda sometime in  the company is also looking to expand the potential of firdapse and it is currently in phase  trials to treat myasthenia gravis and congenital myasthenic syndrome this company is also developing cpp to treat infantile spasms epilepsy tourettes and other neurological disorders cpp has been granted us orphan drug designation for the treatment of infantile spasms by the fda it has also been granted orphan medicinal product designation in the european union for the treatment of west syndrome catalyst pharmaceuticals is also working to develop a generic version of sabril vigabatrin which is used to treat spasms and seizures the graphic below is sourced from the catalyst pharmaceuticals website and it shows the status of the pipeline why this stock was down in  but could be poised for a major reversal in  in  this stock was trading for over  per share at the start of  the stock was trading at just above  per share but then came a fairly sharp market correction in january and february later on in  the company received a refusal to file letter from the fda for firdapse which also put selling pressure on the stock this created a delay and meant the fda wanted more data before it would approve firdapse for north america the company has since worked with the fda and has finalized a study protocol with that agency that is expected to provide the data needed so that firdapse can be approved in  basically the refusal to file letter earlier this year caused a delay and there was a lack of other significant positive catalysts in  then the market also took a negative tone towards the entire biotech sector due to election year politics the last quarter of  was full of politicians talking about price controls for drugs then almost as soon as the election was over in november taxloss selling began and that has also taken a toll on catalyst pharmaceuticals and other stocks in this sector short sellers have also contributed to the downward pressure but i believe shorts could actually become a positive and help to drive this stock higher in early  heres why it is clear this stock has bottomed out and now it might be poised to rebound since the taxloss selling officially ended last week with this stock trading for less than half of the week high which is  per share many short sellers have large gains in this stock just as some shareholders were selling before the end of  in order to get taxloss benefits many short sellers are also probably making strategic tax decisions if i shorted this stock when it was trading at  or more per share i would have very significant gains and i would not want to cover my short position until early january  by waiting to cover in early january i could defer paying taxes on these big gains for a whole extra year but with trumps election victory i have another big motivating factor to delay covering a short position and that is because the trump administration is expected to enact significant tax cuts in  i think the motivation for short sellers to postpone taxes on gains for another year plus the incentive to hold off on covering until early january in order to potentially pay less in taxes under trump has created a situation whereby many shorts may now cover and possibly create a shortcovering rally according to shortsqueezecom over  million shares are currently short and the average daily trading volume for catalyst pharmaceuticals is about  shares that means the short interest is equivalent to over  days worth of average trading volume that is clearly enough to potentially create significant buying pressure if shorts start to cover i also think this stock could see increased buying pressure along with many other stocks in the biotech sector as investors start the year looking to rotate into laggards that could offer better value especially since financials and energy stocks have rallied so much in recent weeks a strategic licensing deal and investment made by biomarin pharmaceuticals is notable catalyst pharmaceuticals has some notable strategic partnerships in connection with firdapse amifampridine phosphate biomarin pharmaceutical inc nasdaqbmrn has made a licensing deal and a  million investment into catalyst pharmaceuticals biomarin shares trade for about  and the company has a market capitalization of over  billion biomarins annual revenues are just over  billion so this stock trades for about  times revenues i think it is a very positive sign that such a significant company would show the interest to license and invest in a much smaller firm catalyst pharmaceuticals also has strategic partnerships with northwestern university new york university and the feinstein institute for medical research the revenue potential for firdapse in north america is estimated at  million annually approval of firdapse by the fda in  has the potential to transform catalyst pharmaceuticals from being a clinical stage company and turn it into a commercialstage company with a significant revenue stream clearly this potential is not yet priced into the stock but i believe it will be once the company gets closer to completing its phase  trials the other significant upside factor in  is that the company is currently in phase  trials for treating myasthenia gravis and congenital myasthenic syndrome or cms which would significantly expand the potential for firdapse according to catalyst pharmaceuticals firdapse could generate  million in annual revenues and possibly more if other indications are added the company states assuming the north american market is similar to the eu market on lems prevalence firdapse® adoption and pricing catalyst believes that the potential peak revenue opportunity in the north american market for firdapse® could be about  million annually potential upside to the north american market estimate could be driven by more favorable pricing in the us than in the eu and possible expansion into myasthenia gravis us prevalence of  andor congenital myasthenic syndrome us prevalence of  both of which are also cns orphan indications insiders and other smart money investors have bought shares in catalyst pharmaceuticals when investing in any stock especially a biotech that could have significant upside potential i really want to see that management owns a meaningful stake far too often i see management that is either selling stock or a ceo that owns little to no shares if a biotech truly has significant potential there is no way the ceo would not want to own a meaningful stake it is great to see that management at catalyst pharmaceuticals owns about  of the company the ceo and cofounder of the company is patrick j mcenany and he owns about  million shares several other members of management own stakes that range from around  shares on down to between  to about  shares each when this stock was trading for over  per share in  the ceo could have sold some or cashed in on all of it for over  million  million shares times  per share but he did not do this and that seems to indicate he is in this for the long haul and possibly for a much higher share price in the future as this company moves toward becoming a commercialstage biotech firm a number of highly successful hedge and mutual funds are also currently invested in catalyst pharmaceuticals broadfin capital llc owns nearly  of the company with a stake of  million shares this is a very significant amount and it is one where any fund manager would probably have done exhaustive research and due diligence on the company the pipeline and the management team before investing such a large sum baker brothers advisors llc which is a wellknown fund that specializes in biotech investments owns over  million shares as an expert investing in biotech companies baker brothers has significant knowledge and experience with this sector as well as a history of finding biotech investments that offer major upside the mutual fund giant vanguard group owns nearly  million shares i also think it is worth noting that point asset management which is run by hedge fund billionaire steven a cohen he also cofounded the famed hedge fund known as sac capital advisors owns nearly  million shares in catalyst pharmaceuticals this is not a big investment for a firm that manages many billions of dollars however the fact that this fund has decided to buy any shares in such a small biotech firm is significant because it is not likely they would take the time to research a small company like catalyst pharmaceuticals and make any investment unless they saw significant upside potential the insider direct holders and just a few of the top institutional

capital llc  sep     baker brothers advisors llc  sep     vanguard group inc the  sep     point asset management lp  sep     a low cash burn rate also reduces risks for investors many clinical biotech companies lose tens of millions of dollars in every quarter but that is not the case here on november   catalyst pharmaceuticals reported a gaap net loss of  or  cents per share for the third quarter the management at this company runs a very tight ship in terms of expenses and this greatly reduces potential downside risks a very low burn rate makes this stock more compelling and with about  million in cash and a recent cash burn rate of around  million per quarter this company has sufficient cash resources to last for quite a few quarters in the press release for the third quarter the ceo patrick j mcenany also summarized some of the recent progress this company has made he stated over the last few months we have continued to execute our development strategy for firdapse® amifampridine phosphate and further our mission to serve the lems and cms patient communities we were pleased by our recent receipt of a special protocol assessment agreement with the fda for the protocol design clinical endpoints and statistical analysis approach to be taken in our upcoming second phase  study evaluating firdapse for the symptomatic treatment of lems we believe that our receipt of the spa provides us with a clearly defined development and regulatory pathway to complete the development of this product we were also gratified to have been granted orphan drug designation for firdapse for the treatment of myasthenia gravis finally we have launched our new website to make it easier for patients to access information about obtaining firdapse at no cost through our expanded access program which is another step in our continuing efforts to serve lems and cms patients q and recent highlights reached agreement on a special protocol assessment nysespa with the fda for second phase  clinical trial evaluating firdapse for the treatment of lamberteaton myasthenic syndrome lems firdapse granted orphan drug designation by the fda for the treatment of myasthenia gravis launched new website for its expanded access program publication of cpp clinical efficacy data for infantile spasms in epilepsy  behavior case reports ended q with  million in cash and investments and no debt heres why potential downside risks appear very limited at this time i have been watching this stock closely for the past few months and i was very intrigued but i wanted to wait to buy it until after the taxloss selling pressure was over that is because small company stocks can experience potential liquidity risks especially if a large shareholder or fund decides to sell a big position at the end of the year for tax reasons but now that taxloss selling pressure is no longer a risk and that is one reason i am buying shares now furthermore this stock has clearly been building a solid base at just above  per share and it has even been trending a bit higher from the lows it hit in may of  in terms of the companyspecific fundamentals it also appears that the potential downside risks are very limited at this time especially with the stock trading for just over  per share stocks that trade at this level usually have terrible upsidedown balance sheets that are ridden with debt and have little cash but that is not the case here catalyst pharmaceuticals has absolutely no debt and nearly  million cash in the bank that is equivalent to  cents per share in cash which is remarkable and greatly reduces risks especially for a stock that trades for just over  finally i also believe the pipeline risk is limited because this company has more than one clinical trial going right now and its candidates could be suitable for multiple indications the other reason i think this is a much lower risk biotech stock is because its lead candidate firdapse is already approved and on the market generating millions of dollars in revenues for biomarin pharmaceuticals in europe once the phase  trials that are based on the fda approved study protocols are complete firdapse could receive fda approval for north america in  that would transform catalyst pharmaceuticals into a commercialstage biotech company with an fda approved drug that could generate  million or more in annual revenues this would be a game changer for the company and the share price especially since the current market cap is just below  million most biotech firms sell for many multiples of their annual revenues and that could mean significant upside for this littleknown stock as mentioned above biomarin pharmaceuticals trades for  times revenues if catalyst pharmaceuticals gets the same valuation and  million in annual revenues with firdapse that would equate to potential market capitalization of  billion or around  per share however it could take three to four years after firdapse is approved and launched for sales to potentially reach the  million mark the macro view looks bullish as a biotech rebound seems likely in  there are companyspecific reasons why this stock could have a great  but the macro environment could also boost the share price biotech and healthcare stocks were laggards in  due to election campaign rhetoric and other politicians trying to score points with voters these sectors are now some of the most undervalued in the stock market and could be poised for a catch up rally in  recent analyst price target of  suggests major upside potential on october   analysts at piper jaffray upgraded this stock from neutral to overweight and set a  price target that would suggest upside of roughly  from current levels and it would get the stock back towards the  to  range it was trading at in  i believe this analyst is looking forward into  and sees that with potential clinical results and the approval of firdapse in north america investors will begin to bid up this stock in anticipation of these expected events in summary with taxloss selling over and the potential for short sellers to cover in early  for their own tax reasons it makes strategic sense to realize this stock has bottomed out and consider the upside potential this company has a cashrich balance sheet and zero debt which greatly reduces potential downside risks it also appears to have significant upside potential and relatively limited risk based on the fact that firdapse is already approved in europe and could get fda approval in  with potential revenues that are estimated at  million annually for firdapse and other indications that could be approved and boost this even further catalyst pharmaceuticals could become a commercial stage biotech firm in  the potential downside risks look very limited at this time especially with the stock trading at just over  that is providing us with an excellent risk to reward ratio since the company has upside catalysts in  and an analyst price target of  per share which suggests this stock is deeply undervalued i think this stock will get back to trading in the range of  to  in january and that this rebound will be fueled by the end of taxloss selling and short covering as well as buying in the biotech sector by bargain hunters as the company gets closer to completing phase  trials and potential fda approval for firdapse a move towards the analyst price target of  appears reasonable i have found a couple of other stocks that could be poised for a significant rebound into january and i plan to write about those very

in dec  in fact the company reached an agreement with the fda under a special protocol assessment spa for protocol design clinical endpoints and statistical analysis in october topline data from the study is anticipated in the second half of  consequently positive outcome from the study would allow the company to resubmit the new drug application nda for firdapse for the treatment of lems in the

of muskantibody positive mg in feb   in mar  catalyst reported topline data from the phase iiiii trial catalyst’s efforts to develop firdapse appear encouraging given the significant commercial potential in its target markets we believe an approval would give a huge boost to the companylems is an ultrarare disease and catalyst estimates approximately  lems patients in the us the market therefore represents significant potential even though drugs and treatments like steroids azathioprine other immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulin are in use at present additionally guanidine hcl tablets are approved for the treatment of lems however due to significant side effects the drug is not viewed as an effective treatment anymore as a result  this has created ample space for introducing new therapies for lemscatalyst is exploring the possibility of developing cpp a gaba aminotransferase inhibitor for the treatment of epilepsy initially infantile spasms and the treatment of other selected neurological indications such as complex partial seizures and tourette’s disorder nevertheless the company is highly dependent on firdapse for growth with a limited number

condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the

progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care
