management is a hub function so we interact with sales marketing engineering operations customer support and just about every organization at the company we spend a lot of time in the field with customers so we can understand what they need from us on a daytoday basis and what will help them strategically in the future we take a holistic perspective and because we know the product so intimately we’re granted the opportunity and authority to make big decisions about tradeoffs and the direction we think is best“we spend a lot of time in the field with customers so we can understand what they need”our team is responsible for the product management of all everbridge suite products technology partnerships user experience and cross functional program management in particular user experience and product management are tightly associated at everbridge all our product requirements originate from a customer vision and naturally that’s driven by user experience design and researchhow have your responsibilities changed since you started with the companyas everbridge has grown we have increased our product portfolio significantly adding five new products over the last four years we have expanded our product line both organically and through acquisitions in addition the importance of technology partnerships and integration with our industry ecosystem has grown significantly which has increased the value of our solutions and our platform we now integrate with lots of different kinds of systems including hr bcm and itsm systems as well as physical access

contributor to the company’s growth and the evidence is our recent ipo — that is pretty excitingwhat challenges are you working on right nowour biggest challenge currently is managing our growth and integrating new products and capabilities we’re delivering products at an increasing pace so putting all those pieces together and making the right choices is a fun challengewhat does success look like for you and your teamour biggest sense of satisfaction comes when customers like our products and derive real value from them for example our product recently helped locate an elderly person with alzheimer’s they were safely returned to their home very quickly“our product recently helped locate an elderly person with alzheimer’s”on a larger scale the state of florida used everbridge to share information with citizens and coordinate teams during hurricane matthew we’re helping people communicate and collaborate when unfortunate situations arise it’s gratifying to be part of the solutioncan you provide an example of how customer feedback has influenced a productsure our customers’ input has a significant influence on all of our products the most recent example is our safety connection product we learned that during terrorist attacks — in paris istanbul etc — our corporate customers didn’t really know where their people were at the time of those attacks our customers needed ways to more accurately locate people for “duty of care” purposes“the notion of a static office address is no longer sufficient for keeping people safe”our world is mobile people are working remotely they’re traveling maybe they’re alone maybe they’re away from their desk on a large campus the notion of a static office address is no longer sufficient for keeping people safe we put a lot of effort into solving for that problem in our safety connection product working very closely with our customerson the other side of the coin we learned from working with our state and local government customers that a static address is very important to them think about a forest fire or catastrophic flood keeping people safe for evacuation purposes relies on very accurate geocoded addresseshow do you decide that a company and role is right for youi’ve been involved in a range of organizations from startups to large companies like ibm there are three magic ingredients i considerfirst is the company’s product something i’m interested in working at everbridge means having an impact on critical and lifesaving events that’s a meaningful and exciting challengesecond is the technology interesting i love the technology at everbridge because we’re a full saasoriented product we have great mobile technology and we continue to evolve to make sure we’re always cutting edge“i have the utmost respect for my team members i learn something from them every single day”the third thing which is super important is the team when i look around am i inspired by the people i work with at everbridge i totally am i’ve worked with some of the executive team before and i chose to work with them again but it’s not just my management colleagues and jamie ellertson the ceo — it’s the people in the product management organization i have the utmost respect for my team members i learn something from them every single day and i hope i’m lifting them up toohow did you get into project management in the first placei got into product management in a roundabout fashion my background is electrical engineering and after a couple of years working on chip technology i took a detour into sales engineering and sales positions from there i realized i liked software and wanted to get closer to products and technology again my trajectory was from hardware to software from sales to marketing and then to product management i also branched out from product management occasionally i did business development at ibm and i’ve also managed engineeringall those experiences helped me grow as a product manager i know what it’s like to stand in front of a customer who wants a product to do something it doesn’t currently do i understand some of the challenges of motivating an engineering team i have learned how large corporations conduct mergers and acquisitions every time i’ve veered away from product management it’s been useful but all roads have led me back it really is my passionwhat advice would you give someone considering or just starting a career in product managementget experience in customerfacing roles you can learn technology but understanding how to interpret customer and market needs is critical it’s not just listening to what a customer or the market thinks is cool and what they say they want it’s knowing what they really need and what they will buy“get experience in customerfacing roles understanding how to interpret customer and market needs is critical”you can show customers a rocket ship and they are likely to say “ooh that’s cool” and then if you tell your team “i’ve talked to ten customers and they all want a rocket ship” everyone will scramble to build a rocket ship but when you show it to the customers they say “oh we don’t have astronauts in our organization we really just need to ride around the block”if you had listened and given them a motorcycle they would have been happy they would have been like “that’s cool — it’s easy to use and i can zip around the block” it’s a silly analogy but it illustrates the importance of understanding what customers are really trying to achieve and engaging in a continual dialogue that’s why knowing how to ask the right questions is key and that mostly comes from experienceinterested in working with claudia and the rest of teameverbridge check out open positions herethe full version of this story originally appeared

helps large organizations — state and local governments banks hospitals universities and corporations — keep their constituents informed and safe in critical situations the company has added five new products to its platform in the last four years so claudia has had plenty to keep her busy from user research informing product roadmaps to overseeing key integrations in our conversation below she

time do you get to the office what time do you leave cd i get into the office at around  am and leave around  pm kc coffee or tea cd definitely coffee just one cup but it’s a big one kc once you get to the office what do you tackle first cd even before i arrive at the office i check my email and the news headlines i want to know what’s going on in the world because if there’s been a disaster it influences our product and its usage once in the office i usually try to focus first on something more strategic before the tactical realities of the day begin kc how do you organize your day to stay productive cd i’m an active note taker i like my handwritten todo lists i usually categorize them into things that are strategic things that are customerfacing and things that are smaller execution type things then i prioritize i also delegate as quickly as possible to get the right people involved kc how do you deal with stress cd spending time with family and friends laughing and telling jokes goes a long way and our multicultural rescue dog bess is a great stress reducer she puts everything into perspective very quickly i also have a number of hobbies yoga music and photography  everbridge
