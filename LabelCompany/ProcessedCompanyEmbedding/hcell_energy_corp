australian state of queensland   note   summary of significant accounting policies   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   accounts and retainage receivable   accounts receivable are recorded when invoices are issued and are presented in the balance sheet net of the allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the company’s historical losses the existing economic conditions in the construction industry and the financial stability of its customers accounts are written off as uncollectible after collection efforts have failed in addition the company does not generally charge interest on pastdue accounts or require collateral at june   and  there was no allowance for doubtful accounts required   property and equipment and depreciation    property and equipment are stated at cost depreciation is generally provided using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets leasehold improvements are amortized on a straightline basis over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement   repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the lives of the property and equipment are charged to expense as incurred   comprehensive income loss   comprehensive income loss consists of two

be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded in “costs and earnings in excess of billings” likewise contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded in “billings in excess of costs and earnings” construction costs of projects under contract include all direct material and labor costs and other direct costs related to contract performance changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed periodically changes in job performance job conditions estimated profitability and final contract settlements might result in revisions to costs and income that are recognized in the period in which the changes are disregarded estimated losses are recorded when identified   the use of the poc method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods the company continually evaluates all of the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the poc method of accounting because of inherent uncertainties in estimating costs it is at least reasonably possible

investment when implementing an hc system end users can receive an investment tax credit for the purchase of an hc system in addition if you are located in states or countries whose government
