graham trades actively in both us and foreign markets primarily in futures contracts forward contracts spot contracts and associated derivative instruments such as options and swaps graham engages in exchange for physical transactions which involve the exchange of a futures position for the underlying physical commodity without making an open competitive trade on an exchange graham at times will trade certain instruments as a substitute for futures or options traded on futures exchanges instruments and contracts not traded on any organized exchange may be entered into with banks brokerage firms or other financial institutions as counterparties systematic trading grahams trading systems rely primarily on technical rather than fundamental information as the basis for their trading decisions grahams systems are based on the expectation that they can over time successfully anticipate market events using quantitative mathematical models  pbth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th to determine their trading activities as opposed to attempting properly to forecast price trends using subjective analysis of supply and demand grahams core trading systems are primarily very long term in nature and are designed to participate selectively in potential profit opportunities that can occur during periods of sustained price trends in a diverse number of us and international markets the primary objective of the core trading systems is to establish positions in markets where the price action of a particular market signals the computerized systems used by graham that a potential trend in prices is occurring the systems are designed to analyze mathematically the recent trading characteristics of each market and statistically compare such characteristics to the longterm historical trading pattern of the particular market as a result of this analysis the systems will utilize proprietary risk management and trade filter strategies that are intended to benefit from sustained price trends while reducing risk and volatility exposure in addition to grahams core trading systems graham has developed various trading systems that are not true trendfollowing systems the graham selective trading program which was developed in  relies in part on a pattern recognition model based on volatility the nontrendbased program which was developed in  relies on macroeconomic and supply and demand data as the basis for its trading decisions and has the potential to perform in market conditions that are characterized by a lack of longterm trends discretionary trading the discretionary trading group was established at graham in february  unlike grahams systematic trading programs which are based almost entirely on computerized mathematical models the discretionary trading group determines its trades subjectively on the basis of personal assessment of trading data and trading experience one of the significant advantages grahams traders benefit from is grahams experience in systematic trading and trend identification this experience has proven helpful in enabling the discretionary trading group to take advantage of significant market trends when they occur and equally important the discretionary trading group has the potential to profit from trend reversals as well additionally graham makes available extensive technical and fundamental research resources to the discretionary trading group in an effort to improve its competitive performance edge over time graham believes the discretionary trading groups performance results generally are not highly correlated to the results of other discretionary traders or grahams systematic trading programs graham believes the discretionary trading group can generate successful performance results in trading range type markets where there are few longterm trends trading programs graham will initially trade the funds assets allocated to it in accordance with its global diversified program as described below at  times the standard leverage it applies for the program margin requirements over time at standard leverage are expected to average about  to  of equity for the accounts traded by graham thus graham expects aggregate margin for all positions held in the funds account over time to average about  to  of the accounts net assets increased leverage will alter risk exposure and may lead to greater profits and losses and trading volatility in extraordinary market conditions graham may reduce leverage and portfolio risk if it believes that it is in the best interest of its clients to do so while such actions are anticipated to occur very infrequently no assurance can be given that grahams actions will enhance performance subject to the prior approval of the general partner graham may at any time trade all or a portion of the funds assets allocated to it pursuant to one or more of grahams other programs and at an increased or reduced rate of leverage  pbth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th global diversified program the global diversified program utilizes multiple computerized trading models designed to participate in potential profit opportunities during sustained price trends in approximately  global markets this program features broad diversification in both financial and nonfinancial markets the strategies that are utilized are primarily longterm in nature and are intended to generate significant returns over time with an acceptable degree of risk and volatility the computer models on a daily basis analyze the recent price action the relative strength and the risk characteristics of each market and compare statistically the quantitative results of this data to years of historical data on each market as of january  the allocation of risk exposure for the global diversified program is download table currencies  interest rates  stock indices  agriculture  energy  metals  graham rebalances the weighting of each market in the portfolio on a monthly basis so as to attempt to maintain on a volatility and risk adjusted basis consistent exposure to each market over time graham selective trading program the graham selective trading program was developed in  and utilizes a completely different trading system than other graham programs the graham selective trading program uses a mathematical model to identify certain price patterns that have very specific characteristics indicating that there is a high probability that a significant directional move will occur although the system does not trade against the market trend it is not a true trendfollowing system inasmuch as it will only participate in specific types of market moves that meet the restrictive criteria of the model in general the graham selective trading program will participate only in significant market moves that are characterized by a substantial increase in volatility as a result it frequently will not participate in market trends in which virtually all trendfollowing systems would have a position the graham selective trading program trades in approximately  markets as of january  the allocation of risk exposure

trading model the program will normally maintain a neutral position in approximately  to  of the markets in the portfolio k program the k program was developed in  and commenced trading operations in january  similar to the graham selective trading program the k program uses a mathematical model to identify certain price patterns that have very specific characteristics indicating that there is a high probability that a significant directional move will occur the k program differs from the graham selective trading program in many respects including a tendency to enter markets at different times and the use of other significantly different parameters the k program will normally enter or exit a position only when a significant price and volatility spike takes place and is designed to have a high percentage of winning trades  pbth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th the k program trades in approximately  markets as of january  the allocation of risk exposure for the k program

nontrendbased program todays markets include many trendfollowing and countertrend traders attempting to identify major trends and reversals thereof grahams nontrendbased program utilizes multiple computerized trading models that for the most part do not rely on price trends the nontrendbased program forecasts market direction based on changes in fundamental data such as supply and demand data inflation rates interest rates and shifts in the business cycle by using nontrendfollowing methods it is possible to trade with considerable success in markets irrespective of the existence of price trends as of january  the allocation of risk exposure for the nontrendbased program is download table currency  energy  interest rates  stock indices  metals  the nontrend basedprogram seeks to capture currency gains based on the momentum of interest rate expectations absolute levels of the interest rate differentials and relative shapes of yield curves the nontrendbased program forecasts

on economic release data inflation data and interest rate sensitive stocks for base metal trading the nontrendbased program seeks to identify shifts in supplydemand that are consistent with the current business cycle to anticipate market direction relying on inputs such as cost of carry supplydemand measures inflation currency movement and interest rate sensitive stocks for stock indices the nontrendbased program creates a composite indicator that positions the system long or short the sp  relying on stock market fundamental indicators such as priceearnings ratios dividend yields inflation currency movement and interest rates discretionary trading group program unlike grahams systematic trading programs which are based almost entirely on computerized mathematical models grahams discretionary trading group determines trades for the discretionary trading group program subjectively on the basis of personal judgment and trading experience the discretionary trading group program generally utilizes fundamental information as well as certain technical data as the basis for its trading strategies fundamental considerations relate to the underlying economic and political forces that ultimately determine the true value of a particular financial instrument or commodity fundamental analysis of the discretionary trading group may involve a short or longterm time horizon technical data considered by the discretionary trading group include price patterns volatility trading volumes and level of open interest the discretionary trading group program trades worldwide in

pbth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th past performance of graham the composite performance records include individual accounts that may have materially different rates of return on amounts

of trading and means of moving toward full funding of new accounts  the period during which accounts are active  client trading restrictions  ratio of trading size to level of actual funds deposited with the futures commission merchant ie the extent of notional equity  the degree of leverage employed  the size of the account which can influence the size of positions taken and restrict the account from participating in all markets available to an investment program  the amount of interest income earned by an account which will depend on the rates paid by the futures commission merchant on equity deposits and the amount of equity invested in interestbearing obligations  the amount of management and incentive fees paid to graham and the amount of brokerage commissions paid  the timing of
