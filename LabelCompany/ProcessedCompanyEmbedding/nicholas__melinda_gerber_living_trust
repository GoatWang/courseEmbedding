you by mary s yamingarone will vs living trust whats best for you by mary s yamingarone december        you have worked hard for your money and made every attempt to be a conscientious saver so its only natural that you want some control over what happens to your assets after your die even if you are a person of modest means you have an estate—and several strategies to choose from to ensure your assets are distributed according to your wishes and in a timely fashion your estate plan the right strategy depends on your individual circumstances for some a living trust can be a useful and practical tool for others it may be a waste of time and money what is a living trust anyway and how does it differ from a last will what is a will a will is a written document—signed and witnessed—that indicates how your property will be distributed at the time of your death it is revocable and subject to amendment at any time during your lifetime it also allows you to appoint a guardian for your minor children more about writing a will what is a living trust a living trust provides lifetime and afterdeath property management if you are serving as your own trustee the trust instrument will provide for a successor upon your death or incapacity court intervention is not required livings trusts also are used to manage property if a person is disabled by accident or illness the successor trustee can manage the trust property as a result the expense publicity and inconvenience of courtsupervised distribution of your estate can be avoided if a living trust is properly written and funded you can avoid probate on your assets plan for the possibility of your own incapacity control what happens to your property after you are gone use it for any size estate and prevent your financial affairs from becoming a matter of public record while a trust sounds appealing there are drawbacks a living trust is more expensive to set up than a typical will because it must be actively managed after it is created most importantly however a living trust is useless unless it is funded a living trust only can control those assets that have been placed into it if your assets have not been transferred or if you die without funding the trust the trust will be of no benefit as your estate will still be subject to probate and there may be significant estate tax issues will vs living trust considerations there are many positive reasons to establish a trust but do not overlook the fact that it will involve more upfront effort and expense to determine if you should make the extra effort and invest in the expense of a trust answer these questions is informal probate an available option most states have an expedited or simplified form of probate for estates under a certain dollar threshold that dollar value varies by state if your estate could pass under an expedited form of probate or if you live in a state where probate is not a complex or burdensome process a will could be appropriate do you have minor children a trust allows you to establish provisions specifying when a child will be entitled to any assets held in trust do you have children grandchildren or other dependents with special needs in those instances the access or control those heirs have over their inherited property may need to be limited with a standard will your property can be passed on to those heirs but a will alone does not allow you to exercise much control over their use of the property will your estate be subject to estate taxes if the value of your estate exceeds the current estate tax threshold you may wish to consider setting up a trust with tax planning provisions the estate tax threshold frequently changes so be sure to check with the irs to determine whether or not estate tax is a concern for you will you actively manage your estate plan if not a living trust may not be a suitable solution again a trust will only be beneficial if assets are transferred into it so what is best for you in many respects a living trust and a will accomplish similar objectives a trust however allows you to realize other objectives that a will cannot but those advantages dont come without a price whether or not a living trust is better for you than a will depends on whether the additional advantages are worth the cost when choosing remember that one size does not fit all
