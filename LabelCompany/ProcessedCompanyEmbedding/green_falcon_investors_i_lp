investment by one or more investment funds in a security in which an affiliate is an investor or plans to become an investor including situations in which an affiliate has a partnership or other interest in or compensation arrangements with such issuer sponsor or offeror  applicants assert that compliance with section d and rule d would cause an investment fund to forego investment opportunities simply because a member bcg a bcg entity or other affiliated persons of the investment fund bcg or the bcg entities also had or contemplated making a similar investment in addition because attractive investment opportunities of the types considered by an investment fund often require that each participant make available funds in an amount that may be substantially greater than that available to the investor alone there may be certain attractive opportunities of which an investment fund may be unable to take advantage except as a coparticipant with other persons including affiliates applicants believe that the flexibility to structure co and joint investments in the manner described above will not involve abuses of the type section d and rule d were designed to prevent applicants acknowledge that any transactions subject to section d and rule d for which exemptive relief has not been requested in the application would require specific approval by the commission  section f of the act designates the entities that may act as investment company custodians and rule f under the act allows an investment company to act as selfcustodian applicants request an exemption to permit the following exceptions from the requirements of rule f i compliance with paragraph b of the rule may be achieved through safekeeping in the locked files of bcg or a bcg partner ii for the purposes of the rule a employees of bcg or a bcg entity will be deemed employees of the investment funds b officers and members of the managing member and members of the investment committee will be deemed to be officers of such investment funds and c officers and members of the managing member and members of the investment committee will be deemed to be the board of directors of such investment funds and iii instead of the verification procedure under paragraph f of the rule verification will be effected quarterly by two employees each of whom shall have sufficient knowledge sophistication and experience in business matters to perform such examination applicants expect that most of the investments will be evidenced by partnership agreements or similar documents such instruments are most suitably kept in bcgs files where they can be referred to as necessary applicants will comply with all other provisions of rule f  section g and rule g generally require the bonding of officers and employees of a registered investment company who have access to its securities or funds rule g requires that a majority of directors who are not interested persons of a registered investment company “disinterested directors” take certain actions and give certain approvals relating to fidelity bonding applicants request an exemption from the requirement contained in rule g that a majority of the “directors” of the investment funds who are not “interested persons” of the respective investment funds as defined in the act take certain actions and make certain approvals concerning bonding and request instead that such actions and approvals be taken by the managing members regardless of whether any of them is deemed to be an interested person of the investment funds each managing member will be an interested person of the investment funds  the investment funds request an exemption from the requirements of rule gg and h relating to the filing of copies of fidelity bonds and related information with the commission and relating to the provisions of notices to the board of directors applicants also request an exemption from the requirements of rule gj that the investment funds have a majority of disinterested directors that those disinterested directors select and nominate any other disinterested directors and that any legal counsel for those disinterested directors be independent legal counsel applicants believe that the filing requirements of rule g are burdensome and unnecessary as applied to the investment funds the general partner will maintain the materials otherwise required to be filed with the commission by rule gg and the applicants agree that all such material will be subject to examination by the commission and its staff the general partner will designate a person to maintain the records otherwise required to be filed with the commission under paragraph g of the rule the start printed page investment funds will comply with all other requirements of rule g the fidelity bond of the investment funds will cover the investment committee the general partner and all employees of bcg or any bcg entity who have access to the securities or funds of the investment funds  applicants request an exemption from the requirements contained in section j of the act and rule j under the act that every registered investment company adopt a written code of ethics and every “access person” of such registered investment company report to the investment company with respect to transactions in any security in which such access person has or by reason of the transaction acquires any direct or indirect beneficial ownership in the security applicants request an exemption from the requirements in rule j with the exception of rule jb because they are burdensome and unnecessary as applied to the investment funds and because the exemption is consistent with the policy of the act requiring the investment funds to adopt a written code of ethics and requiring access persons to report each of their securities transactions would be timeconsuming and expensive and would serve little purpose in light of among other things the community of interest among the members of the investment fund and the general partner by virtue of their common association with bcg or a bcg entity accordingly the requested exemption is consistent with the purposes of the act because the dangers against which section j and rule j are intended to guard are not present in the case of the investment funds  applicants request an exemption from the requirements in sections a b and e of the act and the rules and regulations under those sections that registered investment companies prepare and file with the commission and mail to their shareholders certain periodic reports and financial statements applicants contend that the forms prescribed by the commission for periodic reports have little relevance to the investment funds and would entail administrative and legal costs that outweigh any benefit to the members applicants request exemptive relief to the extent necessary to permit the investment funds to report annually to their members applicants also request an exemption from section h of the act to the extent necessary to exempt the general partner any  percent shareholder and any other person who may be deemed to be an officer director member of an advisory board or otherwise subject to section h from filing forms   and  under section  of the securities exchange act of  “exchange act” with respect to their ownership of interests in the investment funds applicants assert that because there is no trading market for interests and the transfer of interests is severely restricted these filings are unnecessary for the protection of investors and burdensome to those required to make them  rule a requires investment companies to adopt implement and periodically review written policies reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and to appoint a chief compliance officer each investment fund will comply with rule aa c and d except that i the members of the investment committee of each investment fund will fulfill the responsibilities assigned to the board of directors under the rule and ii because all members of the investment committee would be considered interested persons of the investment funds approval by a majority of the disinterested board members required by rule a will not be obtained in addition the investment funds will comply with the requirement in rule aaiv that the chief compliance officer meet with the disinterested directors by having the chief compliance officer meet with the members of the investment committee applicants represent that each investment fund will adopt the written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the terms and conditions of the application has appointed a chief compliance officer and is otherwise in compliance with the terms and conditions of the application applicants conditions the applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  each proposed transaction to which an investment fund is a party otherwise prohibited by section a or section d and rule d the “section  transactions” will be effected only if the investment committee determines that a the terms of the section  transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are fair and reasonable to members of the
