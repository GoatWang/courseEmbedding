consistent process and is implemented across all portfolios stock ideas typically emanate from one of three sources  company interaction eg meetings conversations with management etc industry contacts and database screens we are seeking stocks between  million and  billion in market cap at the time of purchase regardless of the idea sources a series of extremely rigorous proprietary growth and earnings revision screens are applied to narrow the investment universe from approximately  companies to a more manageable  investment candidate listfrom this investment candidate list bottomup research is conducted on each stock by the investment team to determine the sustainability of the growth rate likelihood of exceeding expectations and market sentiment each of these factors is further explored by the investment team for instance in assessing the sustainability of the growth traditional research is conducted on the competitive landscape the firm’s financial ability to fund its growth and a thorough review of its product pipeline to determine the likelihood of exceeding expectations we compare current fundamental trends with existing expectations and overlay management’s execution history in addition we seek situations where potential investments have expanding operating marginsfinding fundamentally sound companies is not enough to improve the timeliness of the investment it is critical that the market embraces a stock’s fundamental attributes thus we analyze the market sentiment toward each stock seeking situations where the sentiment is neutral to positiveif these strict criteria are met the stock is a candidate for the portfolio the investment team works cooperatively to research securities while mr nelson makes the final investment decisions

philosophy process team vehicles contact investment philosophy at timpani we believe that earnings drive stock price performance by combining fundamental research with an analysis of estimate revisions we firmly believe we can identify and purchase underestimated growth that exists between a companys business strength and the markets expectation of that strength we add exposure to stocks where growth is being underestimated or where there is a positive perception gap and we reduce exposure to stocks where growth is being overestimated or where there is a negative perception gap this phenomenon exist because the market is slow to react to incremental relevant changes in a company’s fundamentals using growth gaps to guide our decisions causes us to minimize two behavioral mistakes of growth investing selling winners too early and not selling losers quickly enough the investment team believes that outstanding companies with superior earnings and revenue growth will outperform
