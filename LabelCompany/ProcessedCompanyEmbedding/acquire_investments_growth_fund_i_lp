overview widget loading  performance performance widget loading  commentary as of june   quarter in review the jpmorgan investor growth fund i class shares outperformed its primary market benchmark the russell  index for the quarter ended june   international equities performed quite well while creditoriented income delivered weak results the following jpmorgan funds are highlighted global equity performance remained stellar in the second quarter exposure to emerging market funds and developed markets international proved beneficial highlighted by the emerging markets equity fund which delivered exceptional performance the rise in global economic prospects has driven positive earnings estimate revisions across much of the globe exposure to growth funds large cap growth mid cap growth and intrepid growth boosted performance in the second quarter while core domestic equity exposure struggled us equity and intrepid america valuebased methodologies showed mixed results as strong manager performance did not provide enough alpha to offset weak asset class returns core fixed income funds outperformed their relevant benchmarks in the quarter returns from the asset class were solid but lagged the performance delivered by global equities the floating rate income and inflation managed bond funds were notable detractors as interest rates fell during the quarter in contrast to solid developments in fixed income and equities marketneutral funds were unable to keep pace in the second quarter looking ahead the fund primarily focuses on opportunities expected to evolve over intermediate threetofive year and longerterm  to year horizons here are our expectations for the next several years the recent slowgrowth environment may be giving way to a modestly more favorable economic backdrop as expectations have risen for support from fiscal stimulus and tax reform while this may lead to a temporary rise in growth inflation and interest rates the demographic backdrop and elevated debt levels reflected by the global economy are likely to restrain growth unless productivity improves markedly interest rate normalization could be underway and investmentgrade fixed income returns should also begin to look more favorable as time progresses we would expect bond allocations to increase should rates rise more meaningfully within credit we retain an allocation to leveraged loans which offer higher returns than core fixed income and a lowerrisk profile than high yield international equity markets offer longerterm opportunity but also pose high volatility associated with both the underlying stocks and higher exposures to foreign currencies the portfolio maintains a modest overweight to risk assets with an emphasis on credit and developed markets equity

the jpmorgan investor growth fund i class shares outperformed its primary market benchmark the russell  index for the quarter ended june   international equities performed quite well while creditoriented income delivered weak results the following jpmorgan funds are highlighted global equity performance remained stellar in the second quarter exposure to emerging market funds and developed markets international proved beneficial highlighted by the emerging markets equity fund which delivered exceptional performance the rise in global economic prospects has driven positive earnings estimate revisions across much of the globe exposure to growth funds large cap growth mid cap growth and intrepid growth boosted performance in the second quarter while core domestic equity exposure struggled us equity and intrepid america valuebased methodologies showed mixed results as strong manager performance did not provide enough alpha to offset weak asset class returns core fixed income funds outperformed their relevant benchmarks in the quarter returns from the asset class were solid but lagged the performance delivered by global equities the floating rate income and inflation managed bond funds were notable detractors as interest rates fell during the quarter in contrast to solid developments in fixed income and equities marketneutral funds were unable to keep pace in the second quarter looking ahead the fund primarily focuses on opportunities expected to evolve over intermediate threetofive year and longerterm  to year horizons here are our expectations for the next several years the recent slowgrowth environment may be giving way to a modestly more favorable economic backdrop as expectations have risen for support from fiscal stimulus and tax reform while this may lead to a temporary rise in growth inflation and interest rates the demographic backdrop and elevated debt levels reflected by the global economy are likely to restrain growth unless productivity improves markedly interest rate normalization could be underway and investmentgrade fixed income returns should also begin to look more favorable as time progresses we would expect bond allocations to increase should rates rise more meaningfully within credit we retain an allocation to leveraged loans which offer higher returns than core fixed income and a lowerrisk profile than high yield international equity markets offer longerterm opportunity but also pose high volatility associated with both the underlying stocks and higher exposures to foreign currencies the portfolio maintains a modest overweight to risk assets with an emphasis on credit and developed markets equity fees and minimums fees widget loading  portfolio portfolio widget loading  management fund managers

interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings or other risk factors investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates short selling involves certain risks including additional costs associated with
