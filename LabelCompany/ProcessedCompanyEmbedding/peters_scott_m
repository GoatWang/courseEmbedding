known as the automobile capital of the world but the great lakes state boasts a similarly rich heritage in the development of boat building in america by the late nineteenth century michigan had emerged as the industry’s hub drawing together the most talented designers builders and engine makers to produce some of the fastest and most innovative boats ever created within decades gifted michigan entrepreneurs like christopher columbus smith john l hacker and gar wood had established some of the nation’s top boat brands and brought the prospect of boat ownership within reach for american consumers from all ranges of income more than just revolutionizing recreational boating michigan boat builders also left their mark on history—from developing the speedy runabouts favored by illicit rumrunners during the prohibition era to creating the landing craft that carried allied forces to shores in europe and the pacific in wwii in making waves scott m peters explores this intriguing story of people processes and products—of an industry that evolved in michigan but would change boating across the world scott m peters is curator of collections at the michigan historical museum in lansing and a lifelong great lakes boater a frequent contributor to michigan history magazine he has been collecting information on the state’s boatbuilding industry for the past  years praise  awards complete with photographs maps and appendices that provide statistical information on production employment and geographic distribution of boatbuilders making waves should have a place
