case no cv judge rebecca r pallmeyer magistrate judge arlander keys plaintiff’s motion to compel plaintiff nancy carlson and through her attorney charles siedlecki respectfully moves this honorable court pursuant to fed r civ p  and  to compel defendant mi homes of chicago llc to produce the personnel disciplinary employment applications sales records performance records all roleplay videos secret shopper videos the attendant roleplay and secret shopper evaluations and grading of plaintiff and other sales associates employed by defendant during plaintiff’s tenure plaintiff further moves this court to compel defendant to produce documents requested in plaintiff’s request for documents to defendant see exhibit  defendant’s response to plaintiff’s requests for documents and fully respond to plaintiff’s interrogatories to defendant see exhibit  defendant’s responses to plaintiff’s interrogatories as more fully set forth below plaintiff also respectfully moves this court to compel defendant to provide some form of identification as to the documents they have produced so that plaintiff and this honorable court have some idea which request or interrogatory the documents tendered  are responsive to fed r civ p bei requires a party to organize and label responsive documents to correspond with the categories of the request glover v bd of educ  us dist lexis  nd ll april   history  plaintiff nancy carlson brought this action under the americans with disabilities act of  “ada”  usc §  et seq the americans with disabilities amendments act of  “adaa” and the common law of the state of illinois retaliatory discharge seeking declaratory injunctive monetary and other appropriate relief to redress intentional violations by the defendant mi homes of chicago llc of rights secured to her by the laws of the united states of america and the common law of the state of illinois  plaintiff challenges defendant’s discriminatory treatment in the terms and conditions of her employment based upon her disability andor her record of having a disability or defendant’s erroneous perception that her disabilities precluded her ability to perform the essential functions of her job  plaintiff challenges defendant’s failure to reasonably accommodate plaintiff’s disability by creating situations which exacerbated her disabling conditions  plaintiff challenges defendant’s discriminatoryretaliatory dismissal from her employment and preclusion from promotional opportunities for requesting an accommodation for her disability and complaining about different treatment in the terms and conditions of her employment and conduct which she reasonably believed to be illegal under illinois state law   plaintiff has made attempts pursuant to rule  to resolve the discovery disputes addressed in this motion they were addressed in email communication in open court in a face to face meeting ordered by the court on may   and in a april   letter which accompanied plaintiff’s discovery responses it should be noted that defense counsel informed plaintiff’s counsel on may   that he never had seen the april   letter nevertheless plaintiff’s counsel had made known his discovery concerns in open court and in email communication as well  the face to face meeting required by this honorable court and r  was satisfied on may   at defense counsel’s office at approximately   pm plaintiff’s counsel has been ordered to file this motion to compel by  pm on friday may   as set forth above after consultation in person via email in court and by telephone these good faith attempts to resolve these discovery issues have failed i  scope of discovery in employment discrimination cases rule  of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that “parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter not privileged which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action    the information sought need not be admissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence” fed r civ p b relevant evidence is any “evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence” fed r evid  the phrase “relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action” “has been construed broadly to encompass any matter that bears on or that reasonably could lead to other matters that could bear on any  issue that is or may be in the case” oppenheimer fund inc v sanders  us    led d   s ct   “relevancy cannot be equated with admissibility at trial or the narrow issues presented by the facts” in re aircrash disaster near roselawn ind  frd   nd ill  relevancy is a broad concept at the discovery stage and requests for discovery are relevant if there is any possibility that the subject matter of the request may be relevant to the action id broad discovery is necessary in employment discrimination suits to further the goal of equal opportunity in the workplace bell v woodward governor co  us dist lexis  nd ill jan   ii  defendant’s response to plaintiff’s document requests defendant responded on april   to plaintiff’s thirtyfour  requests for documents with a litany of objections claims of privilege workproduct and a request for a protective order  no privilege log was tendered and no responsive documents were tendered at all defendant had ample time including a twoweek agreed to extension to request a protective order see exhibit   in response to requests nos      defendant claims privilege and tendered no responsive documents or privilege log in response to the several requests including videos defendant states they will be produced after a reasonable search as set forth below only one secretshopper video of plaintiff has thus far been produced none of the roleplay videos and nothing regarding other employees comparators during her tenure   in response to requests nos      and  defendant claims a protective order was required before any response would be made  in response to requests nos  and  defendant failed to respond based upon relevance  in response to requests nos  defendant failed to respond based upon its objection of vague and ambiguous  in sum plaintiff received no responsive documents at all on april   defense counsel emailed to plaintiff’s counsel what defendant described as non confidential response documents the documents were not organized in a manner that informed plaintiff as to what request for documents or interrogatory they were responsive to leaving plaintiff to wonder what was still being withheld and what document request or interrogatory was being responded to  on april   plaintiff’s counsel after reviewing the nonconfidential documents sent by email from defendant issued the following email communication to defense counsel counsel i have briefly reviewed the documents you tendered which you describe as non confidential yet they have been sanitized with ripe with redactions and edits leaving only those portions of which defendant deems relevant defendant cannot set itself up to be the arbiter of what is relevant and what is not please tenderproduce complete versions of these documents or produce a privilege log as required by the court as to why you have conducted your discovery in this manner and are editing documents requested without leave of court or court approval i do not wish to engage in motion practice which could be avoided but i cannot allow defense counsel to edit and manipulate the evidence and documents in this matter in this way you will force me to file a motion to compel production please advise as to when we can expect the noneditedredacted documents  on april   plaintiff responded to defendant’s discovery requests and issued a cover letter outlining again the defendant’s failure to respond as noted above  defense counsel indicated on july   that he never received the cover letter see exhibit  april   cover letter  on may   plaintiff’s counsel received via email three pages of documents emails one of which did not indicate the senders name  see exhibit   pages of emails received again no indication as to what these were in response to which request which interrogatory and one of the senders identities is removed  on may   an agreed protective order was emailed to the court by defense counsel  on may   following the imposition of a protective order plaintiff’s counsel sent an email to defense counsel requesting all the documents withheld be immediately tendered defense counsel indicated he would do so the following monday june    on june   defense counsel sent via email thirty  pages of documents to plaintiff’s counsel  marked as confidential once again no indication of which document request or interrogatory they were responsive to following that in june  defendant mailed one  secret shopper video of plaintiff only none of the roleplay information has been tendered  iii  no other documents or adequate responses have been had since that time defendant’s response to plaintiff’s interrogatories defendant responded on april   to plaintiff’s eleven  interrogatories with the same litany of boilerplate objections claims of privilege  no privilege log was tendered see exhibit  as set forth above they are woefully inadequate  defendant responded to plaintiff’s interrogatories nos     and  with  claims of workproduct or attorneyclient privilege again no privilege log was tendered  iv no subsequent responses have been had since that time defendant has failed to produce documents and video of comparators relevant to establishing discrimination pretext and validity of the role play and secret shopper videos  defendant has failed to produce to produce all of the personnel disciplinary employment applications sales records performance records roleplay videos secret shopper videos the attendant evaluations and grading of plaintiff and its other sales associates employed by defendant during plaintiff’s tenure defendant objects on the bases that the request is overbroad and unduly burdensome irrelevant and that the documents are privileged see exhibit  and  on june   defense counsel mailed via us mail to plaintiff’s counsel one secret shopper video of plaintiff no comparator secretshopper videos and no roleplay videos at all  not even of plaintiff these videos are central to plaintiff’s claim as is the evaluations and grading of all sales people subjected to them during her tenure they will be required for comparison value application and expert review  the personnel disciplinary employment applications sales records performance records of all other sales associates employed during plaintiff’s tenure is similarly required as comparative evidence related to plaintiffs claims of discriminatorydisparate treatment  defendant has the burden
