as silk textiles lace and mirrors were in high demand in the s mirrors had become very popular among the upper classes of society italian cabinets châteaux and ornate side tables and piertables were decorated with this expensive and luxurious product at the time however the french were not known for mirror technology instead the republic of venice was known as the world leader in glass manufacturing controlling a technical and commercial monopoly of the glass and mirror businesscitation needed french minister of finance jeanbaptiste colbert wanted france to become completely selfsufficient in meeting domestic demand for luxury products thereby strengthening the national economy colbert established by letters patent the public enterprise manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs french pronunciation ​manyfaktyʁ ʁwajal də ɡlas də miʁwaʁ royal mirrorglass factory in october  the company was created for a period of twenty years and would be financed in part by the state the beneficiary and first director was the french financier nicolas du noyer receiver of taxes of orléans who was granted a monopoly of making glass and mirrorglass for a period of twenty years the company had the informal name compagnie du noyer an early saintgobain emblem to compete with the italian mirror industry colbert commissioned several venetian glassworkers he had enticed to paris to work for the company the first unblemished mirrors were produced in  soon the mirrors created in the faubourg saintantoine under the french company began to rival those of venice the french company was capable of producing mirrors that were  to  inches long  to  m which at the time was considered impressive competition between france and the venetians became so fierce that venice considered it a crime for any glass artisan to leave and practice their trade elsewhere especially in foreign territory nicolas du noyer complained in writing that the jealous venetians were unwilling to impart the secrets of glassmaking to the french workers and that the company was hardpressed to pay its expenses the distractions of paris proved distracting to the workers and supplies of firewood to stoke the furnaces were dearer in the capital than elsewhere in  the glassmaking was transferred to a small glass furnace already working at tourlaville near cherbourg in normandy and the premises in faubourg saintantoine were devoted to glassgrinding and polishing the crude product though the compagnie du noyer was reduced at times to importing venetian glass and finishing it in france by september  the royal french manufacturer was on a sufficiently sound footing for the importation of glass to be forbidden to any of louis subjects under any conditions in  the company produced the glass for the hall of mirrors at the palace of versailles in  the companys financial arrangement with the state was renewed for another two decades however in  the rival compagnie thévart was created also financed in part by the state compagnie thévart used a new pouring process that allowed it to make plate glass mirrors measuring at least  by  inches wide  by  m much bigger than the  inches  m which the compagnie du noyer could create the two companies were in competition for seven years until  when the economy slowed down and their technical and commercial rivalry became counterproductive under an order from the french government the two companies were forced to merge creating the compagnie plastier in  compagnie plastier declared bankruptcy a group of francoswiss protestant bankers rescued the collapsing company changing the name to compagnie dagincourt at the same time the company was provided royal patents which allowed it to maintain a legal monopoly in the glassmanufacturing industry up until the french revolution  despite fierce sometimes violent protests from free enterprise partisans  industrial revolutionedit in  as a consequence of the french revolution the state financial and competitive privileges accorded to compagnie dagincourt were abolished the company now had to depend on the participation and capital of private investors although it continued to remain partly under the control of the french state in the s saintgobain continued to function as it had under the ancien régime manufacturing highquality mirrors and glass for the luxury market however in  a new glass manufacturer was established in commentry france and in  several belgian glass manufacturers were also founded while saintgobain continued to dominate the luxury highquality mirror and glass markets its newly created competitors focused their attention on making medium and lowquality products the manufacture of products of such quality made mirrors and glass affordable for the masses in response the company extended its product line to include lowerquality glass and mirrors in  just as louisphilippe became king of the newly restored french monarchy saintgobain was transformed into a public limited company and became independent from the state for the first time while mirrors remained their primary business saintgobain began to diversify their product line to include glass panes for skylights roofs and room dividers thick mirrors semithick glass for windows laminated mirrors and glass and finally embossed mirrors and window panes some of the more famous buildings that saintgobain contributed to during that period were the crystal palace in london le jardin des plantes les grand et petit palais and les halles in paris and milan railway station saintgobain merged with another french glass and mirror manufacturer saintquirin in the midth century after the merger the company was able to gain control of  of european glass and mirror production before it had only controlled –

century in  the company expanded its manufacturing to bottles jars tableware and domestic glassware in  saintgobain extended its businesses to fibreglass manufacture fibreglass was being used to create insulation industrial textiles and building reinforcements in  the company founded isover a subsidiary fibreglass insulation manufacturer during this period the company developed three new glassmaking techniques and processes first a dipping technique used to coat car windows which prevented glass from shattering in the event of an accident as a result of that technique  of saintgobains  sales came from the car industry and  in  second a few years later another technique was developed that allowed glass to be shaped and bentclarification needed finally a process was developed to coat glass with aluminum allowing it to be used as a conductor and allowed the company to create products such as radiavers a glass heater – pontàmousson mergeredit between  and  saintgobains sales rose at a rate of  per year its work force grew from  in  to  in  by the end of the s saintgobain had more than  subsidiaries under its control glass and fiberglass sales benefited from the booming

categories instead of accepting lower margins said javier gimeno head of the company’s asiapacific business saintgobain no longer manufactures glass wool or architectural glass in china mr gimeno said in an interview with cfo journal in shanghai “it is impossible to make money with these kinds of overcapacities” he said overcapacity among chinese manufacturers have resulted in downward price pressures in these product categories affecting margins saintgobain now focuses on product classes it considers healthy like plastics automotive window shields and mortars “making money here in china is much harder than in other asian countries” mr gimeno said “it is getting more complicated” nevertheless the move — along with increased productivity has resulted in higher profit margins than in

protection and to safety at work” mr gimeno said “these regulations cost us foreign firms like saintgobain a lot of money” he said now domestic competitors are held accountable according to the same set of standards mr gimeno said the country’s premier li keqiang last week pledged to create equal conditions — a socalled level playing field — for foreign and domestic companies operating in china a step welcomed by western executives including the chief executive of johnson controls international plc alex molinaroli “the laws are getting tighter more aligned with western standards” mr gimeno said still the outlook for saintgobain’s china business is positive he added restrictions on the overseas export of capital for example dividends generated in china are no longer an issue mr gimeno said introduced late last year the controls initially caused concerns among multinationals “capital transfers take a bit longer now but that’s all” mr gimeno said foreign firms that want to transfer

including the us the us specialty chemical industry especially in personal healthcare is gearing up to take back its pre dominance this has been allowed by development of green chemistries and the emergence of enzyme technology coming from advances in the food industry  the chinese did not see these changes in time their best hope is getting involved in joint ventures in the us and focus on

another substance liquid gas or vapor into its interior adhere to cling or stick together adhesion tendency of rubber to bond or cling to a contact surface aging to undergo changes in physical properties with age or lapse of time aging accelerated tests run on various rubbers to find out in as short a period as possible the destructive influence of light oxygen heat and ozone ambient temperature the surrounding temperature relative to the given point of application bleeding migration to the surface of plasticizers waxes or similar materials to form a film or bead blemish a mark deformity of injury which impairs appearance blister a raised spot in the surface or a separation between layers usually forming void or airfilled space in the profile bloom a dusty or milky looking deposit that sometimes appears on the surface of a molded product after molding and storage caused by migration of liquid or solid to the surface not to be confused with dust from external sources bond the term commonly used to denote the attachment of a given elastomer to some other member bonds may be classified by types as follows a mechanical – purely physical attachment accomplished by such means as “through” holes interlocking fingers envelope design riveting etc b cold – adhesion of previously vulcanized elastomer to another member through use of suitable contact cements c vulcanized – adhesion of an elastomer to a previously primed surface using heat and pressure thus vulcanizing the elastomer at the same time brittleness tendency to crack when deformed bunan see nitrile bunas a general term for the copolymers of butadiene and styrene also known as sbr and grs butt joint joining two ends of a seal whereby the junction is perpendicular to the mold parting line cell a single small cavity surrounded partially or completely by walls cellular rubber rubber products containing many cells or small hollow receptacles dispersed throughout the mass closed cell a cell totally enclosed by its walls and hence not interconnecting with other cells coefficient of thermal expansion average expansion per degree over a stated temperature range expressed as a fraction of initial dimension may be linear or volumetric cold resistance able to withstand the effects of cold or low temperatures without loss of serviceability compound a term applied to a mixture of polymers and other ingredients to produce a usable rubber material compression deflections psi to compress lab slab a specified percentage of overall height normally  compression set the amount by which a rubber specimen fails to return to its original shape after release of compressive load conductive rubber a rubber capable of conducting electricity most generally applied to rubber products used to conduct static electricity copolymer a polymer consisting of two different monomers chemically combined cracking the sharp break or fissure in the surface generally due to excessive strain crazing a surface effect on rubber articles characterized by many minute cracks cross section a seal as viewed if cut at right angles to the molding line showing internal structure dense solid rubber product with no voids or cells available in various durometer hardness durometer a an instrument for measuring the hardness of a rubber measures the resistance to the penetration of an indenter point into the surface of the rubber b numerical scale of rubber hardness elasticity the property of an article which tends to return to its original shape after deformation elastomer any natural or synthetic material with resilience or memory sufficient to return to its original shape after major of minor distortion elongation generally means “ultimate elongation” or percent increase in original length of a specimen when it breaks epdm ethylenepropylenedienemonomer is well known for its excellent ozone weathering and aging resistance it also has excellent water and steam resistance maintains its flexibility at low temperatures features excellent resistance to alkalis acids and oxygenated solvents and is very color stable it is not recommended for resistance to oil gasoline and hydrocarbon solvents epdm is found in a wide range of applications and is excellent for use outdoors extrusion distortion or flow under pressure of a portion of a seal into clearance between mating parts feather edge the sharp thin edge on parts such as wiper seals and cups also called “knife edge” flame resistance the resistance to burning of material that will not withstand combustion under ordinary conditions friction resistance to motion due to contact of surfaces gasket a device used to retain fluids under pressure or seal out foreign matter normally refers to static seal hardness resistance to a disturbing force measured by the relative resistance of a material to an indenter point of any one of a number of standard hardness testing instruments see durometer heat aging a test for degradation of physical properties as a result of exposure to high temperature conditions low temperature flexibility the ability of a rubber product to be flexed bent or bowed at low temperature without cracking memory the tendency of a material to return to original shape after deformation modulus tensile stress at specific elongation usually  elongation for elastomers modulus of elasticity one of several measurements of stiffness or resistance to deformation not often incorrectly used to indicate specifically static tension modulus mooney scorch the measurement of the rate at which a rubber compound will cure set up by means of the mooney viscometer test instrument mooney viscosity measurement of the plasticity or viscosity of an uncompounded or compounded vulcanized elastomer seal material by means of the mooney shearing disk viscometer neoprene neoprene has moderate resistance to oils and gasoline it features good flame resistance weathers well and has very good resistance to abrasion flex cracking alkalis and acids however expect poor resistance to aromatic and oxygenated solvents and limited flexibility at low temperatures neoprene is generally considered an excellent allpurpose material with a solid balance of properties and few limitation neoprene’s service temperature ranges from  degrees f to  degrees f nitrile nitrile has very good oil and gasoline resistance permeability and heat and abrasion resistance its resistance to alkalis and acids all increase as the nitrile content of the compound increases nitrile must be specially compounded for resistance to ozone sunlight and natural aging and has poor resistance to oxygenated solvents nitrile is superior to neoprene in oils and solvent resistance but is not recommended for applications where it is exposed to severe weathering nitrile’s service temperature ranges from  degrees f to  degrees f nonblooming the absence of “bloom” oil resistant ability to vulcanize rubber to resist the swelling and deteriorating effects of various types of oils ozone cracking the surface cracks checks or crazing caused by exposure to an atmosphere containing ozone ozone resistance ability to withstand the deteriorating effects of ozone which generally causes cracking polymer a material formed by joining together many poly individual units mer of one or more monomers synonymous with elastomer porosity quality or state of being porous rebound a measure of the resilience usually as a percentage of vertical return of a body which has fallen and bounced resilience ability of an elastomer to return to original size and shape after deforming forces are removed generally expressed in per cent of the ratio of energy removed to the energy used in compressing resilient having that capability rubber see elastomer rubber synthetic manufactured of manmade elastomers sbr copolymer of butadiene and styrene an all purpose type synthetic similar to natural rubber butadiene is a gaseous material of petroleum styrene a reaction product of ethylene and benzene scorching premature curing or setting up of a raw compound during processing shelf aging the change in a material’s properties which occur in storage with time silicone silicone features excellent resistance to ozone sunlight and oxidation and is very color stable it also maintains excellent flexibility at low temperatures has outstanding resistance to high heat low compression set and is a very good electrical insulator however it is not recommended for applications which require abrasion resistance tear and cut growth resistance and high tensile strength nor is it recommended for resistance to oil gasoline solvents alkalis and acids size actual actual dimension of the product including tolerance units skin a relatively dense layer at the surface of a cellular material specific gravity ratio of the weight of a given substance to the weight of an equal volume of water at any specific temperature sphericity the measure of a tolerance of a molded ball or ground ball in reference to a perfect sphere also described as “roundness” stress force per unit of original cross section area tear strength the force required to rupture a sample of stated geometry tear resistance resistance to growth of a cut or nick when tension is applied to the cut specimen commonly expressed as pounds per square inch thickness temperature range maximum and minimum temperature limits in which a seal compound will function in a given application tensile strength force in pounds per square inch
