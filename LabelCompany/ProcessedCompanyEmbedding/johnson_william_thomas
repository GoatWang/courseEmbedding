william thomas johnson banker rancher and rodeo producer son of william thomas and laura bolin johnson was born at mount vernon texas on december 4 87 his grandfather joshua foster johnson was one of seven texas legislators who joined sam houston in voting against secession his sister ora was founder of camp waldemar at hunt texas johnson attended franklin county schools until age fourteen when he left home to work as a cowboy in wyoming and montana he subsequently moved to denton texas and opened a livestocktrading and feed barn in  he married lucy young daughter of the denton county sheriff they had two children after selling the barn to two younger brothers johnson helped establish the first national bank of denton county and became its president in  he sold his interest in the bank moved to san antonio and began purchasing ranches along the southern pacific railway between laredo and el paso he eventually amassed over  acres he raised herefords for the war effort during world war i sometime during this period for reasons that remain unexplained he came to be known as colonel johnson though ranching made him a millionaire johnson gained his national fame as a rodeo producer in october 8 he produced a san antonio rodeo to entertain the national american legion convention unfortunately the legionnaires were more interested in bullfights in mexico than the rodeo and johnson lost more than  he decided the only way to recover his investment was to remain in the business in  he produced a spring rodeo in el paso and the texas state fair rodeo in dallas there he entertained officials from the madison square garden rodeo then the most prestigious rodeo in america he became its producer in  also in  he successfully staged the first rodeo in boston garden by 4 johnsons rodeos also played detroit philadelphia indianapolis dallas chicago kansas city and sedalia thanks to his flair for publicity these contests grossed several million dollars more than any others in rodeo history making the big texan as the press called him the most famous and powerful producer in the country he was especially helpful to cowgirls whom he provided excellent prizes and publicity with health and accident insurance nonexistent in rodeo johnson also paid medical and transportation expenses for women injured at his contests in the belief that his purses were too low and that he was getting rich at their expense cowboys went on strike against johnson at the  boston garden rodeo determined to break the strike the colonel attempted unsuccessfully to continue the rodeo with grooms and stable hands for cowboys ultimately he capitulated and increased the purse so the contest could take place as scheduled as a result of this conflict the cowboys formed the cowboys turtle association now the professional rodeo cowboys association soon afterward johnson sold his rodeo company which included more than  cattle and horses and a staff of  to m t and w j clemens and everett coleman for  johnson retired to san antonio his departure marked a turning point in rodeo history as the cowboys began their successful efforts to control the sport johnson died at san antonio on september  4 and was buried at denton the following day he was a baptist by the time of his death he retained only two of his ranching properties because he was the target of the  strike that launched the prca johnson remains a pariah to the rodeo profession and is absent from its halls of fame bibliography  patricia a florence the little turtle that grew prorodeo sports news october 8 san antonio
