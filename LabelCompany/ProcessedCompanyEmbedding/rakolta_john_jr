parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

but cashstrapped chrysler found it lacked the money to pay walbridge for the workchrysler couldnt pay us our final bill on that project recalled john rakolta jr ceo of walbridge today and they said would you take product in return for your final bill and my father agreed that the final bill would be paid in k cars as opposed to cash we took  k cars they were worth about  each so we all drove k cars for four or five years”it was a key moment in the history of walbridge which is celebrating its th anniversary this year just a few years later in  chrysler built its enormous technology center in auburn hills and awarded the contract worth more than  billion to walbridge thanks to the k car deal chrysler ceo lee iacocca viewed walbridge as not just a contractor but as a strategic partnerdetroit free pressredeveloping detroit remains long hard slogwhen we were selected to be the contractor for the chrysler technology center mr iacocca made a point of telling us that ‘you won the project fair and square but that put the icing on the cake there have been many such dramatic moments in the history of walbridge which formed in  as walbridge aldinger a partnership between building expert george walbridge and financial expert albert aldingernow simply walbridge the firm has built dozens of iconic structures in its hometown of detroit including the penobscot building book tower orchestra hall the detroit people mover one detroit center and compuware headquartersmost identified for its automotive work walbridge work included fords rouge plant in the late s and again in this century general motors wind tunnel at its warren tech center in the s and visteons headquarters campus in van buren township in  the company now employs about  workers and does more than  billion a year in revenuewalbridge survived the great depression doing work for maxwell motor car by doing maintenance on railroad lines and other work it could pick up once world war ii began walbridge turned to defense projects building vast munitions factories for the government in missouri and minnesota factories that produced billions of rounds of ammunition photo walbridgebut the companys greatest crisis came after the war when founders walbridge and aldinger died leaving an ownership conundrum for the pairs several other partners who owned pieces of the firm the firm survived the crisis because of a culture that valued service and continuityeach time somebody sold to the succeeding group they left a little on the table for the next guy rakolta said they didn’t extract every single last dollar in value that the company might have been worth they sold at a discount so there was protection for the next guy so in case the economy went down or they had a couple job losses they wouldn’t be stretched to the limitjust prior to the chrysler tech center contract the firm acquired its largest competitor at the time a company called darin and armstrong and added  employees to its own  that provided more expertise and personnel enabling the firm to go after bigger jobs and to take more risks you have to have a big appetite for risk to be in this business rakolta saidtoday the firm employs about  staffers and works throughout the us and in several other countries reported annual revenues top  billion the firm is headquartered in the one kennedy square building near campus martius in downtown detroitthe rakolta family has long been involved in the firm as principal owners and executives going back more than  years ceo rakolta started working at the

to customers the community and colleaguesweve had a great  years rakolta said there’s very few companies on a national scale that have been able to survive that long our goal today is to set this company up to have another  years so that the guy sitting in my chair in  will most likely be saying exactly the same things that i’m saying today culture is what makes all the differencecontact john
