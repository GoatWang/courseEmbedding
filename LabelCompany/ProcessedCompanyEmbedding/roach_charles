sears mycleaningproductscom and our other retailers by barb kelly – amazon review worked very well have not seen a live roach and has been two weeks since i sprayed thanks roach bully i bought this because we had a roach problem it has a slight odor that smells pleasant it doesnt give me an asthma attack the way that poisons do it takes a little longer for the bugs to die but they do die i have used it on ants and spiders also i recently had a roaches outbreak and i would see them even in the middle of the day after i got this item i sprayed it all over my house everywhere and let it dry for a few minutes or hours and then went to bed i did not see one roach after i washed my older blanket which i thought the roaches were hiding in i sprayed it silly as well and went to sleep soundly those roaches have not come back yet this product works the roaches might simply be hiding for now i’m not sure but i intend to spray my entire bed room soon to make sure they never show their ugly bug faces again this was a good expense we were scared out of our wits with roaches when i notice a roach crawling on my child i found you guys from a friend and want to thank you roach bully is a great product and worked as promised no more  roaches you have saved me a ton of worry thank you a must if you have a roach problem we recently had roaches in my apartment building they did not hire an exterminator right away i purchased this product and sprayed the area in the doorway to my apartment because i did not want the roaches coming into my apartment i also sprayed the areas under my bathroom and kitchen sinks i believe that this product helped a lot i have not seen any roach in my apartment and i hope i never do great stuff  angela  amazon review by stephanie martinez – amazon

infestation treatment that may be out there shipping was great as well as packaging bully those roaches bully those roaches by gentle deer lion tamer– amazon review i had roach bully sent to my son who is living in harlem he had roaches all over the house i sent him detailed instructions on how to use it with de needless to say the kid did not follow my instructions and just sprayed it around and sprinkled the de into the carpet where he sleeps thankfully it worked he sleeps on the floor on an air mattress and this stuff works the roaches have disappeared and his spirits are better he thinks i’m joking when i told him that when he comes home he’s coming in the back door naked while i take his stuff to the laundromat ha ha roach bully has been a top green product with large pest
