immutability impassibility and omniscience particularly in terms of foreknowledge of all future eventsthe authors begin with the contention that god has granted humans a significant degree of freedom and that he chooses to enter into a genuine relationship with them they defend this position biblically historically theologically and philosophically offering a wellbalanced comprehensive look at several familiar issues from a different and they claim more biblical viewpoint the unique interplay of the five authors in this book makes it a fascinating read richard rice makes a compelling biblical case for open theism while john sanders takes a look at just how greek our christian theology is and why contemporary theologians are generally unwilling to accept the validity of open theism clark pinnock offers what can be termed a systematic theology of gods openness and william hasker offers a cogent philosophical defense of open theism david basinger then offers some practical implications of open theism and compares them to the implications of both traditional classical theism and process theologyyou may not agree with the authors of this volume but the discussion itself about these major issues is vitally important learn why each of these five authors came to believe in open theism and what it means in their lives product information▼▲ format paperbacknumber of pages

of christianity todays  books of the year the openness of god presents a careful and fullorbed argument that the god known through christ desires responsive relationship with his creatures while it rejects process theology the book asserts that such classical doctrines as gods immutability impassibility and foreknowledge demand reconsideration the authors insist that our understanding of god will be more consistently biblical and more true to the actual devotional lives of christians if we profess that god in grace grants humans significant freedom and enters into relationship with a genuine giveandtake dynamic the openness of god is remarkable in its comprehensiveness drawing from the disciplines of biblical historical systematic and philosophical theology evangelical and other orthodox christian philosophers have promoted the relational or personalist perspective on god in recent decades now here is the first major attempt to bring the discussion into the evangelical theological arena author bio▼▲ clark pinnock was professor emeritus of systematic theology at mcmaster divinity college in hamilton ontario widely regarded as one of evangelicalisms most stimulating

joint author of the books oxford and ashgate editorial reviews▼▲ what nonbelievers reject is often not god but the caricature of god that theologians have synthesized over the centuries a faith based on that caricature is poorly suited to the hard facts of the real world these authors masterfully retrace how that caricature was drawn show where its distortions lie and offer a sound alternative to it almost five centuries ago christians thrilled at the recovery of the truth of salvation by grace that had benn hijacked from them for a millennium of church history this book throbs today with the same excitement at the rediscovery of a god infinitely greater and freer than the cold abstractions of medievally minded reductionist theologians make him to be the openness of god signals a new openness of his people toward the god who has never ceased being open to them  the openness of god presents a comprehensive case for a relational model of the biblical god it is written collaboratively by a team of fine thinkers whether or not its arguments finally convince all the openness of god develops interpretations and explores insight that will enrich every careful reader

product to a friend write review sort by most recent overall rating helpfulness see    displaying items  of  page  of  kyle  stars out of  may   kyle this is the groundbreaking book that brought open theism back in to vigorous discussion the authors rightly address some of the issues behind the issues namely how aristotelian perfection ideals have influenced most of western theology especially very pervasive and influential authors such as hodge hodge augustine grudem piper and others present a wide sampling of those whose theology wreaks of greek thoughtthe authors of this book address some of these major underlying issues that are involved in any responsible discussion of god time knowledge humanity etc that is one of the major strengths of the book not to mention of course the open view itself the open view as described in this book is the most coherent useful realistic and god honoring view available this book does not spend much time refuting any other view however it does point out the inconsistencies found in calvinism simple foreknowledge classic arminianism and molinism you may not adopt the view after reading this book but it should become clear to you that it is coherent evangelical and biblical the main obstacle in my opinion is not the validity of this view instead it is our willingness to cast aside ancient western falsehoods and open our minds to how the rest of the world has always thought also recommended god time and knowledge by william hasker the god who risks by john sanders god of the possible  satan and the problem of evil by greg body and

rev shelby boese this was a wonderful book i challenge evangelicals to rediscover the fruit of the spirit and the bible as the basis for discussing this view of god bill hybels advice would be good for many who disagree with the ov and then move to demonize their fellow believers the one clear definition of what love is is to treat every person as thought they were more important than you this means you should treat family members friends open view evangelicals employees minorities republicans and democrats as thought they are more important than you are what is missing in those who demonize others who are presenting a sincere case for a biblebased model of god is the fruit of the spirit and the love of god the open view challenged me to reread the bible and church history without the reformeddeterminist tradition filtering the older church and biblical traditions and text made me an open view personbecause it is a biblical view of god good bye aristotle was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate donald javery  stars out of  october   donald javery the authors have trespassed upon areas where they have no right to travel god the creator sees hears and knows every movement and every thought and what will transpire in each minute of each hour of each day this book if read by a majority would lose their way as far as knowing an all loving god who is guiding men through each day in the correct path they have misrepresented god and his loving power available to all he knows everything was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate jennifer billey  stars out of  november   jennifer billey this book is very thought provoking it challenges the classical and traditional view of god and helps the reader to see god in a way that she may never have thought of before the first two chapters are long and at some points difficult because of the controversial nature if your thoughts are not challenged by the evidences presented in this book maybe you should read it again was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate displaying items  of  page  of  ask a question▼▲ have a question
