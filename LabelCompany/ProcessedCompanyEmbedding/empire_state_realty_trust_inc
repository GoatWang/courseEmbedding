statements and exhibits d exhibits exhibitno description  press release announcing financial results for the second quarter   supplemental report nongaap supplemental financial measures funds from operations “ffo” we compute ffo in accordance with the “white paper” on ffo published by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit which defines ffo as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap excluding impairment writedowns of investments in depreciable real estate and investments in insubstance real estate investments gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of depreciable operating properties plus real estaterelated depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of  deferred financing costs less distributions to noncontrolling interests and gainslosses from discontinued operations and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures ffo is a widely recognized nongaap financial measure for reits that we believe when considered with financial statements determined in accordance with gaap is useful to investors in understanding financial performance and providing a relevant basis for comparison among reits in addition ffo is useful to investors as it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate has generally appreciated over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets investors should review ffo along with gaap net income when trying to understand an equity reit’s operating performance we present ffo because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits however because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results of operations the utility of ffo as a measure of performance is limited there can be no assurance that ffo presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss determined in accordance with gaap or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap ffo is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs including the ability to make cash distributions although ffo is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of reits as the nareit white paper only provides guidelines for computing ffo the computation of ffo may vary from one company to another modified funds from operations “modified ffo” modified ffo adds back an adjustment for any above or belowmarket ground lease amortization to traditionally defined ffo we consider this a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance due to the noncash accounting treatment under gaap which stems from the third quarter  acquisition of two option properties following our formation transactions as they carry significantly below market ground leases the amortization of which is material to our overall results we present modified ffo because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance in that it adds back the noncash amortization of belowmarket ground leases there can be no assurance that modified ffo presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits modified ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss determined in accordance with gaap or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap modified ffo is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs including the ability to make cash distributions  core funds from operations “core ffo” core ffo adds back to modified ffo the following items acquisition expenses deferred financing costs writeoffs prepayment penalties and acquisition breakup fee the company presents core ffo because it considers it an important supplemental measure of its operating performance in that it excludes nonrecurring items there can be no assurance that core ffo presented by the company is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits core ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss determined in accordance with gaap or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap core ffo is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs including the ability to make cash distributions in future periods we may also exclude other items from core ffo that we believe may help investors compare our results core funds available for distribution “core fad” in addition to core ffo we present core fad by iadding to core ffo nonreal estate depreciation and amortization the amortization of deferred financing costs amortization of debt discounts and noncash compensation expense and iideducting straight line rent recurring second generation leasing commissions tenant improvements prebuilts capital expenditures furniture fixtures equipment purchases amortization of debt premiums and abovebelow market rent revenue core fad is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure that management believes provides useful information regarding our ability to fund our dividends core fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss determined in accordance with gaap or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap core fad is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs including the ability to make cash distributions there can be no assurance that core fad presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits net operating income “noi” noi is a nongaap financial measure of performance noi is used by our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by ithe cost of funds of the property owner iithe impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with gaap iiiacquisition expenses and breakup fee or ivgeneral and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner the cost of funds is eliminated from noi because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner the cost of funds is eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our  office or retail properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions while certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period these gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarlytimed purchases or sales we believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs however the usefulness of noi is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs interest expense depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties and other gains and losses as stipulated by gaap the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties all of which are significant economic costs noi may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness noi is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole noi is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with gaap this measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with other companies may use different methods for calculating noi or similarly titled measures and accordingly our noi may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do ebitda we compute ebitda as net income plus interest expense income taxes and depreciation and amortization we present ebitda because we believe that ebitda along with cash flow from operating activities investing activities and financing activities provides investors with an additional indicator of its ability to incur and service debt ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of its liquidity  to the requirements of the exchange act the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized empire state realty
