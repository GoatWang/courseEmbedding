aflcio change agentedit although donahue’s personal background and career were in many respects traditional for trade union officials no aflcio leader has been more intensely focused on creating institutional change when he was elected secretarytreasurer he told a reporter “my hopes for the labor movement are growth dynamism militancy”  for donahue those meant innovation and sweeping reforms the chief vehicle for his efforts was the aflcio committee on the evolution of work which he chaired under donahue “the group has become the federation’s principal think tank for modernizing its structure” according to the new york times it eventually published three reports “the future of work” august  “the changing situation of workers and their unions” february  and “the new american workplace a labor perspective” february  “the new american workplace” is still notable for exploring “a model for a new system of work organization” one that rejects “the traditional dichotomy between thinking and doing conception and execution” and recognizes that “workers – the individuals who actually do what it is the organization is doing – are in the best position to decide how their work can most efficiently and effectively be accomplished”  but the most important report of donahue’s committee—and the one with the greatest longterm effect on american unions—was “the changing situation of workers and their unions” the new york times summarized its message as “american unions have fallen ‘behind the pace of change’ and should adopt innovative methods for representing their members and for attracting new ones” the times in a frontpage story called it a “frank study” and “the first of its type in the history of the nearly yearold aflcio” one committee member american federation of teachers president albert shanker described the report as “a revolutionary document”  similar support was expressed by other members of the committee including jack joyce president of the international union of bricklayers and allied craftworkers charles pillard president of the international brotherhood of electrical workers glenn watts president of the communications workers of america and lynn williams president of the united steelworkers several of the report’s recommendations would serve as a blueprint for some of the largest changes in the aflcio during the quartercentury that followed its publication for example donahue’s committee recommended that “consideration should be given to establishing new categories of membership for workers not employed in an organized bargaining unit”  such a significant structural change would constitute a dramatic departure from the normative way that workers became and maintained their status as union members at first it was not universally embraced when donahue presented a membership benefits program to the  aflcio convention based on his committee’s recommendation “several local and national union officials who are supposed to carry out the program say they have grave misgivings about it” the wall street journal reported “they worry that labor’s goal of bargaining collectively will be blurred by a special category of members whom the union wouldn’t fully represent and probably couldn’t count on in a strike”  but donahue’s vision ultimately won out he and his committee laid the groundwork for union privilege which today offers an array of union plus consumer benefits to union members and retirees including mortgage assistance credit cards with provisions for laidoff and striking workers supplemental medicare insurance and discounts on vision and dental care and working america the aflcio’s community affiliate for “workers without the benefit of a workplace union” who support “good jobs affordable health care worldclass education secure retirements real homeland security and more” and are eligible for union plus benefits another reform that donahue championed was systematic intensive training of a new generation of union organizers “the changing situation of workers and their unions” stated that “union organizing is a skill it is not something that everyone can do and is not something that can be taught in a oneweek training session…organizers should be extensively trained”  donahue became the leading advocate inside the aflcio of creating an organizing institute oi it was launched in  “one of my proudest accomplishments as aflcio secretarytreasurer was our creation of the aflcio organizing institute to recruit and train organizers” he commented in  the oi has trained and graduated thousands of union members staffers and students who have gone on to help organize countless american workers into unions it was emulated nine years later by the trades union congress in britain which created its own organising academy catholic social teachingedit donahue has said that the two people who sparked his early interest in the trade union movement were brother cornelius justin his teacher at manhattan college and george donahue no relation who was president of the national association of catholic trade unionists thomas donahues catholicism was always central to his career in the trade union movement along with sen ted kennedy dmass sen daniel patrick moynihan dny and former gov mario cuomo dny he became known in the s and s as an important lay advocate in public life of catholic social teaching his main focus was always workers rights in his formal role as a north american commentator to the pontifical commission on justice and peace donahue summarized his ideas in a presentation he gave at an international symposium in rome on the topic of laborem exercens pope john paul ii’s encyclical on human work he praised the popes statements that work must provide fulfillment as a human being and must be arranged so that it also corresponds to mans dignity however donahue also expressed his conviction that what the pope takes for granted as a right of association freely exercised guaranteed in a democratic society is often trampled upon in this country and others and one must conclude that it is trampled upon in pursuit of the profit motive and in an effort to exclude workers from any voice in ownership or management or indeed from any effective participation in the fixing of the conditions under which they will labor international activityedit “the american labor movement has always been involved with the wellbeing of workers in other lands” donahue wrote in a  letter to the editor of foreign affairs magazine that set out his views of the aflcio’s international role he added that “in more than  countries after world war ii the aflcio helped workers develop independent unions to protect and advance their interests both on the job and in civil society it was a relentless foe of all forms of totalitarianism it had and still has only one test by which to judge a nation is a free and democratic union movement allowed to function there”  two major areas of donahue’s own international work both as aflcio secretarytreasurer and during his retirement have been his support of the struggle against south african apartheid and his activism on behalf of cuban workers his involvement in the south african effort in the s included testifying before congress in opposition to apartheid on three occasions when the new york times columnist and humanrights advocate anthony lewis wrote in  that americans “have begun to feel a responsibility for helping to bring the cruelty of south african racism to an end” and noted that “members of congress and other political and community leaders have picketed and deliberately invited arrest by walking across police lines” the only one he mentioned by name was donahue lewis reported approvingly that donahue “said it was time to boycott south african imports and if necessary to prohibit us investment in south africa”  donahue is now a leading advocate of cuban workers’ rights in his role as chair of the committee for free trade unionism cftu he has written that the committee supports “the right of freedom of association – the right of workers to form and join unions of their own choosing run by people they elect” he has also noted that “the cftu has been active in recent years in attempts to assist workers in cuba struggling to assert that right – in the face of their government’s insistence that only one union guided by the communist party can represent them and against the background of continuing imprisonment and harassment of those who think otherwise”  in struggles elsewhere donahue as secretarytreasurer played a leading role in the aflcios critical support movement for polands solidarnosc or solidarity movement which succeeded in establishing free trade unions in the soviet bloc and was a key catalyst for the fall of communism in eastern europe donahue served as chairman of the special advisory committee to the president and secretary of state on labor and diplomacy during the tenures of secretary albright and secretary powell the committee produced reports urging among other items strengthening of the foreign service’s labor attaché program in addition the committee urged the state department to intensify its outreach activities among workers and labor unions abroad including in countries such as pakistan and afghanistan he served on the board of the national endowment for democracy ned for ten years between  and  and continues to serve on the organization’s audit  budget committee today in addition to serving as chairman of the committee for free trade unionism he is a board member of the albert shanker institute and a board member of the dunlop agricultural labor commission donahue is a past member of the boards of the council on foreign relations the carnegie corporation and the brookings institution in  donahue remarked “for former aflcio president george meany for former president lane kirkland and i hope always for myself those issues were always fairly clear either you stand on the side of democratic forces or you don’t”  irelandedit donahue first led a us labor delegation to ireland and northern ireland in  and met with the northern ireland committee of the international confederation of free trade unions icftu to discuss discrimination against catholics within northern ireland after meetings in belfast the delegation met in london with the british trade union congress to press further the case for fair employment principles in northern ireland the call for such reform was embodied in a report of the trade union delegation to northern ireland published in  during the s donahue was a strong advocate for the sullivan principles which called upon us companies operating in northern ireland to observe fair employment principles and practices because of his consistent role in advancing the struggle for human rights in northern ireland he was invited to join president clinton’s  delegation to belfast he was also named a recipient of the annual bell and thrush award by the irish american historical society in recognition and was honored to be appointed as the  grand marshal of the st patrick’s day parade in washington dc aflcio presidentedit early in  leaders of a broad crosssection of the labor federation’s unions encouraged donahue to challenge incumbent aflcio president lane kirkland owing to his sense of loyalty donahue insisted that he would not oppose kirkland who for his part maintained his intent to seek another term as a result a faction of dissenting unions decided to abandon their “draft donahue” efforts and lined up behind thenseiu president john sweeney a former donahue protégé and fellow native of the bronx new york then in the late spring of  kirkland made it known that he had changed his mind and would resign from office in august  donahue was elected president by a twotoone margin over sweeney in a vote by the aflcio’s governing body its executive council prior to the vote donahue had asked barbara easterling secretarytreasurer of the communications workers of america to join his ticket as candidate for the secretarytreasurer position easterling agreed and was duly elected as the first female officer in either of the labor federation’s two senior positions four months later john sweeney ran against donahue again this time at the federation’s biannual convention his platform included a pledge to add a third national officer executive vice president and to increase the size of the executive council from  members to  while donahue remained open to the idea of expanding the number of unions represented on the governing council he declined to solicit votes on the basis of such a concept

agent  catholic social teaching  international activity  ireland  aflcio president  honorary degrees  personal life  notes  external links early lifeedit born and raised in the bronx in new york city donahue is the son of thomas r and mary e donahue and the grandson of irish immigrants as the new york times noted he “came of age at a time when unions were helping deliver new yorkers from the depression and were perceived as a beacon for many young people”  donahue was first drawn to the trade union movement after he saw how much his father’s wages jumped when he went from being a nonunion janitor to a unionized construction worker the younger donahue worked as a best  company department store elevator operator a school bus driver a bakery worker and a doorman at radio city music hall he graduated from manhattan college in  with a degree in labor relations donahue’s union career actually started a year before that when he became a parttime organizer for the retail clerks international association from  to  he held several positions with local b the flagship local of the building service employees international union bseiu including business agent education director contractor director and publications editor meanwhile he attended night classes at fordham law school and received his law degree in  in  he became the european labor program coordinator for the free europe committee in paris he returned to the united states in  to take a position as executive assistant to david sullivan the newly elected president of the bseiu many years later donahue would tell interviewers that sullivan “remains my hero in the trade union movement he was an irish immigrant who came here in  and was an elevator operator at the start and became active in the union he then led the reform faction in the union to oust a racketdominated leadership”  donahue was nominated by president lyndon johnson as assistant secretary for labormanagement relations in the labor department in  he served in that position until the end of the johnson administration in  then returned to the service employees international union as it was by then called where he served as executive secretary and later first vicepresident he became executive assistant to the president of the aflcio george meany in  career as a labor leaderedit already an influential figure as meanys executive assistant when meany retired in  donahue was elected secretarytreasurer the secondranking position in the aflcio the week of his election the new york times reported that “his position is a strong one the federation is generally regarded as the voice of labor and mr donahue is an intelligent man with clear opinions”  he was reelected at seven aflcio biennial conventions for the next  years donahue was involved in virtually every part of the trade union movement but his strongest influence was in three areas the campaign against the north american free trade agreement nafta rejuvenation of the union movement and advancing catholic social teaching on workers’ rights naftaedit in december   president george hw bush canadian prime minister brian mulroney and mexican president carlos salinas met in texas to sign nafta which would create a trilateral trade bloc and financial zone in north america to take effect nafta had to be ratified by the legislatures in the three countries long before the signing ceremony donahue was already leading a massive campaign by the aflcio against us ratification as early as february  “the aflcio has made blocking a mexican agreement its no  legislative priority” the new york times reported the main reasons for aflcio opposition were that “it would pave the way for tens of thousands of… jobs to be exported to mexico and it would bump hundreds of thousands down the economic ladder to underemployment and low wages” donahue wrote he condemned its “powerfully regressive effect” and noted “the jobs that are most easily exported to mexico are not those of probate attorneys stockbrokers economists and editorial writers they are the jobs of assemblyline workers and others who can least afford a massive disruption of their work lives”  the aflcio was certainly not the only opponent of nafta others included ross perot among the most vocal critics of nafta the sierra club greenpeace friends of the earth the national farmers union the national council of senior citizens ralph nader’s public citizen jerry brown’s we the people and jesse jackson’s rainbow coalition however a pronafta editorial in the washington post complained that “it’s not ross perot but the labor movement that’s the central force in the campaign to kill nafta – the north american free trade agreement mr perot has little following in congress but the unions have been working ferociously to line up their friends and campaign beneficiaries against the agreement”  donahue succeeded in mobilizing the entire trade union movement against nafta the new york times reported that “within the labor movement the campaign against the accord extends far beyond the industrial unions…’our selfinterest is very similar’ said albert shanker president of the american federation of teachers when factories close he said community tax revenues plunge so teachers lose wages and jobs”  beyond the aflcio donahue oversaw what the new york times described as the federation’s “lobbying petition drives and  million in billboard and radio advertising”  he testified before congress against nafta at least nine times he appeared on such tv shows as nbc’s meet the press  and cnn’s late edition he frequently wrote articles letters to editors and oped pieces for leading newspapers and he built an unprecedented working coalition between the aflcio and leading environmentalists notably the sierra club and the national toxics campaign – the strongest relationship in the history of the two movements all of it was not enough by september  nafta’s supporters “seem to have the stronger hand the prestige of the white house as well as five of its former occupants a slew of eminent economists the nation’s most powerful business lobbies including the chamber of commerce and the national association of manufacturers and even the christian coalition the mexican government as well has poured millions of dollars into us lobbying” the philadelphia inquirer reported two months later nafta passed the house by a vote of  and the senate by a vote of  it was signed by president clinton on december   and went into effect on january   nine years later an economic policy institute briefing paper on nafta’s effects pointed out that “the rise in the us trade deficit with canada and mexico through  has caused the displacement of production that supported  us jobs most of those lost jobs were highwage positions in manufacturing industries” it continued “the loss of these jobs is just the most visible tip of naftas impact on the us economy in fact nafta has also contributed to rising income inequality suppressed real wages for production workers weakened workers collective bargaining powers and ability to organize unions and reduced fringe benefits”  aflcio change agentedit although donahue’s personal background and career were in many respects traditional for trade union officials no aflcio leader has been more intensely focused on creating institutional change when he was elected secretarytreasurer he told a reporter “my hopes for the labor movement are growth dynamism militancy”  for donahue those meant innovation and sweeping reforms the chief vehicle for his efforts was the aflcio committee on the evolution of work which he chaired under donahue “the group has become the federation’s principal think tank for modernizing its structure” according to the new york times it eventually published three reports “the future of work” august  “the changing situation of workers and their unions” february  and “the new american workplace a labor perspective” february  “the new american workplace” is still notable for exploring “a model for a new system of work organization” one that rejects “the traditional dichotomy between thinking and doing conception and execution” and recognizes that “workers – the individuals who actually do what it is the organization is doing – are in the best position to decide how their work can most efficiently and effectively be accomplished”  but the most important report of donahue’s committee—and the one with the greatest longterm effect on american unions—was “the changing situation of workers and their unions” the new york times summarized its message as “american unions have fallen ‘behind the pace of change’ and should adopt innovative methods for representing their members and for attracting new ones” the times in a frontpage story called it a “frank study” and “the first of its type in the history of the nearly yearold aflcio” one committee member american federation of teachers president albert shanker described the report as “a revolutionary document”  similar support was expressed by other members of the committee including jack joyce president of the international union of bricklayers and allied craftworkers charles pillard president of the international brotherhood of electrical workers glenn watts president of the communications workers of america and lynn williams president of the united steelworkers several of the report’s recommendations would serve as a blueprint for some of the largest changes in the aflcio during the quartercentury that followed its publication for example donahue’s committee recommended that “consideration should be given to establishing new categories of membership for workers not employed in an organized bargaining unit”  such a significant structural change would constitute a dramatic departure from the normative way that workers became and maintained their status as union members at first it was not universally embraced when donahue presented a membership benefits program to the  aflcio convention based on his committee’s recommendation “several local and national union officials who are supposed to carry out the program say they have grave misgivings about it” the wall street journal reported “they worry that labor’s goal of bargaining collectively will be blurred by a special category of members whom the union wouldn’t fully represent and probably couldn’t count on in a strike”  but donahue’s vision ultimately won out he and his committee laid the groundwork for union privilege which today offers an array of union plus consumer benefits to union members and retirees including mortgage assistance credit cards with provisions for laidoff and striking workers supplemental medicare insurance and discounts on vision and dental care and working america the aflcio’s community affiliate for “workers without the benefit of a workplace union” who support “good jobs affordable health care worldclass education secure retirements real homeland security and more” and are eligible for union plus benefits another reform that donahue championed was systematic

agent  catholic social teaching  international activity  ireland  aflcio president  honorary degrees  personal life  notes  external links early lifeedit born and raised in the bronx in new york city donahue is the son of thomas r and mary e donahue and the grandson of irish immigrants as the new york times noted he “came of age at a time when unions were helping deliver new yorkers from the depression and were perceived as a beacon for many young people”  donahue was first drawn to the trade union movement after he saw how much his father’s wages jumped when he went from being a nonunion janitor to a unionized construction worker the younger donahue worked as a best  company department store elevator operator a school bus driver a bakery worker and a doorman at radio city music hall he graduated from manhattan college in  with a degree in labor relations donahue’s union career actually started a year before that when he became a parttime organizer for the retail clerks international association from  to  he held several positions with local b the flagship local of the building service employees international union bseiu including business agent education director contractor director and publications editor meanwhile he attended night classes at fordham law school and received his law degree in  in  he became the european labor program coordinator for the free europe committee in paris he returned to the united states in  to take a position as executive assistant to david sullivan the newly elected president of the bseiu many years later donahue would tell interviewers that sullivan “remains my hero in the trade union movement he was an irish immigrant who came here in  and was an elevator operator at the start and became active in the union he then led the reform faction in the union to oust a racketdominated leadership”  donahue was nominated by president lyndon johnson as assistant secretary for labormanagement relations in the labor department in  he served in that position until the end of the johnson administration in  then returned to the service employees international union as it was by then called where he served as executive secretary and later first vicepresident he became executive assistant to the president of the aflcio george meany in  career as a labor leaderedit already an influential figure as meanys executive assistant when meany retired in  donahue was elected secretarytreasurer the secondranking position in the aflcio the week of his election the new york times reported that “his position is a strong one the federation is generally regarded as the voice of labor and mr donahue is an intelligent man with clear opinions”  he was reelected at seven aflcio biennial conventions for the next  years donahue was involved in virtually every part of the trade union movement but his strongest influence was in three areas the campaign against the north american free trade agreement nafta rejuvenation of the union movement and advancing catholic social teaching on workers’ rights naftaedit in december   president george hw bush canadian prime minister brian mulroney and mexican president carlos salinas met in texas to sign nafta which would create a trilateral trade bloc and financial zone in north america to take effect nafta had to be ratified by the legislatures in the three countries long before the signing ceremony donahue was already leading a massive campaign by the aflcio against us ratification as early as february  “the aflcio has made blocking a mexican agreement its no  legislative priority” the new york times reported the main reasons for aflcio opposition were that “it would pave the way for tens of thousands of… jobs to be exported to mexico and it would bump hundreds of thousands down the economic ladder to underemployment and low wages” donahue wrote he condemned its “powerfully regressive effect” and noted “the jobs that are most easily exported to mexico are not those of probate attorneys stockbrokers economists and editorial writers they are the jobs of assemblyline workers and others who can least afford a massive disruption of their work lives”  the aflcio was certainly not the only opponent of nafta others included ross perot among the most vocal critics of nafta the sierra club greenpeace friends of the earth the national farmers union the national council of senior citizens ralph nader’s public citizen jerry brown’s we the people and jesse jackson’s rainbow coalition however a pronafta editorial in the washington post complained that “it’s not ross perot but the labor movement that’s the central force in the campaign to kill nafta – the north american free trade agreement mr perot has little following in congress but the unions have been working ferociously to line up their friends and campaign beneficiaries against the agreement”  donahue succeeded in mobilizing the entire trade union movement against nafta the new york times reported that “within the labor movement the campaign against the accord extends far beyond the industrial unions…’our selfinterest is very similar’ said albert shanker president of the american federation of teachers when factories close he said community tax revenues plunge so teachers lose wages and jobs”  beyond the aflcio donahue oversaw what the new york times described as the federation’s “lobbying petition drives and  million in billboard and radio advertising”  he testified before congress against nafta at least nine times he appeared on such tv shows as nbc’s meet the press  and cnn’s late edition he frequently wrote articles letters to editors and oped pieces for leading newspapers and he built an unprecedented working coalition between the aflcio and leading environmentalists notably the sierra club and the national toxics campaign – the strongest relationship in the history of the two movements all of it was not enough by september  nafta’s supporters “seem to have the stronger hand the prestige of the white house as well as five of its former occupants a slew of eminent economists the nation’s most powerful business lobbies including the chamber of commerce and the national association of manufacturers and even the christian coalition the mexican government as well has poured millions of dollars into us lobbying” the philadelphia inquirer reported two months later nafta passed the house by a vote of  and the senate by a vote of  it was signed by president clinton on december   and went into effect on january   nine years later an economic policy institute briefing paper on nafta’s effects pointed out that “the rise in the us trade deficit with canada and mexico through  has caused the displacement of production that supported  us jobs most of those lost jobs were highwage positions in manufacturing industries” it continued “the loss of these jobs is just the most visible tip of naftas impact on the us economy in fact nafta has also contributed to rising income inequality suppressed real wages for production workers weakened workers collective bargaining powers and ability to organize unions and reduced fringe benefits”  aflcio change agentedit although donahue’s personal background and career were in many respects traditional for trade union officials no aflcio leader has been more intensely focused on creating institutional change when he was elected secretarytreasurer he told a reporter “my hopes for the labor movement are growth dynamism militancy”  for donahue those meant innovation and sweeping reforms the chief vehicle for his efforts was the aflcio committee on the evolution of work which he chaired under donahue “the group has become the federation’s principal think tank for modernizing its structure” according to the new york times it eventually published three reports “the future of work” august  “the changing situation of workers and their unions” february  and “the new american workplace a labor perspective” february  “the new american workplace” is still notable for exploring “a model for a new system of work organization” one that rejects “the traditional dichotomy between thinking and doing conception and execution” and recognizes that “workers – the individuals who actually do what it is the organization is doing – are in the best position to decide how their work can most efficiently and effectively be accomplished”  but the most important report of donahue’s committee—and the one with the greatest longterm effect on american unions—was “the changing situation of workers and their unions” the new york times summarized its message as “american unions have fallen ‘behind the pace of change’ and should adopt innovative methods for representing their members and for attracting new ones” the times in a frontpage story called it a “frank study” and “the first of its type in the history of the nearly yearold aflcio” one committee member american federation of teachers president albert shanker described the report as “a revolutionary document”  similar support was expressed by other members of the committee including jack joyce president of the international union of bricklayers and allied craftworkers charles pillard president of the international brotherhood of electrical workers glenn watts president of the communications workers of america and lynn williams president of the united steelworkers several of the report’s recommendations would serve as a blueprint for some of the largest changes in the aflcio during the quartercentury that followed its publication for example donahue’s committee recommended that “consideration should be given to establishing new categories of membership for workers not employed in an organized bargaining unit”  such a significant structural change would constitute a dramatic departure from the normative way that workers became and maintained their status as union members at first it was not universally embraced when donahue presented a membership benefits program to the  aflcio convention based on his committee’s recommendation “several local and national union officials who are supposed to carry out the program say they have grave misgivings about it” the wall street journal reported “they worry that labor’s goal of bargaining collectively will be blurred by a special category of members whom the union wouldn’t fully represent and probably couldn’t count on in a strike”  but donahue’s vision ultimately won out he and his committee laid the groundwork for union privilege which today offers an array of union plus consumer benefits to union members and retirees including mortgage assistance credit cards with provisions for laidoff and striking workers supplemental medicare insurance and discounts on vision and dental care and working america the aflcio’s community affiliate for “workers without the benefit of a workplace union” who support “good jobs affordable health care worldclass education secure retirements real homeland security and more” and are eligible for union plus benefits another reform that donahue championed was systematic intensive training of a new generation of union organizers “the changing situation of workers and their unions” stated that “union organizing is a skill it is not something that everyone can do and is not something that can be taught in a oneweek training session…organizers should be extensively trained”  donahue became the leading advocate inside the aflcio of creating an organizing institute oi it was launched in  “one of my proudest accomplishments as aflcio secretarytreasurer was our creation of the aflcio organizing institute to recruit and train organizers” he commented in  the oi has trained and graduated thousands of union members staffers and students who have gone on to help organize countless american workers into unions it was emulated nine years later by the trades union congress in britain which created its own organising academy catholic social teachingedit donahue has said that the two people who sparked his early interest in the trade union movement were brother cornelius justin his teacher at manhattan college and george donahue no relation who was president of the national association of catholic trade unionists thomas donahues catholicism was always central to his career in the trade union movement along with sen ted kennedy dmass sen daniel patrick moynihan dny and former gov mario cuomo dny he became known in the s and s as an important lay advocate in public life of catholic social teaching his main focus was always workers rights in his formal role as a north american commentator to the pontifical commission on justice and peace donahue summarized his ideas in a presentation he gave at an international symposium in rome on the topic of laborem exercens pope john paul ii’s encyclical on human work he praised the popes statements that work must provide fulfillment as a human being and must be arranged so that it also corresponds to mans dignity however donahue also expressed his conviction that what the pope takes for granted as a right of association freely exercised guaranteed in a democratic society is often trampled upon in this country and others and one must conclude that it is trampled upon in pursuit of the profit motive and in an effort to exclude workers from any voice in ownership or management or indeed from any effective participation in the fixing of the conditions under which they will labor international activityedit “the american labor movement has always been involved with the wellbeing of workers in other lands” donahue wrote in a  letter to the editor of foreign affairs magazine that set out his views of the aflcio’s international role he added that “in more than  countries after world war ii the aflcio helped workers develop independent unions to protect and advance their interests both on the job and in civil society it was a relentless foe of all forms of totalitarianism it had and still has only one test by which to judge a nation is a free and democratic union movement allowed to function there”  two major areas of donahue’s own international work both as aflcio secretarytreasurer and during his retirement have been his support of the struggle against south african apartheid and his activism on behalf of cuban workers his involvement in the south african effort in the s included testifying before congress in opposition to apartheid on three occasions when the new york times columnist and humanrights advocate anthony lewis wrote in  that americans “have begun to feel a responsibility for helping to bring the cruelty of south african racism to an end” and noted that “members of congress and other political and community leaders have picketed and deliberately invited arrest by walking across police lines” the only one he mentioned by name was donahue lewis reported approvingly that donahue “said it was time to boycott south african imports and if necessary to prohibit us investment in south africa”  donahue is now a leading advocate of cuban workers’ rights in his role as chair of the committee for free trade unionism cftu he has written that the committee supports “the right of freedom of association – the right of workers to form and join unions of their own choosing run by people they elect” he has also noted that “the cftu has been active in recent years in attempts to assist workers in cuba struggling to assert that right – in the face of their government’s insistence that only one union guided by the communist party can represent them and against the background of continuing imprisonment and harassment of those who think otherwise”  in struggles elsewhere donahue as secretarytreasurer played a leading role in the aflcios critical support movement for polands solidarnosc or solidarity movement which succeeded in establishing free trade unions in the soviet bloc and was a key catalyst for the fall of communism in eastern europe donahue served as chairman of the special advisory committee to the president and secretary of state on labor and diplomacy during the tenures of secretary albright and secretary powell the committee produced reports urging among other items strengthening of the foreign service’s labor attaché program in addition the committee urged the state department to intensify its outreach activities among workers and labor unions abroad including in countries such as pakistan and afghanistan he served on the board of the national endowment for democracy ned for ten years between  and  and continues to serve on the organization’s audit  budget committee today in addition to serving as chairman of the committee for free trade unionism he is a board member of the albert shanker institute and a board member of the dunlop agricultural labor commission donahue is a past member of the boards of the council on foreign relations the carnegie corporation and the brookings institution in  donahue remarked “for former aflcio president george meany for former president lane kirkland and i hope always for myself those issues were always fairly clear either you stand on the side of democratic forces or you don’t”  irelandedit donahue first led a us labor delegation to ireland and northern ireland in  and met with the northern ireland committee of the international confederation of free trade unions icftu to discuss discrimination against catholics within northern ireland after meetings in belfast the delegation met in london with the british trade union congress to press further the case for fair employment principles in northern ireland the call for such reform was embodied in a report of the trade union delegation to northern ireland published in  during the s donahue was a strong advocate for the sullivan principles which called upon us companies operating in northern ireland to observe fair employment principles and practices because of his consistent role in advancing the struggle for human rights in northern ireland he was invited to join president clinton’s  delegation to belfast he was also named a recipient of the annual bell and thrush award by the irish american historical society in recognition and was honored to be appointed as

agent  catholic social teaching  international activity  ireland  aflcio president  honorary degrees  personal life  notes  external links early lifeedit born and raised in the bronx in new york city donahue is the son of thomas r and mary e donahue and the grandson of irish immigrants as the new york times noted he “came of age at a time when unions were helping deliver new yorkers from the depression and were perceived as a beacon for many young people”  donahue was first drawn to the trade union movement after he saw how much his father’s wages jumped when he went from being a nonunion janitor to a unionized construction worker the younger donahue worked as a best  company department store elevator operator a school bus driver a bakery worker and a doorman at radio city music hall he graduated from manhattan college in  with a degree in labor relations donahue’s union career actually started a year before that when he became a parttime organizer for the retail clerks international association from  to  he held several positions with local b the flagship local of the building service employees international union bseiu including business agent education director contractor director and publications editor meanwhile he attended night classes at fordham law school and received his law degree in  in  he became the european labor program coordinator for the free europe committee in paris he returned to the united states in  to take a position as executive assistant to david sullivan the newly elected president of the bseiu many years later donahue would tell interviewers that sullivan “remains my hero in the trade union movement he was an irish immigrant who came here in  and was an elevator operator at the start and became active in the union he then led the reform faction in the union to oust a racketdominated leadership”  donahue was nominated by president lyndon johnson as assistant secretary for labormanagement relations in the labor department in  he served in that position until the end of the johnson administration in  then returned to the service employees international union as it was by then called where he served as executive secretary and later first vicepresident he became executive assistant to the president of the aflcio george meany in  career as a labor leaderedit already an influential figure as meanys executive assistant when meany retired in  donahue was elected secretarytreasurer the secondranking position in the aflcio the week of his election the new york times reported that “his position is a strong one the federation is generally regarded as the voice of labor and mr donahue is an intelligent man with clear opinions”  he was reelected at seven aflcio biennial conventions for the next  years donahue was involved in virtually every part of the trade union movement but his strongest influence was in three areas the campaign against the north american free trade agreement nafta rejuvenation of the union movement and advancing catholic social teaching on workers’ rights naftaedit in december   president george hw bush canadian prime minister brian mulroney and mexican president carlos salinas met in texas to sign nafta which would create a trilateral trade bloc and financial zone in north america to take effect nafta had to be ratified by the legislatures in the three countries long before the signing ceremony donahue was already leading a massive campaign by the aflcio against us ratification as early as february  “the aflcio has made blocking a mexican agreement its no  legislative priority” the new york times reported the main reasons for aflcio opposition were that “it would pave the way for tens of thousands of… jobs to be exported to mexico and it would bump hundreds of thousands down the economic ladder to underemployment and low wages” donahue wrote he condemned its “powerfully regressive effect” and noted “the jobs that are most easily exported to mexico are not those of probate attorneys stockbrokers economists and editorial writers they are the jobs of assemblyline workers and others who can least afford a massive disruption of their work lives”  the aflcio was certainly not the only opponent of nafta others included ross perot among the most vocal critics of nafta the sierra club greenpeace friends of the earth the national farmers union the national council of senior citizens ralph nader’s public citizen jerry brown’s we the people and jesse jackson’s rainbow coalition however a pronafta editorial in the washington post complained that “it’s not ross perot but the labor movement that’s the central force in the campaign to kill nafta – the north american free trade agreement mr perot has little following in congress but the unions have been working ferociously to line up their friends and campaign beneficiaries against the agreement”  donahue succeeded in mobilizing the entire trade union movement against nafta the new york times reported that “within the labor movement the campaign against the accord extends far beyond the industrial unions…’our selfinterest is very similar’ said albert shanker president of the american federation of teachers when factories close he said community tax revenues plunge so teachers lose wages and jobs”  beyond the aflcio donahue oversaw what the new york times described as the federation’s “lobbying petition drives and  million in billboard and radio advertising”  he testified before congress against nafta at least nine times he appeared on such tv shows as nbc’s meet the press  and cnn’s late edition he frequently wrote articles letters to editors and oped pieces for leading newspapers and he built an unprecedented working coalition between the aflcio and leading environmentalists notably the sierra club and the national toxics campaign – the strongest relationship in the history of the two movements all of it was not enough by september  nafta’s supporters “seem to have the stronger hand the prestige of the white house as well as five of its former occupants a slew of eminent economists the nation’s most powerful business lobbies including the chamber of commerce and the national association of manufacturers and even the christian coalition the mexican government as well has poured millions of dollars into us lobbying” the philadelphia inquirer reported two months later nafta passed the house by a vote of  and the senate by a vote of  it was signed by president clinton on december   and went into effect on january   nine years later an economic policy institute briefing paper on nafta’s effects pointed out that “the rise in the us trade deficit with canada and mexico through  has caused the displacement of production that supported  us jobs most of those lost jobs were highwage positions in manufacturing industries” it continued “the loss of these jobs is just the most visible tip of naftas impact on the us economy in fact nafta has also contributed to rising income inequality suppressed real wages for production workers weakened workers collective bargaining powers and ability to organize unions and reduced fringe benefits”  aflcio change agentedit although donahue’s personal background and career were in many respects traditional for trade union officials no aflcio leader has been more intensely focused on creating institutional change when he was elected secretarytreasurer he told a reporter “my hopes for the labor movement are growth dynamism militancy”  for donahue those meant innovation and sweeping reforms the chief vehicle for his efforts was the aflcio committee on the evolution of work which he chaired under donahue “the group has become the federation’s principal think tank for modernizing its structure” according to the new york times it eventually published three reports “the future of work” august  “the changing situation of workers and their unions” february  and “the new american workplace a labor perspective” february  “the new american workplace” is still notable for exploring “a model for a new system of work organization” one that rejects “the traditional dichotomy between thinking and doing conception and execution” and recognizes that “workers – the individuals who actually do what it is the organization is doing – are in the best position to decide how their work can most efficiently and effectively be accomplished”  but the most important report of donahue’s committee—and the one with the greatest longterm effect on american unions—was “the changing situation of workers and their unions” the new york times summarized its message as “american unions have fallen ‘behind the pace of change’ and should adopt innovative methods for representing their members and for attracting new ones” the times in a frontpage story called it a “frank study” and “the first of its type in the history of the nearly yearold aflcio” one committee member american federation of teachers president albert shanker described the report as “a revolutionary document”  similar support was expressed by other members of the committee including jack joyce president of the international union of bricklayers and allied craftworkers charles pillard president of the international brotherhood of electrical workers glenn watts president of the communications workers of america and lynn williams president of the united steelworkers several of the report’s recommendations would serve as a blueprint for some of the largest changes in the aflcio during the quartercentury that followed its publication for example donahue’s committee recommended that “consideration should be given to establishing new categories of membership for workers not employed in an organized bargaining unit”  such a significant structural change would constitute a dramatic departure from the normative way that workers became and maintained their status as union members at first it was not universally embraced when donahue presented a membership benefits program to the  aflcio convention based on his committee’s recommendation “several local and national union officials who are supposed to carry out the program say they have grave misgivings about it” the wall street journal reported “they worry that labor’s goal of bargaining collectively will be blurred by a special category of members whom the union wouldn’t fully represent and probably couldn’t count on in a strike”  but donahue’s vision ultimately won out he and his committee laid the groundwork for union privilege which today offers an array of union plus consumer benefits to union members and retirees including mortgage assistance credit cards with provisions for laidoff and striking workers supplemental medicare insurance and discounts on vision and dental care and working america the aflcio’s community affiliate for “workers without the benefit of a workplace union” who support “good jobs affordable health care worldclass education secure retirements real homeland security and more” and are eligible for union plus benefits another reform that donahue championed was systematic intensive training of a new generation of union organizers “the changing situation of workers and their unions” stated that “union organizing is a skill it is not something that everyone can do and is not something that can be taught in a oneweek training session…organizers should be extensively trained”  donahue became the leading advocate inside the aflcio of creating an organizing institute oi it was launched in  “one of my proudest accomplishments as aflcio secretarytreasurer was our creation of the aflcio organizing institute to recruit and train organizers” he commented in  the oi has trained and graduated thousands of union members staffers and students who have gone on to help organize countless american workers into unions it was emulated nine years later by the trades union congress in britain which created its own organising academy catholic social teachingedit donahue has said that the two people who sparked his early interest in the trade union movement were brother cornelius justin his teacher at manhattan college and george donahue no relation who was president of the national association of catholic trade unionists thomas donahues catholicism was always central to his career in the trade union movement along with sen ted kennedy dmass sen daniel patrick moynihan dny and former gov mario cuomo dny he became known in the s and s as an important lay advocate in public life of catholic social teaching his main focus was always workers rights in his formal role as a north american commentator to the pontifical commission on justice and peace donahue summarized his ideas in a presentation he gave at an international symposium in rome on the topic of laborem exercens pope john paul ii’s encyclical on human work he praised the popes statements that work must provide fulfillment as a human being and must be arranged so that it also corresponds to mans dignity however donahue also expressed his conviction that what the pope takes for granted as a right of association freely exercised guaranteed in a democratic society is often trampled upon in this country and others and one must conclude that it is trampled upon in pursuit of the profit motive and in an effort to exclude workers from any voice in ownership or management or indeed from any effective participation in the fixing of the conditions under which they will labor international activityedit “the american labor movement has always been involved with the wellbeing of workers in other lands” donahue wrote in a  letter to the editor of foreign affairs magazine that set out his views of the aflcio’s international role he added that “in more than  countries after world war ii the aflcio helped workers develop independent unions to protect and advance their interests both on the job and in civil society it was a relentless foe of all forms of totalitarianism it had and still has only one test by which to judge a nation is a free and democratic union movement allowed to function there”  two major areas of donahue’s own international work both as aflcio secretarytreasurer and during his retirement have been his support of the struggle against south african apartheid and his activism on behalf of cuban workers his involvement in the south african effort in the s included testifying before congress in opposition to apartheid on three occasions when the new york times columnist and humanrights advocate anthony lewis wrote in  that americans “have begun to feel a responsibility for helping to bring the cruelty of south african racism to an end” and noted that “members of congress and other political and community leaders have picketed and deliberately invited arrest by walking across police lines” the only one he mentioned by name was donahue lewis reported approvingly that donahue “said it was time to boycott south african imports and if necessary to prohibit us investment in south africa”  donahue is now a leading advocate of cuban workers’ rights in his role as chair of the committee for free trade unionism cftu he has written that the committee supports “the right of freedom of association – the right of workers to form and join unions of their own choosing run by people they elect” he has also noted that “the cftu has been active in recent years in attempts to assist workers in cuba struggling to assert that right – in the face of their government’s insistence that only one union guided by the communist party can represent them and against the background of continuing imprisonment and harassment of those who think otherwise”  in struggles elsewhere donahue as secretarytreasurer played a leading role in the aflcios critical support movement for polands solidarnosc or solidarity movement which succeeded in establishing free trade unions in the soviet bloc and was a key catalyst for the fall of communism in eastern europe donahue served as chairman of the special advisory committee to the president and secretary of state on labor and diplomacy during the tenures of secretary albright and secretary powell the committee produced reports urging among other items strengthening of the foreign service’s labor attaché program in addition the committee urged the state department to intensify its outreach activities among workers and labor unions abroad including in countries such as pakistan and afghanistan he served on the board of the national endowment for democracy ned for ten years between  and  and continues to serve on the organization’s audit  budget committee today in addition to serving as chairman of the committee for free trade unionism he is a board member of the albert shanker institute and a board member of the dunlop agricultural labor commission donahue is a past member of the boards of the council on foreign relations the carnegie corporation and the brookings institution in  donahue remarked “for former aflcio president george meany for former president lane kirkland and i hope always for myself those issues were always fairly clear either you stand on the side of democratic forces or you don’t”  irelandedit donahue first led a us labor delegation to ireland and northern ireland in  and met with the northern ireland committee of the international confederation of free trade unions icftu to discuss discrimination against catholics within northern ireland after meetings in belfast the delegation met in london with the british trade union congress to press further the case for fair employment principles in northern ireland the call for such reform was embodied in a report of the trade union delegation to northern ireland published in  during the s donahue was a strong advocate for the sullivan principles which called upon us companies operating in northern ireland to observe fair employment principles and practices because of his consistent role in advancing the struggle for human rights in northern ireland he was invited to join president clinton’s  delegation to belfast he was also named a recipient of the annual bell and thrush award by the irish american historical society in recognition and was honored to be appointed as the  grand marshal of the st patrick’s day parade in washington dc aflcio presidentedit early in  leaders of a broad crosssection of the labor federation’s unions encouraged donahue to challenge incumbent aflcio president lane kirkland owing to his sense of loyalty donahue insisted that he would not oppose kirkland who for his part maintained his intent to seek another term as a result a faction of dissenting unions decided to abandon their “draft donahue” efforts and lined up behind thenseiu president john sweeney a former donahue protégé and fellow native of the bronx new york then in the late spring of  kirkland made it known that he had changed his mind and would resign from office in august  donahue was elected president by a twotoone margin over sweeney in a vote by the aflcio’s governing body its executive council prior to the vote donahue had asked barbara easterling secretarytreasurer of the communications workers of america to join his ticket as candidate for the secretarytreasurer position easterling agreed and was duly elected as the first female officer in either of the labor federation’s two senior positions four months later john sweeney ran against donahue again this time at the federation’s biannual convention his platform included a pledge to add a third national officer executive vice president and to increase the size of the executive council from  members to  while donahue remained open to the idea of expanding the number of unions represented on the governing council he declined to solicit votes on the basis of such a concept
