division of investment management office of investment company regulation end further info end preamble start supplemental information supplementary information the following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained for a fee at the public reference desk us securities and exchange commission  f street ne washington dc  telephone   applicants representations  mfs is an investment adviser registered under the investment advisers act of  mfs serves as investment adviser to the funds mfd is registered as a brokerdealer under the securities exchange act of  and serves as distributor of the funds  the trusts are massachusetts business trusts registered under the act as openend management investment companies the trusts currently offer  series  of which are “toptier funds”  and  of which are “underlying funds”  the toptier funds will invest substantially all of their assets in the underlying funds the toptier funds and certain of the underlying funds currently offer multiple classes of shares in reliance on rule f under the act  mfs and the trusts propose to enter into a special servicing agreement that would allow an underlying fund to bear the expenses of a toptier fund other than advisory fees rule b fees and classspecific administrative service fees under the special servicing agreement each underlying fund will bear expenses of a toptier fund in proportion to the estimated benefits to the underlying fund arising from the investment in the underlying fund by the toptier fund “underlying fund benefits”  applicants state that the underlying fund benefits are expected to result primarily from the incremental increase in assets resulting from investment in the underlying fund by the toptier fund and the large asset size of each shareholder account that represents an investment by the toptier fund relative to other shareholder accounts a shareholder account that represents a toptier fund will experience fewer shareholder transactions and greater predictability of transaction activity than other shareholder accounts as a result the shareholder servicing costs to any underlying fund for servicing one account registered to a toptier fund will be significantly less than the cost to that same underlying fund of servicing the same pool of assets contributed by a large group of shareholders owning relatively small accounts in one or more underlying funds in addition by reducing toptier fund expenses the special servicing agreement may lead to increased assets being invested in the toptier funds which in turn would lead to increased assets being invested in the underlying funds which could enable the underlying funds to control and reduce their expense ratios because their operating expenses will be spread over a larger asset base  no fund will enter into a special servicing agreement unless the special servicing agreement  precisely describes the services provided to the toptier fund and the fees for those services charged to the toptier fund that may be paid by the underlying fund “underlying fund payments”  provides that no affiliated person of the toptier funds or affiliated person of such person will receive directly or indirectly any portion of the underlying fund payments except for bona fide transfer agent services approved by the board of trustees “board” of the underlying fund including a majority of trustees who are not “interested persons” within the meaning of section a of the act “independent trustees”  provides that the underlying fund payments may not exceed the amount of actual expenses incurred by the toptier funds  provides that no underlying fund will reimburse transfer agent expenses of a toptier fund including start printed page subaccounting expenses and other outofpocket expenses at a rate in excess of the average per account transfer agent expenses of the underlying fund including subaccounting expenses and other outofpocket expenses expressed as a basis point charge for purposes of calculating the underlying funds average per account transfer agent expense the toptier funds investment in the underlying fund will be excluded and  has been approved by the funds board including a majority of the independent trustees as being in the best interests of the fund and its shareholders and not involving overreaching on the part of any person concerned applicants legal analysis  section d of the act and rule d under the act provide that an affiliated person of or a principal underwriter for a registered investment company or an affiliate of such person or principal underwriter acting as principal shall not participate in or effect any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which the registered investment company is a participant unless the commission has issued an order approving the arrangement mfs as investment adviser is an affiliated person of each of the underlying funds and toptier funds which in turn could be deemed to be under common control of mfs and therefore affiliated persons of each other the toptier funds and the underlying funds also may be affiliated persons by virtue of a toptier funds ownership of more than  of the outstanding voting securities of an underlying fund consequently the special servicing agreement could be deemed to be a joint transaction among the toptier funds the underlying funds and mfs  rule d under the act provides that in passing upon a joint arrangement under the rule the commission will consider whether participation of the investment company in the joint enterprise or joint arrangement on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants request an order under section d and rule d to permit them to enter into the special servicing agreement applicants state that participation by the toptier funds the underlying funds and mfs in the proposed special servicing agreement is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and that the terms of the special servicing agreement and the conditions set forth below will ensure that no participant participates on a basis less advantageous than that of other participants applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions  no fund will enter into a special servicing agreement unless the special servicing agreement a precisely describes the services provided to the toptier funds and the underlying fund payments b provides that no affiliated person of the toptier funds or affiliated person of such person will receive directly or indirectly any portion of the underlying fund payments except for bona fide transfer agent services approved by the board of the underlying fund including a majority of the independent trustees c provides that the underlying fund payments may not exceed the amount of actual expenses incurred by the toptier funds d provides that no underlying fund will reimburse transfer agent expenses of a toptier fund including subaccounting expenses and other outofpocket expenses at a rate in excess of the average per account transfer agent expenses of the underlying fund including subaccounting expenses and other outofpocket expenses expressed as a basis point charge for purposes of calculating the underlying funds average per account transfer agent expense the toptier funds investment in the underlying fund will be excluded and e has been approved by the funds board including a majority of the independent trustees as being in the best interests of the fund and its shareholders and not involving overreaching on the part of any person concerned  in approving a special servicing agreement the board of an underlying fund will consider without limitation a the reasons for the underlying funds entering into the special servicing agreement b information quantifying the underlying fund benefits c the extent to which investors in the toptier fund could have purchased shares of the underlying fund d the extent to which an investment in the toptier fund represents or would represent a consolidation of accounts in the underlying funds through exchanges or otherwise or a reduction in the rate of increase in the number of accounts in the underlying funds e the extent to which the expense ratio of the underlying fund was reduced following investment in the underlying fund by the toptier fund and the reasonably foreseeable effects of the investment by the toptier fund on the underlying funds expense ratio f the reasonably foreseeable effects of participation in the special servicing agreement on the underlying funds expense ratio and g any conflicts of interest that mfs any affiliated person of mfs or any other affiliated person of the underlying fund may have relating to the underlying funds participation in the special servicing agreement  prior to approving a special servicing agreement on behalf of an underlying fund the board of the underlying fund including a majority of the independent trustees will determine that a the underlying fund payments under the special servicing agreement are expenses that the underlying fund would have incurred if the shareholders of the toptier fund had instead purchased shares of the underlying fund through the same brokerdealer or other financial intermediary b the amount of the underlying fund payments is less than the amount of underlying fund benefits and c by entering into the special servicing agreement the underlying fund is not engaging directly or indirectly in financing any activity which is primarily intended to result in the sale of shares issued by the underlying fund  in approving a special servicing agreement the board of a fund will request and evaluate and mfs will furnish such information as may reasonably be necessary to evaluate the terms of the special servicing agreement and the factors set forth in condition  above and make the determinations set forth in conditions  and  above  approval by the funds board including a majority of the independent trustees in accordance with conditions  through  above will be required at least annually after the funds entering into a special servicing agreement and prior to any material amendment to a special servicing agreement  to the extent underlying fund payments are treated in whole or in part as a class expense of an underlying fund or are used to pay a classbased expense of a toptier fund conditions  through  above must be met with respect to each class of a fund as well as the fund as a whole  each fund will maintain and preserve the boards findings and determinations set forth in conditions  and  above and the information and considerations on which they were
