should they leave in the mids capital began to include research analysts in the management of the portfolios reserving a portion of each to allow analysts to pursue their highest conviction investment ideas capital group’s longterm approach has helped it avoid some of the pitfalls that have plagued other firms in the late s the firm was criticized for not offering thenpopular tech funds but when the tech bubble burst capital was praised for not jumping on the bandwagon in the early s new share classes and offerings were introduced such as a  college savings plan and retirement target date funds named for the expected year of withdrawal the target date funds automatically rebalance their mix of equities and fixedincome holdings as the investor approaches the expected date of retirement
