support fees and hosting fees we define churn as the percentage of rr that does not renew rr increased  or  to  of total revenue for the quarter ended april   compared to the same period last year and

and enhance the marketing sales and servicing activities for our customers in order to help them sell and service more parts garments accessories and whole goods differentiate our content we believe we have the largest library of replacement part major unit and pga content in the vertical markets we serve however simply offering the largest content library in the markets we serve is not sufficient to drive the longterm revenue growth we desire we strive to deliver more value to our customers through the enrichment of our content and have recently made the following enhancements � oem parts content expansion  weve authored notable content for three new brand catalogs in the powersports market � pga content expansion  new content has been authored for the rv and powersports markets enter new markets ari currently maintains a significant share in our core vertical markets of ope powersports marine rv and appliances accordingly we anticipate low singledigit growth in these markets ari maintains a lower share in our growth vertical markets of hme atw automotive and aa accordingly we are targeting doubledigit growth in these markets as we continue to increase our share in our current markets leveraging our technology in new and underserved markets will be important to attaining high single digit to low double digit organic growth rates ari currently has more than  dealer websites in the atw market we estimate that the total addressable market includes approximately  dealers further the broader aa market which we entered via our acquisition of dci comprises nearly  independent service providers more than all of our other markets combined we intend to continue to invest heavily in this growth market including seeking opportunities to leverage our products and services in the broader aa we are one of the first website providers to service the hme market we estimate that this market comprises nearly  service providers and believe the market to be in the early stages of ecommerce adoption expand geographically although we maintain relationships with dealers throughout the world we have low penetration into international markets growing our international business will require us to secure and publish electronic content from manufacturers outside the us and make changes to our existing product suite that will allow us to rapidly deploy these products in a scalable and efficient manner without the need to have boots on the ground in those countries nurture and retain existing customers through worldclass customer service and valueadded product feature updates in order to achieve sustained high singledigit or low doubledigit organic growth we not only need to execute the growth strategies described above we must also retain our existing customers in a saas business the cost to retain an existing customer is much less than the cost to acquire a new customer accordingly customer churn is an important metric we track and manage we experienced improvements in our churn rates the past several years as a result of strategic actions taken by the company all of which are designed to enhance the stickiness of our products within our customers operations in fiscal  we experienced a decrease in customer churn from  for the twelve months ended april   to  for the twelve months ended april   we will continue to leverage our relationships with existing customers and closely monitor and manage the level of customer churn lead the market with open integration to related platforms one of our strategic advantages is our focus on integrating our solutions with dealer business management systems dms to pass key information including customer and transactional data between our solutions and the dms saving our customers valuable time and eliminating redundant data entry we currently have integration capabilities with over  dms and we continue to seek other strategic alliances that can be integrated with our product and service offerings we recently integrated our website offerings in the powersports marine and rv markets with cdk global to provide dealers with websites and enhanced integrations to their dms this new offering allows dealers to instantly post unit inventory as well as available parts and accessories to their website directly from their cdk lightspeed system successfully execute acquisitions that align with our core strategy since  we have had a formal corporate development program aimed at identifying evaluating and closing acquisitions that align with our strategy we focus on verticallyoriented markets with a large base of independent multiline dealers that sell and service complex equipment our strategy is to acquire companies that allow us to do one or more of the following i expand our market share in existing verticals ii expand into new markets that fit our desired profile iii provide us with complementary products which can be crosssold to our existing customer base iv provide opportunities to crosssell our existing products and v can be integrated into our operations thereby creating costsaving synergies from the programs inception through april
