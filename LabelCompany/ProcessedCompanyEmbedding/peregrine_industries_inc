entitled peregrine industries inc v the peregrine corporation civil action no sa cv  glt rnrx plaintiff the peregrine corporation filed a motion to enjoin defendants peregrine industries inc and richard a voit from prosecuting the california action in response defendants filed a crossmotion to stay dismiss or transfer to the central district of california on tuesday june   oral argument was heard on these motions after the completion of oral argument i granted defendants motion to stay dismiss or transfer to the central district of california and denied plaintiffs motion to enjoin prosecution of the california action i write now to explain my reasons  i plaintiff the peregrine corporation tpc was incorporated under the laws of new jersey on december   plaintiff is in the business of providing training and consulting services in the use of firearms to police departments security agencies and members of the general public throughout the united states under the trade name the peregrine corporation and has continually used its service mark and trademark peregrine as well as its peregrine falcon logo presently plaintiffs principal place of business is mertztown pennsylvania defendant peregrine industries inc pii is a california corporation which maintains its only corporate office and only physical plant in huntington beach california defendant pii adopted the tradename peregrine industries inc in  and since that time has been involved in presale engineering and development of a semiautomatic handgun product to be marketed under the trademark falcon a limited introductory collectors edition of the handgun is to be designated the phoenix defendant richard voit is the president of pii pii has not yet sold a single product and has engaged in only limited presale promotional activities in september of  pii sent out a twopage press release announcing that it was a new firearms manufacturer in march of  pii mailed an introductory letter to specially selected gun enthusiasts to whom pii wished to extend offers to place reservations for subsequent purchases of a limited collectors edition of the falcon pistol designated the phoenix pistol later in march of  an introductory product catalog for piis falcon mm semiautomatic handgun appeared in the march  edition of american firearms industry a trade publication which is circulated to firearms manufacturers and retailers throughout the united states both of the promotional pieces in march of  were circulated throughout the united states plaintiff through its chicago counsel first notified pii of its alleged claim of common law trademark infringement in a letter to pii dated july   the management of pii referred the letter to its counsel who thereafter engaged in communications with plaintiff and its counsel in an effort to understand the factual basis for plaintiffs claims and in an attempt to amicably resolve the matter in early january  after six months of fruitless settlement negotiations plaintiffs chicago counsel sent another letter to pii threatening immediate litigation at that point and after determining that plaintiff was properly subject to jurisdiction and venue in the central district of california pii filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against plaintiff on january   during an april   telephone conversation with plaintiffs new york counsel it became apparent to piis counsel that litigation remained imminent and that a reasonable settlement was unlikely therefore on the afternoon of thursday april   piis counsel transmitted to plaintiffs new york counsel by facsimile a letter informing plaintiff that pii had previously filed the california complaint which would be served upon plaintiff that letter further inquired as to whether plaintiffs new york counsel was authorized to accept service of process on behalf of his client on april   the day after receiving a copy of the letter dated april   plaintiffs new york counsel filed the complaint in this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania after the pennsylvania complaint was filed it was quickly dispatched along with a summons to a california process server for immediate service upon pii on tuesday april   the pennsylvania complaint and summons were served upon mr voit also on tuesday april   plaintiffs new york counsel responded to piis letter dated april   informing piis counsel that he was not authorized to accept service of process on wednesday april   the complaint and summons in the california action were served upon plaintiff at its principal place of business in addition on april   pii mailed a  duplicate service of process to plaintiffs statutory agent for service by united states postal service express mail ii in its motion to stay dismiss or transfer to the central district of california defendants contend that because its action was the first to be filed this court should refrain from assuming jurisdiction over the action and should permit the litigation to proceed in the california action plaintiff on the other hand contends that this action should proceed and that the california action should be enjoined because defendants in this action were served before the defendant in the california action in addition plaintiff argues that at the time the complaint for declaratory judgment was filed in california there was no justiciable controversy and thus that the complaint was prematurely filed the united states supreme court first established what has come to be known as the firstfiled rule in smith v mciver  us  wheat   l ed   in which the court stated in all cases of concurrent jurisdiction the court which first has possession of the subject must decide it id at  then in  the third circuit court of appeals in crosley corp v hazeltine corp  fd  d cir borrowed this quote and clarified the rule by speaking explicitly to federal concurrent jurisdiction in crosley the court stated it was long ago laid down by chief justice marshall as a salutary rule that in all cases of concurrent jurisdiction the court which first has possession of the subject must decide it it is of obvious importance to all litigants to have a single determination of their controversy rather than several decisions which if they conflict may require separate appeals to different circuit courts of appeals no party has a vested right to have his cause tried by one judge rather than by another of equal jurisdiction the party who first brings a controversy into a court of competent jurisdiction for adjudication should as far as our dual system permits be free from the vexation of subsequent litigation over the same subject matter the economic waste involved in duplicating litigation is obvious equally important is its adverse effect upon the prompt and efficient administration of justice in view of the constant increase in judicial business in the federal courts and the continual necessity of adding to the number of judges at the expense of the taxpayers public policy requires us to seek actively to avoid the waste of judicial time and energy id at  citations omitted prior to the decision in eeoc v university of pennsylvania  fd  d cir the third circuit court of appeals had never specifically referred to the rule as the firstfiled rule instead the third circuit had referred to the rule in terms of which court first had possession of the subject and the court first obtaining jurisdiction of the parties and the issues as a result in national patent development corp v american hospital supply corp  f supp  sdny the court noted that in the third circuit it appeared that jurisdiction over the person rather than the filing of the complaint was controlling for purposes of determining the priority of two lawsuits involving the same parties and the same issues id at  n  however in eeoc v university of pennsylvania the third circuit court of appeals for the first time specifically referred to the rule as the firstfiled rule the issue before the court in eeoc was whether the district judge abused his discretion by refusing to dismiss the secondfiled suit in favor of the firstfiled suit in determining which was the firstfiled suit the court looked only to the dates that the complaints in the two lawsuits were filed in fact the court never even mentioned the dates of service of process although the court decided that the district judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to dismiss the secondfiled suit the court emphasized invocation of the rule will usually be the norm not the exception courts  must be presented with exceptional circumstances before exercising their discretion to depart from the firstfiled rule id at  although the third circuit court of appeals has never specifically addressed the significance if any of the dates of service of process with respect to determining the priority as between two lawsuits dealing with the same parties and the same issues in light of the decision in eeoc two things are clear  the third circuit has embraced the firstfiled rule and  the firstfiled rule as its name indicates is premised upon a priority of filing the complaint  not upon a priority of serving the complaint therefore in the present case the california action filed on january   is the firstfiled at oral argument plaintiff made four arguments why this court should depart from the the firstfiled rule first plaintiff argued that the california court does not have personal jurisdiction over it and that venue is not proper in the central district of california it appears from the declaration of emanuel kapelsohn president of tpc that the california court does have personal jurisdiction over plaintiff because plaintiff does business in california in paragraph  of his declaration mr kapelsohn admits that one of his customers is the police department of the city of burbank in california burbank is located in the central district of california because the california action is an action for declaratory judgment section a of title  of the united states code applies for the purpose of determining whether venue is proper in the central district of california section a provides a civil action wherein jurisdiction is founded on diversity of citizenship may except as otherwise provided by law be brought in  a judicial district where any defendant resides if all defendants reside in the same state  a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated or  a judicial district in which the defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction at the time that the action is commenced  usc § a section c provides for purposes of venue under this chapter a defendant that is a corporation shall be deemed to reside in any judicial district in which it is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced in a state which has more than one judicial district and in which a defendant that is a corporation is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time an action is commenced such corporation shall be deemed to reside in any district in that state within which its contacts would be sufficient to subject it to personal jurisdiction if that district were a separate state and if there is no such district the corporation shall be deemed to reside in the district within which it has the most significant contacts  usc § c under either of the three alternative bases set forth in section a venue  appears to be proper in the central district of california pursuant to the second basis for venue there can be no doubt that a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim of trademark infringement occurred in the central district of california because the first and third bases for venue are grounded upon personal jurisdiction the district court in the central district of california is proper for venue purposes as long as it has personal jurisdiction over tpc as stated earlier based upon the record before this court it appears that the district court in the central district of california has personal jurisdiction over tpc however if personal jurisdiction over tpc becomes an issue in the california action then that issue should be decided by the district court in the central district of california not by this court second tpc contended that on january   when the complaint was filed in california no justiciable controversy existed and therefore that the complaint was filed prematurely this argument has no merit first in september of  pii sent out a twopage press release announcing that it was a new firearms manufacturer second in a letter dated january   to pii tpcs chicago counsel stated not only is your use of our clients mark likely to cause confusion and mistake and to deceive it has actually done so and continues to do so since the time of mr kapelsohns letter and telephone conversation with you he and peregrine have received numerous inquiries and continue to receive them both from longstanding clients and customers and from previously unknown individuals concerning the bren ten pistol that you marketing as the peregrine falcone and our client peregrines connection with it see exhibit  of plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction pursuant to rule  of the federal rules of civil procedure emphasis added therefore because plaintiff admitted that actual confusion existed as of january   it cannot now be heard to argue that actual confusion did not yet exist as of january   and thus that no justiciable controversy existed when the complaint was filed third plaintiff maintained that pii acted in bad faith by waiting until april   to serve the complaint filed on january   pii served the complaint within  days after it was filed as required by rule j of the federal rules of civil procedure at oral argument pii stated that the reason that it did not serve the complaint immediately after its filing was because settlement negotiations were still proceeding between the parties and that sometime after the complaint was filed in january tpcs new york counsel got involved in the controversy between tpc and pii based upon the record before this court i cannot say that pii acted in bad faith in not serving the complaint soon after it was filed pii did not violate any rule of procedure by waiting until april   to serve the complaint in addition filing the complaint in january and waiting to serve it until april may have been a tactical decision on the part of piis counsel attorneys make tactical decisions with respect to how to proceed with cases everyday and i cannot conclude without more that a tactical decision with respect to when to file and serve a complaint amounts to bad faith moreover even if pii had served the complaint on tpc immediately or soon after it was filed piis california action still would have been the firstfiled lawsuit hence it is difficult to understand how tpc was prejudiced by piis waiting to serve the complaint until april   finally tpc argues that the california action should be enjoined because this action the secondfiled action has developed  further than the firstfiled action this argument is also without merit the only things that have taken place in the present action is one telephone conference one hearing and the disposition of two pending motions pertaining to jurisdictional issues in the firstfiled action tpc has already filed an answer whereas in this action pii never filed an answer the work that the parties have done in preparing and responding to tpcs motions for a temporary restraining order and for a preliminary injunction will not be wasted because they will be transferred to the firstfiled action in the central district of california after considering the motions responses and supporting memoranda as well as the parties oral arguments i am not persuaded to abandon the general rule that when there are two lawsuits involving the same parties and the same issues pending in two different courts the firstfiled action takes priority over the secondfiled action and should proceed with the litigation although i do have discretion to depart from the firstfiled rule i can only do so when i am presented with exceptional circumstances eeoc v university of pennsylvania  fd   d cir i do not find any exceptional circumstances in the present case and thus shall invoke the firstfiled rule and transfer this action to the central district of california to be consolidated with peregrine industries inc v the peregrine corporation civil action no sa cv  glt rnrx notes  in american modern home ins v insured accounts co  f supp  sdohio  plaintiffs argued that the fact that they served their adversaries on may   while the plaintiffs in the firstfiled action pending in missouri perfected service on june   should weigh in favor of abandoning the firstfiled rule the court in addressing that argument stated this issue was squarely addressed by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit in barbergreene co v blawknox co  fd  th cir in an opinion by then circuit judge potter stewart the court held that because an action is commenced upon filing per fedrcivp  the first commenced action should receive preference over a later commenced action for which service of process was more swiftly achieved admittedly the barbergreene litigants were governed by a different rule  which then placed responsibility for service of process upon the federal marshal today parties bear the responsibility themselves to serve each other this change however does not bear upon the reasoning behind the first to file rule and does not provide a basis to distinguish the ruling of barbergreene the basic reasoning of barbergreene remains sound and controlling as the filing of a suit is still a far better touchstone for determining chronological preference of cases id at  emphasis added  although tpc argues that the court in california does not have personal jurisdiction over it and that venue is improper tpc filed its answer to the complaint in the california action rather than filing a motion to dismiss under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue i note that in its answer under a section entitled affirmative defenses tpc asserts lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue however the issue of whether there is personal jurisdiction and proper venue is not currently before the court in california by way of a motion peregrine industries inc
