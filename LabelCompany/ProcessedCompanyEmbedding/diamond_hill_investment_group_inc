diamond hill experienced net cash inflows of  million during  as inflows to its proprietary and subadvised funds more than offset outflows in its institutional accounts combined with investment gains of nearly  billion this led the companys aum to grow to  billion as of dec   up from  billion at the end of  diamond hills higher aum helped to drive investment advisory revenue higher by  year over year to  million mutual fund administration revenue however declined  to  million mainly due to diamond hills sale of its beacon hill fund services business in june  in all total revenue rose  to  million however net operating income grew only  to  million as operating expenses increased  to  million the increase in operating expenses was primarily related to higher compensation and mutual fund administration costs investment income was  billion up from a loss of  million in  these gains and losses can change significantly from one period to another and market fluctuations can distort the underlying operating performance of the company as such diamond hills management focuses more on net operating income after tax a metric that excludes the impact of investment related activity in this regard net operating income after tax rose  to  million and increased  on a pershare basis to  looking forward as a primarily equityfocused investment company diamond hills nearterm results will be driven largely by the rise and fall of the stock market while this can create volatility in its quarterly results the upward trajectory of the market should serve as a tailwind for diamond hills longterm results however another major trend could serve a headwind the flow of capital toward passive index investments and away from actively managed funds diamond hill is attempting to combat this trend by steadily reducing its fund fees which should help to lessen the cost advantages that index funds have over its actively managed products but diamond hills funds will likely always be higherpriced alternatives to index funds because of the inherent higher cost structures of active equity and fixedincome research as such diamond hills best move is to deliver on its stated goal to achieve net of fee returns that exceed passive alternatives over time such performance would be worthy of higher fees and it could allow diamond hill to grow its assets under management by taking share from other active fund managers even if the overall industry continues to contract in the years ahead joe tenebruso has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends diamond

the end of q  the current bull market has been a boon for diamond hill image source getty images in turn diamond hills investment advisory fees increased  to  million despite a basispoint yearoveryear decrease in its average advisory fee rate to  mutual fund administration fees however fell  to  million due to the sale of its beacon hill business as well as a decline in the net administration fee rate to  from  in the year ago period net operating income increased  to  million as operating margins held steady at  investment income was  million up from  million in the prioryear quarter net income which benefited from a lower effective tax rate jumped  to  million yet because market fluctuations can cause investment income to change significantly from one period to another diamond hills management focuses more on net operating income after tax which excludes the impact of investmentrelated activity in this regard adjusted net operating income after tax increased  to  million and  on a pershare basis to  looking forward diamond hill continues to buck the trend toward passive investment strategies it once again enjoyed net inflows in the first quarter even as much of the industry is seeing capital flow to index funds and away from the type of actively managed funds that diamond hill operates yet it remains to be seen how long diamond hill can continue to fight  and win  this uphill battle still with a proven investing philosophy a culture focused on fulfilling its fiduciary responsibility to clients and a track record of success in both the management and marketing of its funds diamond hill should be able to weather the storm better than most in fact it could continue to grow its assets under management by taking share from faltering competitors even if the overall
