yield headaches for advisers who bought them for income top analysts in the sector see a bear market as investors pumped  billion into energy funds over the last year jul     pm by trevor hunnicutt  zoom energyinfrastructure partnerships which had been a successful approach for advisers to deliver rich yields to incomestarved clients with fewer tax consequences have decidedly fallen into what some call a bear marketdespite yields often exceeding  the energy limited partnership category tracked by morningstar inc is off  over the year ended tuesday some analysts view the performance as the chickens coming home to roost “what we suggest to people is that you look for income but you do not stretch for income” said richard bernstein chief executive officer of richard bernstein advisors a firm that focuses on incomeoriented investment strategies other than mlps masterlimited partnerships largely include publicly traded energyinfrastructure companies whose owners receive some favorable tax treatment they can be held by individuals or fundsmr bernstein said a heavy implicit sector bet on energy could be hurting investors“the more that youre deviating from the market yield youre taking on additional risk he said there is no free lunch”for mr bernstein a key indicator can be found on the firms earnings statements the average oilandgas midstream company listed in the us an important component of the investible universe for mlps has a negative total free cashflow yield for the last  months according to data compiled by morningstar thats a measure of the money those partnerships have left over after they make investments in their business and an indicator of what little cash remains for unitholders as mlp owners are calledbeyond me“why someone would invest in an income investment that has a negative cashflow yield is beyond me” said mr bernstein formerly the chief investment strategist of merrill lynch  co inc “if the average financial adviser is not aware that the industry is free cashflow negative i think they have to do some looking at the portfolio some serious reevaluation of risk is necessary”another factor is a highyield bond market that may be pricing in the risk of defaults in the energy sector as oil prices have fallen“clearly the recent performance of this asset class has been sloppy testing the patience of investors” mark litzerman an investment strategist at the adviserserving wells fargo investment institute said in a note last wednesdaythose investors have made the asset class a draw even in a market thats looking bearish some  billion moved into openend mutual funds and etfs in morningstars energy limited partnership category over the last year — a figure putting it among the top fundraising categories of those products that doesnt include closedend funds or the securities themselves which can be traded on exchanges too much capital too few ideas“because of the surge in interest in mlps and in energyrelated investments the cost of capital to the companies has dropped quite substantially and therefore theyve expanded like crazy” said mr bernstein “the amount of capital flowing into the ideas is going up and youre going to have too much capital chasing too few ideas”kyri loupis disagrees the mlp specialist and portfolio manager at goldman sachs asset management a former energy analysts at lehman brothers said inflows into the market are no longer enough to support demand for capital and he said a recent selloff has been driven more by “technical” factors including sellers and shortsellers of exchangetraded funds and notes“its been a painful few months quite honestly” said mr loupis a manager of the goldman sachs mlp energy infrastructure fund glpax whose institutional share class has returned negative  this year putting it in the th percentile among funds ranked in the same category by morningstar mr loupis credits some of that to comparisons against funds whose legal structure helps their tax accounting more in down markets “were a victim of our own success he said we grew the sector too much”back in  mr loupis said the partnerships were underownedstill he and a number of investors are now making the case for sticking with the asset class despite tightening monetary policy that will raise borrowing costs for an industry heavily dependent on making investments in oilandgas distribution infrastructure at the right cost“in a world where pretty much every other asset is at an alltime high” he said mlps are valued relatively cheaplyamong the bulls points the revenue in the partnerships — often derived from heavily regulated contracts negotiated in advance with energy producers — may matter much more than borrowing costs and the increasing dominance of the us in producing natural gas and oil — including from shale formations such as the bakken formation in and around north dakota — may mean long continued demand for distribution infrastructurealternative metricsmr litzerman proposes alternative metrics for investors to examine other than cash flow one is the industrys potentially healthy levels of production and capital expenditures a kind of longterm investment in the businessanother metric is the spread or difference between distribution yields of mlps in the alerian mlp index and those offered by the barclays baa municipal index a collection of lowcredit municipal bonds that like mlps enjoy favorable tax treatment mr litzerman said the fact that this spread is almost as large as it has been over the last five years indicates that those mlp yields are relatively attractive“the relatively highdistribution yields available from mlps have been one of the primary attractions for individual investors seeking higher income” he said “although they are not taxexempt they are taxdeferred being treated as a return of capital as such many investors are likely to compare the distribution yield available to the yield on municipal bonds”however he conceded that the history of many mlp investments are limited “making it difficult to draw historical comparisons”“the recent selloff for them has mostly been due to energy prices and oil” said matt cody chair of the asset allocation committee at wetherby asset management whose firm has been weighing increasing its allocation to the investments you see the market trade periodically on what energy prices are doing but over time people tend to realize that their funds are necessarily linked with oil prices“as long as theres still demand theyre going to do fine and theyre not really affected by oversupply” he said  comments what do you think view comments please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus recommended for you related stories
