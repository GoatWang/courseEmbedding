discotech and browse the most popular nightclubs in las vegas miami los angeles and san francisco our deck party like a pro the nightlife space has long been plagued by inefficiency and nontransparent pricing as avid nightlife customers we here at discotech have firsthand experience with the frustration and disappointment that comes with promoters and the traditional nightlife system from these negative experiences we realized there was an opportunity for a technologydriven company to streamline the process and bring transparency to nightlife over the last few years our team has validated the concept and we have proven that the business is viable by focusing on delighting our customers we have grown past  registered users  primarily via word of mouth in march of this year we were able to achieve monthly breakeven and our revenues have continued to grow month over month since then we have demonstrated that our model works and now we are looking to scale the business by increasing our marketing and improving the platform via a larger engineering team going out with your friends is fun however planning a night out is anything but at discotech we believe that the nightlife industry is overdue for disruption and that a technological overhaul will solve the major problems in this space we invite you to join us now as an investor and help us bring about the much needed

entrepreneurs who build global companies patrick sarkissian ceo  cofounder at raleigh  drake more investors more investors details expand all what are you building we are building the opentable for nightlife our mobile app allows users to discover events purchase tickets and sign up for vip guest lists at nightlife venues in different cities what’s the problem you’re solving we are tackling the inefficiency and nontransparency that has been plaguing the nightlife space people currently have to go through these nightclub promoters traditional middlemen who are very hard to get in touch with and aren’t professional or very transparent when it comes to pricing our app makes it a lot easier for our customers to get the information they need like accurate pricing and ultimately to make reservations very quickly without having to find these promoters call them text them and go through a laborious processpromoters get paid on commission they’ll charge more if they know that the customer doesn’t know any better just so that they can make more money out of it discotech is about working on a large scale and getting the lowest price possible for our customers we save them money make things easier and we really just want to streamline this process which we think is long overdue what problems are you solving not only are we a good solution for the end customer who’s ultimately the paying customer for the club but we also make things a lot easier for the nightlife venue which is actually something we learned after we set out to do this clubs find promoters to be a pain point there are a lot of them they’re highly fragmented there’s high turnover and their loyalties are not steady we make it easy and streamlined for the club to source them with customers we’re nonbiased and at the end of the day we’re much more professional to work with than different promoters calling and texting the club and serving as this inefficient middle manclubs leverage promoters as essentially their marketing team for the most part promoters are valuable because they’re the ones who have contact with the customers they’re the ones who go out and do a lot of the marketing most clubs are mom and pop shops who don’t have a very sophisticated marketing teams so they develop this relationship with the promoters where they go out bring in revenue and make a commission on thatwhen promoters do rent out an entire club these promoters still rely on other promoters to fill their venue because just like the club owners they want to maximize the number of people in the venue so that the event is hot they want make money on the people coming in because ultimately that’s what they’re getting paid out on in these situations discotech maintains similar operations where our app helps them increase traffic to their venue through our end userson the customer end it’s a huge pain point for a customer without contacts to find out what’s going on to know what’s hot in town and how to get access to those events that’s magnified if you think internationally as well we’re only focused domestically but imagine going to a foreign country where you don’t speak the language but you want to go out imagine how hard that process would be without something like thisanother problem that we’re solve for the clubs is that in traditional methods promoters go out and try to get people to come by putting them on a vip list but these people aren’t paying in advance clubs don’t know how many of those listed names are actually going to show up whereas with us people are actually paying in advance what do you have that traditional promoters don’t there’s a lot that we do that traditional promoters cannot do one of the main differences is access to data analytics that comes with our app we’re able to see trends and analyze data based on which djs are hot and which nights are good we can do a lot more for the club in terms of these data analytics but we can also help them as a crm system because we can reach out to our customers via push notifications which clubs cannot do themselveswe also work with clubs in los angeles to provide an exclusive loyalty platform where our customers are able to accrue loyalty points and just like airline miles exchange them for rewards the clubs allow us to do this because they trust that we can keep accurate tabs on customer spending whereas a human promoter may not be the most trustworthy how will you incentivize referrals we don’t currently have a referral reward system but it’s something that is very high in our to do list we really want to go the uber and dropbox route where customer can get rewards or get incentives for sharing discotech with their friends and also for inviting people to the party and doing different actions on the app how did you guys get started the idea for discotech really came to us as a team we’re three guys from uc berkeley friends since college none of us worked in the nightlife space so the idea came to us from the customer’s perspective i think four or five years out of college we were convening together in las vegas and we had spent a couple of hours tracking down different promoters and talking to them we finally agreed on a price and then on the night of the event we showed up as scheduled and we were told that our promoter had misquoted us we don’t know this was an intentional bait and switch or if the promoter had just made a mistakeeither way we were in a really tough spot we actually ended up paying the extra amount that night but all the guys were just furious we weren’t really having fun because we were bitter while we were having drinks we were just talking about how bad it tasted and it was really that experience that inspired us to search online to see if there was a company that was already solving this problem so that we as customers wouldn’t have to deal with this againit was during that exploratory phase back in i think  that we saw there wasn’t anyone really solving this problem in a meaningful way by leveraging technology we decided to do this as a side project at first we built a demo for some of our friends and then got a lot of approval from the big nightlife players in los angeles where i was based at that time it was from that point we realized that this thing had legs and we quit our full time jobs and the team moved from san francisco down to la we’ve been hustling ever since who are your customers initially when we started the app we were focused on solving bottle service only so that target market was much smallertypically wealthy males who spend a lot of money we’ve since democratized the product added on prefilled ticketing to our app and also vip guest lists from there we now target anyone who wants to go to a club at any point whether they want to get them for free whether they want to pay for a ticket or whether they want to do the vip bottle service which is the highend package we really make it accessible to everyone our demographics are split pretty evenly slightly more men than women but it’s pretty close to  now we see people of all sorts from ages  to  i’d say is our target group but really people of all ages what’s the market size the current market that we’re really focused on right now is nightclubs and lounges however we also work with live music festivals such as electric daisy carnival if you look at some reports out there i think the nightlife federation put out a report on the top hundred largest clubs and they’re doing about  billion in gross revenue we estimate that our market in the united states is about  billion and around  billion globally of that  billion number we estimate it’s about  due to alcohol sales  of which is bottle servicethe biggest segment then bar spend is probably around another  the remaining difference comes from admission fees clubs are literally making more than half their revenue on bottle service this percentage goes up for high end clubswe’re already working with some bars but not yet clubs or lounges we’re also working with live music festivals like edc ultra life is beautiful electric zoo some of the bigger edm festivals that happen in america and so that’s a separate market all by itself and that’s somewhere we’re currently playing which impacts our adjustable market as well how do venues use your app to get on board the app is pretty straight forward once we give them the goahead we simply need them to fill out a twopage word document for us with all the information that we need we then either work with the clubs or find pictures online ourselves to go live with the venue on our app and in regards to getting their events we either scrape them directly from the event apis if they have them or we have a scraper built that pulls them automatically from their website how do guestlists work i actually start the guest list because that’s much more simple for us to do it every club is slightly different but for the most part at a certain time we provide the club with a list of names for the guest list and that list is literally printed out or the doorman will have it on an ipad and then as customers come in they’ll get checked off the list and then they’ll be given free admission or discount admissionwhatever that guest list perk should be bottle service works the same way how does your app attract customers we offer services that no other traditional promoter could we have the most efficient streamlined system out there and we give customers the experience of being treated like high status royalty for example in vegas because there are a lot of venues we will actually provide the customer with a dedicated vip host who will contact the customer and set up a time to greet them in front of the venue the host will then walk them into the club so that they don’t have to wait in any line they’re getting the highest vip experience at other clubs we book tables for them they’re in the system and then when people show up at the door they’ll check in with their first and last name and just pay at the venue what can you do that traditional promoters can’t one thing that we do that a traditional promoter can’t do is actually just sell tickets presell tickets the incumbent way of buying tickets would be to go to different websites and checking out the prices and then purchasing them online we make it very easy to buy tickets in a few clicks the qr code is stored on the app so you don’t need to print anything out or find it in your email this makes it very easy since there’s a scan at the venue that reads the tickets that you bought on our app how did you guys start onboarding venues we launched and started off in los angeles from la we branched into las vegas which is the largest market in the united states that was really done through the connections that we made here in la for las vegas the team actually moved to a suburb of las vegas called slumberland we lived there for seven months during that time we onboarded all the major players in las vegas onto our platform the sale process initially was a lot more difficult getting the foot in the door wasn’t that easy when we didn’t really have traction in customers and customer referrals to back us uponce we are able to get the foot in the door the sales process is pretty straightforward there’s really no risk for the club to be a part of our app because we don’t take an upfront subscription cost or a service fee we only eat what we kill the same way that traditional promoters do for that reason when we make the presentation to the clubs they’re pretty receptive to us because they don’t really have anything to lose what’s the growth like i think we’re right now between  and  venues that are onboard the app in addition to vegas and la we’re also live in san francisco san diego orange county miami and we’re starting to enter into other cities on the east coast as well in terms of number of venues we’ve probably increased  over the last year adding venues onto the platform really isn’t our highest priority right nowwe’re much more focused on getting users in the areas that we’re already in in particular we’re working on los angeles which has really proven out to be a nice hub where we’ve achieved some kind of critical mass and we’re starting to see a lot of organic downloads which is great we’re really focused on gaining share rather than expanding without having the users that fall behind thatmonth over month we’re seeing more downloads last month we for the first time ever broke  new registered users for june  i believe our monthly active users is close to  off of a total install base of around  which we think is pretty solidwe also measure the unique number of visitors who come to our website so wwwdiscotechme that number has also continued to grow every month as our seo continues to improve i believe those numbers are actually north of  we actually get more unique visitors to our website than we do to our app currently we’re trying to funnel those people to our mobile app who acquires the user base historically we’ve been doing all the grunt work we started with digital marketing and guerilla tactics going out to clubs and handing out cards once we had an initial feed of customers they started talking and sharing it with their friends and now all of our downloads at this moment and for the last number of months have been all organic these are people searching for us on our website or just people spreading us through word of mouth because they like the product clubs today actually do offer us support when it comes to marketing so some of our good partners here in la give us exclusive deals outside of the loyalty platform such as an exclusive guest list that’s only good for discotech customers one example would be sound nightclub which is a very prestigious and famous club in this country on a number of nights we’ll actually have a free onehour open bar for our customers which again is exclusive to us we provide them with discotech wristbands to prove that they came in with discotech and that helps us generate more buzz and more downloads what’s the value per customer our lifetime value is definitely greater than our customer acquisition costs for our paying customers it’s a pretty high customer value because bottle service is such a high value item our average tables price costs around  of which we’re doing a little better than  blended margin so those customers are generating a lot of value per user how much do you guys make as far as we know it’s pretty comparable to what promoters make right now we are much more focused on growing users and building relationships with the clubs rather than maximizing our cash flow we’ve kind of taken what was given to us and we’re usually making between  commission on the traffic that we bring inon the revenue side growth has been great year over year i think we’ve grown over x from where we were i think around january of this year we were probably doing around k in gross merchandise volume a month and now we’re doing over k a month we’ve definitively come a long way and we see that number continuing to grow especially as we gear up to launch our web app which we think will show an increase in our metrics how do you plan to grow and expand for us we haven’t really been leveraging digital and paid marketing just because we’ve been very conservative and lean as a startup we’ve been bootstrapping it where we really see the growth coming in is as followscontinue to invest in the product building out social features because nightlife is ultimately a social activity you never do it by yourself it’s something you do with your friends and the ability to see where your friends are going invite your friends to events or partiesthese are all part of the experience building in a referral program is something that we think would supercharge this organic growth that’s really been taking off for uswe want to get back involved in digital marketing and paid advertising one of my cofounder’s backgrounds was doing that for five years at zeus which is the online dating site we think that we can do it in a very calculated and efficient manner lastly we think that hiring the right people to help with community engagement management and social media would also be a big help for us because currently we don’t have the human resources to really take full advantage of that and that’s something we’d like to look into have you focused on specific types of nightlife venues we’re pretty agnostic we like to start with the best clubs the most popular ones in each city largely because once you get the big guys on board that addresses the most customers and other venues will typically follow if you get the big players on they’ll say “if you’ve got those guys then i need to be on this app too” what’s the biggest challenge for you guys the most important thing for us is getting the users i think we got the club onboarding part down at least for now i think the hardest thing is just getting the word out building a brand and communicating that brand to our customers once you have that initial critical mass things definitely get easier because when you’re discovering discotech from your friend you’re much more likely to trust that brand and that product than if you just saw it on a facebook mobile ad or a google ad for us we want to do things that build a strong initial following and then grows off of that we want to take the strategy that we’ve used in la and apply it in the different new cities that we’re launching in what are your plans for the future there are a lot of plays that we can do that don’t currently exist for example a “hotel tonight” type of play with last minute deals because ultimately a club operates very similarly to a hotel they have a lot of overhead but selling a table or selling a hotel room doesn’t really have any incremental costs for them they’re all about filling up that inventory with the right data and the right connection to the customers we can help clubs fill out unfold inventory and have dynamic pricing like uberwe want to incorporate surge pricing based on demand and inventory remaining i think that is a really cool opportunity that would be disruptive in the space people might possibly even bid on certain tables with customers being able to bid down or up that’s something that doesn’t really exist today for us we also just want to make it a onestop shop where people from different countries can get on one app and just make it very easy for them to get information and get onto the platformthere’s actually a few other potential things that we could be doing with the technology that we have one of them is leveraging location based technology for example if you’re on the strip and you’re walking around and we know you open the app then we know which clubs that you’re closest to we could send you an exclusive deal or package if it’s close to your birthday and we know that information we can ping you in advance with a push notification offering you a special from the club that has birthday specials there’s definitely a lot that we can do with customer data and location data to help with hyper targeting who are your competition there are other app players out there but our biggest competitor is tablelist there have been a few players in the past who have tried to build products like ours that have failed one more recognizable name is i think is ez vip they’re actually on shark tank and they got funded by mark cuban a lot of these players in the past were just nightclub promoters who thought that because they could promote well they could go out and build a technology company and do this but that wasn’t true they didn’t invest enough in operations and building out the technology and making sure things workedwe on the other hand are approaching this from the product side as a startup should then we figured out how clubbing works while doing it that was much more easy for us again our biggest competitor’s tablelist they’ve actually raised between  million and they’re based down in boston their stronghold is really that boston new york area we don’t really run up against them they don’t play in the markets here on the west coast and we don’t really see them run up against us in vegas either we’re really racing i think to displace promoters in whichever markets that we’re inunlike tablelist however we are much more focused on the broader market for nightlife as their name implies tablelist they’re much more focused on the vip the table part which again while it is a big business it does not address a lot of the ticketing and guest list needs of the masses we also have a partnership with wantickets who is the largest ticketing provider in the nightlife space they’ve been in business for over  years and we have relationships with a good number of clubs i’d say most clubs in the country our partnership with them gives us access to their ticketing inventory which gives us a lot more ticketing inventory than they have many times the inventory for wantickets is actually exclusive as well tell us about the team the team is comprised of three founders all three of us are uc berkeley graduates
