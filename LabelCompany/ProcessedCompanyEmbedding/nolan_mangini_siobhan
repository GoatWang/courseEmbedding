available on our website and as an exhibit to the form k filed with the sec just before this call in addition please remember the close date of the jiff acquisition was april  accordingly deferred revenue fair value adjustment discussed on this call is a preliminary estimate and is subject to change upon the completion of purchase price accounting with that ill turn the call over to john john c doyle  castlight health inc thank you and good afternoon  is a pivotal year for castlight at the beginning of the first quarter we announced our acquisition of jiff and began working to capitalize on the combination as quickly as possible three months later on april  we successfully closed the transaction and our strong focus on integration activities this past quarter has allowed us to hit the ground running in q our new combined company is unique in its ability to help human resources leaders and employees successfully navigate the complexity of healthcare and wellbeing benefits and manage the overwhelming proliferation of healthcare vendors castlight is now the only health benefits platform that covers the full spectrum of wellbeing healthcare decision support and benefits hub all in one complete package with a comprehensive offering serving more than  companies we believe we believe we put the foundation in place to achieve our financial objectives for the year as we expected q was a seasonally light sales quarter for us again this year castlights standalone arr was flat sequentially at  million siobhan will review the quarter in greater detail but revenue and cash used in operations were in line with our expectations and execution against our plans to drive cost synergies has us on track to achieve our goals related to substantially reducing our nongaap operating loss by the end of  beneath the q headline performance the platform initiatives we began in late  are helping us with our  goals of driving growth and mitigating churn we added five logos in q four of which were platform customers through the combination of new client additions and transparency client migrations arr from our platform business now exceeds  of total arr up from approximately  of our total arr in the yearago period this is an important milestone for the company which we believe validates our platform strategy further our combination with jiff is already showing signs of delivering growth opportunities that are not reflected in the q metrics reported today we were pleased to see our first crosssell of jiff into the castlight customer base in q where jiff successfully displaced an incumbent wellness vendor based on the power of our combined offering already in q weve seen further validation of the combined offering with walmart expanding their contract with us to purchase jiff functionality these are early proof points of the power of the castlight and jiff combination which ill speak to in greater detail shortly another key element of our growth strategy has been a greater focus on channels q is a critical period to be engaged with channel partners as customers begin evaluating proposals and programs for implementation in their next plan year we are investing heavily in channel partnerships from strengthening our benefit consultant relationships to executing this year on our anthem gotomarket initiative overall we saw good channel support and further progress with anthem we are seeing our pipeline build and expect to see good sales yield from these efforts during the balance of the year ultimately our sales plan for the year ties to the seasonality of our customers typical buying cycles which tend to drive our sales pipeline in q and create good momentum for us beginning in q we are seeing this happen and weve seen increasing interest in the joint offering across our combined customer base and from partners and prospects based on the momentum in the sales pipeline we expect to drive strong growth overall in  in addition to driving sales growth we are focused on reducing churn we added five new logos and have seven customers churn in q and as weve seen before the losses were driven primarily by transparencyonly customers one critical focus for us has been to transition transparency customers to our platform solution because we believe the value equation for platform customers is strong and sticky and is reflected in the shifting balance of our arr to platform customers as i shared earlier the churn in the first quarter was consistent with the seasonality and benefits buying and our dollar churn is tracking to the  expectations we previously discussed finally in  we are also focused on successfully integrating castlight and jiff to unlock the strategic value of the combined company as of today less than a month after the closing our integrated leadership team is in place we have identified and implemented the cost synergies needed to achieve our cash flow goals and we are executing our plans to combine and evolve our value proposition for customers and users from a product perspective we are executing a phased integration plan that enables us to deliver a joint value proposition to shared customers and users right away with a plan to launch a fully integrated app during the first half of  with the most comprehensive solution in the market we will be giving employers the product they are asking for a single app for employees to access the right benefit at the right time whether they are accessing care managing a condition or focused on their own wellbeing our platform enables employers to deploy customized benefits personalized content and communications and drive engagement across their entire employee population in this way we save for employers while creating more engaged healthier employees in parallel with our efforts to reaccelerate growth we have worked diligently to capture synergies from the acquisition as soon as possible prior to closing the acquisition the integration team from both companies worked with the new leadership team to identify efficiencies in the combined business we implemented all of the organizational adjustments and changes to our pro forma operating plan immediately after closing the acquisition we also already combined the teams as well as our offices the impacts of these changes on our opex run rate will be fully realized by the time we exit this year consistent with our plan to reach cash flow breakeven by the end of  at a high level our financial plan reflects prioritization of rd investments needed to support the integration of our products and aggressive innovation of our platform so this was an extremely productive quarter at castlight the team did a fantastic job on the merger integration tasks that were essential to keep us on track to achieve our combined goals we also have clear plans to complete all mergerrelated work streams including full integration of our products by the first half of  and achieve the cash flow breakeven milestone by the end of  when it all comes together i expect us to be a larger faster growing business with the most comprehensive health benefits platform in the market when we get there we will take an enormous step towards our ultimate objective which is to make healthcare work better for employers and our users none of it is possible without the dedicated and talented employees who build and sell our products or who serve our customers and users or the folks in support functions who make our business run im grateful to every one of them and for the opportunity to do what we do with that ill turn the call over to siobhan siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc thanks john good afternoon everyone and let me also thank all of you for joining us on todays call ill start by reviewing our q results and then ill provide an update to our  outlook after that well open up the call to questions please note that our jiff acquisition closed on april  so jiffs financial performance is not included in our q results first quarter financial results were largely in line with our expectations at the end of q  net annualized recurring revenue or arr totaled  million which is essentially flat from its yearend  level and we completed the quarter with  net signed customers this seasonality of our arr and new logo trends was expected due to the annual benefits decision making and buying cadence now over half of our castlights arr is associated with customers on the full castlight platform and the attach rate for our action platform product is now  across the castlight customer base up from  in the yearago period we strongly believe that our platform initiative is a key longterm driver of the business total revenue for the first quarter was  million which increased  yearoveryear and was in line with our expectations as a reminder we shared previously that we expected castlights first quarter revenues to be down sequentially given q  included  million of nonrecurring revenue and we incurred seasonally higher levels of churn at the end of the benefits year  of total revenue was subscriptionbased reported revenue is a function of completed implementations and we had a record number of customer deployments over the course of the first quarter in particular we built our newest products to scale and we are now consistently seeing castlight customers launch with multiple products simultaneously castlight had  total customer deployments in the first quarter including  new customers and  action launches the  yearoveryear increase in services revenue was primarily driven by increased launch activity now lets turn to our first quarter nongaap financials q nongaap gross margin was  towards the high end of our  to  target range and up significantly from  in the year ago period this improvement is a product of the efficiency gains associated with the investments we made last year with scaled and automated launch operations however we remind you that the jiff transaction will initially result in lower gross margin for the combined company as jiff is in an earlier stage of launching clients during their rapid growth phase we continue to expect gross margin to increase over time with scale just as they did with castlights legacy business and to reach the same longterm target range of  to  total nongaap operating expense was  million in q down  yearoveryear we experienced a  decline in sales and marketing expense as our increased emphasis on channel partners over the past year enabled us to achieve greater efficiencies in sales and marketing these savings were partially offset primarily by seasonal ga expenses and onetime costs nongaap operating loss was  million in q a  improvement yearoveryear cash used in operations was  million including more than  million in onetime transaction costs associated with the jiff deal and seasonal working capital needs this was consistent with our expectations and led to  million in cash and marketable securities at the end of the first quarter as jiffs financial performance was not included in the castlight q results ill provide some preliminary unaudited headline metrics to assist with comparing the combined companies performance going forward in q jiff ended the quarter with  million in arr and generated approximately  million in revenue please note that going forward we do not plan to break out castlight and jiffs results on a quarterly basis with that ill turn to our outlook for the full year  and second quarter we previously provided  nongaap pro forma revenue guidance of  million to  million when we announced the jiff deal now that the transaction with jiff is closed i will also provide our  gaap revenue outlook for the combined company based on jiffs inclusion in our financial results starting april  please refer to the presentation posted on the investor relations section of our website for details for the full year  we expect gaap revenue for the combined company to be in the range of  million to  million this gaap revenue guidance can be reconciled towards nongaap pro forma and revenue range above by adding the  million in revenue that jiff generated in their first quarter as well as the approximately  million impact in  related to the writedown of deferred revenue associated with purchase accounting based on our expectations of  million to  million in gaap revenue in  we expect full year  nongaap operating loss to be in the range of  million to  million which exclude jiffs first quarter operating loss this translates into a nongaap net loss per share of approximately  to  based on approximately  million to  million shares we assume sequentially smaller operating losses starting in the third quarter of this year as a result of the progress we made in the first quarter identifying synergies from the jiff transaction additionally we expect to cut in half the combined companies nongaap operating loss when comparing q  to pro forma results for q  finally we expect cash used in operations to be in the mid million range for the fullyear  including approximately  million in transaction cost we remain confident that the combined company can reach cash flow breakeven by the end of  with at least  million of cash on the balance sheet given q will be our first quarter reporting financials in combination with jiff we wanted to provide a bit more detail on our expectations for the second quarter and incorporate the deferred revenue writedown outlined above going forward we will return to our practice of providing annual guidance for the second quarter of  we expect quarterly revenues for the combined company of approximately  million and nongaap operating loss of approximately  million both with the level of variability this incorporates more than  million of the deferred revenue writedown in the second quarter of  in summary q financial performance was in line with our expectations and we continue to make great progress with our platform initiatives in addition we continue to improve our ability to implement clients which improves our arr conversion with the close of the acquisition of jiff we believe were on a track to generate a combination of a strong growth and progress towards driving to cash flow breakeven with that ill now turn the call over to the operator for questions questionandanswer session operator your first question is from brian essex from morgan stanley brian l essex  morgan stanley  co llc hi good afternoon and thank you for taking the question i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about jiff and expected performance just from a seasonality perspective so that we have a little bit of insight with regard to finetuning our models for the rest of the year siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc absolutely brian this is siobhan thanks for the question i think one of the great things about the jiff business model is incredibly similar to castlight so were selling into the same buyer they tend to see the same benefits year seasonality as it pertains to purchase decisions as well as implementation so in terms of revenue contribution which i think is what your question is they tend to see large amount of implementations in the first quarters as well as in the fourth quarters of a given year and thats what we really saw over this past quarter with jiff and  million in revenues that they have brian l essex  morgan stanley  co llc okay and then i guess a followup in the first quarters sequential decline in subscription revenue if you could offer a little bit of color around what the dynamics were around that and how much were seasonal versus maybe attributable to those transparency only customers siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc sure so there is a high degree of seasonality in terms of effective churn in our business and so this is typically around the end of the benefit year is when our customer base tends to make decisions around terminations and churn and so we were expecting to see going into the first quarter the headwinds from the churn that we talked about in the last call and what we had seen in  and so that was the headwind we were incurring as well as we had had  million in onetime revenues that we had had in the fourth quarter of  and so it really was as we talked about the trends that weve seen in the churn in our business tends to be smaller customers transparencyonly customers and very much was in line with our expectations and was incorporated into the guidance that we shared last quarter as well brian l essex  morgan stanley  co llc great thats helpful thank you very much operator the next question is from brian peterson from raymond james brian peterson  raymond james  associates inc hi guys thanks for taking the question so just maybe a followup on brians question a bit related to jiff for those deals that were talking about today with customers or opportunities that you could book maybe in the next few months are those potentially revenue opportunities in  or would that be in  and how should we think about the revenue uplift for a company like walmart versus what their existing customer economics might look like siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc yes thanks brian so in terms of the sales that were seeing jiff has implementation timelines anywhere for effective two months up to for larger and more complex clients six months to nine months implementation timeline so a high degree of variability very similar to castlight and so for the most part sales that were seen with jiff now are contributing to  revenues now that were in the second quarter in relation to the walmart question were really excited to be seeing early momentum with crosssells and to have a customer like walmart purchasing jiff we obviously have a high degree of economics with walmart and thats been disclosed in the past and this will be incremental this was a q deal so well be reporting that in our q arr brian peterson  raymond james  associates inc okay got it and maybe just a question ore broadly on the platform versus transparency could you just remind us what is the delta in the ppm or customer level economics for somebody thats on a platform versus just transparency so we can kind of try to keep track of that going forward thank you siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc yes so were in the midst i think weve talked about this in the past – our legacy transparency business is highly variable we typically have threeyear contracts and so when we look back to customers in  and  there was a high degree of variance with customers on the transparency business id say as weve seen the migration over to the platform we have seen incremental economics i think a point – data point that we shared in the past is in  we actually saw a  increase on revenue proceeds and that really is as were migrating more and more customers over to the platform and on multiple products were seeing that pmpm lift brian peterson  raymond james  associates inc great thanks siobhan operator the next question is from richard close from canaccord genuity richard collamer close  canaccord genuity group inc great thanks for the questions i think you talked about the deployments in the first quarter record number i think the number was  and then there were some additional statistics following that can you just go over that again please siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc sure absolutely id be happy to so we had  product deployments  new customers got deployed over the course of the quarter and what i think that points to and that were really proud of over the past year is that weve now been able to launch customers on multiple products so as weve been moving over to the platform and were seeing the attach rate across multiple products grow were actually have invested in the infrastructure to launch a customer now on multiple products at the same time which is where we saw such growth in terms of the number of launches this past quarter richard collamer close  canaccord genuity group inc followup question would be on the second quarter data points that you provided as your guidance you said  million just want to be clear is that gaap or the nongaap or pro forma number siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc that is gaap richard collamer close  canaccord genuity group inc okay siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc that is including our expectations around jiffs contribution given the deal closed on april  and it also incorporates the deferred revenue haircut that i spoke about on the call richard collamer close  canaccord genuity group inc okay and then just as we think about the  guidance and you were talking about your margin performance in the first quarter you expect that to go down in the remaining quarters of this year because of the jiff acquisition is there any ranges that you can provide us in terms of where you see the gross margin level being now with jiff and so im just trying to get a sense on how we should think about gross margins and operating expenses now with the acquisition siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc sure i can provide a little more color there so in terms of gross margins we do expect to see the combined company gross margins dip below the longterm range that weve been in for the past couple of quarters the scenic drop below that  to  range we think that well be able to climb back up to that longterm range in  and i think our expectations are youre going to see the same type of progression that you saw with castlight as a standalone business and that we should be able to do that for jiff when you think about opex and i think that was the second part of your question you can imagine that ga is an area that theres natural synergies for the combined business and that we should start to see progress there in the second half of the year and again marching towards our longterm range of  to  of revenue by  sales and marketing is another area where there are opportunities for synergies i mentioned we sell into the same buyer we both have channel relationships that we should be able to leverage as well and then as john mentioned on the call we will continue to invest heavily in rd we are very early in terms of the development of this health benefits platform and youll continue to see aggressive investment in that area richard collamer close  canaccord genuity group inc okay thank you operator the next question is from robert jones from goldman sachs robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co great thanks for the questions on the churn issue i guess just wanted to get a better understanding of how youre thinking about this longer term is the majority of churn something you expect to cycle through at some point is the client base kind of the more original client base makes the decision to either stay and move on or to move off the platform or is this something thats probably we should think about as just more normal course of business john c doyle  castlight health inc thanks bob certainly very much the former and weve spent a fair amount of time on this in the past and i would reiterate comments that we made in particular on the q call where we dug into this issue quite a bit so as you were suggesting in your question our portfolio customers now is balanced between transparencyonly customers and platform customers and we do believe that the platform product offers a very strong and sticky value proposition to the customer and believe that what makes a lot of sense as we renew these transparency customers is for them to shift over to the platform where they continue to get the benefits of the transparency product but also then access to our wellbeing and healthcare navigation solutions as well we certainly have additional transparency customers to work with on renewals during the balance of  but expect to be through most of that in the early part of next year and then expect to see a significant decrease in churn robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co got it and then i guess john just thinking about jiff some of jiffs channel partners curious if you could maybe just give an update on any early conversations or strategies maybe that you guys have thought through in leveraging folks like towers watson and mercer from the jiff side john c doyle  castlight health inc weve had a bunch of conversations there as you know channels are a big focus for the business on the castlight side the emphasis has definitely been on our alignment and partnership with anthem which were making great progress with and then as we combine with jiff to your point theyve done a great job historically building close relationships in the consultant community and so derek and i have been meeting with their partners and expanding on those relationships and weve got leadership in place to expand those dialogues and feel good about the support were getting in the market as we think about the growth that we can drive for the balance of this year and then into  all of those partners we think are going to make a significant contribution robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co got it thanks so much john c doyle  castlight health inc thanks bob operator the next question is from jeff captain from stifel jeff captain  stifel nicolaus  co inc hey guys thanks for taking the question just want to follow up on the partner channel i guess just curious if you have any update around the sap relationship john c doyle  castlight health inc sure jeff so we had hoped i think as you noted to get the sap relationship completed in the first half of this year weve pushed that out today we extended the timeline that we have to get that relationship solidified to the later part of this year and so teams are working actively on doing that in the meantime as i was just saying the focus for the business and we really just scratched the surface here is driving this relationship with anthem which incorporates elements of castlights legacy products as well as the products that jiff brings to the combined business and we see an enormous opportunity there with anthem where our strategic alignment is incredibly strong and so thats really where the focus is in addition to those consultant relationships that i just talked about and we feel like were setup well from a channel perspective to drive growth in the foreseeable future jeff captain  stifel nicolaus  co inc got it great thanks a lot operator the next question is from jamie stockton from wells fargo jamie stockton  wells fargo securities llc yes good evening and thanks for taking my questions i guess maybe good afternoon there i guess maybe first on jiff the walmart deal is it correct to assume that that applies to the  million kind of burnout target from an arr standpoint for them siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc yes it does jamie stockton  wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe just as far as the environment is concerned maybe not recently but especially kind of late last year early this year some other benefit technology companies were talking about repeal and replace noise and it having some impact on benefit decisions the companies were making can you talk about whether or not you guys have seen any of that in the marketplace as when repeal and replace seem to fold did the marketplace seem to accelerate just any color there would be great john c doyle  castlight health inc sure and then – in my new role as you can imagine im spending a lot more time with customers and partners in the field and talking about range of topics its actually not the ahca and the repeal and replace dynamic earlier in q really wasnt at all a focus of those conversations folks are much more focused on things that have been longerterm issues that i think are just becoming more and more acute so obviously escalating costs an explosion of healthcare and healthcare technology vendors and programs that theyd like to deploy but that can get very confusing and overwhelming to manage for their employee base and just the amount of money frankly thats being wasted and spent on inefficient and poor quality of care in many cases and fortunately for us those are the issues that i think were going to – we address head on with the combination of jiff and castlight and so thats been the focus of these conversations much more so than the political environment jamie stockton  wells fargo securities llc okay thats great and maybe just one more quick one as a followup to richards question just to make sure that everybody is modeling this the right way does the  million revenue guidance for q being a gaap number mean that you guys arent – youre just not going to talk about a nongaap revenue number and nobody needs to model a nongaap revenue number youll make some adjustment below the revenue line for the deferred revenue siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc thats the intent exactly jamie stockton  wells fargo securities llc okay thats great thank you john c doyle  castlight health inc thank you operator the next question is from frank sparacino from first analysis frank sparacino  first analysis securities corp hi guys just two questions from me first siobhan on the arr for jiff the  million can you tell us what the yearago figure was siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc i dont actually have that im sorry i can tell you at the of  they were at  million in arr so theres a  million increase over this past quarter frank sparacino  first analysis securities corp and secondly maybe this is best for john in terms of the two companies coming together now if i look at the org chart we have some fair number of new faces in some fair – in some important roles particularly on the sales side of things so john wanted to get your sense as to how much – just how much disruption has there been will there be sort of in the next couple of months and sort of how you feel right now about the sales side of things john c doyle  castlight health inc yes thanks so headline i feel great about where we are on the sales side i think your question suggests – theres no question that when you bring two companies together and in particular merge leadership teams youre going to have some amount of people learning to work with each other and bringing in new practices and so forth but we really have blended the teams and made a very concerted effort to ensure that our top folks in all of the teams around the business are – that were communicating regularly that theyre feeling excited about the business excited about the goforward team and the opportunity that weve created by combining the businesses i think also in the case of each of the individual leaders including mike leonard on the sales side very experienced people who know this healthcare and healthcare technology ecosystem extremely well and so i think in addition to all of the efforts that weve been making to get folks working together as quickly as possible we also have the benefit as siobhan was alluding to earlier of having worked in a very much overlapped ecosystem in terms of partners and customers and buyers and so much much less disruption in our sales motion than you might otherwise imagine so im really excited about where we are and optimistic about the balance of the year frank sparacino  first analysis securities corp if i could just throw in one more on the walmart side id be curious if you can give us some details on the competitive environment there and maybe how that sales process went from kind of start to finish and what you think maybe that tells you as you look at crosssell opportunities sort of going forward john c doyle  castlight health inc let me – so ill answer really the second part of that question and i think a couple of the crosssells we saw in q are consistent with a pattern thats emerging in the pipeline and that i think well see over the balance of the year our hypothesis when we merged jiff and castlight was that the combination of wellness and healthcare decision support and the benefit hub functionality available in one relationship would not only be a big benefit to employers from an administrative and value perspective but also a much better experience for end users and therefore more engaging and effective at the end of the day and controlling the escalation of cost and driving benefit utilization and the crosssell dynamic is validating that for sure we saw a really strong build of crosssell pipeline in the first quarter were seeing deals advancing pretty rapidly here in the second quarter and thats really gratifying having said that as ive said multiple times stretching back more than a year were at the very beginning at castlight of an enormous longterm opportunity we have  customers but ultimately there are s of large businesses in the united states that could derive a lot of value from the products we build and so from that perspective while im pleased with the crosssell activity were certainly going to expand those relationships aggressively we are continuing to focus from a strategic perspective on driving new logo acquisition because ultimately strategically we think that platform that large installed base over time is essential to achieving our longterm goals and so as we move forward through the year we really are focused on both frank sparacino  first analysis securities corp thank you john c doyle  castlight health inc thanks frank operator the next question is from steve halper from cantor fitzgerald steven halper  cantor fitzgerald securities yes hi thanks for taking the question i just wanted to clarify the nongaap earnings guidance or loss per share guidance will that include a deferred revenue adjustment siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc yes so it will be gaap revenue and then our operating expenses are nongaap and thats really taking into account transaction costs stockbased compensation and the like but it will take into account the deferred revenue haircut steven halper  cantor fitzgerald securities okay and how long will we see the deferred revenue addback siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc it will be primarily through  and the majority as i mentioned is actually in the second quarter of this year and then well see a little bit in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of this year steven halper  cantor fitzgerald securities okay so gaap revenue and the deferred addback okay so just when you think about the jiff combination you talked a little bit about some gross margin pressure at least in the short term but when you think about cost rationalization between the two companies can you break down between cost of goods sold or gross – and operating expenses where the synergies would come from over time siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc sure so when we think about synergies where we expect to see the most is really in operating expenses as i mentioned we were – i think weve made great progress one of the many things that we did this past quarter was really set the combined business up to capture those synergies in the second half of this year and where youre going to see the most savings is as you would expect ga as i mentioned to some degree in sales and marketing and this is as i mentioned were selling into the same buyer and have a similar target market so both sales and marketing efforts and then i would say less so on the rd side when it comes to servicing customers jiff is still very much in its early days of launching the servicing customers and so were going to continue to invest there and get that infrastructure into place steven halper  cantor fitzgerald securities great and how long does that take in terms of integration process siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc well i think it will take us through the balance of this year our hope is that well be in the longterm target range of  to  gross margins in  steven halper  cantor fitzgerald securities great thank you so much john c doyle  castlight health inc thanks steve operator the next question is from charles rhyee from cowen  company charles rhyee  cowen  co llc yes hey thanks for taking the questions just wanted to clarify just real quickly on the deferred revenue again so when you talked about the second quarter being the biggest amount is the  million that you kind of used pro forma for the first quarter is it greater that amount – is that the right number to use or is it more or less than that number siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc it is less so its over  million will be – is our expectation i would say we just closed the deal obviously on april  but our expectation is the haircut will be over  million in the second quarter and then you can imagine the balance of that around  million haircut being split over the remainder of the year in the third quarter and fourth quarter and a tiny amount in  charles rhyee  cowen  co llc okay thats helpful and then you talked about  of your business subscription revenue is the other  the variability that – what drives the variability for the other  for you and then is that similar for jiff like how much visibility does jiff have into their revenue for the fullyear siobhan nolan mangini  castlight health inc yes so maybe ill start there i think one of the highly complementary things about our businesses is we both have saas subscription business models with the same seasonality and so we tend to have as i mentioned similar implementation timeframes and so when were thinking about revenue and revenue visibility we do have a high degree of visibility into our businesses because of the saas subscription model when youre talking about the other  of revenues thats really its professional services items so this is the fees that were charging to implement and launch a customer have communication services to make employees aware of the offering and that is very much tied to the launch activities of the business and so its similar in terms of its visibility and predictability to the saas subscription model it just is shorter in tenure because its actually linked to the initial implementation and subscription of the initial contract charles rhyee  cowen  co llc okay thats helpful and then john you just mentioned earlier driving logo acquisition is a key focus for you im just curious how – when – i guess the question is that as your channel partner relationships gain more traction how much direction or how much ability do you have to really drive logo growth if its sold through a channel partner and i guess another way to ask the question is what do you expect sort of your mix in terms of sales – i know anthem is just ramping up but as we think out a little bit longer between your channel partners and through consultants what do you kind of think the mix will be between direct sales and the channel partner sales thanks john c doyle  castlight health inc thanks charles i think its important first of all to describe again what – how our channel relationships work because theyre really i would say robust lead generation sources in most cases where were still taking a very direct role in the sales process itself which i think is critical for making sure that we are doing a complete job communicating value proposition and tailoring our solution for individual customers were also obviously partnering with those channel folks consultants and health plan partners in the customer dialog so that their – as theyre building strategy for the customer we are right there with them making sure that the technology solution is supporting that strategy but its not as if theres a large – we expect a large percentage of the business to just be order taking on our end and the channels actually out there doing the selling as the relationships evolve over time we may see more of the effort being undertaken in the channel but for the foreseeable future theres big involvement from the direct team in almost every deal now that said to answer the question about balance i think very soon the large majority of our deals are going to be channel deals whether through anthem or the consultants thats essentially the pattern were already beginning to see and it presents a much more comprehensive and coordinated solution to the customer and so i think its in everybodys interest to have that alignment working well starting in the sales cycle charles rhyee  cowen  co llc okay thank you thats helpful thank you john c doyle  castlight health inc thanks thanks operator the next question is from richard close from canaccord genuity richard collamer close  canaccord genuity group inc yes thanks john you talked about the walmart crosssell with jiff are there any proof points in terms of crosssell of castlight into the jiff customer base or can you give us some description of how those conversations are going john c doyle  castlight health inc sure so no examples from q and as you know jiff has a much smaller installed base than castlight does and so i think the nearestterm opportunity in terms of growing at our scale is definitely the reverse situation that said as were blending the sales teams i said were hitting the ground running in q and what that means is were enabling the teams to sell and support each other in sales cycles for both products in each others customer bases one exciting thing that came out of not only one of the examples in q but i think were seeing more and more in these crosssell opportunities with jiff and its worth mentioning is that historically castlight has not really had access to the wellness wallet in the market and with jiff as part of the overall solution when we go in now and pitch either jiff alone or jiff and castlight together one of the things were doing and have done is displacing existing wellness vendors in particular because with this combined solution were now the only vendor out there thats able to power that wellness experience and personalize it using claims data which over time i think employers agree is going to be a huge differentiator for us and so important part of that crosssell story so thanks for the question richard collamer close  canaccord genuity group inc ok thank you operator and the next question is from jamie stockton from wells fargo jamie stockton  wells fargo securities llc yes just one quick followup on that comment you just made john if we looked at your customer base today is there a ballpark percentage or number that you could tell us have an existing wellness solution that is comparable to jiff that you feel like could be displaced if you make the right pitch john c doyle  castlight health inc right so wellness is a very highly penetrated category so the large majority of our customer base offer a wellness solution to their population and again i think as you kind of dig in to what were observing in the pipeline and i mentioned that the kind of great reception were seeing to jiff in our portfolio i think thats a reflection of the fact that these buyers almost all have some kind of budget allocated to the space and have been looking for more effective ways to deliver wellness jiff had already been having a lot of success in those headtohead competitive situations and i think now with the addition of the power of our data infrastructure and platform and the promise of combining these two products over time and i think consolidating healthcare decision support and wellbeing and healthcare navigation from a roadmap perspective its just an incredibly powerful value proposition that lands right on top of what a lot of market is thinking about today and so i think were really wellpositioned on that wellness competitive front jamie stockton  wells fargo securities llc all right thanks john c doyle  castlight health inc thanks a lot operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back over to john doyle ceo for closing remarks john c doyle  castlight health inc thank you thanks
