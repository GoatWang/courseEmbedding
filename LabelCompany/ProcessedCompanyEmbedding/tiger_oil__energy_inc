applied to reduce the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties unless the sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves in which case a gain or loss is recognized   capitalized costs associated with impaired properties and capitalized costs related to properties having proved reserves plus the estimated future development costs and asset retirement costs under financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic  “asset retirement and environmental obligations” fasb asc  are amortized using the

future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves discounted at ten percent plus the cost of unevaluated properties  under certain specific conditions companies could elect to use subsequent prices for determining the estimated future net cash flows the use of subsequent pricing is no longer allowed there are many factors including global events that may influence the production processing marketing and price of oil and natural gas a reduction in the valuation of oil and natural gas properties resulting from declining prices or production could adversely impact depletion rates and capitalized cost limitations capitalized costs associated with properties that have not been evaluated through drilling or seismic analysis including exploration wells in progress
