rather than as separate statutory trusts in order to achieve certain administrative efficiencies the interests of investors are not adversely affected by the choice of form of organization as of the date of this prospectus the trust consists of the following seven series – powershares db energy fund powershares db oil fund powershares db precious metals fund powershares db gold fund powershares db silver fund powershares db base metals fund and powershares db agriculture fund this prospectus is for the fund only and not for the first  funds listed in the prior sentence or the sectors funds the sectors funds which are series of the trust are not being offered by this prospectus  the fund seeks to track changes whether positive or negative in the level of the dbiq optimum yield silver index excess return™ or the index over time plus the excess if any of the fund’s interest income from its holdings of united states treasury and other high credit quality shortterm fixed income securities over its expenses the shares are designed for investors who want a costeffective and convenient way to invest in commodity futures on us and nonus markets advantages of investing in the shares include • ease and flexibility of investment the shares trade on the nyse arca and provide institutional and retail investors with indirect access to commodity futures markets the shares may be bought and sold on the nyse arca like other exchangelisted securities retail investors may purchase and sell shares through traditional brokerage accounts • margin shares are eligible for margin accounts • diversification the shares may help to diversify a portfolio because historically the index has tended to exhibit low to negative correlation with both equities and conventional bonds and positive correlation to inflation • optimum yield™ the shares seek to track the index which employs the optimum yield™ rolling methodology which seeks to minimize the effects of negative roll yield that may be experienced by conventional commodities indexes • transparency the shares provide a more direct investment in commodities than mutual funds that invest in commoditylinked notes which have implicit imbedded costs and credit risk investing in the shares does not insulate shareholders from certain risks including price volatility the fund is designed to track the dbiq optimum yield silver index excess return™ dbiqoy si er™ which is intended to reflect the changes in market value of silver the single index commodity consists of silver if the managing owner determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that it has become impracticable or inefficient for any reason for the fund to gain full or partial exposure to the index commodity by investing in a specific futures contract that comprises the index the fund may invest in a futures contract referencing the index commodity other than the specific contract that comprises the index or in the alternative invest in other futures contracts not based on the index commodity if in the commercially reasonable judgment of the managing owner such futures contracts tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with the futures contract that comprises the index the index sponsor calculates the index on both an excess return basis and a total return basis the excess return basis calculation reflects the change in market value over time whether positive or negative of the underlying commodity futures only the total return basis calculation reflects the sum of the change in market value over time whether positive or negative of the underlying commodity futures plus the return on month us treasury bills the fund seeks to track changes whether positive or negative in the level of its index over time plus the excess if any of its interest income from its holdings of united states treasury and other high credit quality shortterm fixed income securities over its expenses the fund will make distributions at the discretion of the managing owner to the extent that the fund’s actual and projected interest income from its holdings of united states treasury securities and other high credit quality shortterm fixed income securities exceeds the actual and projected fees and expenses of the fund the managing owner expects periodically to make distributions of the amount of such excess the fund currently does not expect to make distributions with respect to capital gains depending on the fund’s performance for the taxable year and your own tax situation for such year your income tax liability for the taxable year for your allocable share of the fund’s net ordinary income or loss and capital gain or loss may exceed any distributions you receive with respect to such year the fund’s portfolio also will include united
