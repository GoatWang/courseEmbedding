highly specialized alloys and a manufacturing process that allow cosmetic down to  ra μin highstrength  ksi precision parts to be injection molded in a single manufacturing step liquidmetal alloys provide an economic advantage for parts with cosmetic surfaces complex shapes with close tolerances or forged titaniumgrade strength millions of liquidmetal parts have been made for consumer electronics providing nearly indestructible cases close fitting chassis and hinges and clamps that perform reliably even after thousands of cycles the simplicity of our onestep molding process lends itself to high rate production with remarkable consistency from part to part our business focus is on small precision parts typically weighing up to g while parts must be designed to eject from a mold advanced tooling methods such as slides are available to accommodate critical features a welldesigned part can replace an assembly of machined parts and can be made substantially thinner than other conventional metal parts liquidmetal alloys are truly exceptional for a variety of specialized applications utilizing this revolutionary process product development managers and engineers have been able to overcome many manufacturing obstacles the molding process and a highly unique combination of properties allow “outside the box” thinking relative to traditional metal forming processes when

assurance liquidmetal technologies is committed to providing the highest quality parts to customers which means careful attention and regulation of the endtoend materials and fabrication processes as a recent breakthrough in engineered materials technology bulk metallic glass alloys require extremely high quality standards to ensure reliability and repeatability in part performance many of the analysis tools that are used in traditional metallurgy can be used to assess the quality of liquidmetal processes but often in ways as unique as the alloy itself liquidmetal technologies uses a wide variety of tools to track the quality of its products from initial alloy production to final part performance examples of amorphous and crystalline materials under a high power microscope chemistry since the material properties of liquidmetal alloys are inseparably linked to its glassy structure the alloy composition which dictates its glass forming ability is of crucial importance liquidmetal alloys have incredibly precise compositions and extremely low levels of contaminants such as oxygen differential scanning calorimetry dsc a technique for studying the heat release associated with material phase transitions which can be used to extract information about volumetric amorphous content of ascast parts optical microscopy high quality bulk metallic glass parts can be identified by their uniquely featureless surfaces when an ultrahigh polished is applied to a specimen mechanical strength ascast mechanical properties can also be used to determine the consistency and reliability of the alloy and processing method delivering on promises were changing everything you know about metal parts processing why not challenge us get a quote finishing  liquidmetal®

executives contact contact us finishing there are multiple finishing options that are available to liquidmetal® parts degating upon ejection from the mold liquidmetal parts are attached to a tree that must be removed the tree includes the sprue runner and gate as excess features the simplest means of removing this material is to use a waterjet system where the tree is clamped into a fixture and quickly cut leaving only the parts with a noncosmetic quality surface where the gate was removed in some cases this surface quality may be sufficient for the application however if not the surface will need to be processed further cnc machining at the manufacturing center of excellence in rancho santa margarita liquidmetal technologies operates a cnc machining center liquidmetal alloys are a very hard and strong material draft angles are required on all surfaces to ensure that the mold can eject the part without causing damage to either the part or the mold holes with tolerances in the ±mm ±” range can be machined along with grinding operations performed on surfaces and outer diameters that can hold the same tolerance in some cases parts will be molded as close to tolerance as possible and cleaned up with minimal stock removal from the part in a secondary operation surface treatment near optical surface finish featured on two asmolded liquidmetal parts most customers chose to utilize the asmolded finish of liquidmetal parts this allows us to do a minimal amount of post processing on the surface and leaves the customer with a finish that matches the surface roughness of the mold if a polished mold is specified it is typical to see liquidmetal parts come out of the tool with a surface roughness of µm µin the best corrosion resistance also occurs with an asmolded product in some cases customers may determine that a blasted finish is optimal for aesthetic reasons a variety of blasting media can be used for this including zirconia alumina silica etc this can be discussed further with liquidmetal engineers other options for part finishes include painting and even pvd physical vapor deposition liquidmetal vs cnc machining liquidmetal compared to common
