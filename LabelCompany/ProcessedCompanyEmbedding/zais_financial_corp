issued shares of the combined company common stock for each share of sam common stock held immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and holders of operating partnership units of sam will receive  operating partnership units in the surviving partnership for each limited partnership interest held immediately prior to the effective time of the merger  the value of any fractional
