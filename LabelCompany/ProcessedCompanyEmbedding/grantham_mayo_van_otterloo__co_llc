jeremy grantham from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search robert jeremy goltho grantham cbe born  october  is a british investor and cofounder and chief investment strategist of grantham mayo  van otterloo gmo a bostonbased asset management firm gmo is one of the largest managers of such funds in the world having more than us  billion in assets under management as of march  grantham is regarded as a highly knowledgeable investor in various stock bond and commodity markets and is particularly noted for his prediction of various bubbles he has been a vocal critic of various governmental responses to the global financial crisis grantham started one of the worlds first index funds in the early s in  he was included in the  most influential ranking of bloomberg markets magazine contents  early life  investment philosophy  views on market bubbles and the  credit crisis  views on fossil fuels and the keystone pipeline  philanthropy  awards and honours  references  external links  jg letter early lifeedit grantham was born in ware hertfordshire and grew up in doncaster he studied economics at the university of sheffield in  he completed an mba at harvard business school investment philosophyedit granthams investment philosophy can be summarized by his commonly used phrase reversion to the mean essentially he believes that all asset classes and markets will revert to mean historical levels from highs and lows his firm seeks to understand historical changes in markets and predict results for seven years into the future when there is deviation from historical means averages the firm may take an investment position based on a return to the mean the firm allocates assets based on internal predictions of market direction views on market bubbles and the  credit crisisedit grantham has built much of his investing reputation over his long career by correctly identifying speculative market bubbles as they were happening and steering clients assets clear of impending crashes grantham avoided investing in japanese equities and real estate in the late eighties as well as technology stocks during the internet bubble in the late nineties in gmos april  quarterly letter grantham spoke to the tendency for all bubbles to revert to the mean saying “ for the record i wrote an article for fortune published in september  that referred to three “near certainties” profit margins would come down the housing market would break and the riskpremium all over the world would widen each with severe consequences you can perhaps only have that degree of confidence if you have been to the history books as much as we have and looked at every bubble and every bust we have found that there are no exceptions we are up to  completed bubbles every single one of them has broken all the way back to the trend that existed prior to the bubble forming which is a very tough standard so it’s simply illogical to give up the really high probabilities involved at the asset class level all the data errors that frighten us all at the individual stock level are washed away at these great aggregations it’s simply more reliable higherquality data ” in his fall  gmo letter grantham commented on the underlying causes of the world credit crisis “ to avoid the development of crises you need a plentiful supply of foresight imagination and competence a few quarters ago i likened our financial system to an elaborate suspension bridge hopefully built with some good oldfashioned victorian overengineering well it wasn’t overengineered it was built to do just one under favorable conditions now with hurricanes blowing the corps of engineers as it were are working around the clock to prop up a suspiciously jerrybuilt edifice when a crisis occurs you need competence and courage to deal with it the bitterest disappointment of this crisis has been how completely the buildup of the bubbles in asset prices and risktaking was rationalized and ignored by the authorities especially the formerly esteemed chairman of the fed  ” “ i ask myself ‘why is it that several dozen people saw this crisis coming for years’ i described it as being like watching a train wreck in very slow motion it seemed so inevitable and so merciless and yet the bosses of merrill lynch and citi and even us treasury secretary hank paulson and fed chairman ben bernanke — none of them seemed to see it coming i have a theory that people who find themselves running majorleague companies are real organizationmanagement types who focus on what they are doing this quarter or this annual budget they are somewhat impatient and focused on the present seeing these things requires more people with a historical perspective who are more thoughtful and more rightbrained — but we end up with an army of leftbrained immediate doers so it’s more or less guaranteed that every time we get an outlying obscure event that has never happened before in history they are always going to miss it and the three or fourdozenodd characters screaming about it are always going to be ignored    so we kept putting organization people — people who can influence and persuade and cajole — into top jobs that onceinabluemoon take great creativity and historical insight but they don’t have those skills ” grantham focused on the issue of personal traits and leadership in trying to explain how we reached the current economic crisis views on fossil fuels and the keystone pipelineedit grantham has repeatedly stated that the rising cost of energy  the most fundamental commodity  between  and  has falsely inflated economic growth and gdp figures worldwide and that we have been in a carbon bubble for approximately the last  years in which energy was very cheap he believes that this bubble is coming to an end he has stated his opposition to the keystone pipeline on the basis of the ruinous environmental consequences that its construction will bring to alberta and to the entire planet due to the contribution that burning the extracted oil would make to climate change philanthropyedit grantham together with his wife hannelore established the grantham foundation for the protection of the environment in  substantial commitments have been made to imperial college london the london school of economics and the university of sheffield to establish the grantham institute  climate change and environment the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment and the grantham centre for sustainable futures respectively which will enable the institutions to build on their extensive expertise in climate change research the  tax filing for the grantham foundation for the protection of the environment shows the foundation donated  million to both the sierra club and to nature conservancy and  million to the environmental defense fund that year the foundation has also provided
