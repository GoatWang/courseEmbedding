the company’s  regional mexican exploration program within this area subsequent field work identified a  square hectare area of intensely altered rocks that contains several prospective targets including the ixtaca zone in  a drill program was designed to test a small outcrop due to the limited surface exposure of the ixtaca vein system three holes were fanned out in a small area each in a different direction in august  almaden reported assay results from first hole ever drilled in the ixtaca zone tu intersected  metres of gt gold and gt silver and multiple high grade intervals including  metres of gt gold and gt silver following discovery hole tu extensive drilling has traced mineralization over one kilometer in a northeasterly orientation and showed the main ixtaca zone to be a broad and robust vein system intersected by multiple high grade veinlets in a variety of orientations drilling has also identified two additional zones the ixtaca north zone and the northeast extension to date over  holes have been drilled in the area in april  almaden announced an updated resource estimate and prefeasibility study pfs location of the project the project is located  kilometers southeast of the pachuca mine one of the largest gold and silver deposits in mexico with a historic production of  billion ounces of silver and  million ounces of gold the deposit is also welllocated in the industrial heart of puebla state it is easily accessible from mexico city ixtaca and  kilometers north of puebla city a railserviced industrial park is  kilometers away and regional power is provided by the laguna verde nuclear power station located  kilometers to the east on a deep sea port community involvement almaden has invested in the tuligtic area since  we have had over  local people working with almaden in our ongoing exploration program on behalf of our shareholders we invest in ongoing employee training programs and are actively involved in the communitys health and social welfare projects to date we have helped with local construction and improvement projects including work on a school public bathrooms a community hall a local church and a hospital see our community projects for more information on local projects  almaden is proud to be working in puebla and to be building long term relationships in the communities near the ixtaca project geology of the project the ixtaca zone occurs in deformed carbonate rocks about two kilometres southwest of the tuligtics porphyry copper zone drilled in  surface manifestation of the ixtaca zone is very obscure because the region is almost completely covered with volcanic ash reports of historic clay mines brought almaden’s attention to the area the epithermal goldsilver target area is characterised by extensively clay altered and silicified volcanic rocks the alteration is indicative of the upper parts of an epithermal system and includes replacement silicification and sinter the precipitate or sediment that was deposited from a hot spring quartzcalcite veins with textural evidence of boiling have been identified outcropping in limestone roughly  meters beneath the exposed sinter initial sampling of these veins and from float boulders of breccia containing quartz vein fragments returned anomalous values in gold and silver as high as  gt silver and  gt gold the sinter and the overlying altered volcanic rocks are highly anomalous in mercury and arsenic the ixtacas kaolinite and replacement silica alteration zones are typical of the surface manifestation of an ancient hotspring environment within the feeder faults which channel hot mineral solutions from depth to surface hotsprings quartz carbonate gold and silver can deposit this was the model employed by almaden in testing the ixtaca zone where in an arroyo beneath the kaolinite and silica alteration some very narrow  to  centimetre veins with epithermal textures occur in a small about  metres by  metres outcrop these veins assayed up to  gt gold and  gt silver small cobbles of float in the creek returned assays of up to  gt silver and another such cobble assayed  gt gold work prior to drilling included a single induced polarization geophysical line across this area which detected a resistivity anomaly and several short geochemical soil sample lines showed coincident anomalous gold and silver values recent

expert comments the gold report interview with bob moriarty  almaden minerals ltdis an absolutely perfect example of valueadded thinking bob moriarty says i happen to like the fatherson management team of duane and morgan poliquin i have been to the project and love it the company is moving toward production on the tuligtic project in puebla mexico it spun the other assets off as almadex minerals in a for special for shareholders thats a perfect example of what you need to do in a market bottom investors tend to forget that commodities move up and down and you cant kill a project because todays price is too low you have to weather through it is almaden going to be able to produce silver and gold at a profit at a yearyear trading average my belief is absolutely yes so i dont care what the price is today i want to see it move forward the cost of diesel is cheap the cost of iron is cheap the cost of labor is cheap its a tremendous opportunity to take advantage of thatif you go down to your local corvette dealer and a brand new corvette was quoted to you six months ago at m but today the same red sports car is on special for m that sounds like a hell of a deal to me almaden applied that logic to its recent purchase of the barely used  tonperday capacity rock creek mill a move that could reduce the initial capital cost estimate of rampup for ixtaca by m it was an
