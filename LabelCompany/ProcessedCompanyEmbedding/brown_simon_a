to the inconspicuous gym it is here that simon brown prepares to win the worlds welterweight championship i love to train brown says i love to be better than someone else i love the people that train with me and i love the glory  the word love receives extra emphasis simon brown who turned  in august was born in jamaica and moved to washington dc with his family when he was  jamaica was beautiful and i hope  me day i can defend the title there brown says my family moved here because this is the land of opportunity there was always this quiet little kid sitting on the stoop in front of the gym whenever i came down here said his manager and trainer jose pepe correa who has worked with sugar ray leonard one day brown got off the stoop and went into the gym his progressed ram idly winning the mu championship the washington dc golden gloves title twice and the junior olympics title his amateur record was  simon was fighting for trophies and king the house correa said so we decided to fight for money and fill the house           brown turned professional in  and quickly ran his record to  he fought mostly in atlantic city where casual fans and hardened boxing writers noted the conclusiveness of his knockouts on march   espn televised browns second fight a sixround decision over tough vito masilli of new jersey brown weighed in at  pounds a junior welterweight  he showed good movement a sharp stinging jab fast combinations and the ability to avoid most of the charges of the powerful masilli but he didnt seem to possess knockout power things changed quickly just ask marylands cookie james ko  distancefighter carlos santana ko a sergio bautista ko  or new york powerpuncher allen braswell ko  whether or not simon brown can knock man out weve been trying to kill the myth about jamaican fighters being runners correa said as far as simon is cot corned the myth is dead  he date was december   and the fight was billed as the homecoming it was simon browns fir professional fight in front of his local fan in maryland it took place in prince george county just outside washington the opponent was veteran junior welterweight weight ruby the snake ortiz a ma who had gone the distance with esteban dejesus and alfredo escalera and defeated sean mannion most observers figured that ortiz would try to psych out brown with all the trick he had learned over the years ortiz style has been classified as crafty which is a euphemism for dirty ortiz opened the scheduled eight rounder by circling the steadily advancing brown brown moved in while ortiz war against the ropes and unleashed a lightningfast barrage of punches to the body before moving away ortiz held his hand over his head mocking brown and calling him in brown maneuvered ortiz to the other side of the ring and pummeled ho body until the snake slithered through the ropes and was counted out a first round knockout—all body punches brown kayoed veteran clubfighter pete seward in eight rounds in april the jamaican welterweight is  with  kayos they used to call welterweight i champion jose napoles mantequilla in tribute to his smooth as butter fighting style they call simon brown mantequilla too simon patterns himself after napoles and ray leonard says correa who gave him the tag he is as smooth as napoles was presently brown is  with  consecutive knockouts his last two wins a kayo of pete seward and a oneround knockout of domingo ayala the faded onetime junior welterweight contender indicate brown is ready for meatier opposition  most guys wont fight him says correa weve been trying to get johnny bumphus for six or seven fights and he wont touch us the danger in fighting simon brown is his style—he doesnt have just one he adapts to whatever the opponent is doing before a fight correa will telephone boxing insiders like angelo dundee ralph citro and don elbaum who promotes brown to find out how an opponent fights and brown is prepared from the information but if the fighter changes his style during the bout brown has the ability to change accordingly if an opponent waits to counterpunch as pete seward did brown will move in and aim his right to the body behind his jab if an opponent moves toward him brown can fight backing up counterpunching off the ropes if need be and throwing a wicked overhand right over an opponent’s jab itch   as simon browns record grows so does his confidence the recent usbai rankings list him as the eighth best welterweight in the world thats too low brown said but people will soon see that i belong higher i want wbc welterweight champions milton mccrory because he likes to fight inside and he doesnt have the strength to fight inside ill have one or two more fights and then go for it browns next fight is scheduled to be against ranked contender roger stafford who just lost in his bid for don currys wba welterweight crown by first round knockout the formative stage of browns career is near completion he has passed all the tests the boxing skills the strength i and most important the discipline are all there in simon brown the smooth skinned young man on the brink of worldwide recognition after a workout on the heavybag he sits perspiring on a bench next to his stablemate the usba’s ninthranked welterweight maurice blocker who is simultaneously closing in on a welter weight title shot the two are close friends and work each others corner along with correa al every fight they are reaching for the same goal but neither feels he is in corn petition with the other i would never want to fight maurice and i hope that day never comes brown says we both workand supper each other secretly though brown must hope he reaches his goal first he loves the spotlight too much to share it  ‹ see more
