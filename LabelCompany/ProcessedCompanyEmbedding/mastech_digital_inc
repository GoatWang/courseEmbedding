the presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap  investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of nongaap financial measures as an analytical tool  reconciliations of these nongaap measures to their comparable gaap measures are included in the attached financial tables we believe that providing nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share offers investors useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business  additionally management uses these nongaap financial measures in evaluating the companys performance specifically the nongaap financial measures contained herein exclude the following expense items amortization of acquired intangible assets  we amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with our june  acquisition of

of other companies within our industry and facilitates a helpful comparison of our results with other periods stockbased compensation expenses  we incur material recurring expense related to noncash stockbased compensation we exclude these expenses in our nongaap financial measures because we believe that it provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance  in particular because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under asc  we believe that providing nongaap financial measures that exclude these expenses allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies within our industry and facilitates comparison of our results with other periods severance charges  from time to time we incur severance expense related to the termination by the company of leadership personnel  while it is probable that these expenses will occur in the future we believe that providing nongaap financial measures that exclude these expenses are useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses and facilitate comparison of our results with other periods acquisition related transaction expenses  we incurred significant expenses in connection with our acquisition of the services division of infotrellis inc which we would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations  these transaction expenses included investment banking fees legal expenses audit charges related to our acquired companies and various advisor costs  we believe that providing nongaap financial measures that exclude these expenses

from the account manager who reached out to me about a contract opportunity she tried pumping me for information about how she could place her contractors at my current place of employment this had nothing to do with the position i was applying for elsewhere she also showed a lack of discretion about contacting my current employer which i feared she would do because she had contacts there and didnt seem to understand the need to keep my job search confidential i would be hesitant to work with this company againinterview questions who is in charge of placing contractors at your current
