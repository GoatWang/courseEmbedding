objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime

to be accepted into johnson  johnson innovation jlabs  torontoback to thc news share storypm et  benzingaas a cannabisfocused company avicanna did not know what the outcome would be when it applied to be part of jlabs  toronto yet the company was delighted to make it ceo aras azadian and latam vice president lucas nosiglia told benzinga in a recent interview a few things became clear early in our chat first these guys know about entrepreneurship and overcoming adversity this is not their first nor second successful venture second they understand the value of what canopyboulder’s micah tapman recently defined as “authentic relationships” for success third big things can be accomplished with relatively little money getting mj into jlabs the story of how avicanna was accepted into jlabs  toronto starts with azadian and justin grant phd mba a member of the former’s scientific advisory board and the research program manager of the sttarr innovation centre with princess margaret cancer centre at the university health network the largest cancer center in canada the idea of approaching jlabs  toronto popped up during a conversation between the two although it seemed like a long shot they went for it they really trusted their vision as background johnson  johnson nyse jnj innovation jlabs  toronto is a squarefoot life science innovation center located in mars discovery district the labs provide a flexible environment for startup companies pursuing new technologies and research platforms to advance medical care through a no strings attached model johnson  johnson innovation does not take an equity stake in the companies occupying jlabs and the companies are free to develop products either on their own or by initiating a separate external partnership with johnson  johnson innovation or any other company “our first approach with them was very positive” azadian told benzinga “however we knew they had never accepted any cannabinoid companies before” related link picking marijuanarelated investments phyto partners walks us through its criteria the ceo and his team explained that avicanna is not just a cannabinoid company but a biotech company involved in the cannabis space the pitch was convincing and the company made it through to the first phase of interviews “they understood the business they understood the approach they understood the leveraging of different regulatory frameworks in the us and canada” azadian added all of this got them into another interview stage and eventually after several filtering instances avicanna was accepted to be part of jlabs  toronto “companies at jlabs are at the leading edge of their field” rebecca yu heads of jlabs canada told benzinga “avicanna is focused on innovative approaches and technologies and was selected into jlabs based on meeting our stringent criteria for demonstrating compelling and credible science or technology that addresses a significant medical or market need “selection into jlabs does not infer any special investments or rights assigned to jj and our nostrings attached model offers entrepreneurial companies and technologies the ability to access a network of resources and similar stage companies to help them reach their potential” she added new company proven product line before moving on it’s time to properly introduce avicanna and what they do coming from a biotech background azadian had not only an understanding of the industry but also what he’s called an “incredible network” so he decided to leverage these assets and create a biotech company that was focused on cannabinoids and cannabinoid delivery mechanisms “what we noticed was there is a lot of sophistication with respect to cultivation in canada however due to the legal landscape there are limitations with respect to what licensed producers can do for rd on advanced delivery mechanisms” he explained “with respect to the american landscape even though in specific states producers can make the products and retail them in the medicinal and or recreational markets there are limitations with what the federal government and the fda will allow to be done clinically “there are gaps in the medical cannabis industries of the two countries that are in my opinion spearheading the evolution of the cannabis industry at a global level so we decided to leverage off of those gaps and be a multinational company that has the rd the product development and the ip with market acceptance in the us but bring that into a context where we can clinically develop it – and even collaborate with the top medical institutions in canada” related link discussing snoop doggs marijuanafocused vc firm beyond wearing the investor hat we differentiate with a broad internal ecosystem one of the early steps was a strategic partnership with scientus pharma a licensed dealer that allows avicanna to address these gaps to manufacture and clinically develop its product line soon after the biotech company went after the intellectual property for transdermal delivery mechanisms like patches and creams and a number of other products branding it as pura elements source avicanna “we are now in the clinical development phase” azadian continued pointing out the company is currently conducting animal trials to understand the actual bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of our products “we are conducting a spectrum of studies including safety toxicology and bioavailability to better understand each particular product” this is a doublesided effort on the one hand avicanna wants to prove the medical effectiveness of its products on the other hand they want to enhance them through diverse collaborations with scientists research facilities and institutions ultimately the idea is to develop different products with diverse cannabinoid and release profiles aimed at specific ailments how the patch works intrigued by how avicanna’s patches creams and tinctures work benzinga asked for an explanation how long to they take to act do they get you high or stoned “the transdermal technology is an effective delivery mechanism as it avoids the first pass metabolism and smoking because of its slow release profile the patient is avoiding an extreme surge of cannabinoids” azadian answered “i personally have used the patches i found with the thc in our  mg patch had minimal psychoactive effect which was incredible because i had the desired medical relief” a multinational focus a very important element to avicanna’s business model and plan is international presence they want to be early entrants in multiple nascent medical marijuana markets such as colombia switzerland germany spain chile brazil and argentina “since we first started with the venture we’ve been noticing that companies especially in canada are aiming at creating economies of scale for production to prepare for the legalization of the recreational markets in ” nosiglia who’s in charge of latam expansion said “our model is lean and capexlow as we focus on strategic partnerships we’ve managed to operate with our initial capital of c million  million so far leveraging our international networks to expand our footprint worldwide” related link ianthus enters the new york cannabis market does the  million acquisition make sense so what nosiglia is working on right now is establishing the foundations to get into new markets as they roll out countrywide regulations beyond compassionateuse and exceptions in markets such as argentina additionally avicanna has established a partnership in colombia which should allow them to cultivate and manufacture at a significant discount for local distribution and export “we decided to only raise what we needed and only tapped  strategic shareholders the majority of them are investment bankers that are heavily invested in the industry or strategic investors including ourselves – all of the founding partners have put in money as well that was the first round” azadian concluded “as we continue to progress and meet milestones we will be visiting future financing opportunities” check back soon for part  of this article where nosiglia and azadian will walk us through the largest opportunities in international markets why could europe and latin america prove valuable what’s the problem with spain are there opportunities left in
