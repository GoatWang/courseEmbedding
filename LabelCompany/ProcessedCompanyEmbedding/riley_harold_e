riley harold e riley was born in grandfield oklahoma during the great depression and moved about texas living in waco while his parents attended baylor university and later in fort worth when his father attended southwestern theological seminary  it was in fort worth as a senior in high school that he was asked to try out for the varsity football team – his first experience playing on a high school football team  harold was a natural talent and before the end of the season he had received football scholarships to almost every prestigious school in the southwest conference except his first choice baylor university  not to be deterred harold hitchhiked to waco camped out without an appointment in the head coach’s office until the coach gave in and let him participate in spring training with the team  he had his scholarship by the end of the practice  after a successful college football career at baylor that included becoming an all american and playing in the orange bowl harold declined an offer to be drafted by the los angeles ramsleaving baylor harold was barraged by job offers in the oil industry coaching football selling securities and insurance he tried his hand at most of those opportunities but became intrigued by the living benefits of whole life insurance products  based on a conviction that life insurance policy settlement options are a significant client benefit he began selling wholelife guaranteed cash value products that focused on helping clients create an income they could not outlive  harold spent his early years in the insurance business helping companies grow exponentially including the moody family’s company national western life insurance company  in  harold wanted to build something for himself and began a company that would be the predecessor to citizens inc  almost fifty years later citizens inc has more than  billion in assets and almost  billion insurance in force  at  years old harold e riley has achieved the goal he had as a young man “to make a million dollars and give it all away”  through the harold e riley foundation harold riley has made a profound and lasting impact on its beneficiaries – baylor university
