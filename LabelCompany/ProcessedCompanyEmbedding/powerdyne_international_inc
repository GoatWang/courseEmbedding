electrical power using its own proprietary technology apr    pm etincludes powerdyne international inc pwdy the last five years have brought much more attention on the energy issues that the global economy faces certainly alternatives like solar wind and even ion power are options to take advantage of in addition to their sustainability factor but what if there was a way to have on­‐ demand energy thats self­‐sustained and off the grid so that anyone could turn on a light switch despite what the rest of a city or even what the rest of a country encounters as far as power supply or lack thereof with this next company that can actually become a reality powerdyne international inc otc otcpkpwdy has a proprietary technology offering an independent electric utility to provide primary electric power off the grid to mid sized and large commercial consumers powerdynes product is a self­‐contained generator that utilizes a modified radial air­‐cooled aircraft engine to drive a ­‐ megawatt mw generator this generator works off of almost any gaseous fuel source including propane methane ethane and even hydrogen domestically many cities have come accustomed to those summer months where the increased demand for power creates brownouts or even blackouts in fact a new report from the wall street journal sites that the entire us power grid could be shut down for more than a month if just  of the over  electric substations placed throughout the nation were sabotaged by terrorists or other criminals this report comes on the heels of several events that have occurred over the last year most notably the sniper attack last april on the substation in san jose california knocked out  transformers many feared it could have been a sophisticated dress rehearsal for a more large­‐scale attack the government has stated that it still needs stronger authority to regulate the power grid on a national level but regardless of regulation the threat is real and the journals report is only the first time that these results of the study have been made public more significantly these substations are not required to be protected in a cnn article jon wellinghoff former chairman to the federal energy regulatory commission had reportedly urged congress to fill a void in federal law that he says doesnt empower any federal agency to demand better security around electrical substations according to wellinghoff these stations only have chain­‐link fences and cameras for protection whats more is that these cameras dont capture details outside of the fence we need to have a national coordinated plan and we have to have a federal agency that is in charge wellinghoff said as washington fights for more regulation the threat still remains and for powerdynes product this becomes a huge offset to combat grid vulnerability the company states that its basic pdi unit produces mw of power  and has an expected operational life of  hours before rebuild or replacement of the prime mover thats more than  years of power at a constant rate of usage as far as ease of installation and transport one unit which measures  feet in diameter and  feet long can be fitted comfortably inside a standard  x  x  shipping container box this houses the unit on site for easy handling as well as transport and delivery anywhere in the world there are several other competitors in this space including cummins nysecmi kohler detroit diesel and caterpillar nysecat all of which manufacture generator sets in an interview in september of last year ceo of powerdyne dale p euga expressed that though there is competition in the generator space powerdyne holds several advantages over its much more bulky competition not only do these competitors typical units weigh more than  times that of powerdynes pdigenset  pounds vs  pounds these generators are much larger measuring ­‐ ft long ft high and ft wide nearly the same size as pwdys enclosure for its generator moreover mr euga stated that a special performance characteristic of the pdigenset is that it can perform very efficiently in extreme cold temperatures and at high altitudes where­‐as other technologies especially diesel find a deterioration in capability starting at altitudes over  feet most mining applications in south america for example are above  feet and require multiple engines to drive one generator powerdyne is able to generate power at an inexpensive rate and at reduced costs to the client because the client does not have to buy any equipment they just pay for the electricity in conjunction with this powerdyne has identified its client base as commercial users mines manufacturers and medical centers that have a minimum electrical base of mw or more according to the company the electricity produced by the pdigenset is consumed in parallel with the main electrical source usually the grid and is used to augment total consumption thus resulting in a savings of ­‐ annually compared to traditional means of power consumption i see military applications as a big niche for the company as well not only has this product been shown to be more compact and much lighter compared to its competition but its versatility within various terrains also allows military clients to send this product on a multitude of missions including those in remote destinations in a recent bloomberg article the editor cites that defense spending or military expenditure will increase this year for the first time since  mainly in russia asia and the middle east over the last fiscal year of  however the united states remained the top spender with an estimated  billion spent major us defense contractors including lockheed martin corp and boeing lead this pack but what about the support systems and infrastructure needed to maintain military camps and bases more importantly these funds are not directed solely to wartime efforts either from disaster relief to humanitarian efforts and self­‐sustaining power for the developing world the pdigenset can provide a source of continuous inexpensive energy which puts powerdyne at the forefront of a brand new solution to an age old issue with such a vast array of uses certainly pwdy has the product and the technology to provide opportunities for inexpensive off­‐grid energy for many companies that is half the battle the second half is the leadership to push this to market and for powerdyne the team championing these efforts has a wealth of experience and industry foresight ceo and chairman of the board mr dale p euga has experience in the military serving with the us armys special forces a­‐team and has a background in architecture with a degree from boston architectural college these leadership qualities lead mr euga to become the founder builder and manager of a successful architectural firm euga even formed comvest international inc in  to organize and manage international construction projects mr euga also directly arranged acquisition and construction financing as well as oversaw the development of industrial manufacturing and resort facilities in panama netherlands belize bermuda and spain euga also worked as the coordinator and overseer for the lenders powerdynes ceo is incredibly versed in construction and knows the necessary components needed to complete a successful project from  until the formation of powerdyne inc mr euga had focused on independently developing the underlying product concepts related to the pdigenset operations manager james orourke brings more than thirtyfive years of manufacturing experience to the rapidlygrowing developmentstage electrical generator manufacturer his background in international heavy manufacturing is a good fit for powerdyne which sees huge potential in the foreign marketplace lead engineer and vice president of production stephen l caromile has a wealth of experience in the engineering field he and euga are currently designing powerdynes series  prototype prime mover caromile designed and engineered many of the pdigensets parts and drafted the master plans and specifications for the its construction mr caromiles background in process mechanical civil and aeronautical engineering in which he was the cell manager overseeing the repair of aeronautical jet turbine components brings firsthand knowledge of radial engines as prime movers in electrical generators to powerdynes stable of talent in conclusion powerdyne has a unique technology that allows for a compact inexpensive efficient solution not only to a problem and but even to an impending threat that the us faces moreover the company has also identified that it can reach far beyond its domestic capabilities and aid developing areas in supplying a viable source of power that was once unattainable by any other means because the pdigenset is easily accessible in many diverse locations the companys leadership has an incredible wealth of industry expertise that should grant it to successfully push this product to market and continue to implement future enhancement allowing for the pdigenset to remain at the forefront of off‐grid power generation advancements
