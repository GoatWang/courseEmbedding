bortz “nevertheless we are increasing the lower end of our sameproperty ebitda range and increasing the entire range for adjusted ebitda adjusted ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share to reflect the beat in the second quarter this is due to our success in achieving higher nonroom revenues and reduced expenses despite lowering our revpar range for the year which is mostly attributable to the

during the fourth quarter that said the company expected as much and even outperformed its forecast despite facing the headwinds of a weak hotel market and selling  million of assets last year unfortunately those two factors will continue to weigh on results in  pebblebrook results the raw numbers metric q  millions q  millions yearoveryear change sameproperty revpar    adjusted ffo     affo per share    data source pebblebrook hotel trust revpar revenue per available room affo adjusted funds from operations what happened with pebblebrook this quarter pebblebrook took a step back sameproperty revpar was flat versus  which was a bit below the companys guidance range of  to  due to weak business travel an uptick in new hotel supply and continued global economic headwinds such as a strong dollar those factors as well as the companys shrinking hotel portfolio weighed on earnings however results did come in well above the companys guidance range as adjusted ffo was  million or  per share while the companys forecast was  million to  million and  to  respectively one factor driving that higher result was a  decline in sameproperty expenses because of that expectationbeating quarter the companys fullyear results also came in ahead of guidance adjusted ffo rose  to  million or  per share which was above the highend of its guidance range of  million to  million and  to  respectively the fourthquarter was a busy one for the company on the asset sale side it completed an asset exchange with a former joint venture partner to redeem its  interest in the manhattan collection and then sold the manhattan nyc for  million the company also sold the doubletree by hilton hotel bethesda for  million during the quarter the company used the proceeds to redeem some preferred shares and repay debt which was down to  billion as of the end of the year about  million less than the yearago period image source pebblebrook hotel trust what management had to say ceo jon bortz had this to say about the companys results we are very pleased with our  results and the continued improvements we made throughout our portfolio in  both operationally and from valueenhancing renovations in addition we had significant success with our strategic disposition plan completing numerous property and asset dispositions totaling  million the us hotel industry ended yet another year at its highest occupancy ever despite weak business travel an uptick in new supply and continued headwinds from global economic challenges including a strong us dollar for pebblebrook in  we grew sameproperty wholly owned ebitda by  adjusted ebitda by  and adjusted ffo per share by  and we increased our dividend by  all representing record levels we experienced this growth and record numbers while also completing several property dispositions which reduced the size of the companys portfolio but lowered leverage and increased liquidity aside from jettisoning hotels to improve its balance sheet the company also invested  million to spruce up several of its other properties to enhance their profitability these recently renovated and repositioned hotels were then able to increase their market share and cash flow last year which is a trend the company expects to continue in  looking forward that said despite improvements in its retained portfolio and more optimism in the hotel industry the company expects its financial results to decline in  the company sees sameproperty ebitda falling  on the low end to  at the high end those declines when combined with a smaller portfolio should push adjusted ffo down to a range of  million to  million or  to  per share which represent decreases of  to  versus last year matt dilallo has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley

results still came in above expectations due to strong demand and share repurchases matthew dilallo tmfmd apr   at am pebblebrook hotel trusts nysepeb financial results continue heading in reverse due to the companys strategic repositioning plan not only did its decision to sell hotels cause earnings to slip but recent redevelopment projects led to greaterthanexpected disruption at several of its hotels however despite these and other headwinds pebblebrooks financial results were either within or above its guidance range pebblebrook results the raw numbers metric q  q  yearoveryear change sameproperty revpar    affo  million  million  affo per share    data source pebblebrook hotel trust revpar  revenue per available room affo  adjusted funds from operations image source getty images what happened with pebblebrook this quarter pebblebrooks results continue to head lower sameproperty revpar slipped a bit versus last year though it was within the companys guidance range of  to  thats despite significant disruptions from redevelopment projects at revere hotel boston common hotel palomar los angeles beverly hills and the tuscan fishermans wharf without which revpar would have been  basis points higher meanwhile affo declined versus last year as a result of the sale of eight hotels from its portfolio due to its strategic repositioning plan that said adjusted affo was above the high end of its  million to  million guidance range thanks to the positive impacts of national events in washington dc as well as healthy demand in the nashville seattle and san diego markets which offset tough comparable results in san francisco and los angeles affo on a pershare basis also came in above the companys guidance of  to  per share aside from the positives impacting affo the pershare result benefited from the fact that pebblebrook repurchased  million in stock during the quarter which reduced the share count by  versus the prior year the company continued paring down its hotel portfolio during the quarter agreeing to sell the dumont nyc for  million the company expects to close that sale in late june and could use the proceeds to buy back more shares or reduce debt what management had to say ceo jon bortz commented on the results our portfolios operating results in the first quarter were in line with our overall expectations despite greater than anticipated disruption from one of our significant redevelopment projects our financial results were driven by solid demand in several of our markets including washington dc which benefited from the inauguration and the womens march as well as nashville seattle and san diego as expected this strength was offset by difficult yearoveryear comparisons in san francisco and los angeles the loss of the super bowl in san francisco and the elimination of the prior year demand from the displaced families affected by the porter ranch gas leak in los angeles negatively impacted our growth however excluding the disruption from the redevelopment projects at revere hotel boston common hotel palomar los angeles beverly hills and the tuscan fishermans wharf first quarter revpar growth would have been  basis points higher which is a better indication of the operating performance of the portfolio as bortz points out the tailwind of strong demand in several key markets helped the company deliver results that were well within its expectations that said the companys overall financial performance will remain choppy as it continues redeveloping hotels to boost profitability and selling off additional properties driving the decision to divest according to bortz is that each sale allows us to take advantage of attractive current private market prices for our properties as well as the significant discount between our current share price and the underlying value of our assets on a private market basis looking forward pebblebrook is adjusting its fullyear guidance the company now sees affo coming in at  million to  million which represents reductions of  million and  million respectively from its prior guidance that said on a pershare basis the company expects affo to be in the range of  to  which is a pershare increase on the low end and unchanged at the high end matt dilallo has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends pebblebrook hotel trust the motley fool
