individualsfor organizationsthey sayclientscontact welcome leadership designfacilitating personal organizational and social changei believe that inspired and effective leadership is critical to addressing the biggest issues of our time and leadership  whether our own or someone elses  can also greatly color our daytoday experiences if leadership either by an organization or an individual has such potential for impact on the biggest and smallest aspects of our lives why not proactively design it rather than just leave it to chance i offer consulting and coaching services to help organizations and individuals design their leadership i see this as a way to pursue my personal mission of facilitating personal organizational and social change approachmy approach is facilitative and participatory in nature i bring coaching methods to all of my engagements knowing that when individuals or groups come to their own insights and solutions both the level of ownership and likelihood of follow through skyrocket with that in mind i design processes for inclusive participation effective collaboration decisive action and critical reflection and learning i approach each engagement first with deep listening skills so i can best understand your needs and culture and together we develop a design that is customized flexible and appropriate based on what we decide i may use a variety of facilitation research and assessment methods i also draw on my 0 years’ experience in the nonprofit and philanthropic sectors to share best practices and resources as appropriate backgroundrachel has worked extensively in the areas of leadership change management and strategy development for local national and international nonprofits and philanthropies she is a professional certified coach pcc through the international coach federation and holds a master’s degree in nonprofit administration from the university of san francisco she has trained in participatory

the christensen fund and the global fund for women a longtime champion of human rights rachel is chair of the board of the international accountability project a human rights advocacy organization that seeks to create development policies and practices that respect peoples homes environment and human rights   for individualsas i currently have very few openings for coaching clients i am focusing on providing executive coaching for nonprofit and philanthropic leaders working for social justice design your leadershipexecutive coachingexecutive coaching is a powerful professional alliance in which leaders receive customized support to help them lead confidently and effectively using proven tools and techniques i guide you through a process to assess where you are in your leadership and where you want to be together we set goals create and implement plans and celebrate successes as you become a more effective leader as your coach i can help youdevelop your leadership stylesucceed through empowering otherscommunicate powerfully and authenticallymanage organizational growth and transitionssustain yourself through a healthy worklife balanceproblemsolve complex or politicallycharged situationscoaching provides invaluable support to leaders at any stage of their career if you are in a new position coaching can help you start off on the right foot if you are reaching a plateau coaching can help you identify areas of growth or new goals that reinvigorate your work and if you are an executive coaching can be particularly beneficial in providing you with an appropriate confidential and unbiased sounding board two recent executive coaching clients described the benefits of our work together as follows rachel helped me clarify my own goals these conversations helped me understand how to approach each challenge in a way that was best for both the organization and for the organizations grantees and beneficiaries her questions helped me understand and see the impacts of everyones choices rachels commitment to social justice activism is fantastic and gave me the confidence that we approached these questions from the same set of values executive director of an international foundation after  months of coaching with rachel my relationships with my board and staff are night and day from where they were i am much less critical of the board and vice versa and were able to work together much better now a key staff member who was a real problem is now performing strongly and another is stepping up to new challenges successfully moreover ive learned a lot about myself ive become a better listener and am able to self correct i am managing challenges thoughtfully and strategically rather than with insecurity or defensiveness” executive director of a large local nonprofit organization for organizationsbelow are a few of the consulting services i offer for nonprofit organizations and foundationsthis is not the full menu but rather a sampling to give you a flavor of my work  depending on your focus some of the services may be provided through my role as program director at bay area justice funders network designing strategya participatory and inclusive approach to strategymany organizations find strategic planning either expensive a waste of precious time or both my approach is to create a strategic planning process that is the appropriate size and scope to fit with your organization’s needs and constraints i begin with learning about your past planning efforts organizational culture and key strategic questions i then work closely with you to design and facilitate an inclusive and thorough process that allows you to create the plan that best represents your vision for your organization i often use the technology of participation planning method which is particularly effective in developing consensus and involving people at all levels of the organization building capacitystrengthening leaders organizations and movementsi design and implement capacitybuilding programs of all shapes and sizes calling on my training facilitation and coaching skills as well as my knowledge of nonprofit management and organizational effectiveness often beginning with individual andor organizational assessment including myersbriggs type indicator strengthsfinder and organizational diagnosis i then create and lead a process for reflection discovery and action this may include cohortbased workshop series peer learning networks or communities of practice and coaching for individuals andor teamsmanaging changehelping groups navigate change gracefullyorganizations must manage change as much as they work to create it rapid growth loss of funding leadership transition or launching a new program can all present unforeseen structural operational and cultural challenges for organizations i can help organizations plan for or respond to critical transition points helping them be resilient and adaptable in the face of change knowing that the soft stuff is the hard stuff and that culture eats strategy for lunch i focus on the interpersonal and cultural aspects of organizational change as much as the technical and structural dont take it from meheres what clients say james irvine foundationgrantee capacity building“rachel is such a wise soul her trainings and coaching for our
