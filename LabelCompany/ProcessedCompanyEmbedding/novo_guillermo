products executive will become ceo of a new spinoff company versum covering materials technologies guillermo novo a current air products executive will become ceo of a new spinoff company versum covering materials technologies anthony salamonecontact reporterof the morning call ceo of new air products spinoff company were in control of our destiny air products has been active in mergers and acquisitions for years it has divested itself of various divisions closing a chemicals plant in glendon for example and exiting the medicalequipment businessbut never in its year history has trexlertowns air products spun off one of its businesses to form a separate company that will happen next year with its materials technologies division already renamed versum materials its soontobe chief executive guillermo novo will lead an estimated global workforce of about 0 at  plants including more than 0 employees locallythe yearold novo has been with air products since  and has spent nearly three decades in specialty materials first with rohm and haas and later dow chemical co in commercial marketing and general management positions he became executive vice president of materials technologies in october a native of puerto rico novo has lived in south america and asia besides the us he and his wife reside in philadelphia and novo said he also keeps an apartment in breinigsville in a recent interview at his trexlertown office novo would not say where versum technologies would locate its headquarters or if more jobs would be eliminated air products cut about  jobs in the past year but hasnt disclosed where the cuts have been in its global workforce of approximately 0 chris shipley  the morning call guillermo novo a current air products executive will become ceo of a new spinoff company versum technologies guillermo novo a current air products executive will become ceo of a new spinoff company versum technologies chris shipley  the morning call officials have said it is possible versum rhymes with assume could remain on the air products campus and novo indicated as much he also said if it moved versum would likely stay in commuting distance of the current air products headquarters on hamilton boulevardwe dont want to disrupt the research and development teams he said we have a lot of people and valuable talent we want to keep focused on and we dont want to do radical things to disrupt thatand while the company has stated completion of the taxfree spinoff to us shareholders should take effect on or before september novo said if we can do it quicker we will but its a process  we are not in control of all of it what follows are excerpts from the interviewq did company leaders consider an outright sale of materials technologiesa when you look at these kind of situations where the company is going to make a strategic move we have to consider all options our fiduciary obligation is to make sure we are covering all bases that were looking at the best interest of our shareholders so we have looked at all our options and the board and management decided a spinoff was the best option for us this business has a low tax base if we sell it you would get a really big tax impact that would dilute the amount of earnings that our shareholders would lose so its much better to give them the company if we do a spin the shareholders will get a share of each company and then theres no dilution of the value for our shareholders and thats really the whole driver for this from a shareholder perspective its going to be much better for themq why didnt air products embark on the spinoff of materials technologies soonera this is one of the good things for our organization its been in the news are they going to sell it are they not going to sell it its not a very positive environment for the people here i think this sets us in a path of were in control of our destiny we know where were going to go the option of being separated into a standalone company has been very positiveq in your last quarter materials technologies sales decreased to 0 million did that performance signal a decline for the new companya not at all if you look at the track record of performance over the last two years weve been in the process of improving our business for a while now in  we started an aggressive improvement plan and we can see the track record quarter over quarter weve gone from  million ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to  million ebitda so about 0 million improvement in two yearsright now were just dealing with market dynamics in our electronics business our delivery systems our equipment business we had told investors that the investment cycle for the semiconductor industry shows there was a clear sign that it was going to slow down a little bit we thought actually it was going to be earlier in the year it didnt happen we started to feel it in the fourth quarter but more importantly in  in the fourth quarter we had several big projects that we are not repeating now so its more an issue of the delivery systems sideq what exactly is meant by materials technologiesa were involved in different aspects in electronics were focused on materials that go into the semiconductor industry the one that makes the chips we have materials that are used as you make the layers of the chips we make a lot of those materials or we make materials used in the processing steps we also make equipment to deliver these materials so its not just the material itself but all the knowhow all the services that are required of them to make the chips of the future on the performance materials side we are in the additives business if you think about it its like the things that give it the spice and taste if you are cooking so our ingredients are very critical to making the customers end product work but we are a small component of their formulation the performance materials division of air products materials technologies segment provides additives to the construction composites adhesives coatings and other industries its additives go into many consumer products chairs car seats shoes and insulation to name a fewq where will versum be locateda we have not made any specific statements everybody is asking a thousand questions of things that still need to happen i think the theme that everybody needs to work with is this is a very successful business and we want to set it up for successwhat weve told everybody is look there is no need to do radical changes here if we move because theres an opportunity or we can get a nice site that gives us our own identity all of that will happen when we understand the choices that we have to make but the most important thing is we are probably going to stay in commuting distance because we dont want to disrupt the research and development teams we have a lot of people and valuable talent that we want to keep focused on and we dont want to do radical things to disrupt that we could be two minutes away  we have not gotten that far into all of the analysis to be honest a lot of people attribute more than what has actually been done this thing is moving quickly and were not going to do things without thinking them through when we say we dont know we really dont knowq where would you like the company to be headquartereda its not about where i want it to be located its about the new company everything were doing is about the success i take it very seriously that the wellbeing of the employees and their families … is according to what we do any decision we make is not for any one group but for the totality because we need to be viable we need to be on top of our industry we need to be able to compete and win in the space we are in and thats the driving force of all of the decisionsq how many jobs have been cut at materials technologies and do you foresee more cutsa i dont have a crystal ball what i can say is my priority right now is to build a new company that can flourish as the premier specialty materials company to do that we need to build infrastructure that we dont have and a bigger priority for me right now is building that efficientlyif you look at it from what we have done and i go back two years of improvement … we manage our costs we manage our productivity we change our products we move the plants weve done all kinds of things to improve our overall performance  as we move forward our issues probably will be will we adjust and make improvements as we go any company that stops doing that wont be aroundwe are going to be hiring heres a person we just hired pointing to renee giello materials technologies new global communications manager we just hired our controller our tax person were building a company were on the opposite side of things now we need to do it efficiently we need to do it in an organized way but thats what im saying our mindset is were in a different placeq where do you see the spinoff companys performance years from nowa at  billion in annual sales well be one of the larger chemicalmaterials players in the industry were going to be one of the more profitable ones so our goal has to be growth how do we really drive a more aggressive agenda now that we have the freedom to really leverage our resources for our own business how can we drive faster growth for creating value we will have more resources than we ever had available to drive that growthwere investing where we need to unlike the industrial gases industry we invent things we develop them we get them into the market then we invest in manufacturing its not like the reverse where you build a plant and sell the commodity were not selling a commodityq given your puerto rican roots have you gotten involved in the local hispanic communitya not necessarily ive been very involved with work as you can imagine the last six years have been a lot of change for meive really been focusing a lot on the work at hand and frankly theres been a lot of change at air products since i got here thats really my biggest priority — the organization were building weve got employees around the world we need to do this very well for the sake of the entire organization that were buildingasalamonemcallcomguillermo novotitle future ceo of air products materials technologies spinoff versum materialsage home
