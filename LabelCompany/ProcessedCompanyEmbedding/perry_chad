clients  apple bank of america ikea and microsoft to name a few who knows who he works with under strict nondisclosure the mission design products and services that fly off the shelves the firm ideo the man tom kelley he recently sat down with bobby ghoshal and jared erondu for the podcast high resolution he shared five ideas for anyone looking to innovate and come up with the next milliondollar idea  you have to know what problem to solve you dont know what problem to solve even if you think you do you dont this runs counter to what you might think to find the problem you must look at something with a fresh perspective  as if you know nothing about it he calls it vu jàdé déjà vu backwards  you have to withhold your agenda when looking for a milliondollar idea dont go into the process looking for examples that support your gut feeling or what you think you know  you have to set aside what you know set aside everything you know dont think its always done this way or it should be done that way make and record observations without judgment or opinion  you have to ask what was the person thinking wherever you decide to look observe people doing whatever it is they do then without agenda or judgment ask yourself what that person was thinking when she was doing her thing this is where insights will start coming  you have to ask what was the person feeling asking what a person was feeling will give you perspective on why she did what she did it will reveal the emotion of the situation it will reveal frustrations according to tom when you blend the thinking and feeling part of the equation youll find opportunities for innovation thats the part most people miss but thats where milliondollar ideas come from forget what you think you know to find out what you need to know looking at things with a fresh perspective means forgetting everything you know that also means its ok to look at industries you know nothing about hows that for counterintuitive but what tom kelley and ideo does works try it observe without judgment and who knows you could be one of the next upandcoming inc  founders the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not
