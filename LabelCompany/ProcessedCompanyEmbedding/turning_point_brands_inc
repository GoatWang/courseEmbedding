compared to  million in the first quarter a yearago interest expense for the quarter ended march   was  million which is  million or  lower than the yearago period this decrease is principally

in the midteens for chewing tobacco and highsingle digits for mst tpb outperformed the industry in both chewing tobacco and mst in pennsylvania as measured by msai tpb will continue to monitor the impact this excise tax has on consumer behavior california passed proposition  in november  which included new state excise taxes on liquid vapor products and cigar wraps for the first time effective april   all otp products became subject to the current  state excise tax on july   the tax on all otp products will increase to the new equalized rate that the industry estimates will be between  and  we believe that the new excise tax on myo cigar wraps adversely impacted category sales as california industry sales for the quarter were materially lower versus yearago california represents about  of industry myo cigar wraps cigars and mst sales and  of industry ecig volumes these segment percentages generally parallel tpb sales percentages we anticipate that california proposition  will affect

on the nyse” said tpb president and chief executive officer larry wexler “over the course of the last twelve months we have produced strong operating results and improved our cash flow completed two acquisitions and refinanced our debt we expect to continue to generate organic growth from our focus brands zigzag stoker’s and vaporbeast we plan to use our strong cash flow to further strengthen our brands reduce our debt and fund acquisitions we believe that we are increasingly wellpositioned to continue to grow the business and improve our operating performance” first quarter  results at a

refinancing incurred in the first quarter of  million net income of  million adjusted ebitda increased  to  million see schedule a for a reconciliation to net income salesforce infrastructure investment continued with manpower for the quarter up approximately  other highlights from the first quarter completed the first full quarter for the wind river smokeless tobacco brands and for the vaporbeast ecommerce business increased retail market share in both chewing tobacco and moist snuff tobacco “mst” according to msai management science associates inc “msai” administers a proprietary information system that captures sales from approximately  wholesalers to over  retailers tpb measures “mst” excluding pouch and snus products expanded retail market share in cigarette papers and held an  share in makeyourown “myo” cigar wraps the quarter had one additional shipping day to the trade versus  recent events tpb entered into a strategic partnership with vapor shark a leading distributor and manufacturer of premium vaping eliquids and hardware with nationwide distribution through independent retail vape shops as well as owned and franchised vapor shark branded retail locations tpb and vapor shark have agreed to explore ways to work together to provide bestinclass service to the wholesale vapor channel management observations on the first quarter smokeless products segment  of total net sales smokeless products net sales for the first quarter increased  to  million on the continuing growth of stoker’s mst despite an increasingly competitive environment stoker’s mst cases shipped in the quarter rose about  smokeless products volume comparisons to the prior year were favorably impacted by one additional shipping day for the  period partially offset by the impact of the pennsylvania excise tax increase see excise tax discussion below and by an increase in returned goods relative to the low volume of returns incurred during the new product introductory period a yearago for the quarter volume increased  and pricemix increased  yearoveryear industry volumes for chewing tobacco declined by approximately  in the quarter while mst was down approximately  according to msai tpb measures industry mst volumes excluding pouch and snus products tpb outpaced the industry in the quarter and grew its msai share in both chewing tobacco and mst gross profit for the smokeless segment increased  to  million segment gross margin contracted to  primarily from a lifo expense of  million in the quarter and continuing growth of stoker’s mst which carries a lower gross margin than chewing tobacco products absent lifo expense in both years gross profit increased  to  million and gross margin was  see schedule b for a reconciliation “we have established a strong foundation of stoker’s mst distribution in independent retailers and are now focused on generating consumer trial in those store sets while also accelerating our penetration in the chain store universe” said wexler “we are also on schedule to expand retail distribution of the regional wind river smokeless brands in late ” the mst industry increased pricing in late april  the increase ranged between  and  on oz cans large format tub pricing was more moderate and in the  range smoking products segment  of total net sales net sales of smoking products decreased  million for the quarter to  million net sales in the smoking segment were unfavorably impacted by the previously communicated yearend  trade inventory buildup on cigarette papers which was in line with our expectations and an initial trade inventory impact associated with the april   california tax on myo cigar wraps see excise tax discussion below zigzag ‘rillo cigar wraps continued to produce robust sales gains associated with expanded retail distribution for the quarter smoking products volumes decreased  while pricemix increased  industry volumes for cigarette papers declined by midsingledigits while myo cigar wraps grew by low doubledigits according to msai zigzag increased its market share versus the yearago period in cigarette papers and held an  share in myo cigar wraps according to msai smoking products gross profit for the quarter decreased by  million to  million gross margin decreased to  of net sales compared with  for the yearago quarter of  newgen new generation products segment  of total net sales newgen products net sales for the quarter grew  million to a record  million as a result of the inclusion of a full quarter of vaporbeast’s net sales in the first quarter volume increased  while pricemix accounted for an increase of  gross profit for the newgen segment increased for the quarter versus yearago by  million to a record  million gross margin weakened versus a yearago from  to  of net sales for the current period as a result of the mix impact of vaporbeast’s lower distributor margins on the segment “the vaporbeast integration is proceeding and results are progressing at better than anticipated levels” said wexler “through our november  acquisition of vaporbeast we now have ready access to the nontraditional retail outlets they serve and sharply enhanced insights into the product forms and attributes consumers are choosing operational improvements are being made across the business and we are pleased with the early progress and are readying plans to more fully leverage the vaporbeast platform late this year” wexler continued “while our strategic partnership with vapor shark is still in the formative stages we are jointly exploring a number of opportunities to collaborate and capture a larger share of the markets and channels we collectively serve we expect to provide more details next quarter” other performance measures total company net sales growth of  was driven by volume gains of  with pricemix contributing another  consolidated selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the quarter were  million compared to  million in  due primarily to the inclusion of a full quarter of vaporbeast’s sga strategic expenses and sales and marketing infrastructure investments for the first quarter of  sga strategic expenses were  million versus  million a year earlier nonrecurring new product launch costs of  million were  million higher than yearago recurring public company costs were  million nonrecurring launch costs in cost of goods sold in the  first quarter were  million compared to  million in the first quarter a yearago interest expense for the quarter ended march   was  million which is  million or  lower than the yearago period this decrease is principally attributable to lower average debt levels since our initial public offering coupled with the february  refinancing of our debt investment income from our master settlement agreement escrow monies amounted to  million in the quarter for the quarter ended march   diluted earnings per share was  and included an aftertax nonrecurring noncash charge on extinguishment of debt of  per diluted share capital expenditures in the quarter totaled  million total debt at march   was  million net debt at march   was  million compared to  million as

see schedule d for a reconciliation at march   there were  million common shares outstanding weighted average fully diluted shares for the three months ended march   were  million impact of excise tax changes pennsylvania implemented a  per ounce excise tax on smokeless products effective october   the impact of the tax increase on trade volumes in the quarter was material to both the industry and tpb industry volume degradation on a sequential basis was in the midteens for chewing tobacco and highsingle digits for mst tpb outperformed the industry in both chewing tobacco and mst in pennsylvania as measured by msai tpb will continue to monitor the impact this excise tax has on consumer behavior california passed proposition  in november  which included new state excise taxes on liquid vapor products and cigar wraps for the first time effective april   all otp products became subject to the current  state excise tax on july   the tax on all otp products will increase to the new equalized rate that the industry estimates will be between  and  we believe that the new excise tax on myo cigar wraps adversely impacted category sales as california industry sales for the quarter were materially lower versus yearago california represents about  of industry myo cigar wraps cigars and mst sales and  of industry ecig volumes these segment percentages generally parallel tpb sales percentages we anticipate that california proposition  will affect trade behavior for the next six months and we will continue to closely evaluate its impact on consumer behavior earnings

accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap we use nonus gaap financial measures including ebitda adjusted ebitda net debt and gross profit excluding lifo we believe adjusted ebitda provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations adjusted ebitda net debt and gross profit excluding lifo are used by management to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes and is presented to our board of directors we believe that ebitda adjusted ebitda and gross profit excluding lifo are appropriate measures of operating performance because they eliminate the impact of expenses that do not relate to business performance we define “ebitda” as net income before interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization we define “adjusted ebitda” as net income before interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt provision for income taxes depreciation amortization other noncash items and other items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance we define “net debt” as total debt less cash we define “gross profit excluding lifo” as gross profit less lifo charges nonus gaap measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap adjusted ebitda excludes significant expenses that are required by us gaap to be recorded in our financial statements and is
