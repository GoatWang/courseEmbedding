roar for ceo michael e dubyak by dianne crampton  sep    awards team development tigers roar work environment   comments summary wright express chairman president and ceo michael e dubyak is selected as maine development foundation’s  champion of education training and leadership development   at tigers any time a leader is tapped for promoting education training and leadership development we think this is a big deal for one too many organizations cut back on training and development during the recession as a result many employees’s skills have stagnated  this makes companies that have cut back more risky as we emerge from the recession for another  unions use to provide excellent training programs for their members sadly we do not hear much about that anymore    so when we learned that a  leading global provider of valuebased business payment processing and information management solutions announced its chairman president and ceo michael e dubyak was selected by the maine development foundation as the  “champion of education training and leadership development” we wanted to learn more   the award honors an individual or organization that has gone above and beyond to spark maine’s economy and help all maine citizens reach their highest personal potential since one of our certified and licensed tigers facilitators tony lacertosa  works out of maine this is a double big deal “i am humbled by this award and recognition” said dubyak “i am passionate about trying to align higher education ― and now k ― with maine businesses and the growing need for stem science technology engineering and math graduates maine businesses and the state educational systems must work in partnership if we are to properly train and retain our high school students that come through our college and university systems” with over  employees in the greater portland area wright express takes an active leadership role in supporting organizations that promote economic educational and personal development opportunities dubyak is currently the chairman of educate maine a businessled organization whose mission is to champion college and career readiness and increased education attainment “we greatly appreciate all that mike does for maine” said ed cervone maine development foundation interim executive director “he has demonstrated the ability to collaborate and create successful partnerships across business and academic sectors his ideas and leadership are truly making a difference in maine” dubyak sits on the university of southern maine foundation’s board of
