end of your drive was missing i knew mr swyka must have not been feeling well it is the end of an era best wished to you and your family we are sorry for your loss they dont make them like that any more rusty  allana posted by rusty  allana chambers from agway  de   november   you will be missed you always welcomed me into your home and i was always greatful for this you were a great father n law to my sister traci and she loved you dearly posted by tennille mcginnis  clayton de   november   my giggi was an intelligent man the two things he would always ask me as soon as i said hello were hows work treatin you and how are you doing in school the most important thing to him was to get the best education possible his exact words that i will always live by are they can take away everything you have but they cant take away your education you learn as much as you can so you can do whatever you want in life he had only finished the th grade when he got pulled out of school to fight for our country and i know for a fact that if he could he would most definitely finish his high school education however he was such a gifted man for what knowledge he had he taught himself a lot such as how to create beautifully crafted wood pieces i still have the rocking chair he made me when i was a little girl this is why it was so heartwarming to see him smile the night of my graduation he was proud of what i had done for him even though he had done so much for me his family and our country it was literally the least i could dothe stories he would share with all of us made for such a great laugh every now and again my favorite will always be any story that involved his sly halfsmirk that he would crack throughout telling his tale we would only get a story when he was done his chores with the help of my dad and here recently his adopted grandson my boyfriend matthew he would always make sure his land home and his wife were all taken care of no matter how much pain he was recently in he worked as hard as he could up until a few days before the lord called him up i can only imagine him having a shot and a beer with god and all his war buddies having a grand celebration looking over all the people he has made an impact on which just so happened to be everyone that had the pleasure of meeting himas i said my goodbye to him i could hear him say yakshemash then i see him reaching his hand out for a firm handshake followed by a posted by samantha swyka  newark de  granddaughter   november   i grew up next door to the swyka family i saw first hand the

pennyhe always called me nickle even when i saw him several years ago in the old acme in middletown when i asked him if he knew who i washis answer with the great big smile of hisyes i doyour nickle i

on this day and bless you in his gracious way and may each sympathetic prayer help easy the sorrow that you bear may nicholas rest in peace and his memory be eternal vichnaya pamiat posted by rev volodymyr klanichka  de   november   when i think about dad i think about a man that enjoyed simple things in life like nice weather to do a hard days work in a hot bowl of moms chicken soup a ride on the golf cart with charlie watching heehaw and good conversation while having a shot and beer at the end of the day if there was something he needed a piece of furniture a lamp or a tool he would much rather make it than buy it he was an excellent carpenter mechanic electrician and plumber and strived for perfection in anything he had his hands in one of his many great accomplishments was the beautiful home he built for his family without using drawings or power tools dad was such a hard worker spending hours in the basement sharpening tools every evening after already putting in a hard days work to earn a little extra money he also received great satasfaction in passing on his knowledge talents and wisdom to his children and grand children he told so many interesting stories of his life before during and after the war yet im certain we didnt hear them all he endured some very rough times throughout his life times when there may have been no money shoes or very little food yet he still had fond memories of how he and his family found ways to get by rightfully so there was a distinct proudness in his voice as he told stories of surviving those hard times he was so arnry and loved practical jokes even if it was one that ended up backfiring on him one of my favorites was when he replaced the contents of a nearly empty bottle of scotch with some room temperature tea in preparation for our weekend shot and beer he laughed so hard when he saw the reaction on my face to a sip of unsweetened tea instead fine scotch i will never forget the laughter at that moment nor will i forget the phone call i got on wednesday evening of the following week when he proceeded to tell me that he dicided to have a shot and beer that day forgetting all about the bottle that he had spiked with tea i only wish i could have been there to with him to share in the laughter when he realized that he tricked himself he let you know when you made him proud and i can tell you from experience it is one of the most rewarding feelings in the world to have earned the respect of such a great man father and friend we love you so much dad posted by john swyka sr  newark de
