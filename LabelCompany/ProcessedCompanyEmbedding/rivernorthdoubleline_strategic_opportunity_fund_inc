through the change in the relationship between the closedend funds market price and net asset value nav rivernorth also believes combining a closedend fund strategy with a proven fixed income manager

the use of leverage may cause greater volatility in the level of a closedend funds nav market price and distributions on its common shares leverage will also result in higher fees to the closedend fund manager because the amount of assets under management will be included in the funds managed assets there can be no assurance that a closedend fund will use leverage or that its leveraging

comanagement with doublelines jeffrey gundlach securities mentioned in this video rndlx rivernorth doubleline strategic inc r related links bond cefs only in first inning of discountvolatility game archive  proposedand interestingcefs in the pipeline mike taggart hi im mike taggart head of us closedend fund research at morningstar with me today is patrick galley portfolio manager at rivernorth capital management patrick manages about  million in closedend funds patrick thanks for joining me today patrick galley thanks mike taggart patrick you recently have reopened one of your funds that you comanage with jeffrey gundlach the rivernorthdoubleline strategic income fund it seems to me to be one of the most opportunistic funds out there can you talk to me a little bit just about the general investment objective galley the investment objective is to beat the barclays aggregate predominantly on a riskadjusted return basis were all about riskadjusted returns at rivernorth so the most important objective to us is how much risk you take for incremental return taggart and how do you measure risk galley the volatility of the fund and the performance and if sometimes we do have incremental volatilitybut for that incremental volatility we expect more return taggart one of the criticisms of the barclays aggregate is that its heavily weighted with treasuries so isnt that kind of a little bit of a sandbagging of that index galley well you definitely want to have some type of benchmark that investors can measure you to and we think the barclays aggregate is one of the bestknown benchmarks out there so thats what we chose because it is a fixedincomefocused fund taggart my understanding of this fund is that its essentially two sleeves that are very opportunistic its your sleeve with opportunistic closedend fund investing and jeffreys sleeve with opportunistic fixedincome investing is that fair galley yes actually there are three sleeves so doubleline is managing two sleeves one is the core fixedincome strategy that is jeffreys tactical barclays aggregate strategy and just general diversification across fixedincome thats roughly  of the fund on a neutral basis the other sleeve that doubleline is managing is an opportunistic income strategy thats similar to jeffreys hedge fund strategy which is predominantly mortgagebacked securitiesnonagency and agency mortgagebacked securities then the third sleeve is managed by us at rivernorth and it is an opportunistic closedend fund strategy where were opportunistically investing in closedend funds when opportunities present themselves ie discounts are widening out so well take from the core fixedincome strategy as our dry powder and increase our closedend fund sleeve as opportunities present themselves taggart it seems like this would explain the reopening there are plenty of opportunities right now it would seem and listening to jeffreys calls there are of plenty of opportunities for his opportunistic sleeve can you talk to me a little bit about how you decide the allocation decision across those three sleeves galley it is very opportunistic and so given the opportunities in closedend fundsthe fear has increased in the closedfund space as we know because of interest ratesdiscounts have widened out quite drastically so just a short few months ago most closedend fundsfixedincome closedend fundstraded at a premium to their net asset value today most closedend funds are trading at a discount to their net asset value and in fact only  of the time have they ever been wider than they are today on the fixedincome side of the equation on closedend funds read full transcript taggart so is it safe to say that three four months ago there was less of an allocation in the fund toward closedend funds than there is today galley exactly so just about four months ago we were  closedend fund exposure today were over  closedend fund exposure probably an upper limit to closedend fund exposure in the fund will be around  because as most investors know extra volatility comes with closedend funds so we dont want to concentrate the portfolio all the way to closedend funds but  is more of an upper limit taggart gets back to the riskadjusted comments earlier galley exactly taggart so whats the investment process if you could just briefly go over it for the closedend fund sleeve and then if you could speak for jeffrey both of his sleeves galley on the closedend fund side we are focused on fixedincome closedend funds first and foremost so finding opportunities where we believe theres a catalyst for that discount to narrow because that is our excess return so creating number one a diversified portfolio across a lot of fixedincome closedend funds and then generating excess return by trading the discounts predominantly as we said before discounts are attractive today so increased closedend fund exposure as the discounts widen and as discounts narrow or mean revert take the chips off the table go back to jeffrey and his core fixedincome strategy and wait for opportunities again in the closedend fund space so were being reactive to volatility which is actually good for us so were excited about the future interestrate fear is actually a good thing for the strategy but with it comes sometimes some more volatility taggart and how does jeffrey go about selecting the securities say in his opportunistic sleeve galley in his opportunistic sleeve jeffrey has a riskbalanced approach between nonagency mortgagebacked securities and agency mortgagebacked securities so he can tactically manage the duration first and foremost which a lot of investors are concerned with today but having that barbell approach where nonagency mortgagebacked securities are predominately trading at a discount to their par value and agency mortgagebacked securities are trading at a premium it gives you a nice balance between a riskoff and riskon environment taggart this is a strategy thats about creating income for investors but also as you said youre trying to look at riskadjusted total return so in your mind ideally what type of investor should be interested in this fund galley first probably an investor that understands closedend funds and understands that they tend to be inefficient many times so you can generate excess return by trading off of the discount which is unique only to closedend funds i think that is a characteristic of our investors investors that tend to be contrarian meaning that we tend to buy when everybody else is selling and sell when everybody else is buying so an investor that can embrace that i think will appreciate the fund and the opportunistic nature that we take taggart this fund was launched at the very end of  so in  and  the fund outperformed the barclays aggregate and the morningstar multisector bond category average but in  its lagging both so far what would you ascribe that to galley number one its definitely the closedend fund component that has lagged obviously because of closedend funds are down in many cases  year to date so if you were to compare the fund to the overall closedend fund space weve definitely outperformed  weve lagged the barclays aggregate i believe by  basis points or so the last time i checked year to date so not drastically i would also say looking forward were really excited about the opportunity that we have in front of us there are going to be periods of time of underperformance but that underperformance usually sets us up for a pretty good opportunity as i said before we can increase the closedend fund exposure in that environment and hopefully returns will come in the back end taggart right because part of being a contrarian investor is that youre catching a falling knife eventuallyyou talk about mean reversionthe fund goes back up galley exactly and we dont necessarily feel like were catching a falling knife because the great thing about a closedend fund is you know what its worth and so its not like a stock where its only as good as your estimate of the intrinsic value so because you know what its worth and the discount is just widening out its more of just a sentiment play and betting against the irrationality of investors taggart excellent well thank you patrick for walking us through this fund and best wishes for the future thanks for joining me today
