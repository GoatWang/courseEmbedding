crossover ventures appoints new ceo giving its new generation of leadership a deep capital pool to invest from norwest venture partners is expected to announce the close of a new  billion fund the announcement of norwest venture partners xii lp comes on the heels of a record year for the firm in  when it saw the liquidation of  of its portfolio companies create roughly  billion in value it also caps a remarkable run of infrastructure building within the yearold firm since it raised the  billion norwest venture partners xi fund which closed in  the company made its th partner appointment announced the launch of its healthcare practice added  new professional services staff members and promoted  investment or portfolio services executives to partner or general partner chief among those new appointments was the elevation of jeff crowe and matthew howard to the positions of managing partner at the firm according to senior managing partner promod haque “that’s the succession and the grooming plan” haque says of the process he’s been engaged with for the last  months “we’re going to continue to empower them so that one day they can run the firm without me being there” palo alto califbased norwest venture partners has offices in india and israel in addition to its california locale and diversifies its investments by stage technology and geography from its single pool of capital the firm will invest in everything from early stage seed and series a deals later stage growth capital investments according to haque later stage investments may be an area where norwest venture partners would look to spend more time “there’s a very interesting opportunity in the growth equity market” he says “someone looking for a  million to  million round well that’s too small for the ta associates or summit partners if anything you’ve seen people like ourselves addressing that market” the new fund brings the firm’s total assets under management to  billion and its limited

adaptive insights apigee and bluejeans network and in healthcare carecloud health catalyst and others and whether there’s tech bubble or there isn’t a tech bubble matters very little to a firm like norwest “we’ve had such a long track record” says haque “we’ve never lost any money and we have consistent returns… our longevity has been much longer than any investment cycles we’ve seen these
