silver run ii does complete an acquisition depending on the nature of the management team in place at the target business mr hackett may only serve as silver run ii’s chairman going forward certain institutional investors and proxy advisory firms may vote against or recommend a vote against a chief executive officer who is serving as a director at his public company and as a director at more than two other public companies and in some cases more than just one other public company because of the unique circumstances applicable to a spac such as silver run ii which is relatively new and has
