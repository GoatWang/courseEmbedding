state of utah on october   under the name of electronic agricultural machinery development corporation  in  the company changed its name to zenith development corporation  in  the company changed its name to alternative energy resources inc  in  the company changed its name to trafalgar resources inc   initially the company sought to develop and market inventions including an asparagus harvester a hot water saving device and a gas alert signal  ultimately none of the inventions were successful and they were abandoned the company ceased to conduct any business and has not conducted any business during the last three years   currently the company is in the process of investigating potential business ventures which in the opinion of management will provide a source of eventual profit to the company  such involvement may take many forms including the acquisition of an existing business or the acquisition of assets to establish subsidiary businesses  all risks inherent in new and inexperienced enterprises are inherent in the company’s business   the company is not currently conducting any business nor has it conducted any business for several years therefore it does not possess products or services distribution methods competitive business positions or major customers  the company does not possess any unexpired patents or trademarks and any and all of its licensing and royalty agreements from the inventions it sought to market in the past have since expired and are not currently valid the company does not employ any employees        the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and risky additionally as the company has only limited resources it may be difficult to find good opportunities  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to the company and its stockholders the company will select any potential business opportunity based on managements business judgment   the activities of the company are subject to several significant risks which arise primarily as a result of the fact that the company has no specific business and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management which potentially could act without the consent vote or approval of the companys stockholders  the risks faced by the company are further increased as a result of its lack of resources and its inability to provide a prospective business opportunity with significant capital   item  property   the company owns no properties and utilizes space on a rentfree basis in the office of its principal stockholder anthony brandon escobar  this arrangement is expected to continue until such time as the company becomes involved in a business venture which necessitates its relocation as to which no assurances can be given  the company has no agreements with respect to the maintenance or future acquisition of the office facilities however if a successful mergeracquisition is negotiated it is anticipated that the office of the company will be moved to that of the acquired company     the company is not actively engaged in conducting any business  rather the company is in the process of investigating potential business ventures which in the opinion of management will provide a source of eventual profit to the company  therefore the company does not presently intend to invest in real estate or real estate securities nor has it formulated any investment policies regarding investments in real estate real estate mortgages or securities of or interests in persons engaged in real estate activities        item  legal proceedings   none   item  removed and reserved   part ii

the symbol “tflg”  set forth below are the high and low bid prices for the companys common stock for the respective quarters  although the companys common stock is quoted on the bulletin board it has

information obtained from the company’s transfer agent   dividends – since its inception the company has not paid any dividends on its common stock and the company does not anticipate that it will pay dividends in the foreseeable future        item   selected financial data   summary of financial information   we had no revenues in  or   we had a net loss of  for the year ended september    at

forwardlooking statements   this annual report contains certain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  with respect to the plan of operations provided below including information regarding the company’s financial condition results of operations business strategies operating efficiencies or synergies competitive positions growth opportunities plans and objectives of management the statements made as part of the plan of operations that are not historical facts are hereby identified as “forwardlooking statements”   plan of operation   the company is in the process of investigating potential business ventures which in the opinion of management will provide a source of eventual profit to the company  such involvement may take many forms including the acquisition of an existing business or the acquisition of assets to establish subsidiary businesses  the company’s management does not expect to remain involved as management of any acquired business   as the company possesses limited funds the company will be extremely limited in its attempts to locate potential      business situations for investigation  the company intends to commence on a limited basis the process of investigating possible merger and acquisition candidates and believes that the company’s status as a publiclyheld corporation will enhance its ability to locate such potential business ventures  no assurance can be given as to when the company may locate suitable business opportunities and such opportunities may be difficult to locate however the company intends to actively search for potential business ventures for the foreseeable future     management anticipates that due to its lack of funds and the limited amount of its resources the company may be restricted to participation in only one potential business venture  this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk because it will not permit the company to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another   business opportunities if any arise are expected to become available to the company principally from the personal contacts of its officers and directors  while it is not expected that the company will engage professional firms specializing in business acquisitions or reorganizations such firms may be retained if funds become available in the future and if deemed advisable  opportunities may thus become available from professional advisors securities brokerdealers venture capitalists members of the financial community and other sources of unsolicited proposals in certain circumstances the company may agree to pay a finder’s fee or other form of compensation including perhaps onetime cash payments payments based upon a percentage of revenues or sales volume andor payments involving the issuance of securities for services provided by persons who submit a business opportunity in which the company shall decide to participate although no contracts or arrangements of this nature presently exist  the company is unable to predict at this time the cost of locating a suitable business opportunity   the analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the company’s management none of whom is a professional analyst and none of whom have significant general business experience  among the factors which management will consider in analyzing potential business opportunities are the available technical financial and managerial resources working capital and financial requirements the history of operation if any future prospects the nature of present and anticipated competition potential for further research developments or exploration growth and expansion potential the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products or services name identification and other relevant factors     it is not possible at present to predict the exact manner in which the company may participate in a business opportunity  specific business opportunities will be reviewed and based upon such review the appropriate legal structure or method of participation will be decided upon by management  such structures and methods may include without limitation leases purchase and sale agreements licenses joint ventures and may involve merger consolidation or reorganization  the company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership corporation or reorganization  however it is most likely that any acquisition of a business venture the company would make would be by conducting a reorganization involving the issuance of the company’s restricted securities such a reorganization may involve a merger or combination pursuant to state corporate statutes where one of the entities dissolves or is absorbed by the other or it may occur as a consolidation where a new entity is formed and the company and such other entity combine assets in the new entity  a reorganization may also occur directly or indirectly through subsidiaries and there is no assurance that the company would be the surviving entity  any such reorganization could result in loss of control of a majority of the shares  the company’s present directors may be required to resign in connection with a reorganization     the company may choose to enter into a venture involving the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but desires to establish a public trading market of its securities  such a company may desire to consolidate its operations with the company through a merger reorganization asset acquisition or other combination in order to avoid possible adverse consequences of undertaking its own public offering  such consequences might include expense time delays or loss of voting control  in the event of such a merger the company may be required to issue significant additional shares and it may be anticipated that control over the company’s affairs may be transferred to others   as part of their investigation of acquisition possibilities the company’s management may meet with executive officers of the business and its personnel inspect its facilities obtain independent analysis or verification of the      information provided and conduct other reasonable measures to the extent permitted by the company’s limited resources and management’s limited expertise  generally the company intends to analyze and make a determination based upon all available information without reliance upon any single factor as controlling     in all likelihood the company’s management will be inexperienced in the areas in which potential businesses will be investigated and in which the company may make an acquisition or investment  thus it may become necessary for the company to retain consultants or outside professional firms to assist management in evaluating potential investments  the company can give no assurance that it will be able to find suitable consultants or managers  the company has no policy regarding the use of consultants however if management in its discretion determines that it is in the best interests of the company management may seek consultants to review potential merger or acquisitions candidates  there are currently no contracts or agreements between any consultant and any companies that are searching for “shell” companies with which to merge   it may be anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants attorneys and others  should a decision thereafter be made not to participate in a specific business opportunity it is likely that costs already expended would not be recoverable  it is likely in the event a transaction should eventually fail to be consummated for any reason that the costs incurred by the company would not be recoverable  the company’s officers and directors are entitled to reimbursement for all expenses incurred in their investigation of possible business ventures on behalf of the company and no assurance can be given that if the company has available funds they will not be depleted in such expenses     based on current economic and regulatory conditions management believes that it is possible if not probable for a company like the company without assets or many liabilities to negotiate a merger or acquisition with a viable private company  the opportunity arises principally because of the high legal and accounting fees and the length of time associated with the registration process of “going public”  however should any of these conditions change it is very possible that there would be little or no economic value for anyone taking over control of the company   liquidity and capital resources   as of september   the company had  in cash and liabilities of   as of september   the company had a negative working capital of  the company had a negative working capital of  as of september    the company has only incidental ongoing expenses primarily associated with maintaining its corporate status and maintaining the company’s reporting obligations to the securities and exchange commission current management has indicated a willingness to help support the company’s ongoing expenses through the purchase of securities of the company   for the twelve months ended september   the company had  in expenses related to maintaining its corporate status paying accounting and legal fees  expenses were slightly lower than in previous years as the company had only limited operations related to completed audits and accounting work and filed documents with the securities and exchange commission  management anticipates only nominal continuing expenses related to investigating business opportunities and legal and accounting cost for the year ended september   the company had a net loss of  compared to a loss of  for the year ended september     since inception the company has not generated significant revenue and it is unlikely that any revenue will be generated until the company locates a business opportunity with which to acquire or merge  management of the company will be investigating various business opportunities  these efforts may cost the company not only out of pocket expenses for its management but also expenses associated with legal and accounting costs  there can be no guarantee that the company will receive any benefits from the efforts of management to locate business opportunities   management does not anticipate employing any employees in the future until a merger or acquisition can be accomplished  management will continue to rely on outside consultants to assist in its corporate filing requirements          results of operations   the company has not had any revenue since inception  the company continues to suffer a small loss related to maintaining its corporate status and reporting obligations   offbalance sheet arrangements   the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements and it is not anticipated that the company will enter into any offbalance sheet arrangements   item  financial statements and supplementary data   the company’s financial statements are presented immediately following the signature page to this form k   item  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure   the company has had no disagreements with its principal independent accountants with respect to accounting practices or procedures or financial disclosure   item at controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   our management which consists of one person and with the assistance of an outside cpa firm evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation our president and cfo concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our management including our president and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance however that the objectives of the controls system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within a company have been detected  however management believes the controls and procedures provide a reasonable basis for the conclusions  this evaluation was made in light of the fact the company has no operations or revenue and limited cash on hand     management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule af under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states     because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives     our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september   in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control  integrated framework   further our management considered the lack of operations and revenue the limited cash on hand and the limited transactions which occur on a monthly basis  based on this evaluation our management concluded that as of september   our internal control over financial reporting was effective  however management recognized the weaknesses of inadequate      segregation of duties consistent with control objectives due to our small size and limited resources but believes our controls are reasonably effective   this annual report does not include an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting  management’s report was not subject to attestation by the company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the security and exchange commission that permit the company to provide only management’s report in this annual report   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting   item b other information   none   part iii   item  directors executive officers and corporate governance   the following table sets forth as of december
