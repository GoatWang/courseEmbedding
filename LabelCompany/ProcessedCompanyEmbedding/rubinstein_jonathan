a design consultant to an area computer company careeredit early careeredit after graduate school rubinstein took a job with hewlettpackard in colorado he spent about two years in the company’s manufacturing engineering division developing qualitycontrol techniques and refining manufacturing processes later rubinstein worked on hp workstations rubinstein left hp in  to join a startup ardent

built highend systems using the powerpc chip motorola bought the business in  apple yearsedit after apples purchase of next rubinstein had planned on an extended vacation to travel but jobs now an unpaid consultant for apple invited rubinstein to work with him for apple at the time apple was losing industry support the companys reputation as an innovator was waning as were profits rubinsteins arrival in february  came on the heels of a year in which apple lost us million rubinstein joined apple anyway because as he told the new york times apple was the last innovative highvolume computer maker in the world rubinstein joined apple as senior vice president of hardware engineering and a member of its executive staff he was responsible for hardware development industrial design and lowlevel software development and contributed heavily to apples technology roadmap and product strategy rubinstein took on an immense workload upon his arrival the company sold over  product lines nearly all of which were derided as inferior to other computers available at the time internally apple also suffered from extreme mismanagement of its hardware teams multiple teams often worked on the same product independently of each other and very little attention was directed towards making all of the product lines fully compatible with each other with jobs rubinstein helped towards fixing both of these problems he also helped initiate an extensive costcutting plan affecting research projects and engineers expenses were eventually cut in half after critically examining all projects currently in the pipeline the g a fast powerpcbased desktop machine was chosen to be apples next released product upon its release at the end of  apple finally had what it hadnt had in years a cuttingedge desktop machine that could compete with its intelbased competitors in  jobs cancelled almost all of the product lines and introduced a new product strategy focusing only on desktop and laptop computers for both consumer and professional customer with the power macintosh g filling the role of a desktop computer marketed at professional customers apple began to focus on an entrylevel desktop computer suitable for consumers the result was the imac released in  a computer with an innovative design intended to be friendly and easily accessible for average computer users for the imacs development rubinstein assembled a team and with a deadline of only  months a timeline they considered impossible the imac was an immediate success not only helping to revitalise apple as a company but also popularising new technologies at the time such as usb which would then go on to become an industry standard the imac also shipped without a floppy disk drive rare for computers of the era relying solely on the optical drive and new technologies such as usb and firewire for data transfer rubinstein was responsible for both of these decisions future rollouts under rubinsteins management included all subsequent upgrades the g and g of the power mac series while they were technically powerful computers the power mac series suffered from the perception that they were slower than their intelbased counterparts because their powerpc cpus listed slower clock speeds rubinstein and apple popularised a term known as the megahertz myth to describe how the powerpc architecture could not be compared to the intel architecture simply on their clock speeds the powerpc cpus despite their lower clock speeds were generally comparable to intel cpus of the era developing the ipodedit due to the relatively low sales of its mac computer brand apple decided to expand its ecosystem in order to increase its consumer awareness the ipod came from apples digital hub category when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices digital cameras camcorders and organizers had wellestablished mainstream markets but the company found existing digital music players big and clunky or small and useless with user interfaces that were unbelievably awful so apple decided to develop its own even though it was a space with immense market potential previous products had not enjoyed any notable market penetration by  steve jobs expressed interest in developing a portable music player but rubinstein demurred saying the necessary components were not yet available while on a routine supplier visit to toshiba corp in february  however rubinstein first saw the tiny inch hard disk drive that became a critical component of the ipod while toshiba engineers had developed the drive they were not sure how it could be used at a tokyo hotel later that evening rubinstein met with jobs who was in japan on separate business “i know how to do it now all i need is a  million check” he told jobs jobs agreed and rubinstein assembled and managed a team of hardware and software engineers to ready the product on a rushed eightmonth schedule the team’s engineers needed to overcome a number of hurdles including figuring out how to play music off a spinning hard drive for more than  hours without wiping out a battery charge rubinstein’s production contacts proved invaluable too the ipod’s sleek minimalist design with its highgloss engraveable metal back was a massmanufacturing triumph the success of the firstgeneration ipod was almost overnight by  the business became so important to apple that the ipod was spun off into its own division which rubinstein took over other ipod models were released on a regular basis increasing the device’s capacity decreasing its size and adding features including color screens photo display and video playback by early  more than  million ipods had been sold making it not only the most successful portable media player on the market but one of the most popular consumer electronics products of all time rubinstein  sometimes called the podfather because of his role in developing the ipod  was also instrumental in creating a robust secondary market for accessories such as speakers chargers docking ports backup batteries and other addons that gear produced by a network of independent companies that came to be known as the ipod ecosystem by  generated more than  billion in annual sales in the  fiscal year the ipod generated  billion in revenue or about a third of apples sales in october  apple announced that rubinstein would be retiring on march   it was later announced that he would make himself available for up to  of his workweek on a consulting basis it is said that with the approaching release of hand held devices steve jobs started paying lesser attention to rubinstein and more attention to young engineers he was given a promotion which actually reduced his power at apple jobss focus shifted to newer engineers which ultimately resulted in rubinsteins departure palmedit in  rubinstein joined palm as executive chairman of its board of directors at about the same time he stepped down as chairman of immersion corp a developer of haptic technology rubinstein took control of palm’s product development and led its research development and engineering efforts one of his first tasks included winnowing the companys product lines and restructuring rd teams he was instrumental in developing the webos platform and the palm pre rubinstein debuted both on january   at the consumer electronics show ces in las vegas on june   just four days after the successful release of his brainchild the palm pre rubinstein was named the ceo of palm the pre first launched on the sprint network reports at the time of the launch noted that it was a record for sprint with  units sold its opening weekend a followup phone the palm pixi was announced on september   and released on sprint on november   rubinstein had said that one of palm’s keys moving forward would be to “bring on more carriers and more regions” and the company launched its palm pre plus and pixi plus phones on verizon wireless in january  in the same month att announced plans to launch a pair of palm’s webos devices later in  but the addition of verizon wireless did not help as much as expected by february  palm warned that its products were not selling as quickly as hoped rubinstein’s visibility in the mainstream tech community grew upon joining palm he was the featured guest in september  at the first episode of “the engadget show” a web videocast produced by the technology weblog in december  the magazine fast company named rubinstein one of its geeks of the year along with people such as facebook founder mark zuckerberg and writerdirectorproducer jj abrams fast company also named rubinstein to its list of the “ most creative people in business hewlettpackard to presentedit rubinstein rejoined hp in  when the latter bought palm for  billion the deal gave hp another chance to enter the mobiledevice market while sending a lifeline to palm which some analysts expected to run out of cash within two years rubinstein agreed to remain with the company for  to  months after the merger at the time hp said it would utilize webos across a spectrum of products including phones printers and other devices hp’s strategy was to keep consumers connected to all of their information through the cloud regardless of which device they were on on july   hp released the webosbased touchpad shortly after rubinstein stepped down from the webos unit and assumed a product innovation role elsewhere within hp while rubinstein had pledged to be patient in building demand for the device hp abandoned it quickly in the face of soft sales the touchpad was on the market for only seven weeks when thenceo leo apotheker announced in august that the company would discontinue all hardware devices running webos hp subsequently slashed the price of the least expensive touchpad to  setting off a buying frenzy and leading technologyresearch firm canalys to call it the “musthave technology product of  apotheker himself was gone less than a month later when the hp board replaced him with former ebay ceo meg whitman she announced plans to make webos open source in december  on january   jon rubinstein left hp after his  months contract ended in an interview he said he would not retire but take a break  and while he had no plans at the time he added the future is mobile  in may  rubinstein joined the board of qualcomm a leading provider of chips used in mobile devices he also currently sits on the board of amazoncom to which he was elected in december  rubinsteins appointment as coceo at bridgewater associates the worlds largest hedge fund was announced in a letter to clients in march  in the note bridgewater officials noted that “because technology is so important to us we wanted one of our coceos to be very strong in that area” rubinstein replaced greg jensen who moved to concentrate on his role as cochief investment officer less than one year later it was announced that rubinstein was leaving the company because he and bridgewater founder ray dalio mutually agree that he is not a cultural fit for bridgewater affiliationsedit member national academy of

early careeredit after graduate school rubinstein took a job with hewlettpackard in colorado he spent about two years in the company’s manufacturing engineering division developing qualitycontrol

business in  apple yearsedit after apples purchase of next rubinstein had planned on an extended vacation to travel but jobs now an unpaid consultant for apple invited rubinstein to work with him for apple at the time apple was losing industry support the companys reputation as an innovator was waning as were profits rubinsteins arrival in february  came on the heels of a year in which apple lost us million rubinstein joined apple anyway because as he told the new york times apple was the last innovative highvolume computer maker in the world rubinstein joined apple as senior vice president of hardware engineering and a member of its executive staff he was responsible for hardware development industrial design and lowlevel software development and contributed heavily to apples technology roadmap and product strategy rubinstein took on an immense workload upon his arrival the company sold over  product lines nearly all of which were derided as inferior to other computers available at the time internally apple also suffered from extreme mismanagement of its hardware teams multiple teams often worked on the same product independently of each other and very little attention was directed towards making all of the product lines fully compatible with each other with jobs rubinstein helped towards fixing both of these problems he also helped initiate an extensive costcutting plan affecting research projects and engineers expenses were eventually cut in half after critically examining all projects currently in the pipeline the g a fast powerpcbased desktop machine was chosen to be apples next released product upon its release at the end of  apple finally had what it hadnt had in years a cuttingedge desktop machine that could compete with its intelbased competitors in  jobs cancelled almost all of the product lines and introduced a new product strategy focusing only on desktop and laptop computers for both consumer and professional customer with the power macintosh g filling the role of a desktop computer marketed at professional customers apple began to focus on an entrylevel desktop computer suitable for consumers the result was the imac released in  a computer with an innovative design intended to be friendly and easily accessible for average computer users for the imacs development rubinstein assembled a team and with a deadline of only  months a timeline they considered impossible the imac was an immediate success not only helping to revitalise apple as a company but also popularising new technologies at the time such as usb which would then go on to become an industry standard the imac also shipped without a floppy disk drive rare for computers of the era relying solely on the optical drive and new technologies such as usb and firewire for data transfer rubinstein was responsible for both of these decisions future rollouts under rubinsteins management included all subsequent upgrades the g and g of the power mac series while they were technically powerful computers the power mac series suffered from the perception that they were slower than their intelbased counterparts because their powerpc cpus listed slower clock speeds rubinstein and apple popularised a term known as the megahertz myth to describe how the powerpc architecture could not be compared to the intel architecture simply on their clock speeds the powerpc cpus despite their lower clock speeds were generally comparable to intel cpus of the era developing the ipodedit due to the relatively low sales of its mac computer brand apple decided to expand its ecosystem in order to increase its consumer awareness the ipod came from apples digital hub category when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices digital cameras camcorders and organizers had wellestablished mainstream markets but the company found existing digital music players big and clunky or small and useless with user interfaces that were unbelievably awful so apple decided to develop its own even though it was a space with immense market potential previous products had not enjoyed any notable market penetration by  steve jobs expressed interest in developing a portable music player but rubinstein demurred saying the necessary components were not yet available while on a routine supplier visit to toshiba corp in february  however rubinstein first saw the tiny inch hard disk drive that became a critical component of the ipod while toshiba engineers had developed the drive they were not sure how it could be used at a tokyo hotel later that evening rubinstein met with jobs who was in japan on separate business “i know how to do it now all i need is a  million check” he told jobs jobs agreed and rubinstein assembled and managed a team of hardware and software engineers to ready the product on a rushed eightmonth schedule the team’s engineers needed to overcome a number of hurdles including figuring out how to play music off a spinning hard drive for more than  hours without wiping out a battery charge rubinstein’s production contacts proved invaluable too the ipod’s sleek minimalist design with its highgloss engraveable metal back was a massmanufacturing triumph the success of the firstgeneration ipod was almost overnight by  the business became so important to apple that the ipod was spun off into its own division which rubinstein took over other ipod models were released on a regular basis increasing the device’s capacity decreasing its size and adding features including color screens photo display and video playback by early  more than  million ipods had been sold making it not only the most successful portable media player on the market but one of the most popular consumer electronics products of all time rubinstein  sometimes called the podfather because of his role in developing the ipod  was also instrumental in creating a robust secondary market for accessories such as speakers chargers docking ports backup batteries and other addons that gear produced by a network of independent companies that came to be known as the ipod ecosystem by  generated more than  billion in annual sales in the  fiscal year the ipod generated  billion in revenue or about a third of apples sales in october  apple announced that rubinstein would be retiring on march   it was later announced that he would make himself available for up to  of his workweek on a consulting basis it is said that with the approaching release of hand held devices steve jobs started paying lesser attention to rubinstein and more attention to young engineers he was given a promotion which actually reduced his power at apple jobss focus shifted to newer engineers which ultimately resulted in rubinsteins departure palmedit in  rubinstein joined palm as executive chairman of its board of directors at about the same time he stepped down as chairman of immersion corp a developer of haptic

macintosh g filling the role of a desktop computer marketed at professional customers apple began to focus on an entrylevel desktop computer suitable for consumers the result was the imac released in  a computer with an innovative design intended to be friendly and easily accessible for average computer users for the imacs development rubinstein assembled a team and with a deadline of only  months a timeline they considered impossible the imac was an immediate success not only helping to revitalise apple as a company but also popularising new technologies at the time such as usb which would then go on to become an industry standard the imac also shipped without a floppy disk drive rare for computers of the era relying solely on the optical drive and new technologies such as usb and firewire for data transfer rubinstein was responsible for both of these decisions future rollouts under rubinsteins management included all subsequent upgrades the g and g of the power mac series while they were technically powerful computers the power mac series suffered from the perception that they were slower than their intelbased counterparts because their powerpc cpus listed slower clock speeds rubinstein and apple popularised a term known as the megahertz myth to describe how the powerpc architecture could not be compared to the intel architecture simply on their clock speeds the powerpc cpus despite their lower clock speeds were generally comparable to intel cpus of the era developing the ipodedit due to the relatively low sales of its mac computer brand apple decided to expand its ecosystem in order to increase its consumer awareness the ipod came from apples digital hub category when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices digital cameras camcorders and organizers had wellestablished mainstream markets but the company found existing digital music players big and clunky or small and useless with user interfaces that were unbelievably awful so apple decided to develop its own even though it was a space with immense market potential previous products had not enjoyed any notable market penetration by  steve jobs expressed interest in developing a portable music player but rubinstein demurred saying the necessary components were not yet available while on a routine supplier visit to toshiba corp in february  however rubinstein first saw the tiny inch hard disk drive that became a critical component of the ipod while toshiba engineers had developed the drive they were not sure how it could be used at a tokyo hotel later that evening rubinstein met with jobs who was in japan on separate business “i know how to do it now all i need is a  million check” he told jobs jobs agreed and rubinstein assembled and managed a team of hardware and software engineers to ready the product on a rushed eightmonth schedule the team’s engineers needed to overcome a number of hurdles including figuring out how to play music off a spinning hard drive for more than  hours without wiping out a battery charge rubinstein’s production contacts proved invaluable too the ipod’s sleek minimalist design with its highgloss engraveable metal back was a massmanufacturing triumph the success of the firstgeneration ipod was almost overnight by  the business became so important to apple that the ipod was spun off into its own division which rubinstein took over other ipod models were released on a regular basis increasing the device’s capacity decreasing its size and adding features including color screens photo display and video playback by early  more than  million ipods had been sold making it not only the most successful portable media player on the market but one of the most popular consumer electronics products of all time rubinstein  sometimes called the podfather because of his role in developing the ipod  was also instrumental in creating a robust secondary market for accessories such as speakers chargers docking ports backup batteries and other addons that gear produced by a network of independent companies that came to be known as the ipod ecosystem by  generated more than  billion in annual sales in the  fiscal year the ipod generated  billion in revenue or about a third of apples sales in october  apple announced that rubinstein would be retiring on march   it was later announced that he would make himself available for up to  of his workweek on a consulting basis it is said that with the approaching release of hand held devices steve jobs started paying lesser attention to rubinstein and more attention to young engineers he was given a promotion which actually reduced his power at apple jobss focus shifted to newer engineers which ultimately resulted in rubinsteins departure palmedit in  rubinstein joined palm as executive chairman of its board of directors at about the same time he stepped down as chairman of immersion corp a developer of haptic technology rubinstein took control of palm’s product development and led its research development and engineering efforts one of his first tasks included winnowing the companys product lines and restructuring rd teams he was instrumental in developing the webos platform and the palm pre rubinstein debuted both on january   at the consumer electronics show ces in las vegas on june   just four days after the successful release of his brainchild the palm pre rubinstein was named the ceo of palm the pre first launched on the sprint network reports at the time of the launch noted that it was a record for sprint with  units sold its opening weekend a followup phone the palm pixi was announced on september   and released on sprint on november   rubinstein had said that one of palm’s keys moving forward would be to “bring on more carriers and more regions” and the company launched its palm pre plus and pixi plus phones on verizon wireless in january  in the same month att announced plans to launch a pair of palm’s webos devices later in  but the addition of verizon wireless did not help as much as expected by february  palm warned that its products were not selling as quickly as hoped rubinstein’s visibility in the mainstream tech community grew upon joining palm he was the featured guest in september  at the first episode of “the engadget show” a web videocast produced by the technology weblog in december  the magazine fast company named rubinstein one of its geeks of the year along with people such as facebook founder mark zuckerberg and writerdirectorproducer jj abrams fast company also named rubinstein to its list of the “ most creative people in business hewlettpackard to presentedit rubinstein rejoined hp in  when the latter bought palm for  billion the deal gave hp another chance to enter the mobiledevice market while sending a lifeline to palm which some analysts expected to run out of cash within two years rubinstein agreed to remain with the company for  to  months after the merger at the time hp said it would utilize webos across a spectrum of products including phones printers and other devices hp’s strategy was to keep consumers connected to all of their information through the cloud regardless of which device they were on on july   hp released the webosbased touchpad shortly after rubinstein stepped down from the webos unit and assumed a product innovation role elsewhere within hp while rubinstein had pledged to be patient in building demand for the device hp abandoned it quickly in the face of soft sales the touchpad was on the market for only seven weeks when thenceo leo apotheker announced in august that the company would discontinue all hardware devices running webos hp subsequently slashed the price of the least expensive touchpad to  setting off a buying frenzy and leading technologyresearch firm canalys to call it the “musthave technology product of  apotheker himself was gone less than a month later when the hp board replaced him with former ebay ceo meg whitman she announced plans to make webos open source in december  on january   jon rubinstein left hp after his  months contract ended in an interview he said he would not retire but take a break  and while he had no plans at the time he added the future is mobile  in may  rubinstein joined the board of qualcomm a leading provider of chips used in mobile devices he also currently sits on the board of amazoncom to which he was elected in december  rubinsteins appointment as coceo at bridgewater associates the worlds largest hedge fund was announced in a letter to clients in march  in the note bridgewater officials noted that “because technology is so important to us we wanted one of our coceos to be very strong in that area” rubinstein replaced greg jensen who moved to concentrate on his role as cochief investment officer less than one year later it was announced that rubinstein was leaving the company because he and
