information supplementary information the following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained for a fee at the commissions public reference branch  fifth street nw washington dc  tel   applicants representations  the companies are organized as massachusetts business trusts maryland corporations or in the case of centennial america fund lp a limited partnership under the laws of the state of delaware and are registered under the act as openend management investment companies the business and affairs of each company are managed under the directions of the board of trustees or directors or in the case of centennial america fund lp the managing general partners of the relevant company “board”  each of ofi and camc a wholly owned subsidiary of ofi is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  each oppenheimer fund has entered into an investment advisory agreement with ofi and each centennial fund has entered into an investment advisory agreement with camc ofi also provides the funds with certain administrative services  each fund may deposit uninvested daily cash balances into a joint account administered by ofi “joint account” each fund may lend money to banks or other entities by entering into repurchase agreements either directly or through the joint account other funds may need to borrow money from the same or similar banks for temporary purposes to satisfy redemption requests to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls such as a trade “fail” in which cash start printed page payment for a security sold by a fund has been delayed or for other temporary purposes currently the funds have credit arrangements with their custodians ie overdraft protection under which the custodians may but are not obligated to lend money to the funds to meet the funds temporary cash needs many of the funds also have entered into loan agreements with banks to provide a line of credit for temporary funding  if the funds were to borrow money from their custodians under their current arrangements or under other credit facility arrangements with a bank the funds would pay interest on the borrowed cash at a rate which would be higher than the rate that would be earned by other nonborrowing funds on investments in repurchase agreements and other shortterm instruments of the same maturity as the bank loan applicants believe this differential represents the banks profit other bank loan arrangements such as committed lines of credit would require the funds to pay commitment fees attorney fees and related costs in addition to the interest rate to be paid by the borrowing fund  applicants request an order that would permit the funds to enter into master interfund lending agreements “interfund lending agreements” under which the funds would lend money and borrow money for temporary purposes directly to and from each other an “interfund loan” applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would substantially reduce the funds potential borrowing costs and enhance their ability to earn higher rates of interest on shortterm lendings although the proposed credit facility would substantially reduce the funds need to borrow from banks the funds would be free to continue committed lines of credit or other borrowing arrangements with banks the funds also would continue to maintain overdraft protection currently provided by their custodians  applicants anticipate that the credit facility would provide a borrowing fund with significant savings when the cash position of the fund is insufficient to meet temporary cash requirements this situation could arise when redemptions exceed anticipated volumes and the funds have insufficient cash on hand to satisfy such redemptions when a fund liquidates portfolio securities to meet redemption requests which normally are effected immediately it often does not receive payment in settlement for up to three days or longer for certain foreign transactions the credit facility would provide a source of immediate shortterm liquidity pending settlement of the sale of portfolio securities  applicants also propose using the credit facility when a sale of securities fails due to circumstances beyond the sellers control such as a delay in the delivery of cash to the funds custodian or improper delivery instructions by the broker effecting the transaction sales fails may present a cash shortfall if the fund has undertaken to purchase a security with the proceeds from securities sold when the fund experiences a cash shortfall due to a sales fail the custodian typically extends temporary credit to cover the shortfall and the fund incurs overdraft charges alternatively the fund could fail on its intended purchase due to lack of funds from the previous sale resulting in additional cost to the fund or sell a security on a same day settlement basis earning a lower return on the investment use of the credit facility under these circumstances would enable the fund to have access to immediate shortterm liquidity without incurring custodian overdraft or other charges  while bank borrowings could generally supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails under the proposed credit facility a borrowing fund would pay lower interest rates than those offered by banks on shortterm loans in addition funds making shortterm cash loans directly to other funds would earn interest at a rate higher than they otherwise could obtain from investing their cash in repurchase agreements thus applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would benefit both borrowing and lending funds  the interest rate charged to the funds on any loan under the credit facility the “interfund loan rate” would be the average of the joint account repo rate and the bank loan rate both as defined below the joint account repo rate would be the current overnight repurchase agreement rate available through the joint account the bank loan rate would be calculated by ofi each day that a fund borrows or lends according to a formula established by each funds board to approximate the lowest interest rate at which bank loans would be available to the funds the formula would be based upon a publicly available rate eg federal funds plus  basis points and would vary with this rate so as to reflect changing bank loan rates each funds board periodically would review the continuing appropriateness of using the formula to determine the bank loan rate as well as the relationship between the bank loan rate and current bank loan rates that would be available to the funds the initial formula and any subsequent modifications to the formula would be subject to the approval of each funds board  the credit facility would be administered by ofis fund accounting department collectively the “cash management team” under the proposed credit facility the portfolio managers for each participating fund could provide standing instructions to participate daily as a borrower or lender ofi on each business day would collect data on the uninvested cash and borrowing requirements of all participating funds from the funds custodian once it had determined the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand the cash management team would allocate loans among borrowing funds without any further communication from portfolio managers there typically will be far more available uninvested cash each day than borrowing demand therefore after allocating cash for interfund loans ofi will invest any remaining cash in accordance with the standing instructions from portfolio managers or return remaining amounts for investment directly by the relevant funds the money market funds typically would not participate as borrowers because they rarely need to borrow cash to meet redemptions  the cash management team would allocate borrowing demand and cash available for lending among the funds on what the cash management team believed to be an equitable basis subject to certain administrative procedures applicable to all funds such as the time of filing requests to participate minimum loan lot sizes and the need to minimize the number of transactions and associated administrative costs to reduce transaction costs each loan normally would be allocated in a manner intended to minimize the number of participants necessary to complete the loan transaction the method of allocation and related administrative procedures would be approved by each funds board including a majority of trusteesdirectors who are not “interested persons” of the fund as defined in section a of the act “independent trusteesdirectors” to ensure that both borrowing and lending funds participate on an equitable basis  ofi would a monitor the interest rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the loans b limit the borrowings and loans entered into by each fund to ensure that they comply with the funds investment policies and start printed page limitations c ensure equitable treatment of each fund and d make quarterly reports to the board concerning any transactions by the funds under the credit facility and the interest rates charged  ofi will administer the program under its or camcs existing investment advisory agreement with each fund and ofi would receive no additional compensation from its administration of the proposed credit facility ofi or companies affiliated with it may collect standard pricing record keeping accounting and bookkeeping fees applicable to repurchase and lending transactions generally including transactions effected through the credit facility fees would be no higher than those applicable for comparable loan transactions  each funds participation in the proposed credit facility is either currently consistent with its organizational documents and its investment policies and limitations or such documents policies and limitations will be amended or modified to be made consistent with the funds participation the prospectus of each fund discloses the extent to which the fund may borrow money for temporary purposes and lend securities and other assets and the extent to which the fund is able to mortgage or pledge securities to secure permitted borrowings if the requested relief is granted the statement of additional information “sai” of each fund participating in the interfund lending arrangements will disclose the existence of such arrangements each fund that desires to engage in interfund lending arrangements and that has existing fundamental policies that would restrict participation in such arrangements will obtain shareholder approval to amend such policies to the extent necessary to permit it to participate in such arrangements on the conditions set forth in the application  in connection with the credit facility applicants request an order under a section c of the act granting relief from sections f and b of the act b section dj of the act granting relief from section d of the act c sections c and b of the act granting relief from sections a and a of the act and d section d of the act and rule d under the act to permit certain joint arrangements applicants legal analysis  section a generally prohibits any affiliated person or affiliated person of an affiliated person from borrowing money or other property from a registered investment company section b generally prohibits any registered management investment company from lending money or other property to any person if that person controls or is under common control with the company section ac of the act defines “affiliated person” of another person in part to be any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person applicants state that the funds may be under common control by virtue of having ofi or camc which is a wholly owned subsidiary of ofi as their common investment adviser  section c provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section b authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a of the act provided that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the act applicants believe that the proposed arrangements satisfy these standards for the reasons discussed below  applicants submit that sections a and b were intended to prevent a person with strong potential adverse interests to and some influence over the investment decisions of a registered investment company from causing or inducing the investment company to engage in lending transactions that unfairly inure to the benefit of that person and that are detrimental to the best interests of the investment company and its shareholders applicants assert that the proposed credit facility transactions do not raise these concerns because a ofi would administer the program as a disinterested fiduciary b all interfund loans would consist only of uninvested cash reserves that the fund otherwise would invest in shortterm repurchase agreements or other shortterm instruments c the interfund loans would not involve a greater risk than such other investments d the lending fund would receive interest at a rate higher than it could obtain through such other investments and e the borrowing fund would pay interest at a rate lower than otherwise available to it under its bank loan agreements and avoid the upfront commitment fees associated with committed lines of credit moreover applicants believe that the other conditions in the application would effectively preclude the possibility of any fund obtaining an undue advantage over any other fund  section a generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of an affiliated person from selling any securities or other property to the company section d generally makes it unlawful for a registered investment company to purchase or otherwise acquire any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section applicants state that the obligation of a borrowing fund to repay an interfund loan may constitute a security under sections a and d section dj provides that the commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section d if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors applicants contend that the standards under sections c b and dj are satisfied for all the reasons set forth above in support of their request for relief from sections a and b and for the reasons discussed below  applicants state that section d was intended to prevent the pyramiding of investment companies in order to avoid duplicative costs and fees attendant upon multiple layers of investment companies applicants submit that the proposed credit facility does not involve these abuses applicants note that there would be no duplicative costs or fees to the funds or shareholders and that ofi would receive no additional compensation for its services in administering the credit facility applicants also note that the purpose of proposed credit facility is to provide economic benefits for all the participating funds  section f of the act prohibits openend investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank provided that immediately after the borrowing there is an asset coverage of at least  per centum for all borrowings of the company under section g of the act the term “senior security” includes any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness applicants request exemptive relief from section f to the limited extent necessary to start printed page implement the credit facility because the lending funds are not banks  applicants believe that granting the relief under section c is appropriate because the funds would remain subject to the requirement of section f that all borrowings of the fund including combined interfund and bank borrowings have at least  asset coverage based on the conditions and safeguards described in the application applicants also submit that to allow the funds to borrow from other funds pursuant to the proposed credit facility is consistent with the purposes and policies of section f  section d and rule d generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company or affiliated persons of an affiliated person when acting as principal from effecting any transaction in which the company is a joint or a joint and several participants unless permitted by commission order upon application rule db of the act provides that in passing upon applications for exemptive relief the commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the companys participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants submit that the purpose of section d is to avoid overreaching by and unfair advantage to investment company insiders applicants believe that the credit facility is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act in that it offers both reduced borrowing costs and enhanced returns on loaned funds to all participating funds and their shareholders applicants note that each fund would have an equal opportunity to borrow and lend on equal terms consistent with its investment policies and fundamental investment limitations applicants therefore believe that each funds participation in the credit facility will be on terms which are no different from or less advantageous than that of other participating funds applicants conditions applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the interest rates to be charged to the funds under the credit facility will be the average of the joint account repo rate and the bank loan rate  on each business day ofi will compare the bank loan rate with the joint account repo rate and will make cash available for interfund loans only if the interfund loan rate is a more favorable to the lending fund than the joint account repo

solicit cash for the credit facility from any fund or prospectively publish or disseminate loan demand data to portfolio managers ofi will invest any amounts remaining after satisfaction of borrowing
