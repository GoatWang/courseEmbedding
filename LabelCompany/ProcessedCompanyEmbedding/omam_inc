at september   our us holding company omush was a subsidiary of om group uk limited or omguk which was and is in turn wholly owned by our parent the board of directors of our parent completed our initial public offering of the companys business or the offering on october   upon the completion of the offering on october   we became an indirect majority owned subsidiary of our parent we and our parent determined that certain transactions or the reorganization should be undertaken in preparation for the offering specifically the preoffering restructuring steps described below were completed by us and our parent prior to october    omguk incorporated omam in the united kingdom as a direct whollyowned subsidiary of omguk  omam incorporated omam us inc in the state of delaware us sub as a direct whollyowned subsidiary of omam  us sub incorporated omam uk limited in the united kingdom uk sub as a direct whollyowned subsidiary of us sub  our existing intercompany debt which was owed by omush to omguk was refinanced with new intercompany debt  omguk contributed its shares in omush and the new intercompany debt to omam in return for an issuance of shares by omam resulting in the elimination of existing intercompany debt of  million and the redemption of a  million intercompany receivable via a capital distribution back to omguk for a net reduction of existing intercompany debt of  million  the omush shares were transferred to uk sub via a series of share exchanges and the new intercompany debt was contributed among omam us sub and uk sub  omam underwent a reduction of share capital to maximize distributable reserves reregistered in the united kingdom as a public limited company amended its articles of association to reflect the same and organized its share capital for purposes of the offering  omam declared a  million preoffering dividend to omguk omam also issued a noninterest bearing promissory note to omguk in the principal amount of  million which will be paid as funds become available from affiliate distributions subject to the maintenance of a minimum level of cash holdings  omam entered into arrangements with omguk for the payment of future realizable benefits estimated to total  million at september   associated with certain deferred tax assets existing as of the date of the offering as well as coinvestments with a carrying value of  million and a fair value of  million made by the company in realestate and timber strategies of its affiliates in accordance with the deferred tax asset arrangement in december  omam will begin to make quarterly payments to omguk in the fourth quarter of  omam will adjust the balance of the liability to reflect the impact of the  income tax return and will also reduce the liability as of the offering date to reflect a revised estimate of the future realizable benefits as of the offering date the liability will again be adjusted in the fourth quarter of  to reflect the impact of the  income tax return through the date of the offering table of contents between october   and october   we completed the following restructuring steps i payment of the  million preoffering dividend to omguk funded by a new third party credit facility entered into at the closing of the offering and ii the purchase of additional ownership of an affiliate for  million in cash resulting in a reduction of liabilities for the same amount additionally we have recast the components of parent equity deficit to reflect the issuance of  ordinary shares nominal value  the economics of our business our profitability is affected by a variety of factors including the level and composition of our average assets under management or aum fee rates charged on aum and our expense structure our affiliates earn management fees based on assets under management approximately  of our management fees are calculated based on average aum calculated on either a daily or monthly basis with the remainder of our management fees calculated based on period end aum or other measuring methods changes in the levels of our assets under management are driven by our investment performance and net client cash flows our affiliates may also earn performance fees when certain accounts add value in relation to relevant benchmarks or exceed required returns our largest expense item is compensation and benefits paid to our and our affiliates employees which consists of both fixed and variable components fixed compensation and benefits represents base salaries and wages payroll taxes and the costs of our employee benefit programs variable compensation calculated as described below may be awarded in cash equity or profit interests the arrangements in place with our affiliates result in the sharing of economics between omam and each affiliates key management personnel using a profitsharing model except for icm which uses a revenue share model as a result of a legacy economic arrangement that has not been restructured profit sharing affects two elements within our earnings i the calculation of variable compensation and ii the level of each affiliates equity or profit interests distribution to its employees variable compensation is the portion of earnings that is contractually allocated to affiliate employees as a bonus pool typically representing a fixed percentage of earnings before variable compensation which is measured as revenues less fixed compensation and benefits and other operating and administrative expenses profits after variable compensation are shared between us and affiliate key employee equity holders according to our respective equity or profit interests ownership the sharing of profits in this manner ensures that the economic interests of affiliate key employees and those of omam are aligned both in terms of generating strong annual earnings as well as investing those earnings back into the business in order to generate growth over the long term we view profit sharing as an attractive operating model as it allows us to share in the benefits of operating leverage as the business grows and ensures all equity and profit interests holders are incented to achieve that growth equity or profit interests owned by affiliate key employees are either awarded as part of their variable compensation arrangements or alternatively may have originally resulted from omam acquiring less than  of the affiliate over time affiliate key employeeowned equity or profit interests are recycled from one generation of employeeowners to the next either by the next generation purchasing equity or profit interests directly from retiring principals or by affiliate key employees forgoing cash bonuses in exchange for the equivalent value in affiliate equity or profit interests how we measure performance in measuring and monitoring the key components of our earnings our management uses a nongaap financial measure economic net income or eni to evaluate the financial performance of and to make operational decisions for our business we also use eni to make resource allocation decisions determine appropriate levels of investment or dividend payout manage balance sheet leverage determine affiliate variable compensation and equity distributions and incentivize management it is an important measure in evaluating our financial performance because we believe it most accurately represents our operating performance and cash generation capability eni differs from net income determined in accordance with us gaap as a result of both the reclassification of certain income statement items and the exclusion of certain noncash or nonrecurring income statement items in particular eni excludes the results of discontinued operations which are no longer part of our business and that portion of consolidated funds which are not attributable to our shareholders eni is also adjusted to reflect the effect of restructuring and reorganization activity undertaken in connection with the offering eni revenue is primarily comprised of the fee revenues paid to us by our clients for our advisory services and earnings from our equityaccounted

profit interests amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles and certain other noncash expenses noncontrolling interests is a concept under us gaap that identifies net components of revenues and expenses that are not attributable to our shareholders for example the portion of the net income loss of our consolidated funds that is attributable to the outside investors or clients of the consolidated funds is included in noncontrolling interests in our condensed consolidated financial statements conversely controlling interests is the portion of revenue or expense that is attributable
