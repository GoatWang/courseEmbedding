faq specifications product details product description the peace silver dollar would experience one of the briefest but most unconventional mintage periods in the history of us currency it was produced by the united states mint from  to  and then for another  years from  to  due to changes in legislation because both of its mintage periods preceded the  cessation of silver currency the peace silver dollar would be the last genuine “silver” dollar to ever be produced consequently it remains a popular favorite among collectors since it is one of the few existing pieces of silver currency left coin highlights contains  oz of  fine silver minted by the united states mint between  and  or  and  features the famous peace dollar design created by anthony di francisci all peace dollars featured in this collection are in very good circulated condition which means that they have maintained an above average appearance despite visible wear each individual coin was minted from  troy oz of  pure silver it measures  mm in diameter the artwork for the peace silver dollar was the result of a contest in which participants were asked to create the new dollar coin design the winning entry came from artist anthony di francisci his design displayed a unique rendition of lady liberty that was based on the real life statue of liberty francisci’s liberty is depicted on the front of the coin wearing a “radiate” or multiple pointed crown with several loose strands of hair gently blowing in the wind beneath her appear the words “in god we trust” also inscribed in a circular border along the coin’s edge are her name and the coin’s mintage year prominently displayed on the reverse side of the dollar coin is another beloved american icon the bald eagle the eagle perches nobly upon a mountain top with an olive branch clasped in its talons emanating behind our national bird are rays of sunlight whose pointed shape is reminiscent of lady liberty’s crown appearing above the eagle as an arched heading are our nation’s name and the words “e pluribus unum” with its rich history and its patriotic design motif this charming piece of americana is certain to enhance any collection if you would like to learn more about this peace silver dollar please contact us at  our staff is also happy to assist you via live chat or online forms all orders include
