systems › ultralow power solutions ultralow power solutions in order to meet user demands and expectations smart batterypowered products need to have a maximum autonomous lifetime for this the product must use as little power as possible but how to achieve that outstanding lowpower design can’t be solved on component level – you have to consider the complete system and all functions to ensure a maximum operating lifetime on a single battery charge our ultralow power solutions service helps you do so your benefit in the world of digital connected products  systems ultralow power solutions require the ultimate balancing act there are a great many factors that can interact and influence power consumption at – and even across – different levels in the system such as… are there functions which could better be located outside a connected product – for instance in the cloud – to help extend the maximum operating life can functions possibly be combined to reduce power consumption – and are there suitable components for that how can i maximize processing speed wireless links and other areas of product performance in the face of lowpower requirements the answers to powerrelated questions are not always obvious and can be particularly complex for instance in some cases the most efficient solution could involve using more – rather than fewer – components by making use of broad insight into all factors that influence power consumption our experts can determine the optimal powerperformance equilibrium for your product if desired this can also include an operational prototype that demonstrates the targeted operational lifetime have our ultralow power experts contact you discuss your challenge with our business development manager we deliver philips innovation service follows various phases in developing ultralow power solutions for wearables and other products our experts can also provide individual oneoff support at each one system architecture analysis analyzing the overall system architecture of the product in what ways does it support – or not support – ultralow power operation after identifying changes that would be advantageous we outline the architectural choices and their justification in a document for discussion function analysis analyzing the various product functions power aspects of the batterymains function power management lowpower connectivity etc specifying their requirements and selecting possibly suitable alternative components here we often collaborate with component suppliers to identify the ‘ultralow power potential’ limits we may also investigate energy harvesting options power budgeting determining the most optimal powerconsumption configuration including desired states ie sleep vs awake over time based on all available data of the different components – while also best fulfilling all other product requirements prototyping demonstrating the validity of the design if desired by making a prototype which can also be a first step in the product development phase our approach to achieve the best ultralow power design possible it must be approached from a system point of view we first analyze system architecture to identify how we can maximize ultralow power potential after making any necessary adaptations we then do the same for functions and components then we make one or more power budgets to analyze different configurations all of these steps are typically done in a number of iterations eventually we propose an optimal configuration that can be operationally demonstrated in a prototype have our ultralow power experts contact you relevant for you connect your product to the digital world › check out our related services creating smart connected products and systems

recognizable guide comparing an led bulb to an incandescent will give you a rough estimate of just how well it will light a room as a very ballpark figure for led wattages  or  the incandescent wattage value is usually close to what you need lumens  lumens directly measure just how much light the bulb gives out in total on average a watt incandescent shines at  lumens with roughly  lumens of difference above or below the variance depends on manufacturer and age of the lamp leds are directly rated for their max lumen rating and last much longer without dimming of the bulb color temperature

lighting guide lets you select a color temperature and see how it transforms a kitchen driver content  because of their design leds do not typically run on ac voltage many leds require some form of driver to convert the voltage from ac to dc for proper operation the majority of socketbased led lamps are selfdriven but you should always check before buying to make sure that you buy both an led

fluorescents and led bulbs can drastically reduce your energy costs and help protect the environment selecting the right bulb incandescent incandescent bulbs which provide most home lighting are used in products from nightlights to floodlights the most common incandescent is a pearshaped a bulb with a mediumsized screwtype base incandescent lights use electricity to heat a filament until it glows white hot producing light about  percent of the electricity used by incandescent bulbs is lost as heat this style typically burns for  to  hours halogen halogen bulbs contain a small capsule filled with halogen gas which emits a bright white light long life and full spectrum halogen bulbs use less energy and last longer than standard incandescent bulbs of the same wattage the life of these bulbs is around  to  hours or two to five years linear fluorescent linear fluorescent bulbs also known as fluorescent tubes are more energy efficient than incandescents or halogens because they dont produce much heat these are the thin long tube lights often found in kitchens for undercabinet lighting or in garages workshops and basements the tubes can last from  to  hours— to  times longer than incandescent lights fluorescent bulbs require and are powered by fluorescent ballasts compact fluorescent compact fluorescents also known as cfls provide as much light as regular incandescent bulbs while using just onefourth of the energy for example a watt compact fluorescent light bulb yields the same amount of light as a watt incandescent bulb compact fluorescent bulbs last about  hours— times longer than incandescent bulbs high intensity discharge high intensity discharge or hid bulbs include metal halide high pressure sodium and mercury vapor lights as their name implies hid bulbs emit a very large amount of light using relatively little power they are a mainstay of parking lot street and warehouse lighting like fluorescent bulbs hid bulbs also require a ballast stage and studio stage bulbs and photography lights are specialized high output lights used in the entertainment industry as well as in just about any stage or photography studio traditionally these bulbs have used halogen or hid technology though led stage lights are becoming more common miniature indicator miniature indicator bulbs are found in everything from heavy machinery to instrument panels though

wwwbulbscom the led authority led light bulbs save on our wide assortment of energyefficient led bulbs available in a variety of shapes and sizes leds deliver quality light across a broad spectrum of color temperatures from warm ambient light to the bright white look of daylight to suit any indoor or oudoor application key considerations lumens vs wattage color temperature dimming leds enclosed fixtures lumens vs wattage shop by incandescent equivalent under w w  w w  w w  w w  w w  w w  w over w shop by lumens under                       when shopping for bulbs you’re probably accustomed to looking for watts as an indication of how bright the bulb will be the brightness of leds however is determined a little differently contrary to common belief wattage isn’t an indication of brightness but a measurement of how much energy the bulb draws for incandescent bulbs there is an accepted correlation between the watts drawn and the brightness but for leds watts aren’t a great predictor of how bright the bulb will be the point after all is that they draw less energy but don’t bother doing the math  there isn’t a uniform way to convert incandescent watts to led watts instead a different form of measurement should be used lumens the lumen lm is the real measurement of brightness provided by a light bulb and is the number you should look for when shopping for leds color temperature shop by color temperature under  warmest                coolest led lighting offers a range of color tones perfect for any application from the soft look of an incandescent bulb to the bright white look of daylight these color tones are called “color temperature” and their measurement is made in degrees kelvin k leds produce a wide range of color temperatures from  kelvin warmer light to  kelvin and above cool white dimming leds watch out for nondimmable leds most dimmers which were likely designed to work with incandescent bulbs work by cutting off the amount of electricity sent to the bulbs the less electricity drawn the dimmer the light since there is no direct correlation between led brightness and energy drawn you need to ensure your led on a dimmer switch can result in some leds to hum flicker or buzz if you want your led bulb to be dimmable you need to do one of two things find led bulbs compatible with traditional dimmers or replace your current dimming switch with a leadingedge ledcompatible dimmer shop dimmable leds enclosed fixtures leds can be used in enclosed semiclosed or open fixtures but you need to make sure you buy the right led for your application you probably know that led bulbs run dramatically cooler than incandescent bulbs but that doesn’t mean they don’t produce heat led bulbs do get hot but the heat is pulled away by a heat sink in the base of the bulb from there the heat dissipates into the air keeping the led bulb cool which helps to keep its promise of a very long life and therein lies the problem the bulb needs a way to dissipate the heat if an led bulb is placed in an enclosed housing the heat won’t have anywhere to go sending it right back to the bulb sentencing it to a short life consider where you’d like to place your led bulbs if you have fully or semi enclosed fixtures you need to make sure the leds are approved for recessed or enclosed spaces to avert any preformance issues shop leds for recessed or enclosed spaces
