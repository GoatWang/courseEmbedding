jesse lipson home  about  duke entrepreneurs  jesse lipson  go back jesse lipson citrix sharefile alumni entrepreneur printable bio pdf interview by howie rhee if you’ve ever had to send a large file over the internet you probably have used sharefile acquired by citrix in 0 or a service like it started by duke alumnus jesse lipson ’ it is connected to some of the experiences he had while still an undergraduate at duke university jesse shares some advice for students who are interested in starting their own company while in college duke ie you had some entrepreneurial experiences while you were at duke what kinds of entrepreneurial things did you try as an undergraduate jl when i was a freshman in  we really weren’t thinking about internet businesses since ecommerce was in its very early stages so my roommate and i experimented with a few very nontechnical ideas one business idea involved collected aluminum cans from campus and transporting them to michigan for a 0 cent refund per can we never really got off the ground with that one a second idea involved trying to beat the casino by learning to time the motion of the ball on a roulette wheel my roommate and i even traveled to greensboro to rent a roulette wheel and bring it back to our door room to try different strategies once  rolled around internet businesses were the big thing me and a few friends created a startup called easycentral it was designed to be a personalized portal and browser toolbar that would make it easier to fill in forms on the web and to manage loginspasswords across web sites the business never took off but i learned a lot and in many ways that business pointed me down the path that i’m still on today duke ie talk us through the various startups you’ve been involved with jl aside from the startups mentioned above that i dabbled in during undergrad my first startup was a web site development business that i started with my wife when i was less than a year out of college she was still in college at the time we brought a couple of other friends from duke in as partners pretty early on the company did pretty well but we never grew beyond about  total employees and we decided to split it into three separate companies a couple of years into the business one of those companies brooks bell interactive is currently run by my wife the other one sharefile is my current company the final company was sold to another web development firm a year ago while i was running the web development company i also took over my father’s pharmaceutical market research company i partnered with a couple of other duke grads to take over the daytoday management of that business and we eventually sold the whole business to a public company in early  duke ie so you started a web development company with three friends from duke what lessons did you learn that’d be applicable to students that are thinking of starting a company with their friends jl i think it’s important to choose one person as the clear leader of the company trying to make decisions with unanimous consent can really cause productivity to grind to a halt it is also important to play out all of the “what if” scenarios even if it forces difficult conversations you should take into account the possibility that someone may want to leave the company and figure out how that will impact their dividends and equity distribution i would advise students to watch the movies the social network and startupcom having been exposed to many startups both directly and indirectly i can say that issues between business partners are very common and the more contingency planning you do ahead of time the easier it makes things duke ie when did you realize you could be successful as an entrepreneur and not take a job jl i think i realized it when i was a senior in college becoming exposed to a variety of businesses i just had the probably irrational feeling that it would not be that hard to run a similar business and at least be moderately successful at it duke ie you’ve talked about how students need to focus less on creating the next google or facebook and more on finding a good business and executing well what do you say to them when they say “well anybody could copy this idea” jl i think that the concept of uniqueness is highly overrated when it comes to business ideas many aspiring entrepreneurs especially students feel they need to come up with a totally unique idea and if they later find someone already doing it they give up there is no need to be afraid of competitors as long as you have a clear path for acquiring customers and generating revenue what you should really be afraid of is coming up with a totally new idea that no one actually wants to buyuse if companies copy your idea that implies you have become successful enough to want to copy in that case congratulations now you just need to execute on your strategy to make sure you stay relevant don’t assume that copying a business idea is easy if that were true then blockbuster wouldn’t have lost to netflix and google would have been able to copy facebook before it became a 0 billion company duke ie tell us a little bit about sharefile how did it start what do you do and how’s it doing these days jl in a nutshell sharefile allows companies to exchange business files that are either too large or too confidential to send by email sharefile spun out of my web development business we got the idea for the product because of demand we were seeing in our service business for this type of functionality the company is doing great over the course of  years we have grown from just one employee to almost 0 fulltime employees and over  million total users across  countries we are completely bootstrapped and have never raised any money duke ie what advice do you have for students that think they want to start a company now but are worried it’s too risky jl i would say that the least risky time to start a business is while you’re in school as a student you can work on a business without needing to make a big salary so the downside to starting a business in college is very small in the worst case your business will fail but you’ll still have some great experience that will help you get a job after graduation once you are married with kids and a mortgage payment then you’ll really know what it means for it to be too risky to start a company duke ie you have managed to have a successful company and your wife also has a successful company being an entrepreneur can be stressful but you have it times two how do you manage to balance work and life jl regarding the question about stress i think people adapt to any situation over time even though i have a lot of responsibilities as a ceo i have gotten used to those responsibilities and i’ve developed the skills to handle them so i don’t feel stressed on a regular basis as for worklife balance i didn’t have much balance for the first couple of years in my business after a while though i realized that being an entrepreneur is a marathon and not a sprint when i’m burned out i am not creative and i don’t make good decisions so i started working less hours and taking more vacations i am not saying that you don’t need to work hard as an entrepreneur i have never known anyone in any field who has accomplished something great and is not a very hard worker but in my opinion you don’t have to work 0 hour weeks to be a successful entrepreneur duke ie if you had to do it all over again what would you have done differently at duke to prepare yourself to be an entrepreneur jl i would have started my first business about two years earlier than i did instead of starting my senior year i would have started my sophomore year duke ie if a student wants to meet you and has an idea for advice what are you looking for from them is it the idea the passion the team jl i think it’s all three of those but the talent of the entrepreneur and their passion are definitely more important than the specific idea to read about more duke entrepreneurs click here new tweets duke ie eshipatdukejosh sommer was diagnosed with brain
