is the picasso ofdennis cogan is the picasso of the art of law and the very best trial attorney in the country i am hardly the only person lawyer or not who believes that mr cogan is the definitive embodiment of every desirable characteristic an attorney could have including creativity intelligence knowledge integrity work ethic motivation meticulousness street smarts sincerity compassion and fairness mr cogans explosive enthusiasm for prevailing in court and winning at life in general is highly inspirational and contagious his electric charisma both the star and leadership kinds dignified aggressiveness and artistic spontaneity during trials are breathtaking i should know better than anyone as mr cogan won all nine of my difficulttowin cases for me amongst mr cogans hundreds of spectacular screamsvolumesabouthissuperhumantalent achievements include at one time holding the record for the largest civil liability judgement against the philadelphia police department and being the lead prosecutor of the homicide unit at the young age of  whilst a philadelphia assistant district attorney watching this legendary largerthanlife god in court is like watching a highly entertaining brilliantly acted intricately scripted and expertly directed broadway play sans the frivolous song and dance i often wondered who was actually running the show the judge or mr cogan who invariably commands extreme respect from all involved mr cogans youthful good looks endless energy and infinite passion belie his true age i am using my real name to prove that this is a genuine unsolicited review not that anyone who knows mr cogan would ever suspect otherwisea m r cohen esquire law officeschris k ratedmr cohen is the best immigration law lawyer in pennsylvania or new jersey i say this because of my wonderful experience with him i dealt with a few other immigration firms before mr cohens and theyre not all the samei was drawn to mr cohen because of his easy manner down to earth but knowledgeable style and his over  years experience after meeting him the first time i knew he knew what he was talking abouti had a difficult permanent residency and then later citizenship case especially because i had been convicted although i was innocent of shop lifting i never thought i would be a citizen but mr cohens knowledge of immigration law and the people at uscis won the case for me i still cant believe it mr cohen was readily available for all my inquiries his calm demeanor and attention to detail were especially appreciated he doesnt just tell you what you want to hear though he tells you his honest opinion and chances for approval i like thati have referred many clients to his offices every single referral was satisfied even the one who was denied his permanent residency because it turned out his divorce wasnt valid if you need a good immigration lawyer you can save yourself a lot of time expense and aggravation by going first to mr cohen at one of his offices in pa or njcoleman  kempinskimikechj ratedi was very apprehensive about i was very apprehensive about the entire process of filing for bankruptcy i veiwed it as a diificult process to navigate and also was concerned what others might think if it were found out that i filed when i first met with kimberly and ray i truely felt at ease right away i noticed and appreciated that they were not some stuffed shirts type lawyers i even felt as if i knew them longer than what i really did kimberly made the process so easy and nonintimidating she and ray both addressed all my concerns and issues on the very first visit and i did my part and before i knew it was alll done i had a couple of creditors try to come after me even after my discharge of debts i just simply forwarded the information to kimberly and she jumped on it immediatley she kept me in the loop via email and provided me with a copy of the corospondence she sent to the creditors and i never heard from them again nor any other creditor for that matter its been years since i felt this level of freedom its like a tremedous weight is gone the harrasing calls and letters has stopped and now i can sleep at night and rebuild my credit thanks to coleman  kempiskithanks mike v the law office of harper j dimmerman pcjason m ratedmy wife and i began working with harper over a year and a half ago when we began experiencing build quality issues with our newly constructed home from the very beginning harper not only showed us that he was exceptionally knowledgeable in real estate law but that he was also truly committed to helping us  and most importantly committed to winning our case he is very easy to talk to and very good at explaining complex legal matters in a way anyone can understand he is always responsive to any questions or concerns we had during the process and was always very well informed and knowledgeable over the course of this very long process harper has always gone above and beyond to ensure we were well informed and directing us to take the appropriate steps to ensure we had the strongest case possible he is calculatedly aggressive making smart decisions on what moves to make and who to push and how hard  never coming across as your stereotypical shark of a lawyer harper is truly a great lawyer and we will continue to go to him for any legal needs we have for as long as he is practicingaffordable legal center llckhaleel d ratedi recently hired attorney kaplan to help me gain some level of custody of my two sons i was seeking a lawyer because my sons mother was not allowing me to see them sent me paperwork stating that she was sole legal custody of our children seemingly taking me out of the picture upon my initial conversation with attorney kaplan i reached a level of comfort that i had not experienced in a substantial amount of time due to the foolishness that my sons mother was engaging in in spite of my lack of knowledge concerning how these kinds of cases play out attorney kaplan was not only beyond patient with me he was also very knowledgeable elaborate and informative in explaining the ins and outs of my case needless to say attorney kaplan was able to make it so that both of my sons will be spending the holiday with me there are not enough words to truly articulate andor express the level of gratitude that i have for attorney kaplan and his entire staff for being so diligent temperate and long suffering all in efforts to help enable my sons to be with their dadthe law office of harper j dimmerman pccarlo f ratedi have used harper dimmerman esq for a business partnership agreement and our family has used mr dimmermans services for a complex real estate matter involving separation of title on an outofstate vacation property as well as in a challenge to a residential property valuation involving several city agencies in all three instances we have found mr dimmerman to be a strong determined and effective attorney who delivered the exact results we needed he is unique among attorneys in smaller practices we have seen in that he provides individualized attention and service and takes the time to understand each matter fully in order to recommend the best strategy for success he is extremely organized and very accessible by telephone and email i was also impressed that he has chaired bar association committees and is a frequent speaker on new developments in the law we were extremely pleased with our outcomes and would not hesitate to recommend him for any legal need michael j graves jr lawfred r ratedmy wife was appointed michael grace jr on september th in court by the judge since september th she has called emailed and texted attorney graves every single day to no avail it has been one month and she is in a worse situation that when she started she informed mr graves that there was an emergency situation and it needed immediate attention we would have been grateful for any help at all and have gotten none at all maybe he is having as bad a time in court as i am my previous attorney who was also appointed to me didnt even bother to show on september th this lack of counsel then and now is the reason she is still involved with philadelphia family court pa dhs is a joke and has been grossly negligent it should be an easy win for any lawyer there have been  opened and closed dhs reports prior to this case cmon mr graves help her she is a great mother to her son please we cannot afford a private attorney witch is why mr graves was appointed smhanthony petrone
