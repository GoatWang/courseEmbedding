northwest of wichita the city of hutchinson kansas has a population of over  the public water supply is derived from  municipal wells most of which have been installed and maintained by layne the city discovered that carbon tetrachloride and other volatile organic compounds vocs had contaminated one of its well sites further high levels of inorganic chlorides salts were present vocs are typically treated by air stripping however this strategy was complicated by the chlorides which cannot be removed through air stripping processes solution an engineering firm was brought in to devise a treatment strategy the resulting facility treats water from the contaminated well removing iron and manganese with manganese dioxide pressure filters removing chlorides through reverse osmosis ro then removing co and vocs in a degasifier concealed in the clock tower the resulting pure water is blended with city water resulting in a peak production capability of  mgd in june of  layne was awarded a contract from the general contractor to assist in the design and fabrication of a  mgd ro system including  micron cartridge filters cleaninplace equipment and chemical feed equipment the four ro

high rate plate settlers and onsite sodium hypochlorite generation the proposed site of the plant presented many design challenges also the world equestrian games were being held in  which would place

engaged to coach all members of the team in solving issues in a true partnering mindset this project was successful because of the full collaboration of our project team and was built in less than  ½ years making it online in time for the  world equestrian games layne worked with the design engineer and owner on early conceptual designs and constructability issues unique construction techniques were suggested for the deep river intake in rock raw water pipelines with significant elevation changes and a sharp turn in direction the  mgd plant design employed state of the art components including high rate plate settlers and onsite sodium hypochlorite generation design included a unique pipeline anchor system to allow the raw water transmission line to traverse the bluff and carry process and electric utilities between facilities process treatment includes rapid mixers horizontal reel flocculation plate settler clarifiers and mixed media dual cell filters structures consisted of chemical building sludge dewatering building primary clarifiers aeration tanks secondary clarifiers and effluent plant ps with future uv provisions and clearwell scada design incorporated a fully

and owner on early conceptual designs and constructability issues unique construction techniques were suggested for the deep river intake in rock raw water pipelines with significant elevation changes and a sharp turn in direction the  mgd plant design employed state of the art components including high rate plate settlers and onsite sodium hypochlorite generation design included a unique pipeline anchor system to allow the raw water transmission line to traverse the bluff and carry process and electric utilities between facilities process treatment includes rapid mixers horizontal reel flocculation plate settler clarifiers and mixed media dual cell filters structures consisted of chemical building sludge dewatering building primary clarifiers aeration tanks secondary clarifiers and effluent plant ps with future uv provisions and clearwell scada design incorporated a fully automated system for redundancy the electrical system design takes medium voltage service from the utility and provides a redundant service utilizing kv and  volt distribution networks services employed water treatment plant construction intake construction pump station construction pipeline construction

water resources  membrane aeration removes entrained air situation many public water supplies have entrained air that causes the water to appear “milky” or “cloudy” conventional methods to remove entrained air can result in headloss reduced capacity and – in the case of stilling basins  add significantly to a plants footprint and require additional construction however left untreated entrained air can adversely affect flow capacity and result in lower water pressures and reduced fireflow capacity united water new york uwny owns and operates the water supply treatment and distribution system that serves most of rockland county new york including  wells some of these wells contain high levels of entrained  dissolved air and must be operated below capacity solution following the successful pilot test of membrane liquicel contactor uwny contracted with layne for design and construction of deaeration systems for two wells the challenge was to optimize the use of these wells while minimizing capital and operating expenditures one well was designed to operate at a flow of  gpm the other at  pgm the treatment trains installed by layne were designed for peak capacities of  and

permian basin’s oil patch one company that helps meet the water needs of oil and gas operators drilling in the delaware basin is among those that have seized an opportunity houstonbased layne christensen co recently announced a new energy infrastructure business designed to “satisfy the monstrous and growing need for water for oil and gas operations” said j michael anderson the company’s chief financial officer the new  million system should be in operation in august situated on approximately  acres that the company purchased last year near pecos the infrastructure will include water wells pump stations inground storage facilities and a highcapacity water pipeline stretching  miles north from pecos to orla anderson said in a phone interview from his office in the woodlands the layne christensen project is different from similar projects because the company owns the water and infrastructure anderson said the system initially will be capable of producing and delivering  barrels of water per day the opportunity exists for significant expansion as demand warrants he said the expansion could be by christensen alone or in partnership with other companies producing water in the region he said more from oil report recent oil price swoon could cut us oil output in  expert corporate culture may have to change to improve cyber security “we’re in a nice part of the aquifer but as you move north it dries up pretty rapidly” anderson said “the pipeline can take water from where it’s plentiful to orla where it’s dry and water is difficult to come by” the company will have its own storage pits and customers will also have their own storage pits and the water can be taken that last mile to the drilling site through temporary frac hoses either by the company or its customer he said the pipeline will reduce truck traffic he said and added that trucks could not handle the amounts of water needed to hydraulically fracture a delaware basin well if a well required  barrels of water he said it would require  trucks to haul in that water michael j caliel the company’s president and chief executive officer estimates many fracturing operations require between  and  barrels of water per completion and his company expects water usage within the energy sector to more than double over the next two years anderson stressed that the water the company is providing is nonpotable “layne christensen is focused on sustainability and doing the right thing we’re not taking water that could be used for drinking “producers are excited to be able to get large quantities of water” anderson said they also appreciate working with a company that has  years of experience providing water infrastructure solutions to municipal agriculture and industrial sectors he said layne christensen which was established in kansas city kansas moved to the houston area in  because the company felt its future growth would come from the energy sector “in houston we’re just down the street from customers like anadarko who are active in the delaware” anderson said the company has had operations in midland for six years he said while the initial infrastructure will serve the delaware he said the company believes the midland basin also will be “a nice place to be” and will be looking for opportunities there looking further down the road anderson said the company sees opportunities in offering water treatment services “layne also has a long history in water treatment this infrastructure is new but once the water is used in fracturing it comes back over time in produced water in the future we can provide great solutions for treating and reusing that water”     stay connected top jobs latest news  sports video latest stories mpo agrees on draft list of
