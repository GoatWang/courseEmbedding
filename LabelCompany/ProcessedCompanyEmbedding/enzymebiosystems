hunter straus longterm horizon growth longshort equitysummaryenzymebiosystems financials appear to be inadequate to support the companys goalsabout  of the companys stock is owned by officers directors and the singlelargest shareholderthe company has spent only  in research  development and has not generated any revenue since inceptionthe companys corporate hq appears to be a ups storebackground enzymebiosystems otcqbenzb was recently featured on a promotional website and through snailmail advertisements from the intelligent investor report while the landing page has since been taken down its important to note that the promotional advertisement claimed that the companys product is a potential cure for cancer among other things given the substantial insider ownership nature of the companys financials and managements history it is my opinion that investors would be wise to avoid investing in the common stock of enzymebiosystems business from the companys investor presentation enzymebiosystems enzb a nevada corporation was founded on june   for the purpose of utilizing enzyme technologies to develop commercial solutions for a broad range of applications within the specialty chemical industry enzymes can be categorized as enzyme inhibitors and enzyme activators enzyme inhibitors are molecules that bind to enzymes and decrease their activity since blocking an enzymes activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance many drugs are enzyme inhibitors enzyme activators are molecules that bind to enzymes and increase their activity these molecules are often involved in the allosteric defined as having to do with a protein with a structure that is altered reversibly by a small molecule so that its original function is modified regulation of enzymes in the control of metabolism both enzyme inhibitors and enzyme activators are currently used by many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in research and development of new drug compounds the description is pretty ambiguous  it doesnt really tell us what the company does it only tells us what the company was founded for  has there been any progress on research since  it doesnt say there is no mention of the companys research progress and product development potential customers or market size the long description of enzyme inhibitors and enzyme activators only adds to the confusion i want to know why as a potential investor i should be interested in the company how can i expect a return on my investment beyond the confusing business description the companys financials dont do much to clarify things if we have a detailed look at enzbs financial statements its apparent that the companys financial situation is unable to support such a specialized business beyond these issues the address listed on the companys sec filings as its principal executive offices appears to be a ups store in las vegas financials enzbs most recent q filed on february   shows that the company has  in cash the only asset class listed in the balance sheet no history of revenue and an accumulated deficit of about  in its income statement the only operating expenses are listed as general and administrative at  and nothing was spent on research  development in the six months ended december   the companys operations used  in cash given its cash holdings of  it would seem that at the current cash burn rate the company has time but the amount spent seems inconsistent with the claims that are made in the promotion of its stock it seems highly unlikely that the amount of cash spent is sufficient to pay for a facility employees test materials and equipment to produce such a promising product and the lack of any spending on research  development recently shows that the company has not been actively working on much of anything furthermore if enzbs only asset is cash it implies that it doesnt even have any other property  i can understand renting a facility but surely there must be some equipment or test samples if i am to be convinced that the company is actively performing research in fact if we look at the q filed on november   we can see in the income statement that from the companys inception on june   through september   the company has spent only  on research  development and  on salaries after over five years it seems that very few resources have been dedicated towards progress on any kind of research going concern and dilution the companys auditors have also issued a going concern opinion which i have copied from the companys most recent q note   going concern these condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business as of december   the company has not recognized any revenues and has accumulated operating losses of approximately  since inception the companys ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations management plans to raise equity capital to finance the operating and capital requirements of the company amounts raised will be used to further development of the companys products to provide financing for marketing and promotion to secure additional property and equipment and for other working capital purposes while the company is putting forth its best efforts to achieve the above plans there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern these financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty the first point in bold is pretty important  it plainly states that management plans to issue shares in order to raise additional funding and isnt even considering looking for a loan id at least like to see management take a stake by loaning the company money in the form of a convertible bond but this is not mentioned here the companys liquidity and capital resources note reads the company is authorized to issue  shares of its  par value common stock and  shares of its  par value preferred stock as of december   the company has  shares of common stock issued and outstanding and  of its series a preferred shares issued and outstanding as of december   the company had current assets of  and current liabilities of  so enzb can dilute the current common share pool by about  times in order to raise cash  given that the company has spent hardly any money at all on research it seems that major dilution is inevitable insider ownership enzbs most recent k states as of october   our officers directors and single largest shareholder owned approximately  of our outstanding common stock as a result our officers and largest shareholder will have the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including at the time of the filing the company listed its employee count at three officers and two directors none of whom have any notable experience managing a business in the pharmaceutical industry website and investor presentation the companys website reads like large advertisement for it stock instead of its products and dedicates a substantial amount of space to describing that management is well suited to run the company indeed there is little which describes in detail what enzb does only that it has proven management and track record the page investor presentation is not much better  it is undated and has very little meaningful information on the second page the company lists the highlights of the presentation as follows developed antitumorantibiotic in vivo animal studies in progress showing dramatic tumor reduction results large market potential for antitumor antibiotics strong upside potential for company and its stock and outright purchase of the company experienced industry specific management team enzbs claims of progress are supported by a few blurry pictures of rats with tumors that have supposedly been reduced by the companys products but there is no information that would tell me that supports massive upside or the possibility of a buyout additionally only two members of the management team have information on them none of which suggests that they have a history of successfully developing producing and selling pharmaceutical products conclusion given the companys financials and experience it seems highly unlikely that its stated goals are achievable enzb simply does not have the resources available to carry out the objectives that are advertised beyond the assets required the company has also spent very little and has not invested in rd in quite some time on top of that there is substantial insider ownership and enzbs accounting firm noted that there is substantial doubt that the company will be able to continue as a going concern beyond the woeful cash situation enzb has no source of available funding beyond issuing equity  i would not be surprised at all if there is a major share offering or a sizeable private placement to a thirdparty in the near future as icing on the cake the companys corporate hq has the same address as a ups store which gives me substantial doubt that it operates any facilities at all if you happened to see the companys investor presentation or the landing page and are considering investing in enzb common stock dont believe the hype  have a look at the companys filings  they tell a
