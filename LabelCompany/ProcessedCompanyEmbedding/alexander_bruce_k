vancouver prevention conference addicted to oil poetry links lists  books cv contact bruce k alexanders globalization of addiction website global society is drowning in addiction to drug use and a thousand other habits this is because people around the world rich and poor alike are being torn from the close ties to family culture and traditional spirituality that constituted the normal fabric of life in premodern times this kind of global society subjects people to unrelenting pressures towards individualism and competition dislocating them from social life people adapt to this dislocation by concocting the best substitutes that they can for a sustaining social cultural and spiritual wholeness and addiction provides this substitute for more and more of us history shows that addiction can be rare in a society for many centuries but can become nearly universal when circumstances change – for example when a cohesive tribal culture is crushed or an advanced civilisation collapses of course this historical perspective does not deny that differences in vulnerability are built into each individuals genes individual experience and personal character but it removes individual differences from the foreground of attention because societal determinants are so much more powerful addiction is much more a social problem than an individual disorder this site is about the relationship between addiction on the one hand and global economic and political realities on the other documents videos audio recordings and links may be submitted by anyone using the contact feature and will be added to the site if they are relevant and carefully edited this site was initially based on the work of bruce k alexander phd who is the site administrator i do not easily give superlatives in my praise of books but this one is truly exceptional  i think that the study could prove of momentous importance in how we view the world in the st century if only its message were to be taken to heart we could spare an immense amount of human suffering professor alexander delivers a convincing case that we are manufacturing addiction by the process of economic globalization and the social dislocation that inevitably goes with it frederick m toates professor of biological psychology open university dear mr alexanderi am presently reading your book titled globalization of addiction a study in poverty of the spirit as a person who was addicted to opiates for over  years now over a decade without a physical dependence on opiates i really felt your book provided an insight into addiction that i have never before seen in addiction literature and i am in my fourth year of studying psychology so have read a book or two on the subject my interest on inequality and the distress that modern market societies produce was first aroused by the spirit level book why equality is better for everyone by  richard wilkinson and kate pickett but it was only really after reading your book that my own experiences made sense as an addict i was a continually preocupied with my self this has continued even with the absence of drugs although i remain abstinent through personal choice i find myself just as much an addict as when i was physically addicted to heroin i still have the same gnawing emptyness inside and a terrible desire for recognition and protaganism this i do keep at bay using a spiritualy based  step program of which i am the typical grateful recovering addict as my present life cannot be compared to my former life but i certainly do not feel cured and have never liked the desease model please dont tell my fellow  stepers ha ha i always felt my addiction was adaptive and very much the way a obsessive compulsive person will wash their hands to cope with stress i used heroin adaptive and functional i of course like any self respecting addict seek fame fortune and recognition in the addiction field and am continually disapointed that my word is not taken as gospel  i have the pleasure of knowing several former physically dependent addicts who  have left their physical addiction behind but have launched themselves into an equaly

top results for rat park rat park rat park was a study into drug addiction conducted in the late s and published in  by canadian psychologist bruce k alexander and his colleagues at simon fraser university in british columbia canada alexanders hypothesis was that drugs do not cause addiction and that the apparent addiction to opiate drugs commonly observed in laboratory rats exposed to it is attributable to their living conditions and not to any addictive property of the drug itself he told the canadian senate in  that prior experiments in which laboratory rats were kept isolated in cramped metal cages tethered to a selfinjection apparatus show only that severely distressed animals like severely distressed people will relieve their distress pharmacologically if they can to test his hypothesis alexander built rat park an script error no such module convert housing colony  times the floor area of a standard laboratory cage there were – rats of both sexes in residence an abundance of food balls and wheels for play and enough space for mating and raising litters the results of the experiment appeared to support his hypothesis rats who had been forced to consume morphine hydrochloride for  consecutive days were brought to rat park and given a choice between plain tap water and water laced with morphine for the most part they chose the plain water nothing that we tried alexander wrote  produced anything that looked like addiction in rats that were housed in a reasonably normal environment control groups of rats isolated in small cages consumed much more morphine in this and several subsequent experiments the two major science journals science and nature rejected alexander coambs and hadaways first paper which appeared instead in psychopharmacology a respectable but much smaller journal in  the papers publication initially attracted no response within a few years simon fraser university withdrew rat parks funding contents  disease model of drug addiction  studies of isolated laboratory animal  rat park experiments  reaction to the experiment  related research  see also  notes  references  further reading  external links disease model of drug addiction fileaddictiondependencepng the disease model explains addiction with reference to the action of drugs on the reward pathways in the limbic system researchers say that opiates cause changes in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway that produce feelings of pleasure image courtesy of the national institute on drug abuse it is not disputed that some substances cause withdrawal symptoms after repeated use leaving the user in distress if they stop using where scientists differ is over the extent to which certain substances can be said to rob the user of self control causing not only withdrawal— but a drug addiction defined as a behavioral pattern of drug use characterized by overwhelming involvement with the use of a drug compulsive use the securing of its supply and a high tendency to relapse after withdrawal in the th century drug addiction was regarded as a sign of akrasia immorality or weakness of the will however th century brain research replaced this moral model with a disease model of addiction according to which addiction to a drug is a byproduct of the chemical structure of the drug itself according to social psychologist stanton peele the disease model states that tolerance withdrawal and craving are thought to be properties of particular drugs and sufficient use of these substances is believed to give the organism no choice but to behave in these stereotypical ways this view of drug addiction is reflected in the policies of the war on drugs and in slogans such as heroin is so good dont even try it once or crack cocaine is instantly addictive scientists adhering to the disease model believe that behavior is the business of the brain according to avram goldstein professor emeritus of pharmacology at stanford university and a leading researcher into drug addiction goldstein writes that the site of action of heroin and all other addictive drugs is a bundle of neurons deep in the brain called the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway a reward pathway that mediates feelings of wanting and motivation within this pathway heroin causes dopamine neurons to release dopamine a neurotransmitter that determines incentive salience and causes the user to want more dopamine neurons are normally held in check by inhibitory neurons but heroin shuts these down allowing the dopamine neurons to become overstimulated the brain responds with feelings of euphoria but the stimulation is excessive and in order to protect itself against this the brain adapts by becoming less sensitive to the heroin this has two consequences according to the disease model first more heroin is required to produce the high and at the same time the reward pathway becomes less sensitive to the effects of endorphins which regulate the release of dopamine so that without heroin there is a persistent feeling of sickness after repeated intake the user becomes tolerant and dependent and undergoes withdrawal symptoms if the heroin supply is terminated as the feelings of withdrawal worsen the user loses control writes goldstein and becomes an addict studies of isolated laboratory animal fileratselfinjectgif diagram from the us national institute on drug abuse of a rat selfadministering a drug professor avram goldstein writes a rat addicted to heroin is not rebelling against society is not a victim of socioeconomic circumstances is not a product of a dysfunctional family and is not a criminal the rats behavior is simply controlled by the action of heroin actually morphine to which heroin is converted in the body on its brain according to alexander the disease model makes either of two claims claim a all or most people who use heroin or cocaine beyond a certain minimum amount become addicted claim b no matter what proportion of the users of heroin and cocaine become addicted their addiction is caused by exposure to the drug several decades of animal studies have been seen as supporting these claims avram goldstein wrote in  if a monkey is provided with a lever which he can press to selfinject heroin he establishes a regular pattern of heroin use — a true addiction — that takes priority over the normal activities of his life  since this behavior is seen in several other animal species primarily rats i have to infer that if heroin were easily available to everyone and if there were no social pressure of any kind to discourage heroin use a very large number of people would become heroin addicts twenty years later goldstein maintains the same position in a paper delivered to a  us methadone conference he wrote every addictive drug used by people is also selfadministered by rats and monkeys if we arrange matters so that when an animal presses a lever it gets a shot of heroin into a vein that animal will press the lever repeatedly to the exclusion of other activities food sex etc it will become a heroin addict a rat addicted to heroin is not rebelling against society is not a victim of socioeconomic circumstances is not a product of a dysfunctional family and is not a criminal the rats behavior is simply controlled by the action of heroin actually morphine to which heroin is converted in the body on its brain against this alexander argues that the main evidence for the belief in druginduced addiction comes from the testimonials of some addicted people who believe that exposure to a drug caused them to lose control and from some highly technical research on laboratory animals he argues that this weak evidence has been embellished in the news media to the point where it has acquired the status of an unassailable fact whereas the great bulk of historical and clinical evidence he says runs against it he writes that although the use of opiates in the united states and england during the th century was greater than it is now the incidence of dependence and addiction never reached one percent of the population and was declining at the end of the century in britain he writes that heroin has been widely used in medication for coughs diarrhea and chronic pain until the present day in  british doctors prescribed  kilograms of heroin to patients which he writes amounts to millions of doses yet a  study of the statistics on iatrogenic addiction in the uk showed a virtual absence of such addicts recent research confirms that many people use heroin regularly for years for either recreational or medical purposes without becoming addicted rat park experiments filewistar ratjpg a white wistar lab rat in rat park alexander built a short tunnel large enough to accommodate one rat at a time at the far end of the tunnel the rats could drink a fluid from one of two drop dispensers which automatically recorded how much each rat drank one dispenser contained a morphine solution and the other plain tap water alexander designed a number of experiments to test the rats willingness to consume the morphine rats have a sweet tooth so in the seduction experiment the researchers exploited the rats apparent sweet tooth to test whether they could be enticed to consume morphine if the water was sweet enough morphine in solution has a bitter taste for humans and appears to have the same effect on rats alexander writes since they shake their heads and reject it as they do with bitter quinine solutions the seduction experiment involved four groups of rats group cc was isolated in laboratory cages when they were weaned at  days of age and lived there until the experiment ended at  days of age group pp was housed in rat park for the same period group cp was moved from laboratory cages to rat park at  days of age and group pc was moved out of rat park and into cages at  days of age the caged rats groups cc and pc took to the morphine instantly even with relatively little sweetener with the caged males drinking  times more morphine than the rat park males in one of the experimental conditions but no matter how sweet the morphine became the rats in rat park resisted it they would try it occasionally — with the females trying it more often than the males — but invariably they showed a preference for the plain water it was writes alexander a statistically significant finding he writes that the most interesting group was group cp the rats who were brought up in cages but moved to rat park before the experiment began these animals rejected the morphine solution when it was stronger but as it became sweeter and more dilute they began to drink almost as much as the rats that had lived in cages throughout the experiment they wanted the sweet water he concluded so long as it did not disrupt their normal social behavior even more significant he writes was that when he added a drug called naloxone which negates the effects of opioids to the morphinelaced water the rat park rats began to drink it in another experiment he forced rats in ordinary lab cages to consume morphine for  days on end giving them no liquid to drink other than the morphinelaced solution then moved them into rat park where he allowed them to choose between the morphine solution and plain water they drank the plain water he writes that they did show some signs of dependence but no sign of addiction there were some minor withdrawal signs twitching what have you but there were none of the mythic seizures and sweats you so often hear about  alexander believes his experiments show that animal selfadministration studies provide no empirical support for the theory of druginduced addiction and that the theory has no other strong basis in empirical science although it has not been disproven the intense appetite of isolated experimental animals for heroin and cocaine in selfinjection experiments tells us nothing about the responsiveness of normal animals and people to these drugs normal people can ignore heroin  even when it is plentiful in their environment and they can use these drugs with little likelihood of addiction  rats from rat park seem to be no less discriminating reaction to the experiment the two major science journals science and nature rejected alexanders first paper which was published in psychopharmacology a specialty journal several later studies did appear to confirm its findings — for example bozarth murray and wise in  also published in pharmacology biochemistry and behavior writer lauren slater alexanders daughterinlaw interviewed psychiatrist herbert kleber director of the substanceabuse division of the college of physicians and surgeons of columbia university and a former us deputy drug czar on what was wrong with rat park he replied that the experiment was ingenious but suggested that alexander may have distorted the data in the hope of provoking a public debate and that the study had methodological flaws though he did not state examples slater quotes kleber as saying he believes rat parks problem was that it was conducted in vancouver the scholarly equivalent of the tundra some further studies failed to reproduce the original experiments results but in at least one of these studies both caged and park rats showed a decreased preference for morphine suggesting a genetic difference in any case the publications did draw attention to the idea that the environment that laboratory animals live in might influence the outcome in experiments related to addiction as of update papers from the series of experiments have been cited more than  times and similar studies on the influence of living conditions on the consumption of other drugs have been published alexander was disappointed by the reception and still speaks of the experiments enthusiastically since  alexander has been exploring addiction in human beings by way of historical and anthropological studies of many cultures his newest book the globalization of addiction a study in poverty of the spirit argues that cultural dislocation of human beings instigates addictions of all sorts including addictions that do not involve drugs just as isolation instigates drug consumption in laboratory animals related research recent research has shown that an enriched environment may decrease morphine addiction in mice enriched environments also decrease deficits in animal models of parkinsons disease huntingtons disease and alzheimers disease in  a similar study found socially isolating adolescent rats caused high rates of alcohol and amphetamine addiction in adulthood and it took longer for the isolated rats to overcome the addiction see also lua error in packagelua at line  module moduleportalimagesother not found effect of

boing shop see all deals follow us twitter  facebook  rss this article from garry tan reminded me of the tremendous work of bruce k alexander a psychology professor who retired from teaching at simon fraser university in  i read alexanders first book peaceful measures canadas way out of the war on drugs when it was published in  and it had a profound effect on my outlook and critical thinking about drugs and the way that drug addiction is reported and discussed alexander is well known for his rat park experiment which hypothesized that heroinaddicted lab rats were being driven to drugs by the emisseration of life in a tiny cage tethered to a heroindispensing injection machine other experimenters had caged rats with heroininjecting apparatus and concluded that the rats compulsive use of the drug proved that their brains had been rewired by addiction a rat addicted to heroin is not rebelling against society is not a victim of socioeconomic circumstances is not a product of a dysfunctional family and is not a criminal the rats behavior is simply controlled by the action of heroin actually morphine to which heroin is converted in the body on its brain alexanders rat park was a rats paradise  spacious with plenty of intellectual stimulus and other rats to play with he moved heroinaddicted rats into the park and found that the compulsive behavior abated to the point of disappearance  in other words whatever rewiring had taken place could be unwired by the improvement of their living conditions alexanders work appears in drugs without the hot air one of the best books on drug policy ive ever read written by former uk drugs czar david nutt both men are scientists who make the case that the our drug policy is more the product of political grandstanding than scientific evidence the main conclusions of his experimental and historical research since  can be summarized as follows  drug addiction is only a small corner of the addiction problem most serious addictions do not involve either drugs or alcohol  addiction is more a social problem than an individual problem when socially integrated societies are fragmented by internal or external forces addiction of all sorts increases dramatically becoming almost universal in extremely fragmented societies  addiction arises in fragmented societies because people use it as a way of adapting to extreme social dislocation as a form of adaptation addiction is neither a disease that can be cured nor a moral error that can be corrected by punishment and education therefore the current nida model of addiction which alexander refers to as the official view is untenable contemporary world society can only overcome mass dislocation and addiction by restoring psychosocial integration on a political and social level this requires major social change alexander’s controversial conclusions have been celebrated by some mainstream sources outside the united states alexander received a  sterling prize for controversy in canada a  high commendation from the british medical association and an invitation to present at the royal society of arts and manufactures in london in  although all mainstream american sources have ignored alexander’s work it has acquired considerable recognition in outsider sources bruce k alexander wikipedia share  tweet   comments canada  drugs  health
