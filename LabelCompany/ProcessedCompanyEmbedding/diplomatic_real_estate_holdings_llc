forming an llc for real estate investments pros  cons by jeff weaver esq attorney forming an llc for real estate investments pros  cons by jeff weaver esq january  over the last decade limited liability companies llcs have become one of the most preferred forms of business entities through which to hold title to investment real estate properties llcs did not come into existence in the united states until  when the state of wyoming enacted special legislation to accommodate the needs of oil companies prior to llcs real estate investors seeking limited liability protection were largely limited to using corporations to acquire title—a form of entity that has potential drawbacks florida followed wyomings lead a few years later by enacting its own llc statute in  and now all 0 states have enacted legislation creating some form of the llc business structure the insulation from personal risk exposure for real estate investors provided by llcs coupled with the relative ease of administration and potential tax benefits make ownership of investment property through an llc a very desirable option in most instances llc vs liability insurance although there are many benefits to holding real property assets through an llc a limited liability company may not be the best holding vehicle for every property owner for many real estate investors the trouble of forming and maintaining a company isnt worth protection from the theoretical threat of a lawsuit particularly when affordable liability insurance is available that said real estate investors that rely solely on insurance as a means of protection from personal liability take a significant risk liability policies typically have limits exceptions and carveouts while the chance of a loss that exceeds policy limits may be remote if it happens the consequences can be devastating under current laws and market trends the popularity of real estate holding llcs is very likely to continue to increase as more and more property owners seek to take advantage of the benefits offered by this form of entity llcs limit personal liability first and foremost llcs limit personal vulnerability to potential lawsuits related to the property consider the situation in which the owner of an investment property leases it to a tenant who decides to throw a big party during which one of the tenants guests falls over a balcony in todays legal climate it is quite possible that the injured guest would pursue a claim based on the “unsafe condition” of the rental dwelling more often than not the owner would be named in any lawsuit resulting from the incident ready to form an llc legalzoom can help get started now if that rental property were owned by a real estate investor individually he or she would be named in the lawsuit and would have to defend his or her personal assets from the plaintiffs claims in contrast if that property were owned by an llc the owners risk exposure would be insulated by the protection of the company leaving only the assets owned by the llc as opposed to all of the owners personal assets exposed to potential lawsuits passthrough taxation for single  multimember llcs another advantage of an llc is the owners ability to enjoy the benefits of passthrough taxation in  the irs released revenue ruling  which declared that wyoming llcs would be taxed as partnerships even though they provide for corporatelike protection against liability c corporations in contrast are subject to double taxation—once at the corporate level and again when dividends are distributed to shareholders while the owners of corporations can achieve passthrough taxation by making an “s” election s corporations are subject to many other restrictions and requirements that limit their utility in the real estate investment realm the  revenue ruling was a true gamechanger because it enabled real estate investors to avoid double taxation by acquiring property through an llc while enjoying a liability shield under the default tax classification rules the irs classifies a real estate holding company with one owner as they would a sole proprietorship namely as a “disregarded entity” as a result income and capital gains from the llc pass through directly to the owner who would only have to pay taxes as an individual while still enjoying the protections offered by the llc liability shield since there is no separate llc tax the owner can avoid double taxation on both the rental income generated by the property and the appreciation in value of the property upon disposition moreover the owner of a singlemember llc can deduct mortgage interest similar to a sole proprietor based on current irs rules real estate holding companies that have several owners are known as “multimember” llcs and are generally taxed by the irs like partnerships meaning that the llc files an “informational” tax return but does not actually pay taxes itself multimember llcs also enjoy the benefits of passthrough taxation as the llc passes its profits and losses through to its members who report their portion of the llcs business income or losses on either a schedule c k or form  with their individual income tax returns this means that both single member and multimember llcs offer the benefits of passthrough taxation of profits and losses and limited liability and personal protection for the owners llcs can make business life easier llcs offer numerous other general benefits relative to other entity forms that arent necessarily unique to—but certainly apply to—the use of llcs to hold real estate investments when delegating management responsibilities llcs enjoy much greater flexibility than either a corporation or partnership while corporations are statutorily required to have officers and directors the llc can be easily managed by its owners or thirdparty managers in the many states that impose increased fees based on the authorized number of shares llcs may pay lower state registration and maintenance fees than corporations owners of llcs can take advantage of the tremendous flexibility in the distribution of profits as determined by the llcs operating agreement cash flow distributions do not have to be pro rata according to ownership like an s corporation which gives the owners the ability to financially reward the “sweat equity” effort of select members through appropriate distributions of available cash flow unlike an s corporation foreign ownership and investment in us real estate is possible through an llc llc owners can also easily transfer their ownership in real estate holdings by proactively gifting the companys membership interests to their heirs each year over time it is entirely possible to effectively pass ownership of real estate owned by an llc to loved ones without ever having to formally execute and record a new deed this enables property owners to avoid transfer and recording taxes and fees which can be substantial in many states although not every company will seek these particular benefits its safe to say that llcs can offer steep rewards to companies that choose to take advantage of them explore your options many business owners choose to form an llc because they are unfamiliar with the many legal nuances between different entity choices and they simply assume that an llc offers the most protection from risk because it has “limited liability” in its name in reality a properly formed and operated llc does indeed limit the personal liability of the owners as much as us law allows by affording the owners no personal risk above and beyond their investment in the company—but in many instances so do corporations and certain partnerships of course if a small business owner of any entity form fails to respect the separate and distinct identity of the business or observe statutorily required corporate formalities such as comingling personal and business funds paying owners instead of creditors or failing to maintain a registered agent the integrity of the corporate shield provided by law will be compromised and potentially expose the owners to personal liability generally speaking though the basic requirements to operate an llc within the confines of the corporate statutes are not particularly onerous minimize risks with the right strategy there is simply no way to eliminate all the risks associated with starting a real estate investment business but you can easily improve your chances of success by complying with the corporate formalities required by applicable laws even though these steps may seem tedious and somewhat confusing if you are in the market for investment real estate you should at least consider whether or not the acquisition through an llc is the right choice for you if so it is much easier to purchase the property through the llc to begin with as opposed to trying to transfer the real estate to an entity at a later date where a lender might have to consent to the transaction an llc may not offer any more or less protection from outside lawsuits than a properly formed and operated corporation or limited liability partnership but it does offer many other advantages that make it the most desirable form of entity in many cases particularly with respect to real estate holding companies if youre considering forming an llc for
