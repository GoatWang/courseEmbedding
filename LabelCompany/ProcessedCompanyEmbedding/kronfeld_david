morris and corbin each contributed in his own way to my professional development three men all highly influential in the field of pet nutrition passed away over the course of only the last few months im not a believer in the adage bad things come in threes however that old saying appears true in this case three men all highly influential in the field of pet nutrition passed away over the course of only the last few months i knew all of them personally and each contributed in their own way to my professional development ill miss them greatly dr james e corbin i didnt have the fortune to meet dr corbin until the early s when i asked him to serve on the association of american feed control officials canine nutrition expert subcommittee as well as subsequently the feline nutrition expert subcommittee at that time i believe he had already retired from the university of illinois after a long distinguished career in both industry and academia however that never slowed him down for many years after he continued to be a notable presence at many industry meetings including petfood forumin my experience dr corbin always had a kind word for everyone his propensity for compliments of others was matched by his enthusiasm for and interest in the field of pet nutrition his face had a perpetual grin and when asked things were always terrific despite our age differences and personal familiarity he insisted on addressing me by title although at the same time in a most friendly manner ie doctor davea summary of dr corbins life and career  dr david s kronfeld dr kronfeld may not be as familiar as the other two within the petfood industry but he was a virtual giant in the field of veterinary nutrition he was one of only  charter diplomates in the american college of veterinary nutrition acvn when it was formed in the late smuch of dr kronfelds work in later years at virginia tech focused on equine nutrition but his contributions to the field of canine nutrition especially in regard to the feeding of sled dogs cannot be underestimated to borrow from an old country western song he was low carb when low carb wasnt coolhis frequent participation in many discussions on both the acvn and american academy of veterinary nutrition email listserves speaks to his knowledge on a vast array of nutrition topicsone of my clearest memories of dr kronfeld was a time when we were eating lunch together with a few other colleagues at a veterinary meeting i was a mere graduate student and eager to learn however of all the potential topics we could have talked about our discussion kept going back to whose menu choice was better his or mine while i didnt appreciate it at the time he was really engaging me in the socratic method of learning this means of critical thinking through dialogue has proven helpful to me through the years regardless of subject mattermore information about dr kronfelds life and contributions to the field may be found here dr mark l morris jr dr morris along with his father dr mark morris sr may be best known for the introduction and development of hills prescription diets one of the first lines of veterinary medical petfoods that remain popular to this day as another acvn charter diplomate he was a frequent guest speaker at veterinary schools which is where i first met him his knowledge of and passion for the subject was instrumental in my decision to pursue a career in veterinary nutritiondespite his preeminence in the field i remember dr morris as approachable eager to help and humble i recall only a few years ago when the national research council committee on dog and cat nutrition held one of its work sessions at a location where coincidentally dr morris was being honored for his longtime contributions to veterinary medicine other committee members and i attended the function to add our accolades but dr morris turned the tables instead of just receiving his due praise he shared the spotlight and asked us also to stand for

meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev ivca profile qa david kronfeld founder of jkb capital on his recent trip to russia meeting with russian president dmitry medvedevjuly  chicago  “ david kronfeld founder of jkb capital has been at the forefront of this quandary recently when he participated in a delegation last month that sent  leaders from top vc firms to russia while there they met with business legal entrepreneurial and government officials including the current russian president dmitry medvedev the ivca got the opportunity to interview mr kronfeld as he debriefed on his visit and analyzed the business prospects for private investments in highgrowth companies in russia today ivca what is the background of the initiative for this russian trip david kronfeld this was an historical trip a firstofitskind sponsored at very high levels it stems from a recognition that started all the way at the top of russia both with former russian president putin and current president medvedev giving it personal leadership it started with the recognition that russia is a rich country but its economic success is from natural resources oil gas and agricultural but from a technological standpoint russia is substantially behind developed countries the leadership believes that russia cannot be a successful country in the future without bridging this technological gap with that conclusion president medvedev took it upon himself to start what he refers to as the  ˜era of innovation for russia he wants to establish a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in russia medvedev wants the private sector to advance this innovation culture and he basically wants to replicate in russia what happened in silicon valley what happened in israel and what is happening in china india and singapore in russia he wants to create this through both culture and physical infrastructures ivca what was the purpose for inviting venture capitalists to this particular event dk the trip had a dual purpose first to solicit whatever advice or observations we may have to help russia transition into the cycle of innovation and the other purpose was to convince us that russia is a very attractive place at this point to make venture capital investments russia recognizes that they do not have the venture capital knowhow that we have how do you take basic research and development for example and convert it into a commercialized product additionally they need our involvement in terms of both expertise and capital ivca you expressed some specific goals that the russian leadership had for these meetings in your opinion were those goals met dk yes i believe so there were several things that became very clear first russia has taken substantial steps to do  “ from a public policy standpoint  “ what the country needed to make it more attractive for outside venture capital the flow of capital is unburdened and tax rates are very low capital gains are at nine percent income tax is at thirteen percent these public policies are better than what exists in china for example in china there still are restrictions on who can own things in the country ivca one russian fund advisor was quoted as saying the members of the delegation are coming not just as investors but as role models what are the main lessons a group of vc funds from america can teach a business culture like russia dk i think russia is a very strong country in terms of engineering scientific talent and a very high standard of education weve seen what russians can do in israel around a million and a half russians emigrated to israel many were doctors engineers physicists nuclear scientists etc as soon as they were put in an environment that fostered entrepreneurship they flourished those russians are for the large part responsible for the increased technological innovation in israel so what russia can learn from us is that they have wonderful talent to do basic research they dont have understanding  “ because everything was formerly owned by the government  “ of how to commercialize technology so it fits a market need and how to build a company around that and how to make it successful this is a dimension that they dont have inhouse right now and they view this dimension as valuable this is why they are looking for us to come in and do business with them ivca given the current economic infrastructure in russia what are the great opportunities now especially in your field of expertise in tech dk the opportunities are considerable and across the board but the business model that can best work for american venture capital is the exact same business model that weve seen work in israel you have the basic rd in russia but then you create a company that can take the technology and sell it in global markets i believe that any entity in russia can also find a market in russia itself that could be attractive but the russian market as a whole is not ready for a very sophisticated level of technology however there is a good lower tech potential for local markets if its high tech it would have to be sold globally again the business model that worked for israel will probably be the best business model for russia ivca you spoke of a less restrictive ownership and tax structure in russia now do you see any other restrictions in russia that might make outside venture capital difficult dk there are no restrictions that i see on a governmental policy level however there are other issues that are not driven by policy they are not minor and definitely need to be considered first just like in china there is not a very good legal system in place this can make you nervous at the same time they have a tremendous amount of bureaucracy and corruption at all levels this is definitely a problem in russia it is even more prevalent than china in china the common wisdom was to get around these problems you had to have very good contacts and local partners this is true in russia as well not so much about the contacts but you need a local partner who knows how to avoid the pitfalls the last thing is about what happened in the s many people invested a lot of money in russia and it turned very sour with a lot of bad experiences it was due mostly to an economic recession and crime especially with the russian mafia muscling in i think some of those issues still linger some of the corruption is still very strong so against that background even though the government is creating the right policies and is headed in the right direction in the trenches it may work a little differently the real challenge for the government is to ensure that these new policies translate to real behavior across the board ivca what are the age demographics of the current russian tech entrepreneur what generally did you find to be their backgrounds dk what is being fostered now in russia from what we were able to determine is what you would expect most of the tech entrepreneurship is centered around the internet for simple reasons  “ it requires less  ˜brick and mortar has very few barriers to entry and it doesnt matter physically where you are located they actually created some very successful companies the age of the guys who use the internet as a basis to launch companies is very young similar to what you would find here its people who have just finished college or a little thereafter between the ages of  if its not in the internet space then the next level you see is in the typical well educated scientist physicist and mathematician they are older with more knowledge and experience but the people who really drive the concept of entrepreneurship and who have the drive to try something or take the risk are the younger generation people who come out of the better universities the universities that have a world reputation for quality these entrepreneurs tend to come from the elite schools ivca you talked about the technological and economic aspirations of current russian president dmitry medvedev in regard to meeting with your delegation what was your impression of him as an individual dk i was very impressed he is young in spirit and vision he is a very sharp guy very engaging and very pragmatic i was amazed by the level of pragmatism that i saw in how he viewed what he is trying to do why hes trying to do it and the challenges he is facing ivca what are the main themes or conclusions that came out of these meetings dk i think russia is at an inflection point now i believe that over time russia will become a high technology center just because they have the brain power the creativity and now they have the government behind it its inconceivable to think that the country will not get there over time the question is not if but when in regard to  ˜when russia is probably where china was five or six years ago at that time when we looked at china we saw all the problems the difficulties and tended to shy away now everybody wants to be there those who were there early on had the first mover advantage and i believe that in russia today it is the same situation would i say go in and invest hundreds of millions of dollars in venture startups indiscriminately i would place a very high caution on that but do i believe there are ventures to cherrypick that are wonderful opportunities and that to get in now to obtain a first mover advantage so when the market grows you grow with it is a good idea the answer is yes ive seen enough to convince me that this kind of a scenario might make a lot of sense   powered by memberclicks kronfeld david a new york ny   cortera company profile cortera business directory create account login developers search cortera for a

info on how monsanto protects itself from product liability     how can monsanto risk an experiment on the milk supply of the american public if widespread harm should occur might not the company be liable for billions of dollars in damages and possible bankruptcy luckily for monsanto and others similarly situated recent court rulings have provided safe shelter for corporations whose consumer products result in massive litigation the new corporate shelter was invented by judge jack weinstein in the case of vietnam veterans seeking damages from dow diamond shamrock monsanto and other companies that produced agent orange agent orange was an herbicide used in vietnam to defoliate jungles many american troops exposed to the chemical during the war say they and their children were harmed the national academy of sciences and the veterans administration in  said the vets were harmed  the courts allowed the companies to settle with some of the plaintiffs for a fixed amount with the stipulation that no future lawsuits can be brought against the agent orange manufacturers even by people who werent party to todays settlement because they did not know they had been harmed in future if a person develops a disease they believe was caused by agent orange they cannot sue  their constitutional right to due process was extinguished by the original settlement this is exceptionally important because litigation typically proceeds in stages as we saw in the case of asbestos each new lawsuit brings forth more evidence of what a company knew when jury awards and penalties increase as a companys deceptions and coverups are progressively revealed the first plaintiffs may fail completely but the th or th may be awarded many millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages as the courts see and then punish companies for a pattern of unethical behavior the new legal doctrine cuts off the possibility of a series of suits against a company thus providing almost complete protection against suits that might cause bankruptcy this new legal doctrine has recently been used to limit the liabilities of companies that marketed silicone breast implants it is a creative legal invention which sharply limits the liability of corporations that market possiblyharmful products that have not been fully tested for safety recently more than  million vietnam veterans asked the us supreme court to review this new legal doctrine on the ground that their constitutional rights had been taken from them the attorney generals of all  states joined with the vets asking the supreme court to review this new doctrine  the supreme court refused and that is one reason why companies are willing to risk exposing the general public to drugs in their food
