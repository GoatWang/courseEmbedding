markets in which we operate is strengthening or declining a ratio of greater than one is indicative of improving market demand while a ratio of less than one would suggest weakening demand in addition we believe the booktobill ratio provides more meaningful insight into future revenues for our business than other measures such as order backlog because the majority of our products are activity based
