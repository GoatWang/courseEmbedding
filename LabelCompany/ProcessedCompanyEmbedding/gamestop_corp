gutted this means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter one copy is opened so the case can be put on display with the game disc filed separately behind the counter

it is sold at regular price gamestops checkout policy allows employees to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days with the intent being to allow the employee to

products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies used games marketedit gamestop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles by reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game it is argued that gamestop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue in effect this means that companies such as gamestop can resell used copies of a game within days of the titles release and keep all of the profit thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers it has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games fingerprint identificationedit it was revealed in early august  that gamestop was required by the pennsylvania state police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at philadelphia gamestop locations the policy had been in place since early july of that year and did not apply to the

were replaced by sister company thinkgeek criticismedit opened copies of game titlesedit the company has a policy where some copies of new games upon release are gutted this means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter one copy is opened so the case can be put on display with the game disc filed separately behind the counter consumers may reach for the opened copy and purchase at the counter whereupon the consumer will receive a factorysealed copy from behind the counter if the opened copy is the last copy of the new game it is sold at regular price gamestops checkout policy allows employees to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days with the intent being to allow the employee to evaluate the game and learn about its content this check out policy does not apply to only used merchandise which has been a hotly contested practice among the community gamestop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of deus ex human revolution gamestop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of deus ex human revolution on onlive a cloud gaming service gamestop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its subsidiaries spawn labs and impulse which it had acquired in april  later gamestop entirely removed the pc version of deus ex human revolution from its stores square enix the publisher of deus ex said that it respects the right of gamestop to have final say over the contents of products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies used games marketedit gamestop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles by reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game it is argued that gamestop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue in effect this means that companies such as gamestop can resell used copies of a game within days of the titles release and keep all of the profit thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers it has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games fingerprint identificationedit it was revealed in early august  that gamestop was required by the pennsylvania state police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at philadelphia gamestop locations the policy had been in place since early july of that year and did not apply to the suburban areas of philadelphia this caused some heavy criticism from video gamers living in the affected area pennsylvania state police in philadelphia asserted that the fingerprint identification would help track thieves by august   the policy had been reversed in all philadelphiaarea gamestop stores circle of life policyedit in february  it was revealed that gamestop enforced on all of its retail employees a program known as circle of life the policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allot a certain percentage of their sales to preorders rewards cards used games or have a customer trade in a game upon revelation of the policy many gamestop employees including current and former brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress later into the month gamestop reformed the program to solely focus on the store as a whole instead of the previous individual employee basis see alsoedit

company has a policy where some copies of new games upon release are gutted this means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter one copy is opened so the case can be put on display with the game disc filed separately behind the counter consumers may reach for the opened copy and purchase at the counter whereupon the consumer will receive a factorysealed copy from behind the counter if the opened copy is the last copy of the new game it is sold at regular price gamestops checkout policy allows employees to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days with the intent being to allow the employee to evaluate the game and learn about its content this check out policy does not apply to only used merchandise which has been a hotly contested practice among the community gamestop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of deus ex human revolution gamestop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of deus ex human revolution on onlive a cloud gaming service gamestop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its

that it respects the right of gamestop to have final say over the contents of products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies used games marketedit gamestop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles by reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game it is argued that gamestop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue in effect this means that companies such as gamestop can resell used copies of a game within days of the titles release and keep all of the profit thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers it has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games fingerprint identificationedit it was revealed in early august  that gamestop was required by the pennsylvania state police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at philadelphia gamestop locations the policy had been in place since early july of that year and did not apply to the suburban areas of philadelphia this caused some heavy criticism from video gamers living in the affected area pennsylvania state police

february  it was revealed that gamestop enforced on all of its retail employees a program known as circle of life the policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allot a certain percentage of their sales to preorders rewards cards used games or have a customer trade in a game upon revelation of the policy many gamestop employees including current and former brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress later into the month gamestop reformed the

next blockbusterjun  about gamestop corp gme jozef bystricky value deep value long only longterm horizonsummaryinvestors fear that gamestop corp will become the next blockbuster and eventually bankruptthere are important distinctions between blockbuster and gamestop that may result in the company’s survivalthe technology is not there yet that would allow such a swift transformation of the industryin the meantime the company is shifting away from being a physical product seller to being diversified gaming specialty omnichannel retailerand so the company may be a good value play at these levelsinvestors fear that gamestop corp nysegme will become the next blockbuster and so the pessimism results in very depressed valuation the company currently trades at multiples of  price to forward earnings and  price to free cash flow that is very cheap and therefore grabbed my attention to research the company truthfully the whole brick and mortar industry is undergoing structural change of digitization in addition investor fears are amplified by the technological advancement of the cloud business and so there are many similarities that resemble the blockbuster story but there are also crucial distinctions before making an investment decision one needs to evaluate these similarities and differences hence i provide my analysis industry challenges gamestop corp is doing business in one of the most challenging industries these days the industry is facing a disruption from change in consumer behavior towards digital purchases in addition the industry is challenged by technological advance where physical products are disappearing from the market in the favor of the cloud these are the exact challenges that blockbuster was facing a couple of years ago and so the investors pain from that investment is still fresh similarly gamestop corp is challenged by amazon nasdaqamzn the same way as blockbuster was challenged years ago amazon provided an alternative to selling physical dvds already in  and so blockbuster renting business was challenged by dvds being cheaper and comfortable to buy online compared to renting however this was hardly the reason why the company went out of business had that been the case the companies such as barnes  noble nysebks specializing on selling books would already have ceased to exist and even nowadays barnes  noble is cashflow positive and owns more than  physical stores the company was able to adapt to changing behavior and technological advancement and stayed profitable even in this environment source barnes  noble inc k  therefore judging from the survival in the book retailers the specialized retailer focused on gaming may be able to survive as well in addition i would tend to think the overall market for books is rather a declining business compared to the booming gaming industry hence the probability of surviving the amazon challenge could be quite high the direct competitor however netflix nasdaqnflx became a more significant threat to blockbuster than amazon first the company started offering dvd rentals business with much higher customer satisfaction and home delivery also the subscription services and no late delivery fees quickly stole customers from blockbuster and so blockbuster started losing money from  and was never able to recover it is important to say that netflix started offering a streaming service only in  source business insider therefore blockbuster was not a victim of technological disruption but a victim of the inability to compete in a competitive environment yes netflixs success story can be replicated in the gaming market as well but at the moment there is not a company that would offer such services it would need to be a company that has a platform with most of the games available and could be played on the cloud the cost for storing and owning such games are much higher than in the dvd business in addition there are more platforms that compete with each other and finally the platform would need to be customized and allow each user to save data i dont think the technology is there yet that would offer all of those options and so this is not a direct threat yet cloud however there is another threat that the industry is facing investors see the future in the cloud perhaps  years from now there will be no need to have a physical copy and everything would be downloadable from cloud the management made a counterargument that one dvd can have around gb whereas one game can be gb and more therefore the obstacle to store is  times higher and the download time is  times longer which is a bit uncomfortable for the customers source gamestop corp investors day presentation nevertheless the technology is advancing and perhaps in a couple of years from now the games will be either available on the platform or quickly downloadable from the cloud in the meantime because of technological progress the company may diversify enough that it will not depend on physical sales diversification the management expects to have  of operating income from nonphysical products by  source gamestop corp investors day presentation this translates to m to m of operating earnings which is just enough to cover capital expenditures in the amount of m to m taxes in the amount of m and partial dividend payments in the amount of m in addition to that there is still an upside from selling the physical products such as new consoles and equipment outlook there is a high anticipation of new consoles and gadgets coming in the market that may provide a further boost to the earnings management and analysts outlook for next year earnings translates to approximately m to m in free cash for the company using m shares outstanding this will result in free cash at  to  per share source financeyahoocom source gamestop corp q  earnings release and so the company trades at    times future free cash in my point of view this is very depressed valuation and so i am willing to bet on a possible recovery stemming from higher diversification of revenue streams and new consoles coming in the market therefore the expected performance does not resemble the blockbuster story in addition gamestop corp is highly profitable historical performance i know the historical performance is not an indication of the future performance but it gives us an indication of how well the management was managing the company in the past and in my point of view the results were outstanding the company was able to operate every year with operating margin between  and  and it is still projecting this profitability with flat revenues going forward source gamestop corp ks the free cash flow is enough to cover capital expenditures dividend payments and reinvestment into the business which is a sign of a healthy business source gamestop corp  k also the balance sheet is sound with very low debt compared to ebitda therefore gamestop corp may actually be a sound investment at these levels takeaway my conclusion is that the company operates in a very challenging industry but every company now faces a disruption from advancement in the technology across the whole brickandmortar retailers as well as car manufacturers in my point of view the company has plenty of time to diversify from the challenges and it is on the right track of doing that therefore my conclusion is that it will not end up with the same destiny as blockbuster disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in gme over the next  hours i wrote this article myself

ages rains explained looking at  technology brands and collectibles are expected to generate another year of strong growth and new hardware innovation in the video game category looks promising looking forward rains and his executive team plan to keep emphasizing the retailers healthy business lines this year while cutting costs and trimming down its portfolio of stores to that end they see the tech brands segment growing by  to at least  million in  overall revenue is projected to be flat to mark a solid improvement over this past years  drop net income will likely end between  million and  million which would be a second straight year of declines following s record  million haul that result would leave the  dividend yield well covered at less than  of earnings but whether the company reaches that  million profit mark again will depend on the severity of the pullback in physical game retailing and on gamestops ability to take advantage of complementary selling opportunities like the consumer products and collectibles segments that have protected profitability as its core industry shrinks either way it promises to be a bumpy ride for shareholders in announcing its plan to

recently vacated simply mac locations were replaced by sister company thinkgeek criticismedit opened copies of game titlesedit the company has a policy where some copies of new games upon release are gutted this means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter one copy is opened so the case can be put on display with the game disc filed separately behind the counter consumers may reach for the opened copy and purchase at the counter whereupon the consumer will receive a factorysealed copy from behind the counter if the opened copy is the last copy of the new game it is sold at regular price gamestops checkout policy allows employees to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days with the intent being to allow the employee to

products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies used games marketedit gamestop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles by reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game it is argued that gamestop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue in effect this means that companies such as gamestop can resell used copies of a game within days of the titles release and keep all of the profit thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers it has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games fingerprint identificationedit it was revealed in early august  that gamestop was required by the pennsylvania state police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at philadelphia gamestop locations the policy had been in place since early july of that year and did not apply to the

would help track thieves by august   the policy had been reversed in all philadelphiaarea gamestop stores circle of life policyedit in february  it was revealed that gamestop enforced on all of its retail employees a program known as circle of life the policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allot a certain percentage of their sales to preorders rewards cards used games or have a customer trade in a game upon revelation of the policy many gamestop employees including current and former brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress later into the month gamestop reformed the program to solely focus on the store as a whole instead of the previous

company has a policy where some copies of new games upon release are gutted this means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter one copy is opened so the case can be put on display with the game disc filed separately behind the counter consumers may reach for the opened copy and purchase at the counter whereupon the consumer will receive a factorysealed copy from behind the counter if the opened copy is the last copy of the new game it is sold at regular price gamestops checkout policy allows employees to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days with the intent being to allow the employee to evaluate the game and learn about its content this check out policy does not apply to only used merchandise which has been a hotly contested practice among the community gamestop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of deus ex human revolution gamestop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of deus ex human revolution on onlive a cloud gaming service gamestop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its

that it respects the right of gamestop to have final say over the contents of products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies used games marketedit gamestop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles by reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game it is argued that gamestop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue in effect this means that companies such as gamestop can resell used copies of a game within days of the titles release and keep all of the profit thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers it has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games fingerprint identificationedit it was revealed in early august  that gamestop was required by the pennsylvania state police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at philadelphia gamestop locations the policy had been in place since early july of that year and did not apply to the suburban areas of philadelphia this caused some heavy criticism from video gamers living in the affected area pennsylvania state police in philadelphia asserted that the fingerprint identification would help track thieves by august   the policy had been reversed in all philadelphiaarea gamestop stores circle of life policyedit in february  it was revealed that gamestop enforced on all of its retail employees a program known as circle of life the policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allot a certain percentage of their sales to preorders rewards cards used games or have a customer trade in a game upon revelation of the policy many gamestop employees including current and former brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress later into the month gamestop reformed the

company has a policy where some copies of new games upon release are gutted this means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter one copy is opened so the case can be put on display with the game disc filed separately behind the counter consumers may reach for the opened copy and purchase at the counter whereupon the consumer will receive a factorysealed copy from behind the counter if the opened copy is the last copy of the new game it is sold at regular price gamestops checkout policy allows employees to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days with the intent being to allow the employee to evaluate the game and learn about its content this check out policy does not apply to only used merchandise which has been a hotly contested practice among the community gamestop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of deus ex human revolution gamestop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of deus ex human revolution on onlive a cloud gaming service gamestop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its

that it respects the right of gamestop to have final say over the contents of products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies used games marketedit gamestop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles by reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game it is argued that gamestop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue in effect this means that companies such as gamestop can resell used copies of a game within days of the titles release and keep all of the profit thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers it has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games fingerprint identificationedit it was revealed in early august  that gamestop was required by the pennsylvania state police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at philadelphia gamestop locations the policy had been in place since early july of that year and did not apply to the suburban areas of philadelphia this caused some heavy criticism from video gamers living in the affected area pennsylvania state police in philadelphia asserted that the fingerprint identification would help track thieves by august   the policy had been reversed in all philadelphiaarea gamestop stores circle of life policyedit in february  it was revealed that gamestop enforced on all of its retail employees a program known as circle of life the policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allot a certain percentage of their sales to preorders rewards cards used games or have a customer trade in a game upon revelation of the policy many gamestop employees including current and former brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress later into the month gamestop reformed the
