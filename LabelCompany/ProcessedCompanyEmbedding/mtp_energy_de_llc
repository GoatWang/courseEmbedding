tax do i need to submit anything else with my payment is my franchise tax the same as my annual registered agent fee what do i do after paying my franchise tax what is delaware franchise tax the franchise tax is the fee imposed by the state of delaware for the right or privilege to own a delaware company the tax has no bearing on income or company activity—it is simply required by the state of delaware to maintain the good standing status of your company   the term franchise tax does not imply that your company is a franchise business  when is it due the due date of your tax varies depending on your company type   the franchise tax for a corporation is due by march  of every year if the tax is not paid on or before march  the state imposes a  late penalty plus a monthly interest fee of  percent   the franchise tax for a delaware llc is due by june  of every year the limited partnership lp franchise tax is also due by june  of every year if the tax is not paid on or before june  the state imposes a  late penalty plus a monthly interest fee of  percent   corporations llcs and lps are taxed in arrears meaning the tax due by each due date is for the previous calendar year how do i calculate my franchise tax the franchise tax for a delaware limited liability company llc or delaware limited partnership lp is a flat annual rate of  as of july     the franchise tax for a corporation is a little more complicated it is based on your corporation type and the number of authorized shares your company has the total cost of the franchise tax is comprised of an annual report fee and the actual tax due   a nonstocknonprofit company is considered exempt with the state of delaware this type of company does not pay the annual tax but must file and pay the annual report fee the annual report fee is  per year   a corporation having  authorized shares or less is considered a minimum stock corporation the annual report fee is  and the tax is  as of july   for a total of  per year   a corporation having  authorized shares or more is considered a maximum stock corporation the annual report fee is  and the tax would be somewhere between  and  per year   there are two methods to calculate a maximum stock companys franchise tax they are the authorized shares method   the state of delaware uses this method to initially calculate your taxes this method is calculated based on the number of authorized shares the calculation is as follows  shares or less  as of july      shares  as of july   additional  shares or portion thereof add  the maximum annual tax is    dont forget to add the  annual report fee to the franchise tax after it is calculated   the assumed par value capital method the state of delaware allows you to pay the lower of the two calculation methods therefore if you receive a bill from delaware for tens of thousands of dollars it may be in your best interest to try calculating your franchise tax with the assumed par value capital method   in order to utilize this filing method you will need to provide the companys total gross assets as reported on the form  schedule l and the total number of issued shares many times the tax is then calculated to the minimum payment of  franchise tax plus the  annual report fee   the calculation used for this method is more complex please contact our office if you would like a copy of the calculation emailed to you we will be happy to help you with this calculation how do i pay my franchise tax we make it easy to pay your franchise tax online   as your registered agentwe will send you

llc start your delaware llc in  simple steps the state of delaware is home to half of all public and fortune  companies but that doesn’t mean that small businesses miss out on all its big benefits as the most popular business entity the llc offers delawarebased owners many tax advantages and asset protections in a state heralded for its strong case law first however it’s vital to know the legal side of getting your business off the ground here’s how to form an llc in the diamond state step one choosing your llc’s name the first step in starting a new llc in delaware is to choose a name your new delaware llc’s name must be sufficiently different for people to tell it apart from other business entities already on file registered and reserved with the state of delaware is the name you want available you can do a name search at the delaware division of corporations the llc’s name must include at its end “limited liability company” “llc” or “llc” the llc name is allowed however to contain the name of a member or manager as well as one of the following terms “company” “association” “club” “foundation” “fund” “institute” “society” “union” “syndicate” “limited” or “trust” or abbreviations of the same step two creating your articles of organization after your delaware llc is named you must write your articles of organization and file a certificate of formation with the delaware secretary of state along with a  filing fee incfile canprovide these services for you the certificate must be executed signed by one or more authorized persons as laid out in the llc operating agreement organizers may be either natural persons or legal entities and there must be at least one organizer the certificate of formation for your new delaware llc must include the following information the llc’s name the name and street address of the llc’s resident agent see below for delaware’s rules for registered agents the duration of the llc either perpetual or for a set amount of time the certificate may also include other items that the members wish to include as long as they don’t conflict with state law even if they are also included in the operating agreement delaware registered agent rules all delaware llcs are required to have a registered instate agent this agent is the person or office designated to receive official state correspondence including notice if the llc is served with a lawsuit a registered agent in delaware may be an individual state resident a domestic corporation limited partnership llc or statutory trust or a foreign corporation limited partnership or llc authorized to do business in the state of delaware the registered office may be but is not required to be the llc’s place of business the registered agent must have a business office identical to the registered office which should generally be open during normal business hours incfile offers registered agent service for your delaware llc if needed your llc is officially “organized” once the signed original of the certificate of formation is received by the secretary of state’s office and is determined to be in compliance with state requirements step three writing your operating agreement almost as critical for the llc as the certificate of formation and articles of incorporation is the operating agreement there isn’t an official state requirement to have an operating agreement but it’s a vital internal document that specifies how your llc will operate on both the daytoday and strategic levels if there is more than one member the operating agreement must initially be approved unanimously in writing by the members the operating agreement should list the llc’s members see below for how membership works specify how much each member has invested explain how profits will be divided state how much proportional “weight” each member has when issues are voted upon unless the certificate of formation or the operating agreement say otherwise voting power in a membermanaged llc is vested in each member according to his or her current capital account balance with the llc the operating agreement may also set forth meeting requirements such as the amount of required notice what constitutes a quorum voting rules and so on but they are not necessary most operating agreement list requirements for the llc that are already listed in delaware state law and regulations it can also include such items as restrictions or constraints on the power of the members to adopt amend or repeal the operating agreement unless the certificate of formation or the operating agreement itself state otherwise unanimous consent of the llc’s membership is required to amend the operating agreement how membership works in a delaware llc an llc is required to have at least one member members may become a member of or acquire an interest in the llc when it is first started or when the new member’s admission is recorded in the llc’s records to join the llc the prospective member usually needs to make some kind of contribution — for example pay cash or transfer property to the llc — or undertake a binding obligation to do so a member can only resign from the llc in a manner allowed by the certificate of formation andor the operating agreement one or both of these documents will also usually state the minimum amount of time a member can maintain membership before being allowed to resign when a member resigns he or she is entitled to receive the fair value of the membership interest within a reasonable time after the resignation unless of course either the certificate of formation or operating agreement specify otherwise if the resignation or withdrawal of a member violates the provisions in the operating agreement then the amount payable to the former member is the fair market value of his interest reduced by the amount of damages sustained by the llc or its other members as a result of the violation in this case the llc may also defer the payment for as long as needed to prevent unreasonable hardship to the organization delaware’s ongoing requirements and taxes compared to many other states delaware has minimal reporting and disclosure

vote to dissolve unless a certain percentage or proportion is stated in the certificate of formation or operating agreement an event that makes it unlawful for the llc to continue the llc’s duration
