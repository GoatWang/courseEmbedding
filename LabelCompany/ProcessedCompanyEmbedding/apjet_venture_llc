selwyn conducts product quality assurance on dualfunctional plasmatreated fabric at apjets santa fe lab lanl technology may transform performance apparelcontact  ceojohn emrich  future applications of apjet may include depositing thin films for architectural glass semiconductors flooring and solar panels a big part of our current challenge has been selecting this one use for the technology and putting all of our energy and resources into that selwyn said a new way to stay dry apjet is revolutionizing the textile industry with new plasma technology gary selwyn first used plasma technology for textile finishing applications while employed at los alamos national laboratory today as chairman and chief technology officer of affiliated plasma jet technologies inc apjet a privately held small company based in santa fe new mexico he is revolutionizing the textile industry apjet executed an exclusive license in  for all fields of use involving the atmospheric pressure plasma jet appj®technology the licensed appj technology is a broadbased platform technology consisting of several different apparatus and methods patents on the use of different applications and designs of plasma sources for generating and using a low temperature highly reactive plasma for materials processing applications the most advanced application of apjet’s technology is for treating fabric with atmosphericpressure plasma so that it becomes “dualfunctional” repelling oil and water on the outside while retaining its original qualities and comfort on the inside this is ideal for outdoor sports apparel apjet’s targetmarket apjet uses its proprietary atmospheric pressure plasma technology to apply to fibers a nanometerthin polymeric film that enables fabric to repel water and stains without changing its feel or appearance by combining electrical power with a selected gas the ionization process that occurs in the plasma produces active gasphase chemicals that bond to the surface of the fabric producing unique properties we use atmospheric plasma to chemically modify textiles such as polyester to make them wick water better than cotton by bonding atomic oxygen to the surface he said it breathes well feels great against the body and with a different plasma we make the outer surface rain resistant all properties essential for outdoor performance clothing apjets dualfunctional finish trade named aptex® is about to go to market and unlike traditional wet processing of fabrics the plasma process is green in that it produces no waste and uses little energy after launching apjet received a  venture accelerationfund award from lans the funding helped complete the design and engineering of a commercialscale production unit for apjet the fullscale prototype attracted new private equity financing and two strategic partnerships one with a productionand equipment services company and another with north carolina state college of textiles which provides apjet with a showcase and limited testing facility apjet stands for “affiliated plasma jet technologies”indicating an intention to spin off other affiliates in the near future today apjet is expanding its
