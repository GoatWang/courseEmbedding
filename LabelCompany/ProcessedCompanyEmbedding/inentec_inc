inentec  clean planet technologies select page     today’s waste … tomorrow’s clean energy℠   inentec® patented plasma enhanced melter® technology solves two of the world’s most perplexing challenges disposing of waste in a safe environmentallyresponsible manner and producing valuable clean products from recycled materials without using combustion or incineration pem® technology can transform virtually any waste—hazardous medical industrial and municipal—into ultraclean energy electricity and industrial materials proven efficient and costeffective pem technology provides a clean green path to a sustainable future   the pem process inentec’s plasma enhanced melter breaks materials apart into their elemental components such as hydrogen carbon and oxygen and then transforms those elements into synthesis gas syngas one of the basic building blocks of the chemical and energy industries syngas can be further processed to meet specific customer requirements any waste not converted into syngas gets turned into synglass™ material which has many industrial uses more   greener and safer the pem process is superior to competing methods of waste treatment and disposal based on its economic and environmental advantages pem can used across a wide variety of applications including distributed power generation and transportation fuels production  more proven technology in  inentec constructed the first pem facility at its technology center in richland washington  the system began operations in april  and remains in use today for client demonstrations treatability studies on new

produced by the system was used as fuel in a dualfuel diesel genset mounted on the second flat bed trailer  the g has been moved to other locations to process various materials including debris from tornado and storm activity and various wastes from chemical plants global plasma technology limited – model g kuan yin taipei taiwan roc a model g pem was purchased by global plasma for processing medical waste in kuan yin taiwan near taipei it processed a variety of waste streams including medical waste batteries spent solvents lab packs and mercury vapor lamps  the syngas generated from the

processing most states require that certain portions of the medical waste stream be incinerated this is typically the pathological materials pharmaceuticals and trace chemotherapy materials in order to qualify to treat these materials approval as an “alternate to incineration” must be obtained these approvals have obtained for several states the states having approved the pem™ as an alternate technology are as follows click on state to download their approval letter california new hampshire oregon texas new york michigan note in both oregon and michigan some portions of the waste stream are required by law to be sent to an incinerator since the pem is not an incinerator the state representatives believed that they had no discretionary capacity to approve the pem for all waste streams even though the pem operates at higher temperatures than do incinerators michigan is changing its law to reflect that other systems such as the pem can be approved for all wastes once the law is changed the pem will be fully approved for all portions of the michigan medical waste stream air permits and emissions testing allied technology group – rcra permit allied technology group was the

organization along with a local group organized by the activists filed an appeal to the local air pollution control district citizen based hearing board the appeal basically claimed the local air pollution control district erred in issuing the permits due largely to the complex legal and scientific issues involved the citizen board agreed with the appellants’ positions and the inentec permits were withdrawn inentec filed its own appeal of the hearing board’s findings in the tehama county superior court because we believed that the hearing board failed to correctly interpret the law and incorrectly overturned the permits on jan   tehama county superior court judge john k letton issued his ruling judge letton in a detailed  page ruling found all  of the hearing board’s findings without merit press release judge letton further required that “the hearing board shall give proper notice and hold a further hearing in this matter no later than february   the board may continue that hearing from time to time but the board shall issue its final written decisionorder and findings no later than march  ” the hearing board met on february   and reviewed their previous findings in

the pem® system uses heating from electrically conducting gas a plasma to convert waste feeds to valuable products  pem systems are highly effective in processing a wide variety of waste streams including hazardous medical radioactive industrial municipal and tire wastes transforming them into valuable commercial products including energy ultraclean power generation or transportation fuels production using the syngas and industrial materials chemicals from the syngas roofing tiles insulating panels sandblasting media and other constructionrelated products from the glass and recoverable metals the pem system is environmentally attractive based on its minimal environmental impact and ability to provide neartotal destruction of organic materials providing large volume and weight reduction feed systems feedstock is introduced to the pem process through a feed system designed specifically for the type of materials being processed pregasifier the pregasifier acts as a ìpreliminaryî processing zone in which a majority approximately  of the organic portion of the feedstock is converted to syngas  the remaining feedstock consisting of inorganic materials dirt glass and metal for example carbon and other unprocessed organics pass through to the outlet at the bottom of the pregasifier and into the pem process chamber pem process chamber the remaining feed materials from the pregasifier are dropped onto a molten glass surface near the plasmaarc zone within the pem process chamber  the plasma arc provides the intense energy needed to rapidly gasify the remaining organic materials converting them to syngas  the remaining inorganic components are incorporated into the molten glass bath  the syngas exits the pem process chamber and flows to the thermal residence chamber trc thermal residence chamber trc syngas streams from the pregasifier and the pem process chamber are ducted to the trc which is designed to provide additional residence time at a high enough temperature to fully process any remaining organic materials present in the syngas and allow the gasification reaction to reach equilibrium ac and dc power supplies the primary power supply system for the pem introduces both jouleheating and plasma energy into the pem process chamber by means of separate power supplies for the dc plasma and the ac joule heating system  the dc power is used to produce the plasmaarc which provides most of the energy for gasification of the feed material  the independent ac power heats and maintains the glass bath temperature allowing the plasmaarc power to be focused on the gasification process and not on maintaining the molten pool as in typical plasmabased systems drain power supplies the drain power supplies are used to operate the drains which allow molten glass and metal to be removed from the system during operation syngas cleaning the syngas leaving the trc is cleaned and conditioned in a series of standard processes to prepare it for use in any final products syngas products the syngas may be used for a variety of applications such as electric generation liquid fuels production or conversion to industrial products
