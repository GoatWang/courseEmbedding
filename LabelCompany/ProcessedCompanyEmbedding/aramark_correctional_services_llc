states district court southern district of indiana terre haute division dante d guy plaintiff v aramark correctional services llc          no cvjmsmjd defendant entry granting motion for summary judgment plaintiff dante guy is an indiana inmate incarcerated at the new castle correctional facility he brings this lawsuit pursuant to  usc §  against aramark food services the company which provides meals for inmates of the indiana department of correction “idoc” he alleges that while he was incarcerated at the wabash valley correctional facility “wvcf” he broke a tooth on a foreign object in one of his meals he further asserts that aramark has repeatedly been notified of foreign objects found in the meals it serves but has failed to rectify this situation arguing that guy failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies with respect to these claims the defendants move for summary judgment guy has not responded for the following reasons the motion for summary judgment dkt  is granted i summary judgment standard “the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law the court should state on the record the reasons for granting or denying the motion” fedrcivp docketsjustiacom a see also celotex corp v catrett  us    spath v hayes wheels intl– ind inc  fd 9  th cir  in determining the existence of a genuine issue of material fact the court construes all facts in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draws all reasonable inferences in that party’s favor anderson v liberty lobby inc  us    guy has not opposed the motion for summary judgment either with evidentiary material or with a narrative statement suggesting that the defendant is not entitled to summary judgment based on the pleadings and the evidentiary record he has not filed a statement of material facts in dispute the consequence of these circumstances is that guy has conceded the defendant’s version of the facts smith v lamz  fd   th cir  “failure to respond by the nonmovant as mandated by the local rules results in an admission” waldridge v american hoechst corp  fd 9 9 th cir 9 this does not alter the standard for assessing a rule a motion but does “reduce the pool” from which the facts and inferences relative to such a motion may be drawn smith v severn 9 fd   th cir  ii undisputed facts the offender grievance process is meant to provide a mechanism for every inmate to express complaints and topics of concern for the efficient and fair resolution of legitimate offender concerns and for facility and idoc management to be better informed and better able to carry out the idoc’s mission and goals information on the offender grievance process is included with the admission  orientation a  o paperwork for inmates entering wvcf a copy of the policy for the offender grievance process is also available to inmates through the law library  the offender grievance process consists of three stages first an inmate must attempt to resolve the grievance informally through officials at the facility second if the inmate is unable to obtain a resolution informally the inmate may submit a formal grievance to the designated staff person the appropriate form for submitting grievances is available upon request to inmates through their caseworker or casework manager third if the formal grievance is not resolved in a manner that satisfies the offender he may submit an appeal level ii within ten working days from the date of receipt of the grievance response the offender grievance process is not complete until the inmate completes the appeal process guy was incarcerated at wvcf at the time of the alleged incident guy never filed any grievances relating to foreign objects in his food or a chipped tooth that he suffered as a result of a foreign object in his food iii discussion the defendant argues that guy’s claims must be dismissed because he failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies with respect to those claims the prison litigation reform act “plra” requires that a prisoner exhaust his available administrative remedies before bringing a suit concerning prison conditions  usc § ea see porter v nussle  us    “the plra’s exhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits about prison life whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong” id at  citation omitted the exhaustion requirement of the plra is one of “proper exhaustion” because “no adjudicative system can function effectively without imposing some orderly structure on the course of its proceedings” woodford v ngo  us    this means that the prisoner plaintiff must have  completed “the administrative review process in accordance with the applicable procedural rules including deadlines as a precondition to bringing suit in federal court” id at  see also dale v lappin  fd   th cir  “in order to properly exhaust a prisoner must submit inmate complaints and appeals ‘in the place and at the time the prisons administrative rules require’” quoting pozo v mccaughtry  fd   th cir  the defendant has shown that guy did not fully exhaust his available administrative remedies as required by the plra he did not file any grievances related to his claims in this case he has not responded to the motion for summary judgment and therefore has not disputed these facts it is therefore undisputed that guy failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies with regard to his claims in this case the consequence of these circumstances in light of  usc § ea is that guy’s claims should not have been brought and must now be dismissed without prejudice see pozo  fd at  explaining that “a prisoner who does not properly take each step within the administrative process has failed to exhaust state remedies and thus is foreclosed by § ea from litigating” ford v johnson  fd 9  th cir “we therefore hold that all dismissals under § ea should be without prejudice” iv conclusion the defendants’ motion for summary judgment dkt  is granted judgment consistent with this entry shall now issue it is so ordered date   distribution dante d guy  new castle  cf new castle correctional facility  inmate mailparcels  van nuys road new
