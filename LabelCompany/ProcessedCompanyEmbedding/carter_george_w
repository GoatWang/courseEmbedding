george washington carver front row center poses with fellow faculty of tuskegee institute in this c  photograph taken by frances benjamin johnston in  booker t washington the first principal and president of the tuskegee institute invited carver to head its agriculture department carver taught there for  years developing the department into a strong research center and working with two additional college presidents during his tenure he taught methods of crop rotation introduced several alternative cash crops for farmers that would also improve the soil of areas heavily cultivated in cotton initiated research into crop products chemurgy and taught generations of black students farming techniques for selfsufficiency carver designed a mobile classroom to take education out to farmers he called it a jesup wagon after the new york financier and philanthropist morris ketchum jesup who provided funding to support the program to recruit carver to tuskegee washington gave him an above average salary and two rooms for his personal use although both concessions were resented by some other faculty because he had earned a masters in a scientific field from a white institution some faculty perceived him as arrogant unmarried faculty members normally had to share rooms with two to a room in the spartan early days of the institute one of carvers duties was to administer the agricultural experiment station farms he had to manage the production and sale of farm products to generate revenue for the institute he soon proved to be a poor administrator in  carver complained that the physical work and the letterwriting required were too much in  an institute committee reported that carvers reports on yields from the poultry yard were exaggerated and washington confronted carver about the issue carver replied in writing now to be branded as a liar and party to such hellish deception it is more than i can bear and if your committee feel that i have willfully lied or was party to such lies as were told my resignation is at your disposal during washingtons last five years at tuskegee carver submitted or threatened his resignation several times when the administration reorganized the agriculture programs when he disliked a teaching assignment to manage an experiment station elsewhere and when he did not get summer teaching assignments in – in each case washington smoothed things over photograph of george washington carver taken by frances benjamin johnston in  carver started his academic career as a researcher and teacher in  washington wrote a letter to him complaining that carver had not followed orders to plant particular crops at the experiment station this revealed washingtons micromanagement of carvers department which he had headed for more than  years by then washington at the same time refused carvers requests for a new laboratory research supplies for his exclusive use and respite from teaching classes washington praised carvers abilities in teaching and original research but said about his administrative skills when it comes to the organization of classes the ability required to secure a properly organized and large school or section of a school you are wanting in ability when it comes to the matter of practical farm managing which will secure definite practical financial results you are wanting again in ability in  carver complained that his laboratory had not received the equipment which washington had promised  months before he also complained about institute committee meetings washington praised carver in his  memoir my larger education being chapters from my experience washington called carver one of the most thoroughly scientific men of the negro race with whom i am acquainted after washington died in  his successor made fewer demands on carver for administrative tasks while a professor at tuskegee carver joined the gamma sigma chapter of phi beta sigma fraternity he spoke at the  conclave that was held at tuskegee alabama in which he delivered a powerful and emotional speech to the men in attendance from  to  carver concentrated on researching and experimenting with new uses for peanuts sweet potatoes soybeans pecans and other crops as well as having his assistants research and compile existing uses this work and especially his speaking to a national conference of the peanut growers association in  and in testimony before congress in  to support passage of a tariff on imported peanuts brought him wide publicity and increasing renown in these years he became one of the most wellknown african americans of his time rise to fame one of americas great scientists us world war ii poster circa  carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton together with other agricultural experts he urged farmers to restore nitrogen to their soils by practicing systematic crop rotation alternating cotton crops with plantings of sweet potatoes or legumes such as peanuts soybeans and cowpeas these crops both restored nitrogen to the soil and were good for human consumption following the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields and gave farmers alternative cash crops to train farmers to successfully rotate and cultivate the new crops carver developed an agricultural extension program for alabama that was similar to the one at iowa state to encourage better nutrition in the south he widely distributed recipes using the alternative crops in addition he founded an industrial research laboratory where he and assistants worked to popularize the new crops by developing hundreds of applications for them they did original research as well as promoting applications and recipes which they collected from others carver distributed his information as agricultural bulletins peanut specimen collected by carver carvers work was known by officials in the national capital before he became a public figure president theodore roosevelt publicly admired his work former professors of carvers from iowa state university were appointed to positions as secretary of agriculture james wilson a former dean and professor of carvers served from  to  henry cantwell wallace served from  to  he knew carver personally because his son henry a wallace and the researcher were friends the younger wallace served as us secretary of agriculture from  to  and as franklin delano roosevelts vice president from  to  the american industrialist farmer and inventor william edenborn of winn parish louisiana grew peanuts on his demonstration farm he consulted with carver in  carver was made a member of the royal society of arts in england one of only a handful of americans at that time to receive this honor carvers promotion of peanuts gained him the most notice in  carver wrote to a peanut company about the potential he saw for peanut milk both he and the peanut industry seemed unaware that in  william melhuish had secured us  issued   for a milk substitute made from peanuts and soybeansimproper synthesis the united peanut associations of america invited carver to speak at their  convention he discussed the possibilities of the peanut and exhibited  peanut products by  the us peanut farmers were being undercut by low prices on imported peanuts from the republic of china in  peanut farmers and industry representatives planned to appear at congressional hearings to ask for a tariff based on the quality of carvers presentation at their convention they asked the africanamerican professor to testify on the tariff issue before the ways and means committee of the united states house of representatives due to segregation it was highly unusual for an african american to appear as an expert witness at congress representing europeanamerican industry and farmers southern congressmen reportedly shocked at carvers arriving to testify were said to have mocked himcitation needed as he talked about the importance of the peanut and its uses for american agriculture the committee members repeatedly extended the time for his testimony the fordneymccumber tariff of  was passed including one on imported peanuts carvers testifying to congress made him widely known as a public figure life while famous united states farm security administration portrait march  during the last two decades of his life carver seemed to enjoy his celebrity status he was often on the road promoting tuskegee university peanuts and racial harmony although he only published six agricultural bulletins after  he published articles in peanut industry journals and wrote a syndicated newspaper column professor carvers advice business leaders came to seek his help and he often responded with free advice three american presidents—theodore roosevelt calvin coolidge and franklin roosevelt—met with him and the crown prince of sweden studied with him for three weeks from  to  carver toured white southern colleges for the commission on interracial cooperation with his increasing notability carver became the subject of biographies and articles raleigh h merritt contacted him for his biography published in  merritt wrote at present not a great deal has been done to utilize dr carvers discoveries commercially he says that he is merely scratching the surface of scientific investigations of the possibilities of the peanut and other southern products in  the writer james saxon childers wrote that carver and his peanut products were almost solely responsible for the rise in us peanut production after the boll weevil devastated the american cotton crop beginning about  his article a boy who was traded for a horse  in the american magazine and its  reprint in readers digest contributed to this myth about carvers influence other popular media tended to exaggerate carvers impact on the peanut industry from  to  carver worked to develop peanut oil massages to treat infantile paralysis polio ultimately researchers found that the massages not the peanut oil provided the benefits of maintaining some mobility to paralyzed limbs from  to  carver participated in the usda disease survey carver had specialized in plant diseases and mycology for his masters degree in  carver attended two chemurgy conferences an emerging field in the s during the great depression and the dust bowl concerned with developing new products from crops he was invited by henry ford to speak at the conference held in dearborn michigan and they developed a friendship that year carvers health declined and ford later installed an elevator at the tuskegee dormitory where carver lived so that the elderly man would not have to climb stairs carver had been frugal in his life and in his seventies he established a legacy by creating a museum of his work as well as the george washington carver foundation at tuskegee in  to continue agricultural research he donated nearly us equivalent to  in  in his savings to create the foundation relationships austin curtis  scientist successor to dr carver cartoon by ch alston carver never married at age forty he began a courtship with sarah l hunt an elementary school teacher and the sisterinlaw of warren logan treasurer of tuskegee institute this lasted three years until she took a teaching job in california in her  biography christina vella reviews his relationships and suggests that carver was bisexual and constrained by mores of his historic period when he was seventy carver established a friendship and research partnership with the scientist austin w curtis jr this young black man a graduate of cornell university had some teaching experience before coming to tuskegee carver bequeathed to curtis his royalties from an authorized  biography by rackham holt after carver died in  curtis was fired from tuskegee institute he left alabama and resettled in detroit there he manufactured and sold peanutbased personal care products death painting by betsy graves reyneau upon returning home one day carver took a bad fall down a flight of stairs he was found unconscious by a maid who took him to a hospital carver died january   at the age of  from complications anemia resulting from this fall he was buried next to booker t washington at tuskegee university due to his frugality carvers life savings totaled  all of which he donated in his last years and at his death to the carver museum and to the george washington carver foundation on his grave was written he could have added fortune to fame but caring for neither he found happiness and honor in being helpful to the world voice pitch even as an adult carver spoke with a high pitch historian linda o mcmurry noted that he was a frail and sickly child who suffered from a severe case of whooping cough and frequent bouts of what was called croup mcmurry contested the diagnosis of croup holding rather that his stunted growth and apparently impaired vocal chords suggest instead tubercular or pneumococcal infection frequent infections of that nature could have caused the growth of polyps on the larynx and may have resulted from a gamma globulin deficiency until his death the high pitch of his voice startled all who met him and he suffered from frequent chest congestion and loss of voice mcmurry also examined the theory that carvers vocal pitch was due to being castrated as a child she noted that persistent rumours held he was castrated either by his kidnappers or his owner moses carver she maintained these accounts were unlikely as a person castrated before puberty almost never displays any secondary sexual characteristics and seldom grows to normal stature while carvers voice never deepened he reached normal height and grew facial hair she also pointed out that it was extremely unlikely that carver would have maintained affection for moses if he had castrated him but he retained obvious affection for mosesafter he left diamond he returned on several occasions to visit the carvers even after susans death mcmurry admitted that the castration theory cant be dismissed entirely she pointed to carvers reply in  to a friends question on why he never married  he had replied obliquely to a tragic incident in his past that precluded him from marriage mcmurry further noted he was also very reluctant to discuss the years between his departure from diamond and his arrival at iowa state often declaring that there were some things that he would rather forget mcmurry pointed out that after puberty castration or testicular failure due to accident or illness would not prevent the development of secondary sexual characteristics she also pointed out that carvers failure to marry was not proof of castration as it can be explained in other ways christianity george washington carver believed he could have faith both in god and science and integrated them into his life he testified on many occasions that his faith in jesus was the only mechanism by which he could effectively pursue and perform the art of science george washington carver became a christian when he was still a young boy as he wrote in connection to his conversion in  i was just a mere boy when converted hardly ten years old there isnt much of a story to it god just came into my heart one afternoon while i was alone in the loft of our big barn while i was shelling corn to carry to the mill to be ground into meal a dear little white boy one of our neighbors about my age came by one saturday morning and in talking and playing he told me he was going to sunday school tomorrow morning i was eager to know what a sunday school was he said they sang hymns and prayed i asked him what prayer was and what they said i do not remember what he said only remember that as soon as he left i climbed up into the loft knelt down by the barrel of corn and prayed as best i could i do not remember what i said i only recall that i felt so good that i prayed several times before i quit my brother and myself were the only colored children in that neighborhood and of course we could not go to church or sunday school or school of any kind that was my simple conversion and i have tried to keep the faith — g w carver letter to isabelle coleman july   he was not expected to live past his twentyfirst birthday due to failing health he lived well past the age of twentyone and his belief deepened as a result throughout his career he always found friendship with other christians he relied on them especially when criticized by the scientific community and media regarding his research methodology carver viewed faith in jesus christ as a means of destroying both barriers of racial disharmony and social stratification he was as concerned with his students character development as he was with their intellectual development he compiled a list of eight cardinal virtues for his students to strive toward a monument to carver at the missouri botanical garden in st louis be clean both inside and out neither look up to the rich nor down on the poor lose if need be without squealing win without bragging always be considerate of women children and older people be too brave to lie be too generous to cheat take your share of the world and let others take theirs beginning in  at tuskegee carver led a bible class on sundays for several students at their request he

senator harry s truman sponsored a bill in favor of a monument in a committee hearing on the bill one supporter said the bill is not simply a momentary pause on the part of busy men engaged in the conduct of the war to do honor to one of the truly great americans of this country but it is in essence a blow against the axis it is in essence a war measure in the sense that it will further unleash and release the energies of roughly  negro people in this country for full support of our war effort the bill passed unanimously in both houses on july   president franklin d roosevelt dedicated  for

named after carver it opened on september   in san antonio texas the carver community cultural center a historic center located in san antonio is named for him reputed inventions carver was given credit in popular folklore for many inventions that did not come out of his lab three patents one for cosmetics us  issued   and two for paints and stains us  issued   and us  issued   were issued to carver in  to  however they were not commercially successful aside from these patents and some recipes for food carver left no records of formulae or procedures for making his products he did not keep a laboratory notebook mackintosh notes that carver did not explicitly claim that he had personally discovered all the peanut attributes and uses he cited but he said nothing to prevent his audiences from drawing the inference carvers research was intended to produce replacements from common crops for commercial products which were generally beyond the budget of the small onehorse farmer a misconception grew that his research on products for subsistence farmers were developed by others commercially to change southern agriculture carvers work to provide small farmers with resources for more independence from the cash economy foreshadowed the appropriate technology work of e f schumacher peanut products dennis keeney director of the leopold center for sustainable agriculture at iowa state university wrote in the leopold letter newsletter carver worked on improving soils growing crops with low inputs and using species that fixed nitrogen hence the work on the cowpea and the peanut carver wrote in the need of scientific agriculture in the south the virgin fertility of our soils and the vast amount of unskilled labor have been more of a curse than a blessing to agriculture this exhaustive system for cultivation the destruction of forest the rapid and almost constant decomposition of organic matter have made our agricultural problem one requiring more brains than of the north east or west carver worked for years to create a company to market his products the most important was the carver penol company which sold a mixture of creosote and peanuts as a patent medicine for respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis sales were lackluster and the product was ineffective according to the food and drug administration other ventures were the carver products company and the carvoline company carvoline antiseptic hair dressing was a mix of peanut oil and lanolin carvoline rubbing oil was a peanut oil for massages carver is often mistakenly credited with the invention of peanut butter by the time carver published how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption in  many methods of preparation of peanut butter had been developed or patented by various pharmacists doctors and food scientists working in the us and canada the aztec were known to have made peanut butter from ground peanuts as early as the th century canadian pharmacist marcellus gilmore edson was awarded us patent  for its manufacture in   years before carver began his work at tuskegee sweet potato products carver is also associated with developing sweet potato products in his  sweet potato bulletin carver listed a few dozen recipes many of which i have copied verbatim from bulletin no  u s department of agriculture carvers records included the following sweet potato products  dyes  wood fillers  candies  library pastes  breakfast foods  starches  flours and  molasses he also had listings for vinegars dry coffee and instant coffee candy afterdinner mints orange drops and lemon drops carver bulletins during his more than four decades at tuskegee carvers official published work consisted mainly of  practical bulletins for farmers his first bulletin in  was on feeding acorns to farm animals his final bulletin in  was about the peanut he also published six bulletins on sweet potatoes five on cotton and four on cowpeas some other individual bulletins dealt with alfalfa wild plum tomato ornamental plants corn poultry dairying hogs preserving meats in hot weather and nature study in schools his most popular bulletin how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption was first published in  and was reprinted many times it gave a short overview of peanut crop production and contained a list of recipes from other agricultural bulletins cookbooks magazines and newspapers such as the peerless cookbook good housekeeping and berrys fruit recipes carvers was far from the first american agricultural bulletin devoted to peanuts but his bulletins did seem to be more popular and widespread than previous ones the standard author abbreviation carver is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing

promotion of alternative crops to cotton such as peanuts and sweet potatoes he wanted poor farmers to grow alternative crops both as a source of their own food and as a source of other products to improve their quality of life the most popular of his  practical bulletins for farmers contained  food recipes using peanuts he spent years developing and promoting numerous products made from peanuts none were commercially successful he was also a leader in promoting environmentalism he received numerous honors for his work including the spingarn medal of the naacp in an era of very high racial

the school closed for the night he slept in a nearby barn by his own account the next morning he met a kind woman mariah watkins from whom he wished to rent a room when he identified himself as carvers george as he had done his whole life she replied that from now on his name was george carver george liked mariah watkins and her words you must learn all you can then go back out into the

foster family in fort scott kansas after witnessing a black man killed by a group of whites carver left the city he attended a series of schools before earning his diploma at minneapolis high school in minneapolis kansas college at work in his laboratory carver applied to several colleges before being accepted at highland university in highland kansas when he arrived however they rejected him because of his race in august  carver traveled by wagon with j f beeler from highland to eden township in ness county kansas he homesteaded a claim near beeler where he maintained a small conservatory

in ames when he began there in  he was the first black student carvers bachelors thesis was plants as modified by man dated  iowa state professors joseph budd and louis pammel convinced carver to continue there for his masters degree carver did research at the iowa experiment station under pammel during the next two years his work at the experiment station in plant pathology and mycology first gained him national recognition and respect as a botanist carver taught as the first black faculty member at iowa state tuskegee institute george washington carver front row center poses with fellow faculty of tuskegee institute in this c  photograph taken by frances benjamin johnston in  booker t washington the first principal and president of the tuskegee institute invited carver to head its agriculture department carver taught there for  years developing the department into a strong research center and working with two additional college presidents during his tenure he taught methods of crop rotation introduced several alternative cash crops for farmers that would also improve the soil of areas heavily cultivated in cotton initiated research into crop products chemurgy and taught generations of black students farming techniques for selfsufficiency carver designed a mobile classroom to take education out to farmers he called it a jesup wagon after the new york financier and philanthropist morris ketchum jesup who provided funding to support the program to recruit carver to tuskegee washington gave him an above average salary and two rooms for his personal use although both concessions were resented by some other faculty because he had earned a masters in a scientific field from a white institution some faculty perceived him as arrogant unmarried faculty members normally had to share rooms with two to a room in the spartan early days of the institute one of carvers duties was to administer the agricultural experiment station farms he had to manage the production and sale of farm products to generate revenue for the institute he soon proved to be a poor administrator in  carver complained that the physical work and the letterwriting required were too much in  an institute committee reported that carvers reports on yields from the poultry yard were exaggerated and washington confronted carver about the issue carver replied in writing now to be branded as a liar and party to such hellish deception it is more than i can bear and if your committee feel that i have willfully lied or was party to such lies as were told my resignation is at your disposal during washingtons last five years at tuskegee carver submitted or threatened his resignation several times when the administration reorganized the agriculture programs when he disliked a teaching assignment to manage an experiment station elsewhere and when he did not get summer teaching assignments in – in each case washington smoothed things over photograph of george washington carver taken by frances benjamin johnston in  carver started his academic career as a researcher and teacher in  washington wrote a letter to him complaining that carver had not followed orders to plant particular crops at the experiment station this revealed washingtons micromanagement of carvers department which he had headed for more than  years by then washington at the same time refused carvers requests for a new laboratory research supplies for his exclusive use and respite from teaching classes washington praised carvers abilities in teaching and original research but said about his administrative skills when it comes to the organization of classes the ability required to secure a properly organized and large school or section of a school you are wanting in ability when it comes to the matter of practical farm managing which will secure definite practical financial results you are wanting again in ability in  carver complained that his laboratory had not received the equipment which washington had promised  months before he also complained about institute committee meetings washington praised carver in his  memoir my larger education being chapters from my experience washington called carver one of the most thoroughly scientific men of the negro race with whom i am acquainted after washington died in  his successor made fewer demands on carver for administrative tasks while a professor at tuskegee carver joined the gamma sigma chapter of phi beta sigma fraternity he spoke at the  conclave that was held at tuskegee alabama in which he delivered a powerful and emotional speech to the men in attendance from  to  carver concentrated on researching and experimenting with new uses for peanuts sweet potatoes soybeans pecans and other crops as well as having his assistants research and compile existing uses this work and especially his speaking to a national conference of the peanut growers association in  and in testimony before congress in  to support passage of a tariff on imported peanuts brought him wide publicity and increasing renown in these years he became one of the most wellknown african americans of his time rise to fame one of americas great scientists us world war ii poster circa  carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton together with other agricultural experts he urged farmers to restore nitrogen to their soils by practicing systematic crop rotation alternating cotton crops with plantings of sweet potatoes or legumes such as peanuts soybeans and cowpeas these crops both restored nitrogen to the soil and were good for human consumption following the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields and gave farmers alternative cash crops to train farmers to successfully rotate and cultivate the new crops carver developed an agricultural extension program for alabama that was similar to the one at iowa state to encourage better nutrition in the south he widely distributed recipes using the alternative crops in addition he founded an industrial research laboratory where he and assistants worked to popularize the new crops by developing hundreds of applications for them they did original research as well as promoting applications and recipes which they collected from others carver distributed his information as agricultural bulletins peanut specimen collected by carver carvers work was known by officials in the national capital before he became a public figure president theodore roosevelt publicly admired his work former professors of carvers from iowa state university were appointed to positions as secretary of agriculture james wilson a former dean and professor of carvers served from  to  henry cantwell wallace served from  to  he knew carver personally because his son henry a wallace and the researcher were friends the younger wallace served as us secretary of agriculture from  to  and as franklin delano roosevelts vice president from  to  the american industrialist farmer and inventor william edenborn of winn parish louisiana grew peanuts on his demonstration farm he consulted with carver in  carver was made a member of the royal society of arts in england one of only a handful of americans at that time to receive this honor carvers promotion of peanuts gained him the most notice in  carver wrote to a peanut company about the potential he saw for peanut milk both he and the peanut industry seemed unaware that in  william melhuish had secured us  issued   for a milk substitute made from peanuts and soybeansimproper synthesis the united peanut associations of america invited carver to speak at their  convention he discussed the possibilities of the peanut and exhibited  peanut products by  the us peanut farmers were being undercut by low prices on imported peanuts from the republic of china in  peanut farmers and industry representatives planned to appear at congressional hearings to ask for a tariff based on the quality of carvers presentation at their convention they asked the africanamerican professor to testify on the tariff issue before the ways and means committee of the united states house of representatives due to segregation it was highly unusual for an african american to appear as an expert witness at congress representing europeanamerican industry and farmers southern congressmen reportedly shocked at carvers arriving to testify were said to have mocked himcitation needed as he talked about the importance of the peanut and its uses for american agriculture the committee members repeatedly extended the time for his testimony the fordneymccumber tariff of  was passed including one on imported peanuts carvers testifying to congress made him widely known as a public figure life while famous united states farm security administration portrait march  during the last two decades of his life carver seemed to enjoy his celebrity status he was often on the road promoting tuskegee university peanuts and racial harmony although he only published six agricultural bulletins after  he published articles in peanut industry journals and wrote a syndicated newspaper column professor carvers advice business leaders came to seek his help and he often responded with free advice three american presidents—theodore roosevelt calvin coolidge and franklin roosevelt—met with him and the crown prince of sweden studied with him for three weeks from  to  carver toured white southern colleges for the commission on interracial cooperation with his increasing notability carver became the subject of biographies and articles raleigh h merritt contacted him for his biography published in  merritt wrote at present not a great deal has been done to utilize dr carvers discoveries commercially he says that he is merely scratching the surface of scientific investigations of the possibilities of the peanut and other southern products in  the writer james saxon childers wrote that carver and his peanut products were almost solely responsible for the rise in us peanut production after the boll weevil devastated the american cotton crop beginning about  his article a boy who was traded for a horse  in the american magazine and its  reprint in readers digest contributed to this myth about carvers influence other popular media tended to exaggerate carvers impact on the peanut industry from  to  carver worked to develop peanut oil massages to treat infantile paralysis polio ultimately researchers found that the massages not the peanut oil provided the benefits of maintaining some mobility to paralyzed limbs from  to  carver participated in the usda disease survey carver had specialized in plant diseases and mycology for his masters degree in  carver attended two chemurgy conferences an emerging field in the s during the great depression and the dust bowl concerned with developing new products from crops he was invited by henry ford to speak at the conference held in dearborn michigan and they developed a friendship that year carvers health declined and ford later installed an elevator at the tuskegee dormitory where carver lived so that the elderly man would not have to climb stairs carver had been frugal in his life and in his seventies he established a legacy by creating a museum of his work as well as the george washington carver foundation at tuskegee in  to continue agricultural research he donated nearly us equivalent to  in  in his savings to create the foundation relationships austin curtis  scientist successor to dr carver cartoon by ch alston carver never married at age forty he began a courtship with sarah l hunt an elementary school teacher and the sisterinlaw of warren logan treasurer of tuskegee institute this lasted three years until she took a teaching job in california in her  biography christina vella reviews his relationships and suggests that carver was bisexual and constrained by mores of his historic period when he was seventy carver established a friendship and research partnership with the scientist austin w curtis jr this young black man a graduate of cornell university had some teaching experience before coming to tuskegee carver bequeathed to curtis his royalties from an authorized  biography by rackham holt after carver died in  curtis was fired from tuskegee institute he left alabama and resettled in detroit there he manufactured and sold peanutbased personal care products death painting by betsy graves reyneau upon returning home one day carver took a bad fall down a flight of stairs he was found unconscious by a maid who took him to a hospital carver died january   at the age of  from complications anemia resulting from this fall he was buried next to booker t washington at tuskegee university due to his frugality carvers life savings totaled  all of which he donated in his last years and at his death to the carver museum and to the george washington carver foundation on his grave was written he could have added fortune to fame but caring for neither he found happiness and honor in being helpful to the world voice pitch even as an adult carver spoke with a high pitch historian linda o mcmurry noted that he was a frail and sickly child who suffered from a severe case of whooping cough and frequent bouts of what was called croup mcmurry contested the diagnosis of croup holding rather that his stunted growth and apparently impaired vocal chords suggest instead tubercular or pneumococcal infection frequent infections of that nature could have caused the growth of polyps on the larynx and may have resulted from a gamma globulin deficiency until his death the high pitch of his voice startled all who met him and he suffered from frequent chest congestion and loss of voice mcmurry also examined the theory that carvers vocal pitch was due to being castrated as a child she noted that persistent rumours held he was castrated either by his kidnappers or his owner moses carver she maintained these accounts were unlikely as a person castrated before puberty almost never displays any secondary sexual characteristics and seldom grows to normal stature while carvers voice never deepened he reached normal height and grew facial hair she also pointed out that it was extremely unlikely that carver would have maintained affection for moses if he had castrated him but he retained obvious affection for mosesafter he left diamond he returned on several occasions to visit the carvers even after susans death mcmurry admitted that the castration theory cant be dismissed entirely she pointed to carvers reply in  to a friends question on why he never married  he had replied obliquely to a tragic incident in his past that precluded him from marriage mcmurry further noted he was also very reluctant to discuss the years between his departure from diamond and his arrival at iowa state often declaring that there were some things that he would rather forget mcmurry pointed out that after puberty castration or testicular failure due to accident or illness would not prevent the development of secondary sexual characteristics she also pointed out that carvers failure to marry was not proof of castration as it can be explained in other ways christianity george washington carver believed he could have faith both in god and science and integrated them into his life he testified on many occasions that his faith in jesus was the only mechanism by which he could effectively pursue and perform the art of science george washington carver became a christian when he was still a young boy as he wrote in connection to his conversion in  i was just a mere boy when converted hardly ten years old there isnt much of a story to it god just came into my heart one afternoon while i was alone in the loft of our big barn while i was shelling corn to carry to the mill to be ground into meal a dear little white boy one of our neighbors about my age came by one saturday morning and in talking and playing he told me he was going to sunday school tomorrow morning i was eager to know what a sunday school was he said they sang hymns and prayed i asked him what prayer was and what they said i do not remember what he said only remember that as soon as he left i climbed up into the loft knelt down by the barrel of corn and prayed as best i could i do not remember what i said i only recall that i felt so good that i prayed several times before i quit my brother and myself were the only colored children in that neighborhood and of course we could not go to church or sunday school or school of any kind that was my simple conversion and i have tried to keep the faith — g w carver letter to isabelle coleman july   he was not expected to live past his twentyfirst birthday due to failing health he lived well past the age of twentyone and his belief deepened as a result throughout his career he always found friendship with other christians he relied on them especially when criticized by the scientific community and media regarding his research methodology carver viewed faith in jesus christ as a means of destroying both barriers of racial disharmony and social stratification he was as concerned with his students character development as he was with their intellectual development he compiled a list of eight cardinal virtues for his students to strive toward a monument to carver at the missouri botanical garden in st louis be clean both inside and out neither look up to the rich nor down on the poor lose if need be without squealing win without bragging always be considerate of women children and older people be too brave to lie be too generous to cheat take your share of the world and let others

monument to carver began before his death because of world war ii such nonwar expenditures had been banned by presidential order missouri senator harry s truman sponsored a bill in favor of a monument in a committee hearing on the bill one supporter said the bill is not simply a momentary pause on the part of busy men engaged in the conduct of the war to do honor to one of the truly great americans of this country but it is in essence a blow against the axis it is in essence a war measure in the sense that it will further unleash and release the energies of roughly  negro people in this country for full support of our war effort the bill passed unanimously in both houses on july   president franklin d roosevelt dedicated  for the george washington carver national monument westsouthwest of

named after him national basketball association star david robinson and his wife valerie founded an academy named after carver it opened on september   in san antonio texas the carver community cultural center a historic center located in san antonio is named for him reputed inventions carver was given credit in popular folklore for many inventions that did not come out of his lab three patents one for cosmetics us  issued   and two for paints and stains us  issued   and us  issued   were issued to carver in  to  however they were not commercially successful aside from these patents and some recipes for food carver left no records of formulae or procedures for making his products he did not keep a laboratory notebook mackintosh notes that carver did not explicitly claim that he had personally discovered all the peanut attributes and uses he cited but he said nothing to prevent his audiences from drawing the inference carvers research was intended to produce replacements from common crops for commercial products which were generally beyond the budget of the small onehorse farmer a misconception grew that his research on products for subsistence farmers were developed by others commercially to change southern agriculture carvers work to provide small farmers with resources for more independence from the cash economy foreshadowed the appropriate technology work of e f schumacher peanut products dennis keeney director of the leopold center for sustainable agriculture at iowa state university wrote in the leopold letter newsletter carver worked on improving soils growing crops with low inputs and using species that fixed nitrogen hence the work on the cowpea and the peanut carver wrote in the need of scientific agriculture in the south the virgin fertility of our soils and the vast amount of unskilled labor have been more of a curse than a blessing to agriculture this exhaustive system for cultivation the destruction of forest the rapid and almost constant decomposition of organic matter have made our agricultural problem one requiring more brains than of the north east or west carver worked for years to create a company to market his products the most important was the carver penol company which sold a mixture of creosote and peanuts as a patent medicine for respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis sales were lackluster and the product was ineffective according to the food and drug administration other ventures were the carver products company and the carvoline company carvoline antiseptic hair dressing was a mix of peanut oil and lanolin carvoline rubbing oil was a peanut oil for massages carver is often mistakenly credited with the invention of peanut butter by the time carver published how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption in  many methods of preparation of peanut butter had been developed or patented by various pharmacists doctors and food scientists working in the us and canada the aztec were known to have made peanut butter from ground peanuts as early as the th century canadian pharmacist marcellus gilmore edson was awarded us patent  for its manufacture in   years before carver began his work at tuskegee sweet potato products carver is also associated with developing sweet potato products in his  sweet potato bulletin carver listed a few dozen recipes many of which i have copied verbatim from bulletin no  u s department of agriculture carvers records included the following sweet potato products  dyes  wood fillers  candies  library pastes  breakfast foods  starches  flours and  molasses he also had listings for vinegars dry coffee and instant coffee candy afterdinner mints orange drops and lemon drops carver bulletins during his more than four decades at tuskegee carvers official published work consisted mainly of  practical bulletins for farmers his first bulletin in  was on feeding acorns to farm animals his final bulletin in  was about the peanut he also published six bulletins on sweet potatoes five on cotton and four on cowpeas some other individual bulletins dealt with alfalfa wild plum tomato ornamental plants corn poultry dairying hogs preserving meats in hot weather and nature study in schools his most popular bulletin how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption was first published in  and was reprinted many times it gave a short overview of peanut crop production and contained a list of recipes from other agricultural bulletins cookbooks magazines and newspapers such as the peerless

reading and writing black people were not allowed at the public school in diamond grove george decided to go to a school for black children  miles  km south in neosho when he reached the town he found the school closed for the night he slept in a nearby barn by his own account the next morning he met a kind woman mariah watkins from whom he wished to rent a room when he identified himself as carvers george as he had done his whole life she replied that from now on his name was george carver george liked mariah watkins and her words you must learn all you can then go back out into the

continue there for his masters degree carver did research at the iowa experiment station under pammel during the next two years his work at the experiment station in plant pathology and mycology first gained him national recognition and respect as a botanist carver taught as the first black faculty member at iowa state tuskegee institute george washington carver front row center poses with fellow faculty of tuskegee institute in this c  photograph taken by frances benjamin johnston in  booker t washington the first principal and president of the tuskegee institute invited carver to head its agriculture department carver taught there for  years developing the department into a strong research center and working with two additional college presidents during his tenure he taught methods of crop rotation introduced several alternative cash crops for farmers that would also improve the soil of areas heavily cultivated in cotton initiated research into crop products chemurgy and taught generations of black students farming techniques for selfsufficiency carver designed a mobile classroom to take education out to farmers he called it a jesup wagon after the new york financier and philanthropist morris ketchum jesup who provided funding to support the program to recruit carver to tuskegee washington gave him an above average salary and two rooms for his personal use although both concessions were resented by some other faculty because he had earned a masters in a scientific field from a white institution some faculty perceived him as arrogant unmarried faculty members normally had to share rooms with two to a room in the spartan early days of the institute one of carvers duties was to administer the agricultural experiment station farms he had to manage the production and sale of farm products to generate revenue for the institute he soon proved to be a poor administrator in  carver complained that the physical work and the letterwriting required were too much in  an institute committee reported that carvers reports on yields from the poultry yard were exaggerated and washington confronted carver about the issue carver replied in writing now to be branded as a liar and party to such hellish deception it is more than i can bear and if your committee feel that i have willfully lied or was party to such lies as were told my resignation is at your disposal during washingtons last five years at tuskegee carver submitted or threatened his resignation several times when the administration reorganized the agriculture programs when he disliked a teaching assignment to manage an experiment station elsewhere and when he did not get summer teaching assignments in – in each case washington smoothed things over photograph of george washington carver taken by frances benjamin johnston in  carver started his academic career as a researcher and teacher in  washington wrote a letter to him complaining that carver had not followed orders to plant particular crops at the experiment station this revealed washingtons micromanagement of carvers department which he had headed for more than  years by then washington at the same time refused carvers requests for a new laboratory research supplies for his exclusive use and respite from teaching classes washington praised carvers abilities in teaching and original research but said about his administrative skills when it comes to the organization of classes the ability required to secure a properly organized and large school or section of a school you are wanting in ability when it comes to the matter of practical farm managing which will secure definite practical financial results you are wanting again in ability in  carver complained that his laboratory had not received the equipment which washington had promised  months before he also complained about institute committee meetings washington praised carver in his  memoir my larger education being chapters from my experience washington called carver one of the most thoroughly scientific men of the negro race with whom i am acquainted after washington died in  his successor made fewer demands on carver for administrative tasks while a professor at tuskegee carver joined the gamma sigma chapter of phi beta sigma fraternity he spoke at the  conclave that was held at tuskegee alabama in which he delivered a powerful and emotional speech to the men in attendance from  to  carver concentrated on researching and experimenting with new uses for peanuts sweet potatoes soybeans pecans and other crops as well as having his assistants research and compile existing uses this work and especially his speaking to a national conference of the peanut growers association in  and in testimony before congress in  to support passage of a tariff on imported peanuts brought him wide publicity and increasing renown in these years he became one of the most wellknown african americans of his time rise to fame one of americas great scientists us world war ii poster circa  carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton together with other agricultural experts he urged farmers to restore nitrogen to their soils by practicing systematic crop rotation alternating cotton crops with plantings of sweet potatoes or legumes such as peanuts soybeans and cowpeas these crops both restored nitrogen to the soil and were good for human consumption following the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields and gave farmers alternative cash crops to train farmers to successfully rotate and cultivate the new crops carver developed an agricultural extension program for alabama that was similar to the one at iowa state to encourage better nutrition in the south he widely distributed recipes using the alternative crops in addition he founded an industrial research laboratory where he and assistants worked to popularize the new crops by developing hundreds of applications for them they did original research as well as promoting applications and recipes which they collected from others carver distributed his information as agricultural bulletins peanut specimen collected by carver carvers work was known by officials in the national capital before he became a public figure president theodore roosevelt publicly admired his work former professors of carvers from iowa state university were appointed to positions as secretary of agriculture james wilson a former dean and professor of carvers served from  to  henry cantwell wallace served from  to  he knew carver personally because his son henry a wallace and the researcher were friends the younger wallace served as us secretary of agriculture from  to  and as franklin delano roosevelts vice president from  to  the american industrialist farmer and inventor william edenborn of winn parish louisiana grew peanuts on his demonstration farm he consulted with carver in  carver was made a member of the royal society of arts in england one of only a handful of americans at that time to receive this honor carvers promotion of peanuts gained him the most notice in  carver wrote to a peanut company about the potential he saw for peanut milk both he and the peanut industry seemed unaware that in  william melhuish had secured us  issued   for a milk substitute made from peanuts and soybeansimproper synthesis the united peanut associations of america invited carver to speak at their  convention he discussed the possibilities of the peanut and exhibited  peanut products by  the us peanut farmers were being undercut by low prices on imported peanuts from the republic of china in  peanut farmers and industry representatives planned to appear at congressional hearings to ask for a tariff based on the quality of carvers presentation at their convention they asked the africanamerican professor to testify on the tariff issue before the ways and means committee of the united states house of representatives due to segregation it was highly unusual for an african american to appear as an expert witness at congress representing europeanamerican industry and farmers southern congressmen reportedly shocked at carvers arriving to testify were said to have mocked himcitation needed as he talked about the importance of the peanut and its uses for american agriculture the committee members repeatedly extended the time for his testimony the fordneymccumber tariff of  was passed including one on imported peanuts carvers testifying to congress made him widely known as a public figure life while famous united states farm security administration portrait march  during the last two decades of his life carver seemed to enjoy his celebrity status he was often on the road promoting tuskegee university peanuts and racial harmony although he only published six agricultural bulletins after  he published articles in peanut industry journals and wrote a syndicated newspaper column professor carvers advice business leaders came to seek his help and he often responded with free advice three american presidents—theodore roosevelt calvin coolidge and franklin roosevelt—met with him and the crown prince of sweden studied with him for three weeks from  to  carver toured white southern colleges for the commission on interracial cooperation with his increasing notability carver became the subject of biographies and articles raleigh h merritt contacted him for his biography published in  merritt wrote at present not a great deal has been done to utilize dr carvers discoveries commercially he says that he is merely scratching the surface of scientific investigations of the possibilities of the peanut and other southern products in  the writer james saxon childers wrote that carver and his peanut products were almost solely responsible for the rise in us peanut production after the boll weevil devastated the american cotton crop beginning about  his article a boy who was traded for a horse  in the american magazine and its  reprint in readers digest contributed to this myth about carvers influence other popular media tended to exaggerate carvers impact on the peanut industry from  to  carver worked to develop peanut oil massages to treat infantile paralysis polio ultimately researchers found that the massages not the peanut oil provided the benefits of maintaining some mobility to paralyzed limbs from  to  carver participated in the usda disease survey carver had specialized in plant diseases and mycology for his masters degree in  carver attended two chemurgy conferences an emerging field in the s during the great depression and the dust bowl concerned with developing new products from crops he was invited by henry ford to speak at the conference held in dearborn michigan and they developed a friendship that year carvers health declined and ford later installed an elevator at the tuskegee dormitory where carver lived so that the elderly man would not have to climb stairs carver had been frugal in his life and in his seventies he established a legacy by creating a museum of his work as well as the george washington carver foundation at tuskegee in  to continue agricultural research he donated nearly us equivalent to  in  in his savings to create the foundation relationships austin curtis  scientist successor to dr carver cartoon by ch alston carver never married at age forty he began a courtship with sarah l hunt an elementary school teacher and the sisterinlaw of warren logan treasurer of tuskegee institute this lasted three years until she took a teaching job in california in her  biography christina vella reviews his relationships and suggests that carver was bisexual and constrained by mores of his historic period when he was seventy carver established a friendship and research partnership with the scientist austin w curtis jr this young black man a graduate of cornell university had some teaching experience before coming to tuskegee carver bequeathed to curtis his royalties from an authorized  biography by rackham holt after carver died in  curtis was fired from tuskegee institute he left alabama and resettled in detroit there he manufactured and sold peanutbased personal care products death painting by betsy graves reyneau upon returning home one day carver took a bad fall down a flight of stairs he was found unconscious by a maid who took him to a hospital carver died january   at the age of  from complications anemia resulting from this fall he was buried next to booker t washington at tuskegee university due to his frugality carvers life savings totaled  all of which he donated in his last years and at his death to the carver museum and to the george washington carver foundation on his grave was written he could have added fortune to fame but caring for neither he found happiness and honor in being helpful to the world voice pitch even as an adult carver spoke with a high pitch historian linda o mcmurry noted that he was a frail and sickly child who suffered from a severe case of whooping cough and frequent bouts of what was called croup mcmurry contested the diagnosis of croup holding rather that his stunted growth and apparently impaired vocal chords suggest instead tubercular or pneumococcal infection frequent infections of that nature could have caused the growth of polyps on the larynx and may have resulted from a gamma globulin deficiency until his death the high pitch of his voice startled all who met him and he suffered from frequent chest congestion and loss of voice mcmurry also examined the theory that carvers vocal pitch was due to being castrated as a child she noted that persistent rumours held he was castrated either by his kidnappers or his owner moses carver she maintained these accounts were unlikely as a person castrated before puberty almost never displays any secondary sexual characteristics and seldom grows to normal stature while carvers voice never deepened he reached normal height and grew facial hair she also pointed out that it was extremely unlikely that carver would have maintained affection for moses if he had castrated him but he retained obvious affection for mosesafter he left diamond he returned on several occasions to visit the carvers even after susans death mcmurry admitted that the castration theory cant be dismissed entirely she pointed to carvers reply in  to a friends question on why he never married  he had replied obliquely to a tragic incident in his past that precluded him from marriage mcmurry further noted he was also very reluctant to discuss the years between his departure from diamond and his arrival at iowa state often declaring that there were some things that he would rather forget mcmurry pointed out that after puberty castration or testicular failure due to accident or illness would not prevent the development of secondary sexual characteristics she also pointed out that carvers failure to marry was not proof of castration as it can be explained in other ways christianity george washington carver believed he could have faith both in god and science and integrated them into his life he testified on many occasions that his faith in jesus was the only mechanism by which he could effectively pursue and perform the art of science george washington carver became a christian when he was still a young boy as he wrote in connection to his conversion in  i was just a mere boy when converted hardly ten years old there isnt much of a story to it god just came into my heart one afternoon while i was alone in the loft of our big barn while i was shelling corn to carry to the mill to be ground into meal a dear little white boy one of our neighbors about my age came by one saturday morning and in talking and playing he told me he was going to sunday school tomorrow morning i was eager to know what a sunday school was he said they sang hymns and prayed i asked him what prayer was and what they said i do not remember what he said only remember that as soon as he left i climbed up into the loft knelt down by the barrel of corn and prayed as best i could i do not remember what i said i only recall that i felt so good that i prayed several times before i quit my brother and myself were the only colored children in that neighborhood and of course we could not go to church or sunday school or school of any kind that was my simple conversion and i have tried to keep the faith — g w carver letter to isabelle coleman july   he was not expected to live past his twentyfirst birthday due to failing health he lived well past the age of twentyone and his belief deepened as a result throughout his career he always found friendship with other christians he relied on them especially when criticized by the scientific community and media regarding his research methodology carver viewed faith in jesus christ as a means of destroying both barriers of racial disharmony and social stratification he was as concerned with his students character development as he was with their intellectual development he compiled a list of eight cardinal virtues for his students to strive toward a monument to carver at the missouri botanical garden in st louis be clean both inside and out neither look up to the rich nor down on the poor

monument to carver began before his death because of world war ii such nonwar expenditures had been banned by presidential order missouri senator harry s truman sponsored a bill in favor of a monument in a committee hearing on the bill one supporter said the bill is not simply a momentary pause on the part of busy men engaged in the conduct of the war to do honor to one of the truly great americans of this country but it is in essence a blow against the axis it is in essence a war measure in the sense that it will further unleash and release the energies of roughly  negro people in this country

cultural center a historic center located in san antonio is named for him reputed inventions carver was given credit in popular folklore for many inventions that did not come out of his lab three patents one for cosmetics us  issued   and two for paints and stains us  issued   and us  issued   were issued to carver in  to  however they were not commercially successful aside from these patents and some recipes for food carver left no records of formulae or procedures for making his products he did not keep a laboratory notebook mackintosh notes that carver did not explicitly claim that he had personally discovered all the peanut attributes and uses he cited but he said nothing to prevent his audiences from drawing the inference carvers research was intended to produce replacements from common crops for commercial products which were generally beyond the budget of the small onehorse farmer a misconception grew that his research on products for subsistence farmers were developed by others commercially to change southern agriculture carvers work to provide small farmers with resources for more independence from the cash economy foreshadowed the appropriate technology work of e f schumacher peanut products dennis keeney director of the leopold center for sustainable agriculture at iowa state university wrote in the leopold letter newsletter carver worked on improving soils growing crops with low inputs and using species that fixed nitrogen hence the work on the cowpea and the peanut carver wrote in the need of scientific agriculture in the south the virgin fertility of our soils and the vast amount of unskilled labor have been more of a curse than a blessing to agriculture this exhaustive system for cultivation the destruction of forest the rapid and almost constant decomposition of organic matter have made our agricultural problem one requiring more brains than of the north east or west carver worked for years to create a company to market his products the most important was the carver penol company which sold a mixture of creosote and peanuts as a patent medicine for respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis sales were lackluster and the product was ineffective according to the food and drug administration other ventures were the carver products company and the carvoline company carvoline antiseptic hair dressing was a mix of peanut oil and lanolin carvoline rubbing oil was a peanut oil for massages carver is often mistakenly credited with the invention of peanut butter by the time carver published how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption in  many methods of preparation of peanut butter had been developed or patented by various pharmacists doctors and food scientists working in the us and canada the aztec were known to have made peanut butter from ground peanuts as early as the th century canadian pharmacist marcellus gilmore edson was awarded us patent  for its manufacture in   years before carver began his work at tuskegee sweet potato products carver is also associated with developing sweet potato products in his  sweet potato bulletin carver listed a few dozen recipes many of which i have copied verbatim from bulletin no  u s department of agriculture carvers records included the following sweet potato products  dyes  wood fillers  candies  library pastes  breakfast foods  starches  flours and  molasses he also had listings for vinegars dry coffee and instant coffee candy afterdinner mints orange drops and lemon drops carver bulletins during his more than four decades at tuskegee carvers official published work consisted mainly of  practical bulletins for farmers his first bulletin in  was on feeding acorns to farm animals his final bulletin in  was about the peanut he also published six bulletins on sweet potatoes five on cotton and four on cowpeas some other individual bulletins dealt with alfalfa wild plum tomato ornamental plants corn poultry dairying hogs preserving meats in hot weather and nature study in schools his most popular bulletin how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption was first published in  and was reprinted many times it gave a short overview of peanut crop production and contained a list of recipes from other agricultural bulletins cookbooks magazines and newspapers such as the peerless cookbook good housekeeping and berrys fruit recipes carvers was far from the first american agricultural bulletin devoted to peanuts but his bulletins did seem to be more popular and widespread than previous ones the standard author abbreviation carver is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name see also african american portal biography portal science portal

continue there for his masters degree carver did research at the iowa experiment station under pammel during the next two years his work at the experiment station in plant pathology and mycology first gained him national recognition and respect as a botanist carver taught as the first black faculty member at iowa state tuskegee institute george washington carver front row center poses with fellow faculty of tuskegee institute in this c  photograph taken by frances benjamin johnston in  booker t washington the first principal and president of the tuskegee institute invited carver to head its agriculture department carver taught there for  years developing the department into a strong research center and working with two additional college presidents during his tenure he taught methods of crop rotation introduced several alternative cash crops for farmers that would also improve the soil of areas heavily cultivated in cotton initiated research into crop products chemurgy and taught generations of black students farming techniques for selfsufficiency carver designed a mobile classroom to take education out to farmers he called it a jesup wagon after the new york financier and philanthropist morris ketchum jesup who provided funding to support the program to recruit carver to tuskegee washington gave him an above average salary and two rooms for his personal use although both concessions were resented by some other faculty because he had earned a masters in a scientific field from a white institution some faculty perceived him as arrogant unmarried faculty members normally had to share rooms with two to a room in the spartan early days of the institute one of carvers duties was to administer the agricultural experiment station farms he had to manage the production and sale of farm products to generate revenue for the institute he soon proved to be a poor administrator in  carver complained that the physical work and the letterwriting required were too much in  an institute committee reported that carvers reports on yields from the poultry yard were exaggerated and washington confronted carver about the issue carver replied in writing now to be branded as a liar and party to such hellish deception it is more than i can bear and if your committee feel that i have willfully lied or was party to such lies as were told my resignation is at your disposal during washingtons last five years at tuskegee carver submitted or threatened his resignation several times when the administration reorganized the agriculture programs when he disliked a teaching assignment to manage an experiment station elsewhere and when he did not get summer teaching assignments in – in each case washington smoothed things over photograph of george washington carver taken by frances benjamin johnston in  carver started his academic career as a researcher and teacher in  washington wrote a letter to him complaining that carver had not followed orders to plant particular crops at the experiment station this revealed washingtons micromanagement of carvers department which he had headed for more than  years by then washington at the same time refused carvers requests for a new laboratory research supplies for his exclusive use and respite from teaching classes washington praised carvers abilities in teaching and original research but said about his administrative skills when it comes to the organization of classes the ability required to secure a properly organized and large school or section of a school you are wanting in ability when it comes to the matter of practical farm managing which will secure definite practical financial results you are wanting again in ability in  carver complained that his laboratory had not received the equipment which washington had promised  months before he also complained about institute committee meetings washington praised carver in his  memoir my larger education being chapters from my experience washington called carver one of the most thoroughly scientific men of the negro race with whom i am acquainted after washington died in  his successor made fewer demands on carver for administrative tasks while a professor at tuskegee carver joined the gamma sigma chapter of phi beta sigma fraternity he spoke at the  conclave that was held at tuskegee alabama in which he delivered a powerful and emotional speech to the men in attendance from  to  carver concentrated on researching and experimenting with new uses for peanuts sweet potatoes soybeans pecans and other crops as well as having his assistants research and compile existing uses this work and especially his speaking to a national conference of the peanut growers association in  and in testimony before congress in  to support passage of a tariff on imported peanuts brought him wide publicity and increasing renown in these years he became one of the most wellknown african americans of his time rise to fame one of americas great scientists us world war ii poster circa  carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton together with other agricultural experts he urged farmers to restore nitrogen to their soils by practicing systematic crop rotation alternating cotton crops with plantings of sweet potatoes or legumes such as peanuts soybeans and cowpeas these crops both restored nitrogen to the soil and were good for human consumption following the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields and gave farmers alternative cash crops to train farmers to successfully rotate and cultivate the new crops carver developed an agricultural extension program for alabama that was similar to the one at iowa state to encourage better nutrition in the south he widely distributed recipes using the alternative crops in addition he founded an industrial research laboratory where he and assistants worked to popularize the new crops by developing hundreds of applications for them they did original research as well as promoting applications and recipes which they collected from others carver distributed his information as agricultural bulletins peanut specimen collected by carver carvers work was known by officials in the national capital before he became a public figure president theodore roosevelt publicly admired his work former professors of carvers from iowa state university were appointed to positions as secretary of agriculture james wilson a former dean and professor of carvers served from  to  henry cantwell wallace served from  to

president from  to  the american industrialist farmer and inventor william edenborn of winn parish louisiana grew peanuts on his demonstration farm he consulted with carver in  carver was made a member of the royal society of arts in england one of only a handful of americans at that time to receive this honor carvers promotion of peanuts gained him the most notice in  carver wrote to a peanut company about the potential he saw for peanut milk both he and the peanut industry seemed unaware that in  william melhuish had secured us  issued   for a milk substitute made from peanuts and soybeansimproper synthesis the united peanut associations of america invited carver to speak at their  convention he discussed the possibilities of the peanut and exhibited  peanut products by  the us peanut farmers were being undercut by low prices on imported peanuts from the republic of china in  peanut farmers and industry representatives planned to appear at congressional hearings to ask for a tariff based on the quality of carvers presentation at their convention they asked the africanamerican professor to testify on the tariff issue before the ways and means committee of the united states house of representatives due to segregation it was highly unusual for an african american to appear as an expert witness at congress representing europeanamerican industry and farmers southern congressmen reportedly shocked at carvers arriving to testify were said to have mocked himcitation needed as he talked about the importance of the peanut and its uses for american agriculture the committee members repeatedly extended the time for his testimony the fordneymccumber tariff of  was passed including one on imported peanuts carvers testifying to congress made him widely known as a public figure life while famous united states farm security administration portrait march  during the last two decades of his life carver seemed to enjoy his celebrity status he was often on the road promoting tuskegee university peanuts and racial harmony although he only published six agricultural bulletins after  he published articles in peanut industry journals and wrote a syndicated newspaper column professor carvers advice business leaders came to seek his help and he often responded with free advice three american presidents—theodore roosevelt calvin coolidge and franklin roosevelt—met with him and the crown prince of sweden studied with him for three weeks from  to  carver toured white southern colleges for the commission on interracial cooperation with his increasing notability carver became the subject of biographies and articles raleigh h merritt contacted him for his biography published in  merritt wrote at present not a great deal has been done to utilize dr carvers discoveries commercially he says that he is merely scratching the surface of scientific investigations of the possibilities of the peanut and other southern products in  the writer james saxon childers wrote that carver and his peanut products were almost solely responsible for the rise in us peanut production after the boll weevil devastated the american cotton crop beginning about  his article a boy who was traded for a horse  in the american magazine and its  reprint in readers digest contributed to this myth about carvers influence other popular media tended to exaggerate carvers impact on the peanut industry from  to  carver worked to develop peanut oil massages to treat infantile paralysis polio ultimately researchers found that the massages not the peanut oil provided the benefits of maintaining some mobility to paralyzed limbs from  to  carver participated in the usda disease survey carver had specialized in plant diseases and mycology for his masters degree in  carver attended two chemurgy conferences an emerging field in the s during the great depression and the dust bowl concerned with developing new products from crops he was invited by henry ford to speak at the conference held in dearborn michigan and they developed a friendship that year carvers health declined and ford later installed an elevator at the tuskegee dormitory where carver lived so that the elderly man would not have to climb stairs carver had been frugal in his life and in his seventies he established a legacy by creating a museum of his work as well as the george washington carver foundation at tuskegee in  to continue agricultural research he donated nearly us equivalent to  in  in his savings to create the foundation relationships austin curtis  scientist successor to dr carver cartoon by ch alston carver never married at age forty he began a courtship with sarah l hunt an elementary school teacher and the sisterinlaw of warren logan treasurer of tuskegee institute this lasted three years until she took a teaching job in california in her  biography christina vella reviews his relationships and suggests that carver was bisexual and constrained by mores of his historic period when he was seventy carver established a friendship and research partnership with the scientist austin w curtis jr this young black man a graduate of cornell university had some teaching experience before coming to tuskegee carver bequeathed to curtis his royalties from an authorized  biography by rackham holt after carver died in  curtis was fired from tuskegee institute he left alabama and resettled in detroit there he manufactured and sold peanutbased personal care products death painting by betsy graves reyneau upon returning home one day carver took a bad fall down a flight of stairs he was found unconscious by a maid who took him to a hospital carver died january   at the age of  from complications anemia resulting from this fall he was buried next to booker t washington at tuskegee university due to his frugality carvers life savings totaled  all of which he donated in his last years and at his death to the carver museum and to the george washington carver foundation on his grave was written he could have added fortune to fame but caring for neither he found happiness and honor in being helpful to the world voice pitch even as an adult carver spoke with a high pitch historian linda o mcmurry noted that he was a frail and sickly child who suffered from a severe case of whooping cough and frequent bouts of what was called croup mcmurry contested the diagnosis of croup holding rather that his stunted growth and apparently impaired vocal chords suggest instead tubercular or pneumococcal infection frequent infections of that nature could have caused the growth of polyps on the larynx and may have resulted from a gamma globulin deficiency until his death the high pitch of his voice startled all who met him and he suffered from frequent chest congestion and loss of voice mcmurry also examined the theory that carvers vocal pitch was due to being castrated as a child she noted that persistent rumours held he was castrated either by his kidnappers or his owner moses carver she maintained these accounts were unlikely as a person castrated before puberty almost never displays any secondary sexual characteristics and seldom grows to normal stature while carvers voice never deepened he reached normal height and grew facial hair she also pointed out that it was extremely unlikely that carver would have maintained affection for moses if he had castrated him but he retained obvious affection for mosesafter he left diamond he returned on several occasions to visit the carvers even after susans death mcmurry admitted that the castration theory cant be dismissed entirely she pointed to carvers reply in  to a friends question on why he never married  he had replied obliquely to a tragic incident in his past that precluded him from marriage mcmurry further noted he was also very reluctant to discuss the years between his departure from diamond and his arrival at iowa state often declaring that there were some things that he would rather forget mcmurry pointed out that after puberty castration or testicular failure due to accident or illness would not prevent the development of secondary sexual characteristics she also pointed out that carvers failure to marry was not proof of castration as it can be explained in other ways christianity george washington carver believed he could have faith both in god and science and integrated them into his life he testified on many occasions that his faith in jesus was the only mechanism by which he could effectively pursue and perform the art of science george washington carver became a christian when he was still a young boy as he wrote in connection to his conversion in  i was just a mere boy when converted hardly ten years old there isnt much of a story to it god just came into my heart one afternoon while i was alone in the loft of our big barn while i was shelling corn to carry to the mill to be ground into meal a dear little white boy one of our neighbors about my age came by one saturday morning and in talking and playing he told me he was going to sunday school tomorrow morning i was eager to know what a sunday school was he said they sang hymns and prayed i asked him what prayer was and what they said i do not remember what he said only remember that as soon as he left i climbed up into the loft knelt down by the barrel of corn and prayed as best i could i do not remember what i said i only recall that i felt so good that i prayed several times before i quit my brother and myself were the only colored children in that neighborhood and of course we could not go to church or sunday school or school of any kind that was my simple conversion and i have tried to keep the faith — g w carver letter to isabelle coleman july   he was not expected to live past his twentyfirst birthday due to failing health he lived well past the age of twentyone and his belief deepened as a result throughout his career he always found friendship with other christians he relied on them especially when criticized by the scientific community and media regarding his research methodology carver viewed faith in jesus christ as a means of destroying both barriers of racial disharmony and social stratification he was as concerned with his students character development as he was with their intellectual development he compiled a list of eight cardinal virtues for his students to strive toward a monument to carver at the missouri botanical garden in st louis be clean both inside and out neither look up to the rich nor down on the poor

monument to carver began before his death because of world war ii such nonwar expenditures had been banned by presidential order missouri senator harry s truman sponsored a bill in favor of a monument in a committee hearing on the bill one supporter said the bill is not simply a momentary pause on the part of busy men engaged in the conduct of the war to do honor to one of the truly great americans of this country but it is in essence a blow against the axis it is in essence a war measure in the sense that it will further unleash and release the energies of roughly  negro people in this country for full support of our war effort the bill passed unanimously in both houses on july   president franklin d roosevelt dedicated  for the george washington carver national monument westsouthwest of

cultural center a historic center located in san antonio is named for him reputed inventions carver was given credit in popular folklore for many inventions that did not come out of his lab three patents one for cosmetics us  issued   and two for paints and stains us  issued   and us  issued   were issued to carver in  to  however they were not commercially successful aside from these patents and some recipes for food carver left no records of formulae or procedures for making his products he did not keep a laboratory notebook mackintosh notes that carver did not explicitly claim that he had personally discovered all the peanut attributes and uses he cited but he said nothing to prevent his audiences from drawing the inference carvers research was intended to produce replacements from common crops for commercial products which were generally beyond the budget of the small onehorse farmer a misconception grew that his research on products for subsistence farmers were developed by others commercially to change southern agriculture carvers work to provide small farmers with resources for more independence from the cash economy foreshadowed the appropriate technology work of e f schumacher peanut products dennis keeney director of the leopold center for sustainable agriculture at iowa state university wrote in the leopold letter newsletter carver worked on improving soils growing crops with low inputs and using species that fixed nitrogen hence the work on the cowpea and the peanut carver wrote in the need of scientific agriculture in the south the virgin fertility of our soils and the vast amount of unskilled labor have been more of a curse than a blessing to agriculture this exhaustive system for cultivation the destruction of forest the rapid and almost constant decomposition of organic matter have made our agricultural problem one requiring more brains than of the north east or west carver worked for years to create a company to market his products the most important was the carver penol company which sold a mixture of creosote and peanuts as a patent medicine for respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis sales were lackluster and the product was ineffective according to the food and drug administration other ventures were the carver products company and the carvoline company carvoline antiseptic hair dressing was a mix of peanut oil and lanolin carvoline rubbing oil was a peanut oil for massages carver is often mistakenly credited with the invention of peanut butter by the time carver published how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption in  many methods of preparation of peanut butter had been developed or patented by various pharmacists doctors and food scientists working in the us and canada the aztec were known to have made peanut butter from ground peanuts as early as the th century canadian pharmacist marcellus gilmore edson was awarded us patent  for its manufacture in   years before carver began his work at tuskegee sweet potato products carver is also associated with developing sweet potato products in his  sweet potato bulletin carver listed a few dozen recipes many of which i have copied verbatim from bulletin no  u s department of agriculture carvers records included the following sweet potato products  dyes  wood fillers  candies  library pastes  breakfast foods  starches  flours and  molasses he also had listings for vinegars dry coffee and instant coffee candy afterdinner mints orange drops and lemon drops carver bulletins during his more than four decades at tuskegee carvers official published work consisted mainly of  practical bulletins for farmers his first bulletin in  was on feeding acorns to farm animals his final bulletin in  was about the peanut he also published six bulletins on sweet potatoes five on cotton and four on cowpeas some other individual bulletins dealt with alfalfa wild plum tomato ornamental plants corn poultry dairying hogs preserving meats in hot weather and nature study in schools his most popular bulletin how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption was first published in  and was reprinted many times it gave a short overview of peanut crop production and contained a list of recipes from other agricultural bulletins cookbooks magazines and newspapers such as the peerless cookbook good housekeeping and berrys fruit recipes carvers was far from the first american agricultural bulletin devoted to peanuts but his bulletins did seem to be more popular and widespread than previous ones the standard author abbreviation carver is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name see also african american portal biography portal science portal

of plants and flowers and a geological collection he manually plowed  acres  m of the claim planting rice corn indian corn and garden produce as well as various fruit trees forest trees and shrubbery he also earned money by odd jobs in town and worked as a ranch hand in early  carver obtained a  loan at the bank of ness city for education by june he left the area in  carver started studying art and piano at simpson college in indianola iowa his art teacher etta budd recognized carvers talent for painting flowers and plants she encouraged him to study botany at iowa state agricultural college in ames when he began there in  he was the first black student carvers bachelors thesis was plants as modified by man dated  iowa state professors joseph budd and louis pammel convinced carver to continue there for his masters degree carver did research at the iowa experiment station under pammel during the next two years his work at the experiment station in plant pathology and mycology first gained him national recognition and respect as a botanist carver taught as the first black faculty member at iowa state tuskegee institute george washington carver front row center poses with fellow faculty of tuskegee institute in this c  photograph taken by frances benjamin johnston in  booker t washington the first principal and president of the tuskegee institute invited carver to head its agriculture department carver taught there for  years developing the department into a strong research center and working with two additional college presidents during his tenure he taught methods of crop rotation introduced several alternative cash crops for farmers that would also improve the soil of areas heavily cultivated in cotton initiated research into crop products chemurgy and taught generations of black students farming techniques for selfsufficiency carver designed a mobile classroom to take education out to farmers he called it a jesup wagon after the new york financier and philanthropist morris ketchum jesup who provided funding to support the program to recruit carver to tuskegee washington gave him an above average salary and two rooms for his personal use although both concessions were resented by some other faculty because he had earned a masters in a scientific field from a white institution some faculty perceived him as arrogant unmarried faculty members normally had to share rooms with two to a room in the spartan early days of the institute one of carvers duties was to administer the agricultural experiment station farms he had to manage the production and sale of farm products to generate revenue for the institute he soon proved to be a poor administrator in  carver complained that the physical work and the letterwriting required were too much in  an institute committee reported that carvers reports on yields from the poultry yard were exaggerated and washington confronted carver about the issue carver replied in writing now to be branded as a liar and party to such hellish deception it is more than i can bear and if your committee feel that i have willfully lied or was party to such lies as were told my resignation is at your disposal during washingtons last five years at tuskegee carver submitted or threatened his resignation several times when the administration reorganized the agriculture programs when he disliked a teaching assignment to manage an experiment station elsewhere and when he did not get summer teaching assignments in – in each case washington smoothed things over photograph of george washington carver taken by frances benjamin johnston in  carver started his academic career as a researcher and teacher in  washington wrote a letter to him complaining that carver had not followed orders to plant particular crops at the experiment station this revealed washingtons micromanagement of carvers department which he had headed for more than  years by then washington at the same time refused carvers requests for a new laboratory research supplies for his exclusive use and respite from teaching classes washington praised carvers abilities in teaching and original research but said about his administrative skills when it comes to the organization of classes the ability required to secure a properly organized and large school or section of a school you are wanting in ability when it comes to the matter of practical farm managing which will secure definite practical financial results you are wanting again in ability in  carver complained that his laboratory had not received the equipment which washington had promised  months before he also complained about institute committee meetings washington praised carver in his  memoir my larger education being chapters from my experience washington called carver one of the most thoroughly scientific men of the negro race with whom i am acquainted after washington died in  his successor made fewer demands on carver for administrative tasks while a professor at tuskegee carver joined the gamma sigma chapter of phi beta sigma fraternity he spoke at the  conclave that was held at tuskegee alabama in which he delivered a powerful and emotional speech to the men in attendance from  to  carver concentrated on researching and experimenting with new uses for peanuts sweet potatoes soybeans pecans and other crops as well as having his assistants research and compile existing uses this work and especially his speaking to a national conference of the peanut growers association in  and in testimony before congress in  to support passage of a tariff on imported peanuts brought him wide publicity and increasing renown in these years he became one of the most wellknown african americans of his time rise to fame one of americas great scientists us world war ii poster circa  carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton together with other agricultural experts he urged farmers to restore nitrogen to their soils by practicing systematic crop rotation alternating cotton crops with plantings of sweet potatoes or legumes such as peanuts soybeans and cowpeas these crops both restored nitrogen to the soil and were good for human consumption following the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields and gave farmers alternative cash crops to train farmers to successfully rotate and cultivate the new crops carver developed an agricultural extension program for alabama that was similar to the one at iowa state to encourage better nutrition in the south he widely distributed recipes using the alternative crops in addition he founded an industrial research laboratory where he and assistants worked to popularize the new crops by developing hundreds of applications for them they did original research as well as promoting applications and recipes which they collected from others carver distributed his information as agricultural bulletins peanut specimen collected by carver carvers work was known by officials in the national capital before he became a public figure president theodore roosevelt publicly admired his work former professors of carvers from iowa state university were appointed to positions as secretary of agriculture james wilson a former dean and professor of carvers served from  to  henry cantwell wallace served from  to  he knew carver personally because his son henry a wallace and the researcher were friends the younger wallace served as us secretary of agriculture from  to  and as franklin delano roosevelts vice president from  to  the american industrialist farmer and inventor william edenborn of winn parish louisiana grew peanuts on his demonstration farm he consulted with carver in  carver was made a member of the royal society of arts in england one of only a handful of americans at that time to receive this honor carvers promotion of peanuts gained him the most notice in  carver wrote to a peanut company about the potential he saw for peanut milk both he and the peanut industry seemed unaware that in  william melhuish had secured us  issued   for a milk substitute made from peanuts and soybeansimproper synthesis the united peanut associations of america invited carver to speak at their  convention he discussed the possibilities of the peanut and exhibited  peanut products by  the us peanut farmers were being undercut by low prices on imported peanuts from the republic of china in  peanut farmers and industry representatives planned to appear at congressional hearings to ask for a tariff based on the quality of carvers presentation at their convention they asked the africanamerican professor to testify on the tariff issue before the ways and means committee of the united states house of representatives due to segregation it was highly unusual for an african american to appear as an expert witness at congress representing europeanamerican industry and farmers southern congressmen reportedly shocked at carvers arriving to testify were said to have mocked himcitation needed as he talked about the importance of the peanut and its uses for american agriculture the committee members repeatedly extended the time for his testimony the fordneymccumber tariff of  was passed including one on imported peanuts carvers testifying to congress made him widely known as a public figure life while famous united states farm security administration portrait march  during the last two decades of his life carver seemed to enjoy his celebrity status he was often on the road promoting tuskegee university peanuts and racial harmony although he only published six agricultural bulletins after  he published articles in peanut industry journals and wrote a syndicated newspaper column professor carvers advice business leaders came to seek his help and he often responded with free advice three american presidents—theodore roosevelt calvin coolidge and franklin roosevelt—met with him and the crown prince of sweden studied with him for three weeks from  to  carver toured white southern colleges for the commission on interracial cooperation with his increasing notability carver became the subject of biographies and articles raleigh h merritt contacted him for his biography published in  merritt wrote at present not a great deal has been done to utilize dr carvers discoveries commercially he says that he is merely scratching the surface of scientific investigations of the possibilities of the peanut and other southern products in  the writer james saxon childers wrote that carver and his peanut products were almost solely responsible for the rise in us peanut production after the boll weevil devastated the american cotton crop beginning about  his article a boy who was traded for a horse  in the american magazine and its  reprint in readers digest contributed to this myth about carvers influence other popular media tended to exaggerate carvers impact on the peanut industry from  to  carver worked to develop peanut oil massages to treat infantile paralysis polio ultimately researchers found that the massages not the peanut oil provided the benefits of maintaining some mobility to paralyzed limbs from  to  carver participated in the usda disease survey carver had specialized in plant diseases and mycology for his masters degree in  carver attended two chemurgy conferences an emerging field in the s during the great depression and the dust bowl concerned with developing new products from crops he was invited by henry ford to speak at the conference held in dearborn michigan and they developed a friendship that year carvers health declined and ford later installed an elevator at the tuskegee dormitory where carver lived so that the elderly man would not have to climb stairs carver had been frugal in his life and in his seventies he established a legacy by creating a museum of his work as well as the george washington carver foundation at tuskegee in  to continue agricultural research he donated nearly us equivalent to  in  in his savings to create the foundation relationships austin curtis  scientist successor to dr carver cartoon by ch alston carver never married at age forty he began a courtship with sarah l hunt an elementary school teacher and the sisterinlaw of warren logan treasurer of tuskegee institute this lasted three years until she took a teaching job in california in her  biography christina vella reviews his relationships and suggests that carver was bisexual and constrained by mores of his historic period when he was seventy carver established a friendship and research partnership with the scientist austin w curtis jr this young black man a graduate of cornell university had some teaching experience before coming to tuskegee carver bequeathed to curtis his royalties from an authorized  biography by rackham holt after carver died in  curtis was fired from tuskegee institute he left alabama and resettled in detroit there he manufactured and sold peanutbased personal care products death painting by betsy graves reyneau upon returning home one day carver took a bad fall down a flight of stairs he was found unconscious by a maid who took him to a hospital carver died january   at the age of  from complications anemia resulting from this fall he was buried next to booker t washington at tuskegee university due to his frugality carvers life savings totaled  all of which he donated in his last years and at his death to the carver museum and to the george washington carver foundation on his grave was written he could have added fortune to fame but caring for neither he found happiness and honor in being helpful to the world voice pitch even as an adult carver spoke with a high pitch historian linda o mcmurry noted that he was a frail and sickly child who suffered from a severe case of whooping cough and frequent bouts of what was called croup mcmurry contested the diagnosis of croup holding rather that his stunted growth and apparently impaired vocal chords suggest instead tubercular or pneumococcal infection frequent infections of that nature could have caused the growth of polyps on the larynx and may have resulted from a gamma globulin deficiency until his death the high pitch of his voice startled all who met him and he suffered from frequent chest congestion and loss of voice mcmurry also examined the theory that carvers vocal pitch was due to being castrated as a child she noted that persistent rumours held he was castrated either by his kidnappers or his owner moses carver she maintained these accounts were unlikely as a person castrated before puberty almost never displays any secondary sexual characteristics and seldom grows to normal stature while carvers voice never deepened he reached normal height and grew facial hair she also pointed out that it was extremely unlikely that carver would have maintained affection for moses if he had castrated him but he retained obvious affection for mosesafter he left diamond he returned on several occasions to visit the carvers even after susans death mcmurry admitted that the castration theory cant be dismissed entirely she pointed to carvers reply in  to a friends question on why he never married  he had replied obliquely to a tragic incident in his past that precluded him from marriage mcmurry further noted he was also very reluctant to discuss the years between his departure from diamond and his arrival at iowa state often declaring that there were some things that he would rather forget mcmurry pointed out that after puberty castration or testicular failure due to accident or illness would not prevent the development of secondary sexual characteristics she also pointed out that carvers failure to marry was not proof of castration as it can be explained in other ways christianity george washington carver believed he could have faith both in god and science and integrated them into his life he testified on many occasions that his faith in jesus was the only mechanism by which he could effectively pursue and perform the art of science george washington carver became a christian when he was still a young boy as he wrote in connection to his conversion in  i was just a mere boy when converted hardly ten years old there isnt much of a story to it god just came into my heart one afternoon while i was alone in the loft of our big barn while i was shelling corn to carry to the mill to be ground into meal a dear little white boy one of our neighbors about my age came by one saturday morning and in talking and playing he told me he was going to sunday school tomorrow morning i was eager to know what a sunday school was he said they sang hymns and prayed i asked him what prayer was and what they said i do not remember what he said only remember that as soon as he left i climbed up into the loft knelt down by the barrel of corn and prayed as best i could i do not remember what i said i only recall that i felt so good that i prayed several times before i quit my brother and myself were the only colored children in that neighborhood and of course we could not go to church or sunday school or school of any kind that was my simple conversion and i have tried to keep the faith — g w carver letter to isabelle coleman july   he was not expected to live past his twentyfirst birthday due to failing health he lived well past the age of twentyone and his belief deepened as a result throughout his career he always found friendship with other christians he relied on them especially when criticized by the scientific community and media regarding his research methodology carver viewed faith in jesus christ as a means of destroying both barriers of racial disharmony and social stratification he was as concerned with his students character development as he was with their intellectual development he compiled a list of eight cardinal virtues for his students to strive toward a monument to carver at the missouri botanical garden in st louis be clean both inside and out neither look up to the rich nor down on the poor

monument to carver began before his death because of world war ii such nonwar expenditures had been banned by presidential order missouri senator harry s truman sponsored a bill in favor of a monument in a committee hearing on the bill one supporter said the bill is not simply a momentary pause on the part of busy men engaged in the conduct of the war to do honor to one of the truly great americans of this country but it is in essence a blow against the axis it is in essence a war measure in the sense that it will further unleash and release the energies of roughly  negro people in this country for full support of our war effort the bill passed unanimously in both houses on july   president franklin d roosevelt dedicated  for the george washington carver national monument westsouthwest of

named after him national basketball association star david robinson and his wife valerie founded an academy named after carver it opened on september   in san antonio texas the carver community cultural center a historic center located in san antonio is named for him reputed inventions carver was given credit in popular folklore for many inventions that did not come out of his lab three patents one for cosmetics us  issued   and two for paints and stains us  issued   and us  issued   were issued to carver in  to  however they were not commercially successful aside from these patents and some recipes for food carver left no records of formulae or procedures for making his products he did not keep a laboratory notebook mackintosh notes that carver did not explicitly claim that he had personally discovered all the peanut attributes and uses he cited but he said nothing to prevent his audiences from drawing the inference carvers research was intended to produce replacements from common crops for commercial products which were generally beyond the budget of the small onehorse farmer a misconception grew that his research on products for subsistence farmers were developed by others commercially to change southern agriculture carvers work to provide small farmers with resources for more independence from the cash economy foreshadowed the appropriate technology work of e f schumacher peanut products dennis keeney director of the leopold center for sustainable agriculture at iowa state university wrote in the leopold letter newsletter carver worked on improving soils growing crops with low inputs and using species that fixed nitrogen hence the work on the cowpea and the peanut carver wrote in the need of scientific agriculture in the south the virgin fertility of our soils and the vast amount of unskilled labor have been more of a curse than a blessing to agriculture this exhaustive system for cultivation the destruction of forest the rapid and almost constant decomposition of organic matter have made our agricultural problem one requiring more brains than of the north east or west carver worked for years to create a company to market his products the most important was the carver penol company which sold a mixture of creosote and peanuts as a patent medicine for respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis sales were lackluster and the product was ineffective according to the food and drug administration other ventures were the carver products company and the carvoline company carvoline antiseptic hair dressing was a mix of peanut oil and lanolin carvoline rubbing oil was a peanut oil for massages carver is often mistakenly credited with the invention of peanut butter by the time carver published how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption in  many methods of preparation of peanut butter had been developed or patented by various pharmacists doctors and food scientists working in the us and canada the aztec were known to have made peanut butter from ground peanuts as early as the th century canadian pharmacist marcellus gilmore edson was awarded us patent  for its manufacture in   years before carver began his work at tuskegee sweet potato products carver is also associated with developing sweet potato products in his  sweet potato bulletin carver listed a few dozen recipes many of which i have copied verbatim from bulletin no  u s department of agriculture carvers records included the following sweet potato products  dyes  wood fillers  candies  library pastes  breakfast foods  starches  flours and  molasses he also had listings for vinegars dry coffee and instant coffee candy afterdinner mints orange drops and lemon drops carver bulletins during his more than four decades at tuskegee carvers official published work consisted mainly of  practical bulletins for farmers his first bulletin in  was on feeding acorns to farm animals his final bulletin in  was about the peanut he also published six bulletins on sweet potatoes five on cotton and four on cowpeas some other individual bulletins dealt with alfalfa wild plum tomato ornamental plants corn poultry dairying hogs preserving meats in hot weather and nature study in schools his most popular bulletin how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption was first published in  and was reprinted many times it gave a short overview of peanut crop production and contained a list of recipes from other agricultural bulletins cookbooks magazines and newspapers such as the peerless cookbook good housekeeping and berrys fruit recipes carvers was far from the first american agricultural bulletin devoted to peanuts but his bulletins did seem to be more popular and widespread than previous ones the standard author abbreviation carver is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name see also african american portal biography portal science portal

continue there for his masters degree carver did research at the iowa experiment station under pammel during the next two years his work at the experiment station in plant pathology and mycology first gained him national recognition and respect as a botanist carver taught as the first black faculty member at iowa state tuskegee institute george washington carver front row center poses with fellow faculty of tuskegee institute in this c  photograph taken by frances benjamin johnston in  booker t washington the first principal and president of the tuskegee institute invited carver to head its agriculture department carver taught there for  years developing the department into a strong research center and working with two additional college presidents during his tenure he taught methods of crop rotation introduced several alternative cash crops for farmers that would also improve the soil of areas heavily cultivated in cotton initiated research into crop products chemurgy and taught generations of black students farming techniques for selfsufficiency carver designed a mobile classroom to take education out to farmers he called it a jesup wagon after the new york financier and philanthropist morris ketchum jesup who provided funding to support the program to recruit carver to tuskegee washington gave him an above average salary and two rooms for his personal use although both concessions were resented by some other faculty because he had earned a masters in a scientific field from a white institution some faculty perceived him as arrogant unmarried faculty members normally had to share rooms with two to a room in the spartan early days of the institute one of carvers duties was to administer the agricultural experiment station farms he had to manage the production and sale of farm products to generate revenue for the institute he soon proved to be a poor administrator in  carver complained that the physical work and the letterwriting required were too much in  an institute committee reported that carvers reports on yields from the poultry yard were exaggerated and washington confronted carver about the issue carver replied in writing now to be branded as a liar and party to such hellish deception it is more than i can bear and if your committee feel that i have willfully lied or was party to such lies as were told my resignation is at your disposal during washingtons last five years at tuskegee carver submitted or threatened his resignation several times when the administration reorganized the agriculture programs when he disliked a teaching assignment to manage an experiment station elsewhere and when he did not get summer teaching assignments in – in each case washington smoothed things over photograph of george washington carver taken by frances benjamin johnston in  carver started his academic career as a researcher and teacher in  washington wrote a letter to him complaining that carver had not followed orders to plant particular crops at the experiment station this revealed washingtons micromanagement of carvers department which he had headed for more than  years by then washington at the same time refused carvers requests for a new laboratory research supplies for his exclusive use and respite from teaching classes washington praised carvers abilities in teaching and original research but said about his administrative skills when it comes to the organization of classes the ability required to secure a properly organized and large school or section of a school you are wanting in ability when it comes to the matter of practical farm managing which will secure definite practical financial results you are wanting again in ability in  carver complained that his laboratory had not received the equipment which washington had promised  months before he also complained about institute committee meetings washington praised carver in his  memoir my larger education being chapters from my experience washington called carver one of the most thoroughly scientific men of the negro race with whom i am acquainted after washington died in  his successor made fewer demands on carver for administrative tasks while a professor at tuskegee carver joined the gamma sigma chapter of phi beta sigma fraternity he spoke at the  conclave that was held at tuskegee alabama in which he delivered a powerful and emotional speech to the men in attendance from  to  carver concentrated on researching and experimenting with new uses for peanuts sweet potatoes soybeans pecans and other crops as well as having his assistants research and compile existing uses this work and especially his speaking to a national conference of the peanut growers association in  and in testimony before congress in  to support passage of a tariff on imported peanuts brought him wide publicity and increasing renown in these years he became one of the most wellknown african americans of his time rise to fame one of americas great scientists us world war ii poster circa  carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton together with other agricultural experts he urged farmers to restore nitrogen to their soils by practicing systematic crop rotation alternating cotton crops with plantings of sweet potatoes or legumes such as peanuts soybeans and cowpeas these crops both restored nitrogen to the soil and were good for human consumption following the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields and gave farmers alternative cash crops to train farmers to successfully rotate and cultivate the new crops carver developed an agricultural extension program for alabama that was similar to the one at iowa state to encourage better nutrition in the south he widely distributed recipes using the alternative crops in addition he founded an industrial research laboratory where he and assistants worked to popularize the new crops by developing hundreds of applications for them they did original research as well as promoting applications and recipes which they collected from others carver distributed his information as agricultural bulletins peanut specimen collected by carver carvers work was known by officials in the national capital before he became a public figure president theodore roosevelt publicly admired his work former professors of carvers from iowa state university were appointed to positions as secretary of agriculture james wilson a former dean and professor of carvers served from  to  henry cantwell wallace served from  to

member of the royal society of arts in england one of only a handful of americans at that time to receive this honor carvers promotion of peanuts gained him the most notice in  carver wrote to a peanut company about the potential he saw for peanut milk both he and the peanut industry seemed unaware that in  william melhuish had secured us  issued   for a milk substitute made from peanuts and soybeansimproper synthesis the united peanut associations of america invited carver to speak at their  convention he discussed the possibilities of the peanut and exhibited  peanut products by  the us peanut farmers were being undercut by low prices on imported peanuts from the republic of china in  peanut farmers and industry representatives planned to appear at congressional hearings to ask for a tariff based on the quality of carvers presentation at their convention they asked the africanamerican professor to testify on the tariff issue before the ways and means committee of the united states house of representatives due to segregation it was highly unusual for an african american to appear as an expert witness at congress representing europeanamerican industry and farmers southern congressmen reportedly shocked at carvers arriving to testify were said to have mocked himcitation needed as he talked about the importance of the peanut and its uses for american agriculture the committee members repeatedly extended the time for his testimony the fordneymccumber tariff of  was passed including one on imported peanuts carvers testifying to congress made him widely known as a public figure life while famous united states farm security administration portrait march  during the last two decades of his life carver seemed to enjoy his celebrity status he was often on the road promoting tuskegee university peanuts and racial harmony although he only published six agricultural bulletins after  he published articles in peanut industry journals and wrote a syndicated newspaper column professor carvers advice business leaders came to seek his help and he often responded with free advice three american presidents—theodore roosevelt calvin coolidge and franklin roosevelt—met with him and the crown prince of sweden studied with him for three weeks from  to  carver toured white southern colleges for the commission on interracial cooperation with his increasing notability carver became the subject of biographies and articles raleigh h merritt contacted him for his biography published in  merritt wrote at present not a great deal has been done to utilize dr carvers discoveries commercially he says that he is merely scratching the surface of scientific investigations of the possibilities of the peanut and other southern products in  the writer james saxon childers wrote that carver and his peanut products were almost solely responsible for the rise in us peanut production after the boll weevil devastated the american cotton crop beginning about  his article a boy who was traded for a horse  in the american magazine and its  reprint in readers digest contributed to this myth about carvers influence other popular media tended to exaggerate carvers impact on the peanut industry from  to  carver worked to develop peanut oil massages to treat infantile paralysis polio ultimately researchers found that the massages not the peanut oil provided the benefits of maintaining some mobility to paralyzed limbs from  to  carver participated in the usda disease survey carver had specialized in plant diseases and mycology for his masters degree in  carver attended two chemurgy conferences an emerging field in the s during the great depression and the dust bowl concerned with developing new products from crops he was invited by henry ford to speak at the conference held in dearborn michigan and they developed a friendship that year carvers health declined and ford later installed an elevator at the tuskegee dormitory where carver lived so that the elderly man would not have to climb stairs carver had been frugal in his life and in his seventies he established a legacy by creating a museum of his work as well as the george washington carver foundation at tuskegee in  to continue agricultural research he donated nearly us equivalent to  in  in his savings to create the foundation relationships austin curtis  scientist successor to dr carver cartoon by ch alston carver never married at age forty he began a courtship with sarah l hunt an elementary school teacher and the sisterinlaw of warren logan treasurer of tuskegee institute this lasted three years until she took a teaching job in california in her  biography christina vella reviews his relationships and suggests that carver was bisexual and constrained by mores of his historic period when he was seventy carver established a friendship and research partnership with the scientist austin w curtis jr this young black man a graduate of cornell university had some teaching experience before coming to tuskegee carver bequeathed to curtis his royalties from an authorized  biography by rackham holt after carver died in  curtis was fired from tuskegee institute he left alabama and resettled in detroit there he manufactured and sold peanutbased personal care products death painting by betsy graves reyneau upon returning home one day carver took a bad fall down a flight of stairs he was found unconscious by a maid who took him to a hospital carver died january   at the age of  from complications anemia resulting from this fall he was buried next to booker t washington at tuskegee university due to his frugality carvers life savings totaled  all of which he donated in his last years and at his death to the carver museum and to the george washington carver foundation on his grave was written he could have added fortune to fame but caring for neither he found happiness and honor in being helpful to the world voice pitch even as an adult carver spoke with a high pitch historian linda o mcmurry noted that he was a frail and sickly child who suffered from a severe case of whooping cough and frequent bouts of what was called croup mcmurry contested the diagnosis of croup holding rather that his stunted growth and apparently impaired vocal chords suggest instead tubercular or pneumococcal infection frequent infections of that nature could have caused the growth of polyps on the larynx and may have resulted from a gamma globulin deficiency until his death the high pitch of his voice startled all who met him and he suffered from frequent chest congestion and loss of voice mcmurry also examined the theory that carvers vocal pitch was due to being castrated as a child she noted that persistent rumours held he was castrated either by his kidnappers or his owner moses carver she maintained these accounts were unlikely as a person castrated before puberty almost never displays any secondary sexual characteristics and seldom grows to normal stature while carvers voice never deepened he reached normal height and grew facial hair she also pointed out that it was extremely unlikely that carver would have maintained affection for moses if he had castrated him but he retained obvious affection for mosesafter he left diamond he returned on several occasions to visit the carvers even after susans death mcmurry admitted that the castration theory cant be dismissed entirely she pointed to carvers reply in  to a friends question on why he never married  he had replied obliquely to a tragic incident in his past that precluded him from marriage mcmurry further noted he was also very reluctant to discuss the years between his departure from diamond and his arrival at iowa state often declaring that there were some things that he would rather forget mcmurry pointed out that after puberty castration or testicular failure due to accident or illness would not prevent the development of secondary sexual characteristics she also pointed out that carvers failure to marry was not proof of castration as it can be explained in other ways christianity george washington carver believed he could have faith both in god and science and integrated them into his life he testified on many occasions that his faith in jesus was the only mechanism by which he could effectively pursue and perform the art of science george washington carver became a christian when he was still a young boy as he wrote in connection to his conversion in  i was just a mere boy when converted hardly ten years old there isnt much of a story to it god just came into my heart one afternoon while i was alone in the loft of our big barn while i was shelling corn to carry to the mill to be ground into meal a dear little white boy one of our neighbors about my age came by one saturday morning and in talking and playing he told me he was going to sunday school tomorrow morning i was eager to know what a sunday school was he said they sang hymns and prayed i asked him what prayer was and what they said i do not remember what he said only remember that as soon as he left i climbed up into the loft knelt down by the barrel of corn and prayed as best i could i do not remember what i said i only recall that i felt so good that i prayed several times before i quit my brother and myself were the only colored children in that neighborhood and of course we could not go to church or sunday school or school of any kind that was my simple conversion and i have tried to keep the faith — g w carver letter to isabelle coleman july   he was not expected to live past his twentyfirst birthday due to failing health he lived well past the age of twentyone and his belief deepened as a result throughout his career he always found friendship with other christians he relied on them especially when criticized by the scientific community and media regarding his research methodology carver viewed faith in jesus christ as a means of destroying both barriers of racial disharmony and social stratification he was as concerned with his students character development as he was with their intellectual development he compiled a list of eight cardinal virtues for his students to strive toward a monument to carver at the missouri botanical garden in st louis be clean both inside and out neither look up to the rich nor down on the poor

monument to carver began before his death because of world war ii such nonwar expenditures had been banned by presidential order missouri senator harry s truman sponsored a bill in favor of a monument in a committee hearing on the bill one supporter said the bill is not simply a momentary pause on the part of busy men engaged in the conduct of the war to do honor to one of the truly great americans of this country but it is in essence a blow against the axis it is in essence a war measure in the sense that it will further unleash and release the energies of roughly  negro people in this country for full support of our war effort the bill passed unanimously in both houses on july   president franklin d roosevelt dedicated  for the george washington carver national monument westsouthwest of

named after him national basketball association star david robinson and his wife valerie founded an academy named after carver it opened on september   in san antonio texas the carver community cultural center a historic center located in san antonio is named for him reputed inventions carver was given credit in popular folklore for many inventions that did not come out of his lab three patents one for cosmetics us  issued   and two for paints and stains us  issued   and us  issued   were issued to carver in  to  however they were not commercially successful aside from these patents and some recipes for food carver left no records of formulae or procedures for making his products he did not keep a laboratory notebook mackintosh notes that carver did not explicitly claim that he had personally discovered all the peanut attributes and uses he cited but he said nothing to prevent his audiences from drawing the inference carvers research was intended to produce replacements from common crops for commercial products which were generally beyond the budget of the small onehorse farmer a misconception grew that his research on products for subsistence farmers were developed by others commercially to change southern agriculture carvers work to provide small farmers with resources for more independence from the cash economy foreshadowed the appropriate technology work of e f schumacher peanut products dennis keeney director of the leopold center for sustainable agriculture at iowa state university wrote in the leopold letter newsletter carver worked on improving soils growing crops with low inputs and using species that fixed nitrogen hence the work on the cowpea and the peanut carver wrote in the need of scientific agriculture in the south the virgin fertility of our soils and the vast amount of unskilled labor have been more of a curse than a blessing to agriculture this exhaustive system for cultivation the destruction of forest the rapid and almost constant decomposition of organic matter have made our agricultural problem one requiring more brains than of the north east or west carver worked for years to create a company to market his products the most important was the carver penol company which sold a mixture of creosote and peanuts as a patent medicine for respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis sales were lackluster and the product was ineffective according to the food and drug administration other ventures were the carver products company and the carvoline company carvoline antiseptic hair dressing was a mix of peanut oil and lanolin carvoline rubbing oil was a peanut oil for massages carver is often mistakenly credited with the invention of peanut butter by the time carver published how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption in  many methods of preparation of peanut butter had been developed or patented by various pharmacists doctors and food scientists working in the us and canada the aztec were known to have made peanut butter from ground peanuts as early as the th century canadian pharmacist marcellus gilmore edson was awarded us patent  for its manufacture in   years before carver began his work at tuskegee sweet potato products carver is also associated with developing sweet potato products in his  sweet potato bulletin carver listed a few dozen recipes many of which i have copied verbatim from bulletin no  u s department of agriculture carvers records included the following sweet potato products  dyes  wood fillers  candies  library pastes  breakfast foods  starches  flours and  molasses he also had listings for vinegars dry coffee and instant coffee candy afterdinner mints orange drops and lemon drops carver bulletins during his more than four decades at tuskegee carvers official published work consisted mainly of  practical bulletins for farmers his first bulletin in  was on feeding acorns to farm animals his final bulletin in  was about the peanut he also published six bulletins on sweet potatoes five on cotton and four on cowpeas some other individual bulletins dealt with alfalfa wild plum tomato ornamental plants corn poultry dairying hogs preserving meats in hot weather and nature study in schools his most popular bulletin how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption was first published in  and was reprinted many times it gave a short overview of peanut crop production and contained a list of recipes from other agricultural bulletins cookbooks magazines and newspapers such as the peerless cookbook good housekeeping and berrys fruit recipes carvers was far from the first american agricultural bulletin devoted to peanuts but his bulletins did seem to be more popular and widespread than previous ones the standard author abbreviation carver is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name see also african american portal biography portal science portal

the school closed for the night he slept in a nearby barn by his own account the next morning he met a kind woman mariah watkins from whom he wished to rent a room when he identified himself as carvers george as he had done his whole life she replied that from now on his name was george carver george liked mariah watkins and her words you must learn all you can then go back out into the

continue there for his masters degree carver did research at the iowa experiment station under pammel during the next two years his work at the experiment station in plant pathology and mycology first gained him national recognition and respect as a botanist carver taught as the first black faculty member at iowa state tuskegee institute george washington carver front row center poses with fellow faculty of tuskegee institute in this c  photograph taken by frances benjamin johnston in  booker t washington the first principal and president of the tuskegee institute invited carver to head its agriculture department carver taught there for  years developing the department into a strong research center and working with two additional college presidents during his tenure he taught methods of crop rotation introduced several alternative cash crops for farmers that would also improve the soil of areas heavily cultivated in cotton initiated research into crop products chemurgy and taught generations of black students farming techniques for selfsufficiency carver designed a mobile classroom to take education out to farmers he called it a jesup wagon after the new york financier and philanthropist morris ketchum jesup who provided funding to support the program to recruit carver to tuskegee washington gave him an above average salary and two rooms for his personal use although both concessions were resented by some other faculty because he had earned a masters in a scientific field from a white institution some faculty perceived him as arrogant unmarried faculty members normally had to share rooms with two to a room in the spartan early days of the institute one of carvers duties was to administer the agricultural experiment station farms he had to manage the production and sale of farm products to generate revenue for the institute he soon proved to be a poor administrator in  carver complained that the physical work and the letterwriting required were too much in  an institute committee reported that carvers reports on yields from the poultry yard were exaggerated and washington confronted carver about the issue carver replied in writing now to be branded as a liar and party to such hellish deception it is more than i can bear and if your committee feel that i have willfully lied or was party to such lies as were told my resignation is at your disposal during washingtons last five years at tuskegee carver submitted or threatened his resignation several times when the administration reorganized the agriculture programs when he disliked a teaching assignment to manage an experiment station elsewhere and when he did not get summer teaching assignments in – in each case washington smoothed things over photograph of george washington carver taken by frances benjamin johnston in  carver started his academic career as a researcher and teacher in  washington wrote a letter to him complaining that carver had not followed orders to plant particular crops at the experiment station this revealed washingtons micromanagement of carvers department which he had headed for more than  years by then washington at the same time refused carvers requests for a new laboratory research supplies for his exclusive use and respite from teaching classes washington praised carvers abilities in teaching and original research but said about his administrative skills when it comes to the organization of classes the ability required to secure a properly organized and large school or section of a school you are wanting in ability when it comes to the matter of practical farm managing which will secure definite practical financial results you are wanting again in ability in  carver complained that his laboratory had not received the equipment which washington had promised  months before he also complained about institute committee meetings washington praised carver in his  memoir my larger education being chapters from my experience washington called carver one of the most thoroughly scientific men of the negro race with whom i am acquainted after washington died in  his successor made fewer demands on carver for administrative tasks while a professor at tuskegee carver joined the gamma sigma chapter of phi beta sigma fraternity he spoke at the  conclave that was held at tuskegee alabama in which he delivered a powerful and emotional speech to the men in attendance from  to  carver concentrated on researching and experimenting with new uses for peanuts sweet potatoes soybeans pecans and other crops as well as having his assistants research and compile existing uses this work and especially his speaking to a national conference of the peanut growers association in  and in testimony before congress in  to support passage of a tariff on imported peanuts brought him wide publicity and increasing renown in these years he became one of the most wellknown african americans of his time rise to fame one of americas great scientists us world war ii poster circa  carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton together with other agricultural experts he urged farmers to restore nitrogen to their soils by practicing systematic crop rotation alternating cotton crops with plantings of sweet potatoes or legumes such as peanuts soybeans and cowpeas these crops both restored nitrogen to the soil and were good for human consumption following the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields and gave farmers alternative cash crops to train farmers to successfully rotate and cultivate the new crops carver developed an agricultural extension program for alabama that was similar to the one at iowa state to encourage better nutrition in the south he widely distributed recipes using the alternative crops in addition he founded an industrial research laboratory where he and assistants worked to popularize the new crops by developing hundreds of applications for them they did original research as well as promoting applications and recipes which they collected from others carver distributed his information as agricultural bulletins peanut specimen collected by carver carvers work was known by officials in the national capital before he became a public figure president theodore roosevelt publicly admired his work former professors of carvers from iowa state university were appointed to positions as secretary of agriculture james wilson a former dean and professor of carvers served from  to  henry cantwell wallace served from  to

president from  to  the american industrialist farmer and inventor william edenborn of winn parish louisiana grew peanuts on his demonstration farm he consulted with carver in  carver was made a member of the royal society of arts in england one of only a handful of americans at that time to receive this honor carvers promotion of peanuts gained him the most notice in  carver wrote to a peanut company about the potential he saw for peanut milk both he and the peanut industry seemed unaware that in  william melhuish had secured us  issued   for a milk substitute made from peanuts and soybeansimproper synthesis the united peanut associations of america invited carver to speak at their  convention he discussed the possibilities of the peanut and exhibited  peanut products by  the us peanut farmers were being undercut by low prices on imported peanuts from the republic of china in  peanut farmers and industry representatives planned to appear at congressional hearings to ask for a tariff based on the quality of carvers presentation at their convention they asked the africanamerican professor to testify on the tariff issue before the ways and means committee of the united states house of representatives due to segregation it was highly unusual for an african american to appear as an expert witness at congress representing europeanamerican industry and farmers southern congressmen reportedly shocked at carvers arriving to testify were said to have mocked himcitation needed as he talked about the importance of the peanut and its uses for american agriculture the committee members repeatedly extended the time for his testimony the fordneymccumber tariff of  was passed including one on imported peanuts carvers testifying to congress made him widely known as a public figure life while famous united states farm security administration portrait march  during the last two decades of his life carver seemed to enjoy his celebrity status he was often on the road promoting tuskegee university peanuts and racial harmony although he only published six agricultural bulletins after  he published articles in peanut industry journals and wrote a syndicated newspaper column professor carvers advice business leaders came to seek his help and he often responded with free advice three american presidents—theodore roosevelt calvin coolidge and franklin roosevelt—met with him and the crown prince of sweden studied with him for three weeks from  to  carver toured white southern colleges for the commission on interracial cooperation with his increasing notability carver became the subject of biographies and articles raleigh h merritt contacted him for his biography published in  merritt wrote at present not a great deal has been done to utilize dr carvers discoveries commercially he says that he is merely scratching the surface of scientific investigations of the possibilities of the peanut and other southern products in  the writer james saxon childers wrote that carver and his peanut products were almost solely responsible for the rise in us peanut production after the boll weevil devastated the american cotton crop beginning about  his article a boy who was traded for a horse  in the american magazine and its  reprint in readers digest contributed to this myth about carvers influence other popular media tended to exaggerate carvers impact on the peanut industry from  to  carver worked to develop peanut oil massages to treat infantile paralysis polio ultimately researchers found that the massages not the peanut oil provided the benefits of maintaining some mobility to paralyzed limbs from  to  carver participated in the usda disease survey carver had specialized in plant diseases and mycology for his masters degree in  carver attended two chemurgy conferences an emerging field in the s during the great depression and the dust bowl concerned with developing new products from crops he was invited by henry ford to speak at the conference held in dearborn michigan and they developed a friendship that year carvers health declined and ford later installed an elevator at the tuskegee dormitory where carver lived so that the elderly man would not have to climb stairs carver had been frugal in his life and in his seventies he established a legacy by creating a museum of his work as well as the george washington carver foundation at tuskegee in  to continue agricultural research he donated nearly us equivalent to  in  in his savings to create the foundation relationships austin curtis  scientist successor to dr carver cartoon by ch alston carver never married at age forty he began a courtship with sarah l hunt an elementary school teacher and the sisterinlaw of warren logan treasurer of tuskegee institute this lasted three years until she took a teaching job in california in her  biography christina vella reviews his relationships and suggests that carver was bisexual and constrained by mores of his historic period when he was seventy carver established a friendship and research partnership with the scientist austin w curtis jr this young black man a graduate of cornell university had some teaching experience before coming to tuskegee carver bequeathed to curtis his royalties from an authorized  biography by rackham holt after carver died in  curtis was fired from tuskegee institute he left alabama and resettled in detroit there he manufactured and sold peanutbased personal care products death painting by betsy graves reyneau upon returning home one day carver took a bad fall down a flight of stairs he was found unconscious by a maid who took him to a hospital carver died january   at the age of  from complications anemia resulting from this fall he was buried next to booker t washington at tuskegee university due to his frugality carvers life savings totaled  all of which he donated in his last years and at his death to the carver museum and to the george washington carver foundation on his grave was written he could have added fortune to fame but caring for neither he found happiness and honor in being helpful to the world voice pitch even as an adult carver spoke with a high pitch historian linda o mcmurry noted that he was a frail and sickly child who suffered from a severe case of whooping cough and frequent bouts of what was called croup mcmurry contested the diagnosis of croup holding rather that his stunted growth and apparently impaired vocal chords suggest instead tubercular or pneumococcal infection frequent infections of that nature could have caused the growth of polyps on the larynx and may have resulted from a gamma globulin deficiency until his death the high pitch of his voice startled all who met him and he suffered from frequent chest congestion and loss of voice mcmurry also examined the theory that carvers vocal pitch was due to being castrated as a child she noted that persistent rumours held he was castrated either by his kidnappers or his owner moses carver she maintained these accounts were unlikely as a person castrated before puberty almost never displays any secondary sexual characteristics and seldom grows to normal stature while carvers voice never deepened he reached normal height and grew facial hair she also pointed out that it was extremely unlikely that carver would have maintained affection for moses if he had castrated him but he retained obvious affection for mosesafter he left diamond he returned on several occasions to visit the carvers even after susans death mcmurry admitted that the castration theory cant be dismissed entirely she pointed to carvers reply in  to a friends question on why he never married  he had replied obliquely to a tragic incident in his past that precluded him from marriage mcmurry further noted he was also very reluctant to discuss the years between his departure from diamond and his arrival at iowa state often declaring that there were some things that he would rather forget mcmurry pointed out that after puberty castration or testicular failure due to accident or illness would not prevent the development of secondary sexual characteristics she also pointed out that carvers failure to marry was not proof of castration as it can be explained in other ways christianity george washington carver believed he could have faith both in god and science and integrated them into his life he testified on many occasions that his faith in jesus was the only mechanism by which he could effectively pursue and perform the art of science george washington carver became a christian when he was still a young boy as he wrote in connection to his conversion in  i was just a mere boy when converted hardly ten years old there isnt much of a story to it god just came into my heart one afternoon while i was alone in the loft of our big barn while i was shelling corn to carry to the mill to be ground into meal a dear little white boy one of our neighbors about my age came by one saturday morning and in talking and playing he told me he was going to sunday school tomorrow morning i was eager to know what a sunday school was he said they sang hymns and prayed i asked him what prayer was and what they said i do not remember what he said only remember that as soon as he left i climbed up into the loft knelt down by the barrel of corn and prayed as best i could i do not remember what i said i only recall that i felt so good that i prayed several times before i quit my brother and myself were the only colored children in that neighborhood and of course we could not go to church or sunday school or school of any kind that was my simple conversion and i have tried to keep the faith — g w carver letter to isabelle coleman july   he was not expected to live past his twentyfirst birthday due to failing health he lived well past the age of twentyone and his belief deepened as a result throughout his career he always found friendship with other christians he relied on them especially when criticized by the scientific community and media regarding his research methodology carver viewed faith in jesus christ as a means of destroying both barriers of racial disharmony and social stratification he was as concerned with his students character development as he was with their intellectual development he compiled a list of eight cardinal virtues for his students to strive toward a monument to carver at the missouri botanical garden in st louis be clean both inside and out neither look up to the rich nor down on the poor

monument to carver began before his death because of world war ii such nonwar expenditures had been banned by presidential order missouri senator harry s truman sponsored a bill in favor of a monument in a committee hearing on the bill one supporter said the bill is not simply a momentary pause on the part of busy men engaged in the conduct of the war to do honor to one of the truly great americans of this country but it is in essence a blow against the axis it is in essence a war measure in the sense that it will further unleash and release the energies of roughly  negro people in this country

tuskegee institute was designated a national historic chemical landmark by the american chemical society on february   an episode of modern marvels included scenes from within iowa state universitys food sciences building and about carvers work in  the missouri botanical garden in st louis missouri opened a george washington carver garden in his honor which includes a lifesize statue of him many institutions continue to honor george washington carver a garden and statue of him are dedicated in the noted missouri botanical gardens in st louis dozens of elementary schools and high schools are named after him national basketball association star david robinson and his wife valerie founded an academy named after carver it opened on september   in san antonio texas the carver community cultural center a historic center located in san antonio is named for him reputed inventions carver was given credit in popular folklore for many inventions that did not come out of his lab three patents one for cosmetics us  issued   and two for paints and stains us  issued   and us  issued   were issued to carver in  to  however they were not commercially successful aside from these patents and some recipes for food carver left no records of formulae or procedures for making his products he did not keep a laboratory notebook mackintosh notes that carver did not explicitly claim that he had personally discovered all the peanut attributes and uses he cited but he said nothing to prevent his audiences from drawing the inference carvers research was intended to produce replacements from common crops for commercial products which were generally beyond the budget of the small onehorse farmer a misconception grew that his research on products for subsistence farmers were developed by others commercially to change southern agriculture carvers work to provide small farmers with resources for more independence from the cash economy foreshadowed the appropriate technology work of e f schumacher peanut products dennis keeney director of the leopold center for sustainable agriculture at iowa state university wrote in the leopold letter newsletter carver worked on improving soils growing crops with low inputs and using species that fixed nitrogen hence the work on the cowpea and the peanut carver wrote in the need of scientific agriculture in the south the virgin fertility of our soils and the vast amount of unskilled labor have been more of a curse than a blessing to agriculture this exhaustive system for cultivation the destruction of forest the rapid and almost constant decomposition of organic matter have made our agricultural problem one requiring more brains than of the north east or west carver worked for years to create a company to market his products the most important was the carver penol company which sold a mixture of creosote and peanuts as a patent medicine for respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis sales were lackluster and the product was ineffective according to the food and drug administration other ventures were the carver products company and the carvoline company carvoline antiseptic hair dressing was a mix of peanut oil and lanolin carvoline rubbing oil was a peanut oil for massages carver is often mistakenly credited with the invention of peanut butter by the time carver published how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption in  many methods of preparation of peanut butter had been developed or patented by various pharmacists doctors and food scientists working in the us and canada the aztec were known to have made peanut butter from ground peanuts as early as the th century canadian pharmacist marcellus gilmore edson was awarded us patent  for its manufacture in   years before carver began his work at tuskegee sweet potato products carver is also associated with developing sweet potato products in his  sweet potato bulletin carver listed a few dozen recipes many of which i have copied verbatim from bulletin no  u s department of agriculture carvers records included the following sweet potato products  dyes  wood fillers  candies  library pastes  breakfast foods  starches  flours and  molasses he also had listings for vinegars dry coffee and instant coffee candy afterdinner mints orange drops and lemon drops carver bulletins during his more than four decades at tuskegee carvers official published work consisted mainly of  practical bulletins for farmers his first bulletin in  was on feeding acorns to farm animals his final bulletin in  was about the peanut he also published six bulletins on sweet potatoes five on cotton and four on cowpeas some other individual bulletins dealt with alfalfa wild plum tomato ornamental plants corn poultry dairying hogs preserving meats in hot weather and nature study in schools his most popular bulletin how to grow the peanut and  ways of preparing it for human consumption was first published in  and was reprinted many times it gave a short overview of peanut crop production and contained a list of recipes from other agricultural bulletins cookbooks magazines and newspapers such as the peerless cookbook good housekeeping and berrys fruit recipes carvers was far from the first american agricultural bulletin devoted to peanuts but his bulletins did seem to be more popular and widespread than previous ones the standard author abbreviation carver is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name see also african american portal biography portal science portal

african americans americas civil war colonial period history immigrants revolution  founding state  local united states description additional information most upvoted comment was george w bush really such a bad presidentrneutralpolitics i believe that presidents should be measured against the counterfactual of what would have happened had the other guy won – using this heuristic most presidents don’t look so bad for example one of the biggest failures bush is criticized for is the financial crisis in  while criticism can rightly be levied at george bush for the massive regulatory cuts and failures to recognize the dangers of mortgagebacked deriviatives there’s simply no reason to think similar failures wouldn’t have occurred under a gore administration or bill bradley or john mccain many of the policies that led to the housing bubble in the first place had their genesis as far back as the reagan administration similarly the bush administration receives a lot of justified criticism for the massive failures in the response to hurricane katrina failures which has an unmistakable racial quality however and again the failures with the levy system predated the bush administration by decades and while his response immediately following was horrifyingly tonedeaf at the time many in the media had joined bush in proclaiming that the fears about the hurricane had been overstated and the response sufficient at least initially by the time bush was screwing up the messaging regarding the hurricane the damage was already done and while the response even after the fact is widely considered to be insufficient it’s not at all clear any other republican president would have been much better terrible as it is republicans simply don’t have a lot of political incentive to spend resources in places like new orleans a sad fact to be sure but a systemic one not limited to george w bush now to this point i would argue the above complaints along with other things people have mentioned absolutely exploding the deficit from the first surplus in decades to greatly exacerbating income inequality with regressive tax cuts aimed primarily at the rich along with the aborted social security reforms the harriet miers supreme court nomination and a few other things – i would argue that these criticisms are mostly partisan in nature an intelligent person could make a strong argument for limited privatization of social security or stimulus through cutting taxes or increasing deficits in lean though not catastrophic economic years that doesn’t make these criticisms invalid but they wouldn’t for me cause bush to rise to the level of one of the worst presidents why i think george w bush is arguably one of the five worst presidents in our history and inarguably one of the ten worst is one thing the iraq war the iraq war was a massive failure of the intelligence community intellectual honesty and transparency in our political system and good common sense in my method of measuring the quality of presidential candidates the afghanistan war likely would have happened in some form or fashion under a gore administration or a mccain administration however no other politician – none in the  presidential field – would have moved for war with iraq which was widely considered – even at the time – a distraction from the war on terror and it’s not like the war on terror couldn’t be criticized in its own right the various failures of the iraq war have been recounted in numerous places abu ghraib crony contracts to companies like halliburton the privatization of key american military operations to me the most unforgiveable facet of the iraq war is that it happened at all this is the main crux of why i consider george w bush such a bad president the morally unjustifiable doctrine of preemptive war make no mistake the bush doctrine of preemptive war represents the single largest change in american foreign policy since woodrow wilson and along with the monroe doctrine one of the three most dramatic turns in american foreign policy ever other presidents who rank among the worst all time usually harm america on the basis of domestic policies james buchanan who failed or address or even properly identify the major cleavages in the leadup to the civil war warren harding who really laid the groundwork for the great depression andrew johnson who tried to roll back basically all of the civil rights accomplishments from before lincoln’s assassination and franklin pierce who laid much of the groundwork for the civil war much earlier even than buchanan bush is the first to have done his harm primarily by virtue of foreign policy sending thousands of americans and tens or thousands hundreds of thousands of arabs to die while spending trillions of dollars on war that would not have happened if almost anyone else was president including members of his own family undertaken in service of a foreign policy that was way out of the mainstream and anathema to  years of stated american foreign conduct however you do your rankings i have no doubt that one hundred years from now bush will be regarded as one of if not

images    prices  deals    information product highlightsused book in good conditionbattered by our economy and disappointed by our governments role in that battering we might be tempted to point the finger of blame at whoevers currently on the hot seat in front of us but as phillip cooper shows we must widen our vision to take in the long history behind this dismal state of affairs by doing so it becomes clear that our present circumstances are in many ways the predictable outcome of a severaldecadeslong war against government regulation and its potential to protect and improve our lives cooper explains how the war against regulation has been conducted both from within and outside the government over the past thirty years chronicling its major battles from the jimmy carter years through the presidency of george w bush he shows that it is a war waged by democrats and republicans alike that has been fought in high places but whose casualties include children senior citizens the infirm and millions of families who have lost their homes and retirement savings cooper tells how carter praised for environmental regulation worked to deregulate airlines trucking and banks how reagan undertook administrative rather than legislative measures against regulation most of which werent understood or even known by the public and how george hw bush continued the fight with the quayle commission he describes bill clintons commitment to fighting regulation despite having campaigned against his republican predecessors policies then describes the behindthescenes maneuverings of george w bush as he sought to gut regulatory agencies entirely he also devotes an entire chapter to parallel developments in the supreme court that substantially advanced the deregulation agenda during this era cooper contends that regulation as one of a number of policy tools available to our leaders is neither good nor bad in and of itself excessive deregulationas opposed to regulatory reform can present considerable peril as current events clearly show by considering key issues important to a more effective understanding and use of regulation in the future the war against regulation makes a vital case for restoring debate about regulations rightful role within the republic and offers hope that a better understanding of that role can help lift us out of our current

following raw data from us government agency sources correspondence with powmia families published sources interviews updated by the pow network in  remarks kia on isle   rcv  nt subj  j synopsis on the evening of april   capt kenneth j yonan accompanied his arvn counterpart to a water tower located on the northwestern edge of the tanh canh base camp compound near dak to kontum province south vietnam yonan was an advisor assigned to advisory team  macv and was assisting the arvn nd regiment based there at about  hours on april  capt yonan was still in the water tower when viet cong attacked the camp perimeter although tanks fired at and hit the water tower two other advisors spoke to capt yonan after the firing and yonan reported that he was not hit and planned to join the other advisors when it was safe to do so radio contact was maintained with yonan until  hours the other us advisors began escape and evasion operations from the beleaguered compound team  advisors maj george w carter maj julius g warmath and capt john p keller were extracted by helicopter the aircraft was a uhh from the nd aviation battalion th aviation group serial  and was flown by lt james e hunsicker wo wade l ellen was the copilot of the chopper and sp charles m lea and sp rickey v vogel were crewmen other persons extracted included lt johnny m jones from the nd aviation battalion sp franklin zollicoffer from the us army installation at pleiku and sgt walter h ward unit not specified the helicopter departed to the northwest from dak to but was apparently hit by enemy fire as it crashed and burned on a small island in the dak poko river about  meters from the end of the dock to the runway because of the rolling terrain personnel at the airfield did not see the aircraft impact a pilot flying over the wreckage reported that the helicopter was burning but they could see no survivors it was later discovered that five people did survive the crash  warmath keller vogel ward and lea according to their statements hunsicker ellen zollicoffer jones and carter were all dead two other team  macv advisors ltcol robert w brownlee and capt charles w gordon and their arvn interpreter sgt cao ky chi were in a bunker near the airstrip approximately  kilometers to the west of the base camp when they were forced to withdraw under heavy enemy attack they proceeded south of the compound across the dak poko river but ltcol brownlee became separated from the others as they were advancing up a hill sgt chi and capt gordon called out to him but received no response from the top of the hill sgt chi heard the enemy call out to someone in vietnamese to halt and raise their hands sgt chi believed the viet cong were speaking to ltcol brownlee gordon and chi evaded capture and eventually made their way to safety a vietnamese who was captured and subsequently released reported that he had talked to another prisoner who had witnessed ltcolbrownlees death he was told that ltcol brownlee had killed himself with his own pistol when communist soldiers told him to raise his hands in an attempt to capture him additional hearsay reports of his suicide were reported by another arvn source yonan never caught up with the others for three days helicopter searches were made of the area with no success ground search because of the hostile threat in the area was not practical in april  the vietnamese discovered the remains of capt kenneth j yonan and returned them to the us in a spirit of steppedup cooperation on the powmia issue for nearly  years this  west point graduate was a prisoner of war  alive or dead his family now knows with certainty that he is dead but may never learn how  or when  he died in addition to the reports regarding brownlees death a south vietnamese soldier reported that he observed the capture of one big american from the camp another report described the capture of a us captain stationed at the camp since the war ended reports and refugee testimony have convinced many authorities that not only do the vietnamese possess several hundred sets of americans remains more startlingly they also control hundreds of living american prisoners as long as they are allowed to do so the vietnamese will return remains at politically expedient intervals as long as they are allowed to do so they will hold our men prisoner  official data bases do not tell the whole story of this mission while rickey von vogel is only noted as rescued in reality sp vogel was missing from april   until his return to military control may   during that time despite severe wounds that included bullet wounds and broken bones he managed to escape and evade capture for almost  weeks until his rescue rickey vogel was awarded the purple heart and  air medals in addition to various vietnam awards and decorations for his service after his medical evacuation and recovery he continued to serve his country until his discharge in   from w page subject pow kenneth yonan  captured mid may in bunker date fri  sep    my interest in powmia returned kenneth yonan is very personal some of us  d th cav in ao at the time were tasked to rescue him but couldnt because of the numerically superior enemy and armor   thought you may be interested to know of this document found at the texas tech archives the archive document number is actually the numerals within the named file view the very last page at the bottom before jimmy gillespie  my buddy in d th cav who was with me passed away he had reminded me of an american who had come into our tiny ao and stayed a bit and left we never knew who he was we always wondered if it could have been ken yonan or someone else so many records are wrong or incomplete   note that kenneth yonan had previously been the co of d th
