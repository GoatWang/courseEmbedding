making we are guided by our respect for the history and culture of beer as well as our passion for and innovation in brewing we wish to enrich the cultural landscape of chicago and support the inspirational organizations within our communities furthermore goose island champions sustainability in our breweries and beyond as well as actively celebrates and engages our employees our vision where we want to be in years to come goose island will solidify our leadership in the craft brewing industry this goal will be achieved through sharing our expertise in the brewing process involving ourselves with professional brewing and trade organizations and growing the craft beer community through consumer engagement and education our history a goose goes to europe our famous beer began with a trip across europe when goose island founder and unabashed beer lover john hall took a tour across the continent pint by pint he savored the styles and selections of brews in every region and thought to himself “america deserves some damn fine beer like this too” craft brewing wasn’t widely known at the time but upon return from his european sojourn john set out to change all that he settled down in his hometown of chicago—a city perfect for craft beer with rapidly evolving tastes and the largest system of fresh water on the planet and then he got to brewing first he made some stellar beer then he invited his consumers in to watch his process at the brewery bringing them behind the scenes every step of the way the result was a new fascination with craft brewing and beer that not only catered to people’s tastes but challenged them as well that was back in  and we haven’t slowed down since by  john’s beer had become so popular that he decided to open a larger brewery along with a bottling plant to keep up with demand  brought even more growth along with an additional brewpub and today what was once one man’s pintfilled dream has become the goose island empire you know and love our brewery our inner workings our brewery was built in  and has more than doubled in size since originally built we bring you our tasty pints using  fermenters over  different yeasts stateoftheart filters centrifuges and a  barrel jv northwest  vessel system that brews  hours a day  days a week it turns out that making awesome brews is quite the science luckily our brewery facilities have all the equipment necessary to deliver results our packaging line alone bottles  cases an hour with our keg line at a rate of  kegs every  minutes once the beer is complete we store it at a crisp  degrees until shipping in other words we don’t mess around when it comes to filling the goose island demand we even have separate rooms to house small batch innovation programs and yeast propagation units and our barrelaged beers have their own dedicated stockroom and  square foot barrel warehouse it’s only the very best equipment for our beer—and we invite you to learn more our barrels aged before everyone else in  goose island gave the beer industry a new reason to belly up to the bar bourbonaged beer we pioneered the process and it begins with firstuse bourbon barrels our brewers only choose those that have had held sweet sweet whiskey in their bellies for an average of  years then they age our beer inside for  months this process takes place in a nonclimate controlled space allowing exposure to the extreme heat and cold of chicago’s ecosystem which contracts and expands the wood pulling the barrel’s whiskey character into our brew each barrel is used only once ensuring the best quality taste in every pint that first barrelaging process yielded our evertasty bourbon county stout back in  three years later we decided it was time to expand our barrelaging program again but this time our brewers brought wine barrels into the picture they started with beer that had undergone primary fermentation in stainless steel casks then transferred it to wine barrels soaked with flavor next came fresh fruit and wild yeasts and the beginning of a secondary fermentation inside the barrel aging went on for  months creating beer with unprecedented depth of character increased acidity and a light essence of fruit without too much sweetness the variety of wine barrels we use now yield some of our most unique brews including sofie juliet lolita madame rose gillian and halia our hops tucked away in a secluded valley in northern idaho is elk mountain farms – the place where goose island hops are grown and harvested head farmer ed atkins shares the same passion and commitment to great beer as our brewers and together they’ve worked to grow the farm from a acre operation to a acre hop heaven here over  different types of hops including goose island favorites like saaz amarillo and cascade are cultivated along with numerous experimental varieties that could one day push the boundaries of beer for drinkers and brewers alike elk mountain is more than just soil and plant life it’s a laboratory a studio a blank canvas on which to paint the future of goose island beer watch the video above to get a taste of this magical place or click here for a chance to experience it our people john hall founder after traveling extensively in his career in the packaging industry john hall was always amazed at how few beer choices americans had when i traveled in europe everywhere i went there would always be a local beer… but not in the us then in  fate struck john hall in the form of a thunderstorm in dallas texas his flight delayed by the inclement weather hall flipped through an inflight magazine to pass the time there he found his future in the form of an article on boutique beers i must be the only person in history who made a major career decision on the basis of a delta sky article hall chuckles fascinated by what he’d read hall began to toy with the idea of starting a brewery i just loved the idea john remembers i mean what could be better than making a product that i was passionate about and nearly every american adult liked after two years of thinking researching and planning hall scrapped his year career with container corporation and opened the original goose island brewpub at  north clybourn avenue introducing the city of chicago to distinctive craft beer goose island beer co is now one of the largest craft breweries in the midwest the company distributes its beers to all  states and the united kingdom im working with people i love and i love what i do says hall im a lucky man john resides in
