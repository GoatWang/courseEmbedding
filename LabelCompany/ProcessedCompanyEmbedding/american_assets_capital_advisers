don’t have an investment allocation to real estate investment trusts “reits” because they believe they already have “enough” exposure to “real estate” through ownership of their home reits and your home are very different asset classes with very different characteristics reits invest primarily in commercial real estate which is any nonresidential property used for commercial profitmaking purposes your home is an investment in residential real estate which is a type of property containing either a singlefamily or multifamily structure which is available for occupation and nonbusiness purposes performance over the past  years publiclytraded reits have returned an annualized  total return and homes have returned  or just a little more than inflation over these  years reits returned more than x  while homes didn’t quite double  publiclytraded reits have been one of the top performing asset classes and homes have been one of the worst over the past  years there are many differences between reits and your home that contribute to this notable difference in performance the largest contributor is that commercial real estate can generate positive cash flows but the residential home you live in cannot by living in your home you are effectively consuming the market rate rent that your home might have procured if you forgo rent as you do by living in your home the return profile changes to be basically little more than an inflation hedge performance of real estate follows the following formula total return  price change  rent collected diversification with your home  of the asset is in one property type and in one geographic market – this is concentration in its purist form the opposite of diversification on the other hand with publiclytraded reits investors can choose from dozens of property types including but not limited to specialized real estate sectors such as data centers cell phone towers casinos medical research labs infrastructure prisons ski areas etc across any market in the us and most major markets in the world the opportunity for diversification in publiclytraded reits vastly exceeds that of a single home liquidity homes are relatively illiquid compared to public reits that can be traded every day the stock market is open and settle to cash virtually immediately this is in stark contrast to the home market which may be illiquid for months seasons or even years and can take months to settle to cash transaction costs transacting a home is much more costly than transacting in publiclytraded reits when you sell a home the typical transaction cost is more than  of the home’s sale price for perspective based on data from the last  years as shown in the total return chart above this is equal to about five years’ worth of your home’s price appreciation after inflation in contrast it costs little more than pocket change to trade shares of a public reit  per trade at fidelity and  per trade at scottrade flexibility home ownership is not flexible the entry price for a home is typically sixfigures and you can’t really buy or sell a percentage of a home – it is binary either you are in all the way or you are completely out with publiclytraded reits you can buy almost any amount you wish in single share increments typically share on the stock market with public reits you can trim add or change a position in almost any amount on almost any day supply  demand perhaps the single most impactful factor that undermines home price appreciation is the ability of developers to add new product to the market in our opinion homes are the type of real estate most likely to be oversupplied because we believe they are the cheapest smallest quickest and least complicated real estate product type to build aaca also believes that whenever the cost to build new homes is below the current market value of existing homes builders will build new homes which could create a price ceiling on the appreciation of your home additionally in recessions construction costs materials and labor costs decrease which makes building new homes less expensive and creates additional new supply this combination of factors could dampen your home’s price rebound out of a recession relative to public reits as shown in the historical graph below volatility let’s look at volatility of publiclytraded reits and homes below is a graph of the past  years which includes the financial crisis since public reits trade on the stock market the share price of these reits are subject to fluctuation in the stock market and as such experience volatility however we would argue the underlying physical real estate owned by the reits can’t be much different in volatility than your physical home the difference is that your home isn’t bought and sold every day and marked to that market price that being said in the graph below we see that homes sold off  and public reits sold off  in the financial crisis however looking at a longer period of time homes captured  of the downside and  of the upside of public reits over the past  years – homes have been asymmetrical to the downside and public reits have since gone on to return  over the past  years while homes have returned  in that same time period final thoughts we believe you should think of your home first and foremost as the place you and your family live and second as an inflation hedge for your invested principal – nothing more than that you should not think of your home as an investment in real estate as history shows there has been almost no meaningful return after inflation publiclytraded reits and your home are very different asset classes with very different characteristics but what if i rent my home out but what if i buy a home and rent it out that would be good right sure you will grab the warranted rent assuming you can find a good renter but you may also be the one grabbing a plunger to fix the toilet on christmas eve when your renter calls also you still need a place to live so you will presumably either be buying or renting a home to live in additionally it is probably unlikely that you can rent one house as efficiently as a public reit that has professional leasing revenue optimization software economies of scale expert experience market knowledge and realtime industry data lastly if you want to buy a home and rent it out there are several publiclytraded reits that do that   this is a summary and does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities or to participate in any

assets capital advisers burland east discusses raaix tim melvin  benzinga staff writer    november   pm   comments share burland east ceo of american assets capital advisers and subadviser to the altegrisaaca real estate long short fund raaix interviewer hi everyone were on today with burland east ceo of american assets capital advisers and subadviser to the altegrisaaca real estate long short fund raaix i was reading through your materials you have a very different approach to investing in rets can you tell us about that burland east weve been at this for about  years in this format and then prior to this i spent close to  years on wall street so ive been through three cycles my observance over these cycles is that what tends to win over time in the long run is real estate that is in some way unique and unique in a way that the tenants either cant or wont leave i can give you a couple of examples within real estate which is a large space – well north of a trillion dollars in equity market cap and multiple hundreds of companies they tend to be in what i call silos for instance manufactured housing which would be mobile home markets would be a silo and lab space would be a silo and suburban office space would be a silo and strip centers would be a silo and malls and so forth – there are about  of these different silos what we look to do is underwrite a silo of companies looking to find a situation where the real estate is either physically unique or locationally unique or both which creates a situation where the tenant either cant leave or is highly reluctant to leave and as a result of that the landlord can maintain high occupancy and have pricing power ie leverage over the tenants so they can raise rent at a very healthy clip over a long period of time thats our strategy interviewer can you give us some examples of the thing you called in your literature you called the tenant denied a choice whereas you said they either cant or just wont  its just not economically advantageous to them to leave can you give me some examples of some of those be yes lets imagine for a minute that you inhabit an apartment youre in your late twenties and you live in the suburbs of atlanta and youre well employed but in atlanta there are no barriers to entry apartments are functionally the same they provide the same functional utility to the user within your little ring of where i want to live relative to my job there may be  or  apartment complexes what you are looking to do is optimize utilization your functional utility per unit of money somebody builds a new apartment across the street and offers you  months free rent and better wifi you will move the point is you can move its easy to move and the set is functionally the same so we dont have any embedded interest in remaining and as long as the place across the street is practically priced you might move so thats an example where the tenant has lots of choices but instead lets imagine that you are a large corporation and you occupy  feet of highly developed and highly built out wet lab space wet lab is what you see in the science fiction movies the gene sequencers and fume hoods and deionized water and all kinds of highly technical stuff and this company has phds in there running around that are in year three of a sevenyear efficacy study of some drug and you the corporation have invested  million in the space yourself to bring this heavy duty equipment in and bolted to the floor and the ceiling and calibrate it so if you are in this situation youre the corporation as opposed to the guy living in the apartment it just seems to us that youre a lot less likely to move mechanically the act of moving would disrupt the research and force you to disassemble all of this highly technical equipment and some of this by the way youve built it in a way that you cant take it with you so if we look at those two situations it tells us we would rather own lab space leased to life science companies than we would own an apartment leased to some yuppie living in atlanta so thats the very simple analysis breakdown and we take this concept and apply it across this broad spectrum of real estate companies looking for this relationship with the tenant is denied choice interviewer that actually makes a lot of sense to me i dont think ive ever heard anyone else talk about using this approach be most people dont do this i just used lab space and multifamily as an example but there are other silos like manufactured housing which we like or student housing or cell phone towers or data centers or super regional malls whatever it is so were looking across all these different platforms these silos and then were looking at it regionally we want to be in markets that have a couple of characteristics physical markets the markets we want to be in have what i would describe as net domestic in migration what that means is people are moving there for instance people are moving to dallas people arent moving to chicago simple analysis you go back to the days of kennedy and chicago had about six million people in it and dallas had about a million flash forward to today  chicago still has six million people but dallas has six million people so where would you rather invest youd rather invest in a market where people are naturally moving in that tends to be the sun belt it tends to be coastal it tends to be communities that have a lot of amenities particularly recreational amenities and educational amenities so those are first cut and the second cut were looking for is we want those markets to also have high barriers to entry so whereas i just used that as an example dallas has no barriers to entry its easy for a developer to build new products so if im trying to deny the tenant choice the ability for an additional developer or real estate owner to come into that market and give my tenant choice is what i dont want i want the tenant to be denied choice so i would rather own for instance in boston or new york or miami or seattle where there is extensive complex regulatory environmental and zoning structure in place so its very very hard  or certainly harder and more expensive  to add a product so lets say we were going to buy apartments we would prefer not to buy them in dallas because theyre easy to replicate in dallas wed rather buy them in seattle its just harder to replicate its harder to provide that tenants with that choice of opportunities what most investors in real estate do is they come to the decision matrix bringing with them baggage the baggage comes in two forms first where they live second what they do for instance if you happen to be in a conference youll eventually run into someone from cleveland that owns suburban office space in cleveland but what do you have to realize is he comes from that experience he doesnt know anything about lab buildings or data centers or cell phone towers or super regional malls theres no domestic inmigration in cleveland people are leaving and suburban offices are a very generic product and the user considers it just to be functional they are not married to the space in any way shape or form so for him what hes looking at is this is all he knows the other false decision matrix is what i would describe as chasing cheap there is an inherently attractive story in the idea that a thing some asset is cheaper other than other assets at the time in the same market or cheaper than it was the idea that im going to buy a dollars worth of something for  is very appealing so what many real estate deals are built around this fundamental investment concept we dont typically pursue cheap for the sake of cheap alone once we decide what we like ill try to buy those stocks inexpensively but what i wont to do is go to cleveland and buy suburban office space just because its cheap but many investors will investors are driven by the pursuit of cheapness we find historically and again weve been doing this for a long time starting in the mideighties that things are usually cheap for a reason the market is more efficient than you think and the other thing about real estate is real estate doesnt know who owns it but it knows where it lives unless you can move a suburban office from cleveland to say san francisco one cant fundamentally change its value its captive to location interviewer that brings me to an interesting question because i talk to a lot of people real estate is one of my two or three major focus areas both in writing and investing so when you talk to a guy in suburban cleveland he thinks that commercial real estate today is probably about not much going on but if i talk to developers down here in orlando they cant build or buy the stuff fast enough and they think we are in the early stages of another long bull market coming back up to  feet where are we today in the real estate markets be youve highlighted a really interesting point just right there in your commentary because youre absolutely correct if you took the country and laid it out on a map and you looked at  lets call it the smile states you start at lets say charlotte and you run a big smile that extends up all the way to the other side all the way to seattle most of those markets are growing jobs and gaining population so orlando where you live orlando has terrific job growth i think orlandos job growth  in fact i have it right in front of me  is probably  the country as a whole is  so orlandos growing roughly  faster than the rest of the country so the question is why is that and the answer is because you have a republican government no taxes and you have available land to build interviewer i call it the sunshine tax factor be and also its warm orlandos a nice place to live its a beautiful city so youve got  job growth the rest of the country is  and change cleveland is probably close to zero or one or two so thats the first thing so you have net domestic in migration so a developer can convince the bank to give them a loan because the banker gets the same economic reports as the developer and says you know what in the next  to  years  people are moving into orlando for example i think the answer is were halfway through the cycle the cycle started in ish as the great recession faded and the normal liquidity mechanisms returned to the market so    accelerated were now in  so were in call it halfway through real estate development is exactly like the prisoners dilemma you have a dozen or two dozen developers in a place like orlando and all of them have the same imperfect information they know the market is growing but they dont know exactly how much they dont know exactly how tenants are going to expand and they cant predict the actions of their competitors they have imperfect information they have guesses and estimates and most importantly they feel like if they dont develop someone else will so they all read the same report that m new feet of office is needed and they all rush to build it – and m feet gets built this is how markets get overbuilt interviewer that makes sense so we are about midway through we like the smile region of the country pretty much now what factors are going to give us that bulletproof tenants have no real choices markets be thats probably the single most important question weve described real estate the way you would describe it to a general investor who might not be familiar with any of these interesting or more niche property types but works in an office building and lives in an apartment and is familiar with those kind of concepts so for the most part if its generic we dont want to own it what we want to own is where the industry substructure  the silo  is either a monopoly an oligopoly or a duopoly with a couple to a handful of competitors we dont want hundreds of providers of the type of property lets say were in apartments there are probably thousands of owners developers managers of apartments it is a widely supplied business instead if you look at lab space most of the lab space in the us is owned by three companies so we have a loose oligopoly if you start out with an oligopoly the oligopolistic competitors are less likely to compete on price thats just the way things are  behavioral economics the corollary to that is an oligopoly is an oligopoly because the business itself the silo has barriers to entry its hard to get into the lab space business now you and i could go into the apartment business though its a lot easier so we first search for this structure where there is a limited number of competitors the second thing we do is we say okay we want a business in which there are enormously high barriers to entry so we want businesses where its very difficult to add products in a physical sense and that can be entitlement zoning land use issues a bunch of other stuff so apartments wouldnt fit because theyre easy to build lab space would because its hard to build next thing were looking for is this thing we call barrier to exit what we mean by that is could the tenant leave even if you gave them a choice the example we usually use weve already used one with the apartments its easy to leave an apartment and hard to leave a lab space then the last thing were looking for is is the tenants business healthy and growing we want our tenants to be coming to us most of the time saying im growing and i need more space not im thinking of reducing my footprint so when we sift through all of this we end up with things like data centers and a cell phone towers and manufactured housing and student housing and selfstorage these silos that are niches ie there are two or three players interviewer thats a totally different way of looking at real estate markets than id say  of the people ive talked to over the years now on your website  youve been very generous with your time  i want to sneak one more question in here  on your website there was an article with you talking about whats going on with california and the drought situation and some interesting ideas of real estate companies involved in that situation be the drought down here has been ongoing for years and years we are now at the point where over  of the state is categorized as being in either extreme drought or exceptional drought additionally the region is a desert there is a relatively modest amount of natural rainfall in southern california san diego for instance gets about  inches of rain a year which isnt very much and the way the place is paved and with the basic terrain much of that simply flows into the ocean so we dont have much in the way of ground water retention the way youd have in maybe new york or illinois where youd go and sink a well our water is mostly stored in the form of snow pack in the sierra nevada mountains it snows over the winter its frozen and in the spring it runs off and when it runs off it runs down rivers and weve dammed a lot of those rivers and creates reservoirs and thats where the water lives the system reservoir capacity is currently  full the population of southern california has increased tremendously in the last  years meanwhile water conveyance water storage water purification all of the systems put in place to provide a safe and reliable water system for the socal region has not kept up with that so we find ourselves now with  mandatory water reduction in southern california interviewer do you have any final thoughts for us be real estate has been a leading asset class now for  or  years we think most investors should allocate  to  of their diversified portfolio income to commercial real estate image credit public domain the above article has been transcribed may not

employees aum portfolio values historical f current portfolio holdings new positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by

correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because
