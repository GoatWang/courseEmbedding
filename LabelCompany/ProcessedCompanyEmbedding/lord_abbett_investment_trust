average sp  nasdaq and morningstar index market barometer quotes are realtime russell  quote is  minutes delayed why trusteed iras are becoming more popular « the investment conversation blog why trusteed iras are becoming more popularjuly    pmby brian dobbis  views if you want to control payouts to your heirs and avoid the time expense of setting up a trust consider this simpler option the road to retirement with brian dobbis  when it comes to naming a beneficiary ira owners have a lot of discretion on how their nest egg is divided up when they’re gone the beneficiary can be a person it can be an estate charity or trust or it can be a combination of those options of course the easiest and most common option is simply naming one or more loved ones on the ira custodian’s beneficiary form but what if you as the ira account owner want to control payouts after death naming a trust as beneficiary or establishing a trusteed ira will give you the desired control the internal revenue code states an ira can be set up as a trust or custodial account however trusteed iras as a third choice are gaining popularity as retirement investors are looking for postdeath control without the myriad of fees hassle and complexities of establishing a trust establishing a trusteed ira is rather simple in fact there is no requirement to have estate planning attorneys however there are usually setup and annualmaintenance fees what is a trusteed ira with a trusteed ira the financial firm holding the ira adds trust language to its basic ira agreement here the ira itself becomes the trust with the financial organization serving as trustee it should be noted only a corporate trustee can oversee a trusteed ira that satisfies irs requirements for iras the ira before and after the owner’s death is administered according to the trust provisions the trust provisions differ depending on the financial institution offering the trusteed ira moreover most trusteed iras contain language allowing for a successor beneficiary different from contingent beneficiary however virtually all trusteed iras contain language that allows for beneficiaries to “stretch” payouts so if you’re concerned about beneficiaries like kids or grandkids squandering their inheritance a trusteed ira might resonate after all you would be assured that required minimum distributions are paid out annually to beneficiaries as opposed to a lump sum that might be spent in short order drawbacks if you’re considering a trusteed ira a few caveats are in order only a handful of organizations offer it and those who do generally will not allow the ira assets to be transferred trustee transfer to another organization this could become an issue if the beneficiary wants to work with another ira provider be sure to check the language in the trust document to determine if this is the case trusteed iras also provide protection from creditors however compared to a trust it’s limited protectioniras unlike ks are not automatically protected from creditors instead creditor protection is based on state law because trusteed iras are plain vanilla standardized documents flexibility may be limited which is another way of saying a trusteed ira may not give you all the control you want or need nor achieve exactly what you want the bottom line a trusteed ira like a trust is not for everybody be diligent and think carefully about whom you want to bequeath your retirement assets to also be sure to consult with a knowledgeable attorney and cpa as this form of estate planning is complex you are signed in asnull
