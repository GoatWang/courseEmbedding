techstars stephen allen nexosis inc a data analytics startup that helps retailers and restaurants forecast how much inventory to stock – down to the ketchup packets at a fastfood store has closed a  million seed round ceo ryan sevey said friday the round in the westerville startup was led by revel partners of new york city a venture capital firm formed by five serial entrepreneurs thats had three acquisitions and an ipo from its portfolio in the past two years enlarge nexosis ceo ryan sevey at target techstars stephen allen nexosis had reported picking up some sizable accounts after going through this summer’s techstars  target retail accelerator near target corp’s minneapolis headquarters plus an integration with the ecommerce platform shopify to get access to its retailers nexosis machinelearning software looks at several data sources and online sentiment to more accurately predict future demand for products such as how many small tshirts a store should stock its already made four hires upon closing the round this month growing to  employees sevey said we’ll be growing pretty rapidly here he said a large investment is being put into product development also participating in the round were techstars ventures the investing arm of the boulder coloradobased startup accelerator inovia capital partners of montreal canada evalue of berlin germany which has joined other revel deals and matchstick ventures of minneapolis we see them all adding a lot of value sevey said in the form of experience running subscription software firms and introductions to potential customers nexosis reported a total of  investors in the round starting in midnovember in a form d filing with the securities and exchange commission the company didnt officially start raising money until finishing techstars but it had formed a relationship with revel months before the accelerator several funds made offers sevey said the company now has some capital cushion heading into the next few years going out and raising another round isn’t something any of us want to do in the next  months he said sevey told me in an earlier interview that nexosis came about almost by accident he and cofounder jason montgomery met while working at american electric power company inc on the side they started studying machine learning – artificial intelligence software that learns from the patterns of input without further human intervention they were pursuing cybersecurity and made some youtube videos attracting a call from northern bottling co a pepsico bottler in minot north dakota asking for

investment in nexosis this spring a revel representative will join the board nexosis is now preparing white papers based on customers use of the software such as how theyve made more sales by avoiding going out of stock during key shopping rushes without carrying too much inventory it can add to that black friday and cyber monday shopping data we have tons of very interesting data points about what
