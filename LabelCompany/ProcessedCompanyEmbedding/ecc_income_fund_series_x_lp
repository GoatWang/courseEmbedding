investing involves risk including risk of loss stock markets especially foreign markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer political regulatory market or economic developments in general the bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk liquidity risk call risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible fidelitys guidance is educational and should not be the primary basis of your investment decisions please see themodel portfolio methodology pdf for more information about how the models are created you should also carefully research any fund you may be

available we can change or update the model portfolios at any time fidelity will not notify you when they are updated the model portfolios may contain taxable bond funds the model portfolios do not attempt to consider the effect of income taxes on performance or returns and does not reflect any opinion on the tax‐appropriateness of the portfolio for any investor depending on your tax situation municipal bond funds may be more appropriate for you model portfolios do not consider the effect of taxes fees andor expenses associated with investing please consult with your investment or tax advisor if applicable prior to taking action in applying the model portfolio or any other results to your individual situation be sure to consider other assets income and investments eg home equity
