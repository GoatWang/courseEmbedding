this startup wants to fix a major problem with the highly unregulated supplements industry lydia ramsey apr    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print elysium health cofounders eric marcotulli dan alminana and leonard guarente courtesy elysiumhealth lets face it most supplements are a little bit sketchy its not just that many of them dont actually contain what they say they do — the science on their alleged benefits is also mixed at best but a startup called elysium health is trying to change that with a new kind of supplement the company is the brainchild of former sequoia partner eric marcotulli former jpmorgan vice president dan alminana and mit professor leonard guarente the team emphasizes first that their products contain what theyre supposed to that is to say no extra materials that have nothing to do with the supplement and second are tested for safety and efficacy the company focuses on supplements which traditionally can include everything from your daily multivitamin to the bottles of unpronouncable ingredients lining the shelves of your local health food store since they arent designed to treat a specific disease or ailment they typically arent regulated in the same way as pharmaceutical drugs business insider sat down with the new yorkbased elysium team which is now a little more than a year into producing its first product to learn more about their plans the goal improve cell health elysiums first product is called basis it aims to boost the levels of a specific protein called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad found in cells some studies in mice and yeast suggest that boosting nad levels may help prevent agingrelated decay in important structures in our cells called mitochondria  nad governs communication between the nucleus and everything else in the cell as well as how the cells communicate with one another said marcotulli as we age and nad levels fall the ability to communicate appropriately also drops in other words its like being on the end of a choppy phone line the less you can hear the more likely something will get lost in translation and go awry there havent been any studies of basis and nad in people just yet but elysium is currently recruiting volunteers for a human trial marcotulli and alminana heard about the possibility to work with nad through guarente whos been studying aging and nad in particular in his lab at mit back in  guarente wrote a paper which concluded that nad helped power special proteins called sirtuins for  years or more wed been studying proteins called sirtuins he told business insider he wanted to see how these proteins potentially affected aging and overall health along the way different kinds of natural products had appeared which could affect the activity of these sirtuins basis courtesy elysiumhealth guarente and his research team ultimately decided on two naturally occurring compounds the first was pterostilbene a type of micronutrient called a polyphenol thats present in tiny amounts in almonds grape leaves and blueberries the second was nicotinamide riboside a form of vitamin b thats also found in trace amounts in yeastcontaining foods and milkderived products like cheese and yogurt elysium hopes that by combining these compounds and providing them in larger quantities than the trace amounts found in food they could help the body make nad  although some research on pterostilibene and nicotinamide riboside has already been conducted showing everything from their bioavailability their ability to be absorbed by the body and safety to some potential antiaging qualities at least in rats elysium still has to show that their formulation also has all of these qualities for that they are conducting a study with the primary goal of examining nad levels in the blood if the supplement is successful the amount of nad should be higher in people taking it regularly than in the people taking a placebo the trial for basis is forthcoming and the study is currently recruiting according to clinicaltrialsgov the first year basis costs about  per month if you choose to pay as you go while a onetime bottle will set you back  you can also subscribe for a half or full year which costs  or  per month respectively at about a year into their development marcotulli said elysiums customers are in the tens of thousandsmarcotulli said theyve retained about a third of the customers whove been with them since february  when they launched basis the groups of people sticking with basis who started a few months later are even larger he said because elysium sold out for about  weeks toward the beginning which he said probably turned a fair number of people off of the product  elysium is testing five more products and plans to investigate others focused on improved overall health and wellness the concept of the company is that there are a lot of natural products out there guarante said we want to be able to recognize when theres something thats discovered in medical research that has the potential for benefiting human health and make that available as quickly as possible in a way thats safe see also most vitamins

health is an antiaging supplement manufacturer which recently released a pill called basis basis claims to turn back the signs of aging by literally repairing your dna normally this is the part where people click away thinking elysium health is another antiaging supplement scam but it’s not elysium health is a legitimate company founded by one of the world’s leading antiaging researchers oh and he’s being advised by five nobel prize winners yes elysium health’s basis is an antiaging supplement based on real science from legitimate researchers find out how this new antiaging company works today in our elysium health basis review click here to see the  rated skin care supplement what is elysium health at the official elysium health website the company describes itself as having one mission “to help people access understand and benefit from scientific breakthroughs in health” to back up that goal the company supports four distinct values transparency access progress and validation basically elysium health wants to give average people like you and me an honest glimpse into modern antiaging technology with no hype no fads and no shady ingredients of course even the shady supplement companies say stuff like this so here’s more validation for you the company was created in silicon valley by two gym buddies who saw an emerging opportunity in antiaging supplements those two gym buddies – cofounders eric marcotulli and dan alminana – knew that they didn’t have the scientific background to build such a company they were tech investors not biologists so they started calling antiaging researchers across the united states that’s when mit biologist leonard guarente picked up the phone and expressed interest and he wasn’t alone five nobel prize winners also jumped on as advisors along with over  other top researchers in their fields that’s why people are paying attention to what elysium health is selling what is elysium health selling elysium health just released its first product it’s called basis – or basis in the official marketing it’s a simple softgel tablet which costs  for a one month supply or  per month on the subscription program each package contains  capsules you take two capsules per day to achieve the full benefits how does elysium health basis work this new supplement is based on work that was pioneered in guarente’s lab specifically guarente studied sirtuins a group of enzymes which play a critical role in cell metabolism and energy production all living organisms have these sirtuins inside their body here’s the interesting thing about sirtuins scientists have shown that by boosting the activity of sirtuins they can extend the lifespans of worms mice yeasts and other living creatures for the past two decades scientists have been trying to develop drugs that elevate sirtuins there are also two known natural compounds which boost sirtuins activity resveratrol – found in red wine and sold as a dietary supplement – and nad nad stands for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and it’s one of the biggest antiaging discoveries of the last decade research has shown that nad levels are directly correlated to aging an old man will have about half the nad levels as his body did when he was young – regardless of exercise healthy eating or disease you may have already heard about nad in december  harvard researchers published a study describing how they made the cells of  year old mice look like the cells of  month old mice simply by “administering a molecule naturally produced by the human body” that molecule was nad whew so given all that information how exactly does basis work basis contains two building blocks for nad it gives your body the tools it needs to produce nad on its own yes there are just two ingredients needed to stimulate nad levels in the body those ingredients are — nicotinamide riboside mg — pterostilbene mg these two ingredients are absorbed by the body and ultimately transform into nad then that nad goes to work performing critical tasks throughout the body including — dna repair — energy production — cellular detoxification — protein function all of these functions lead to powerful antiaging healthboosting benefits click here to see the  rated skin care supplement elysium health basis ingredients up above i mentioned that there were two active ingredients in basis in addition to nicotinamide riboside and pterostilbene there are a number of other ingredients here’s the complete ingredient list as posted on the elysium health website but basis doesn’t call itself an antiaging supplement the funny thing about elysium health basis is that it’s not calling itself an antiaging supplement manufacturer despite enlisting the nation’s top antiaging researchers as advisors elysium health is calling itself a dietary supplement company in a recent interview elysium health cofounder marcotulli said “we have no interest in being an antiaging company and extending lifespan for us this is about increasing healthspan not lifespan” why the founders wanted to avoid the “charlatan feel” of the countless other antiaging supplements on the market today too many lowquality manufacturers claim they’ve found the secret to turning back the clock and reverse the effects of aging – despite having no scientific evidence to back it up elysium health wanted to stay far far away from the problematic reputations of these companies that’s why it’s advertising itself as more of a health and wellness company than an antiaging company future elysium health products elysium health has ambitious plans for the future america’s population is getting older – as are the populations of most developed countries that’s why the opportunity for future products is just going to get larger here are some of the products and targeted areas elysium health has suggested may be in its future lineup — brain health — musculoskeletal health these new products are expected to tap into the network of “more than  scientific advisors” currently signed on to the company how to buy elysium health basis elysium health doesn’t plan on releasing its products anywhere but the official website once again this is a strategic decision by the company designed to protect the elysium health brand you can walk into whole foods and see dozens of faceless pharmaceutical companies selling their own antiaging tonic elysium doesn’t want to be like that ordering from elysium health is easy especially since they only have one product basis in their current online store there are two ways to buy basis — one time  — monthly  both of those prices include shipping if you buy the monthly subscription of basis you’ll receive a shipment of basis in your mailbox along with a  charge on your credit card every month how to use elysium health basis basis comes in packages of  softgel tablets each “serving” includes  softgels elysium health recommends taking two softgel tablets per day or as recommended by your health care professional it only recommends basis for healthy adults  years of age or older it also recommends talking to a health care professional before beginning treatment click here to see the  rated skin care supplement related reviewsmore from author no lift and luminate triple action serum – tight firming skincare decabolic

personal dna weight loss helix health kit nordictrack fusion cst – cardio strength workout fitness trainer  comments i took basis for one solid year without missing days i found zero difference other than feeling sleepy at times which i am not certain is related to this product i think that it has a great marketing plan and i am certain people are gaining profits from all of the hype i did not find this to do anything for me and feel suspicious of the way it is being promoted by a bunch of old dudes making it their last ditch effort to make a ton of cash before hanging it up do some research on the backers of this and it does not offer comfort reply i’m  don’t exercise sit behind a computer all day and have had very bad eating habits for the past  yrs i was in a horrible relationship for those past  yrs  now that i’ve been out the relationship   mos i’ve focused on getting healthy i did get multinutrient testing done by spectracell  as well as magnesium rbc testing via requestatestcom to seek some ground truth as to what was going with my health the testing basically confirmed that i was in poor health … deficiencies in mg rbc  so low i was having heart palpitations anxiety and a few er visits   vitamin e inositol and cytesine and most of my antioxidant levels were borderline  i did my research as well as reviewed the summaries of the chromadex and elysium studies  i’m put off that they’ve not released the actual papers to date i’ve read nihgov research papers on magnesium supplements as well as listened to anyone i could deem somewhat credible on youtube  er doctor  etc  about magnesium as well as nadbasisnrnmn and nad via iv therapy i took this for the first time today and had immediate improvements in energy levels  hour after two capsules my enery levels were to the point almost of euphoria  i’ve not felt this good since i was in the military  and in much better shape   for me as i type this the results are astounding i’ve not taken any other supplements for the past  hours due to some stress testing my new dr wants me to get my takeaway from all of the above comments is that it appears that the older and more out of shape you are the larger and more immediate the impact and results for those that felt nothing  i would wonder if they are under  and workout as it appears the already young and mostly healthy would not benefit as much however for me this thing has been a freaking miracle in addition to taking supplements to get my deficient levels back to where they should be i’ll continue to take basis as well i’ll do testing again in  months to see where my levels are and perhaps post back results though i’m not sure how i would quantify nad results other than my subjective comments about how my body feels thanks reply i have been taking basis for  weeks now i can’t say for certain if i notice anything or not – some days i seem to have more energy some days i don’t some days i seem to sleep better some days i don’t i read a comment on another site where the person summarized what he had read from other comments – it seems that people experience more dramatic results if you are older overweight and don’t exercise much whereas people that are younger in shape and exercise regularly seem to notice less results this is just an observation people that are in better shape supposedly start to notice some results later on  months as has been mentioned numerous times – basis is more of a maintenance supplement and is not designed to boost your performance i plan on giving basis a good  months to a year to determine if i notice any benefits from my perspective – worst case it doesn’t do anything best case it improves the health of my cells and allows me to regain some of the benefits from my youth reply i’ve been taking the recommended dosage of basis by elysium faithfully for  months now i’m a healthy fit  yearold almost  and do feel something is different i have a subtle increase in energy my body and mind are just “working” a bit better and more effeciently my body feels more resilient and my mind just a bit sharper i am having crazy vivid and intense dreams every night though which is interesting i take no other supplements and no medications and it started about a couple weeks in i would have a crazy dream every once in awhile to having them more frequently about a month in and just gradually increasing i’m two months in and i’m having these vivid detailed and intense dreams every night all night long one after the other… and waking up remembering them there is no doubt in my mind that it is indeed the elysium i just find it a fascinating side effect reply i have been taking basis for  months or so and have have more energy and have healed astoundingly fast from some injuries including fractured arm and oral surgery i have recommended it several friends who notice a difference and even got my mom on it who seemed to heal from broken ribs quickly despite her age after  months of auto ship i bought the yearly which is  a month i’m totally convinced it does what it claims i’ve had no problem contacting them and putting my mom’s monthly auto ship on hold i can’t wait till they develop thier new products i’m sure new treatment for dna degradation of cells will emerge but i’ll be way ahead of the game by that point reply are you saying that because you knew your mom would live longer that you canceled her monthly supply reply i would like to order some i live in new york can i please get directions as to how to order or where to buy reply i would like to buy from hungary do you ship in hungary how much would the shipment be please let me know and thanks a lot in advance reply i first read the results of the basic benefits and why in the january  issue of “scientific american” i wonder why it has taken  years to start human trials it is such a breakthrough if it works on humans especially us older persons david crockett reply trials monitoring aging might take  years if you are over  do not wait for it reply you have never tried to get approval for human trials…it is a very lengthy process… reply yes but it has to begin sometime are you saying that there should never be trials because it is a lengthy process reply  years old working out every day taking basis for  days in my case it does seem to increase my energy levels slightly and it does help with recovery from weight lifting for me it works best when i take it before i go to sleep i take no other supplements yes it is unproved in clinical studies if you have time wait  years for results of those studies i do not reply i’m trying to buy this product but they keep asking for a personal referral code how and where do i find one reply don’t buy ittheir phone does not work and there is no way to communicate with them i had to cancel my credit card to stop payments warning it’s a scam reply i first bought a one month supply almost a year ago and received it in a timely manner i then purchased a yearly subscription beginning the next month through their online store the purchase through the store worked perfectly i receive the product i purchased in a timely manner each month i am a very happy and satisfied customer reply i have been taking this supplement for years now and it seems to counter the pesky effects of this darn ring that is stuck on my finger side effectshairy feet and pointy ears reply this is health insurance people otherwise just stick to the toxic stimulants reply where are all the comments for  did everyone stop taking this i don’t understand why arnt more people talking about this today is june   i took my  pills and i’m dozing and feeling tired i hope this isn’t that type of pill and the fact that it say something about red wine similar to well i don’t drink any wine or anything for that matter because alcohol beverage’s make me tired so anyone on here anymore have any good or not so good things to tell us on how your doing with this supplement reply i have been taking basis for a few months the capsules i take are white i read that they are supposed to be blue tablets not white capsules am i taking a scam version that is saying it’s basis reply i’m almost through my second bottle i know it should take a long time for any noticeable effects but i’ve felt more tired have less stamina stomach ache and sleeplessness going to stop taking it and see if these symptoms clear up reply king david addressed this issue over  years ago “who is the man who desires long life who longs to see many good days guard your tongue from speaking evil…avoid evil do good and pursue peace” that is the answer not necessarily swallowing a “magic pill” reply i took niagen for a month  got no effect a couple of weeks later they live cell i think called to see how i was doing i told them  they suggested that i take double doses with the second bottle i went through that in two weeks  still nothing recommendations anybody reply we have a product that has absolutely no evidence of working on people if the product worked it would be over the long term  no one would feel the benefits we have  nobel prize winners that are on our advisory board  they all agree no benefits are proven in humans we will do anything to make you feel as if there is promise in the potential of our product including mentioning its proven effectiveness in mice which to any expert means nothing there are so many cures that work on mice  not on humans that it would take a book to list just those who here thinks the people behind this company feel shame reply i have a degree in molecular biology from a prestigious us research university all of the research and information i’ve read about this product makes sense to me based on everything i learned in school i don’t say this to try to say that you should change your mind i think it is up to each of us to decide whether to use this supplement based on current information that is available i do say this to raise my hand and say hey this all makes sense to me personally and i’m happy to say i take these supplements daily and i do think you should stop trying to make other people change their minds i think each of us should read the available literature and make our own decision whether to take this supplement or not reply thank you for adding intelligence to this blog everyone who is interested in basis should read the literature on all the ingredients in basis  a metabolic repair  optimization product then make your decision whether to subscribe reply do we add this supplement to our daily supplement program or is the only product we need reply it’s not a nutritional supplement so if that’s what you’re referring to then yes just add it to your normal intake of supplements it’s not a substitute for anything you should still take your medications still take the supplements you take there aren’t any negative interactions that i’m aware of reply how and where do i order some basis  reply do you ship to norway tried to enter an order on your site but norway wasn’t on the list reply if you were wondering whether the sales approach based on no evidence worked on anyone here is your answer you could be on a deserted island on the far side of antartica  if there are vulnerable people there i am certain this company will find a way to find them get them in touch with their desires have them convince themselves based on cruel hopes  deliver to them reply bunco reply there are a lot of comments about feeling a big difference or not cellular health isnt about that at all this isn’t red bull cellular health alludes to things that affect us positively or negatively or not at all that are not evident by mere observation years of trials will need to be done on this and until then everyone who takes the product is acting on faith myself included reply lawrence i just started taking this today and while i’ve been reading the comments i keep dozing off have u hurd anything about tiredness  well i guess i’ll try again tomarrow it’s seems the very few people experienced energy and profound clearness in any way so that is disappointing to me to say the least  keep me posted hope your doing well with this  sincerely nancy reply get your money back reply i ordered one sixty doaller supply and have been taking two capsules in morning now for about three weeks  what i have been experiencing is increased energy and sometimes a jolt of uncontolable energy burst around mid morning  this seems to acurr after a morning run  i also feel that i have experienced an heightened mental clarity  i plan on finishing this supply and ordering another  i will not do the prescription plan as i don’t want to be locked in  i do feel that the website and the whole delivery of the product is very well thought out maybe even more then the effectiveness of the product which makes me a little skeptical  but let see what happens  reply today is the second day that i’ve taken my  day supply of basis what you refer to as an ‘energy burst’ i am experiencing as feeling uncomfortably hyper maybe like when i accidently took  sudafed instead of  for sinus congestion my ‘clarity’ too is more visual than mental again like my first reaction to taking claritin for allergies…… reply we took elysium’s product for a couple of months and did not experience any detectable differences be careful signing up with a subscription – we cancelled with them and although they confirmed the cancellation in writing they continued to charge our credit card and have yet to issue a refund furthermore they are trying to get us to take responsibility for the return of the unsolicited item just an fyi folks reply thank you it sounds like that fx testorstorone scam reply this is about cellular health it is not a stimulant or performance enhancing drug you may not notice anything at all except that possibly in the long term you remain healthier in many ways for instance if you don’t get cancer…how will you know if that’s a result of the nr and pterostilbene of basis will you really notice better cognitive function as you age how would you you would have to be able to switch back and for between the nonbasis version of you and the basis version of you the science is very sound but you have to make an effort to understand what they’re saying and take it on faith as lawrence above noted it’s not some cure all for everything it’s more like taking your car in for regular maintenance all the time your car runs perfectly for  years is that because it’s an amazing engineering job and you just got lucky or because you spent the money maintaining the car in optimum shape reply i’m in it for the long haul and i firmly believe that what i am putting into y body will give me a longer healthier life there will always be people who “feel” something from any particular supplement and those who “feel” nothing reply i received my basis supplements this past week i take the second pill just before bed i have now been having the most amazing dreams am wondering if this is a side effect dreamt i was flying swooping around with iridescent blue butterflies and brilliant yellow hummingbirds each night a vivid dream worth it just for these terrific dreams not sure when any other effects will kickin reply how does your energy level feel reply the other guy said this isn’t a red bull and it’s not a stimulant so i’m sitting here reading comments and dozing off as if i’m totally exhausted has anyone had this experience like this  reply i had crazy dreams as well but not necessarily as enjoyable as yours they started in the first day or two i normally remember my dreams but these were just so vivid and crazy coming night after night that i emailed them about it and they said they had not heard of this before i got sort of scared to go to sleep but they eventually went away i stopped taking elysium but now have a few more left and thought i should just finish them but i wanted to google around to see if anyone else has experienced this you’re not alone reply i’m reading an interesting mix of comments that appears to weigh on the positive side with the  plus crowd and not so positive on the under  crowd i’m  and have been taking basis for almost a month now i workout  to  hours a week depending on my busy schedule i do feel a subtle change in positive energy both at work recovering after workouts especially the next day i’ve also noticed a bit more mental clarity in my day to day communications and ability to absorb information i’ll likely try it for another  months and see how it goes reply i’m  and just a week in…would like to touch base with others in our age bracket…i’m doing the ketogenic diet as well and that alone has helped my recovery time from workouts i used to come home and just crash after a workout…now i’m up studying and lively til’ bedtime… reply bruce i am  and thinking of buying basis can you give me an update on how it has worked for you since your last post reply i tried this supplement for a week hoping to feel some benefit i am a  yr old male in good condition eat healthy and workout  x’s a week unfortunately i did not notice any additional energy if anything i felt more tired and not my usual self  days after i stopped taking it i came down with the flu probably just a coincidence but who knows i would like to try and get my money back i would not recommend reply as i’ve said to others…it’s not a performance enhancing substance think of it more like this you can take this or that supplement and you will notice an increase in performance the same as if you modify your car with a new part and you now have a higher top speed or more torque etc basis is about cellular health it’s more analogous to you make sure your car is properly maintained at all times every dent is repaired it’s protected from rust you treat the leather etc etc your car will not be faster more powerful or any better looking…it will just be in great shape you take care of yourself now and maintain your health just fine that’s great keep it up however basis addresses the issues that diet and exercise cannot stop your body will produce less nad your sirt activity will drop your body will suffer oxidative stress you can’t avoid those through diet and exercise alone they help definitely but basis is designed to return your nad and sirt activity to “younger” state pterostilbene is a more potent form of resveratrol and will help to counter the oxidative stress it’s about body maintenance rather than performance enhancement reply a week natural supplements take much longer to work as has been said it’s not red bull reply exactly and red bull will run out until you drink another  reply took first dose this everning stomach upset don’t know it is the basis or not did anyone have a problem at first reply does anyone know how basis compares to vitapulse created by princeton nutrients vitapulse is a natural supplement that’s claimed to provide advanced antioxidant support to help maintain healthy cardio function and cholesterol levels protect against cellular damage decrease inflammation and boost mitochondrial health and cellular energy according to elysium after decades of research by leading scientists and clinicians the basis nutritional supplement was designed to repair cells damaged by the aging process and environmental toxins while keeping healthy cells healthy how would you compare the two products should both be taken if no why reply i am a  year old male that has been lifting weights off and on my whole life since i was  years old i started taking basis around the same time that i was starting to lift weights again after being off for two months i always dread starting back up again due to the extreme soreness that i experience when lifting weights again after an extended off time i started taking basis with my first workout which lasted just under two hours and the first thing i noticed the next day was that i didn’t have the extreme soreness i worked out on monday took a  minute walk on tuesday worked out again on wednesday another walk on thursday and finally another workout and walk on friday i felt excellent in the past i would have been off the rest of the week after that first workout due to extreme soreness i can only attribute this energy level and quick recovery to basis which i will continue to take reply i am  yrs old and been taking basis for a month i just started the nd month i really haven’t felt much of a difference is that because of my age i am hearing that basis may not be as effective in younger people also i went into the press release area of elysium and all of their press is in first half of  with a supplement that everyone claims is so revolutionary i am a bit surprised their hasn’t been any news in more than  months any comments reply i order basis on line and i received a package in  dayswhich i am happy for thatbut the pills in the web side look like blue soft gelinstead i received a white capsulei am confused which is really and which is counterfeit reply the white capsule doesn’t have the blue coloring but is the same product otherwise i think basis switched several months ago as some supplement takers don’t like coloring dye reply my wife and i have been taking it for  months we both notice more energy better sleep and clearer minds we are both in our s reply have seen absolutely nothing as far as changes except extreme desire for more carbs don’t think i’ll be reordering because it really hasn’t shown me any benefitsalso seeing the same ingredients at local health stores for less than  do your research and maybe save some money reply i will look for the ingredients elsewhere first reply what is the name of the supplement at your local health store  reply here’s how you know it’s working you stop taking it and feel crappy again i’m blown away by the effect and i’m a total cynic i’m also very knowledgable about supplements and good health see for yourself it blew my mind mood lifter had energy a clear head could finish sentences wo searching for words… i just sent the company feedback i never do that or this but the product works for real and i have no idea what i’m taking really ps i’m  female and an athlete former reply hmm it seems to me that if the product is actually doing what it says it should do ie repair dna then you shouldn’t feel crappy after not taking it repair is repair no reply but we live in a world of instant gratification we want to feel and see an affect of taking a pill that is suppose to be good so i don’t know the mice can’t talk and there hasn’t been anyone on here that had a profound daily accruence while taking this just  guy saying he sees colors in his dreams witch that doesn’t sound like seeing colors would add years to my life  what do you think about this supplement  reply heidi i can’t believe it i have been taking one a day for three months just last week i was thinking about how my word selection came easier when talking i don’t feel like i need a nap in the middle of the day i am old and have increased libido which i was confused about all coincidence i don’t know i was going to chalk up the sentence making to a “good” day but  after what you said not so sure reply i think that it’s possible over time that your body integrates it into it’s physiological homeostasis then when you stop taking it you have once again unbalanced your homeostasis and it has to readjust so you feel tired as your body is working to readjust for example the thyroid glands of people who take thyroid supplements in time become dormant because the body no longer needs to make its own thyroid hormones that’s why people who take thyroid supplements usually never get off of them reply could you please put my autofill order on hold for two months i’ve gotten stacked up i’m enjoying the product but i’m not sure what to look for in terms of effectiveness any suggestions reply bottom line the product has not been tested on humans even elysium says “there is no scientific evidence yet that the pill would produce the same beneficial effect in humans as in mice” you can already purchase both compounds independently no information given on the efficacy of them i’ll wait until human studies are released before spending mo reply been reading up on this and work of drdavid sinclair looks like the real thing and the next big health product think it might be a good product to tryis there proof of body absorbing and using nad would like to know more is this a safe product would like to know reply chromadex is the sole supplier of nr at least where patents are protected and elysium uses that a chromadex study showed earlier in the year that taking mg of nr boosted nad levels of  adults by  whereas mg boosted nad levels  mg also boosted nad levels  this is likely why elysium recommends mg of nr a day plus mg of the blueberry extract they think has a synergistic effect since like resveratrol but much more bioavailable also elysium’s price has dropped to month of you buy a  month subscription their human trials are expected any week now unless there has been a delay i’ll consider it after the trial results are announced reply where would we locate the trail data you mentioned reply new trial data from chromadex and a couple of universities should be coming soon unfortunately i’m not sure how soon the previous results summary are at chromadex’s homepage they were included in company releases reply still waiting for the trials reply is there a money back guarantee if it doesnt work for me i really want to try it reply “basis contains two building blocks for nad it gives your body the tools it needs to produce nad on its own yes there are just two ingredients needed to stimulate nad levels in the body” is there evidence that a person has more nad after taking a couple of months of basis this seems like a simple test we should pressure elysium to release their finding reply when basis is available i will buy it and give it a try for  months i believe it is great and… i’m hoping it can reach or extend beyond the grand plateau of the original liquid seasilver supplement… that seasilver went to work on my body and countless others and i felt brand new too bad the government shut seasilver down… i will be fair to basis and give it time to work because i sense “honesty” “sincerity” and a deep compassion for human wellness by elysium reply i am still waiting for my orderits been over  months reply me too i emailed them a while ago and they said that the production isn’t meeting demand and that it could take up to  months to receive it they also said that they were working hard to fix the issue reply if this supplement works it doesn’t matter how long you wait for the order you’ll be young again in no time lol i’m still waiting on my snake oil order… it’s been  years and i wait by the door every day reply ordered mine and got in within a week but that’s now in  reply how can i get elysium basis in italy reply i had the same request from a friend of mine in italy they do not send there even finding someone who may try to send it would be some risky once i sent my mom some ordinary supplements from the usa to italy she had to go through a stack of papers and statements even if she stated it was personal use at the end the pills were returned to me since they were “not registered” reply all you italians and others just go to that web page reply hi how do i order from south africa  reply i emailed a question regarding my “basis” order to elysium health eric the ceo and cofounder answered me personally probably the best customer service ever i chose the monthly autofill option and i’ve been taking basis for a couple weeks now look forward to seeing what a few months does thanks eric reply i believe you can go to their website and purchase reply i would like to buy basis i live in italy how to procede reply where i can order for basis tablets or where i can buy it  help me reply good afternoon i would like to buy basis i live in italy how to procede could you answer methank you reply just go to their website its that easy reply you can buy it on their website reply where i can buy basis elysium health in italy reply forse

mia mamma e me li hanno rispediti perche’ “non approvati” anche se per uso personale qui ovviamente non ci sono problemi vai online e ti arriva a casa reply how i can order basis can i have the link

marcotulliericmarcotulli · founderceo of elysium healtheric marcotulli ceo of elysium health here i appreciate the thoughts and ideas offered on this page and i wanted to provide some of mine in return as well as answer some of the questions that were outlined efficacy  clinical data elysium’s mission is to solve the biggest challenges in health that cannot be done without conducting rigorous clinical research and actually assuming the responsibility of pushing that research forward in february  we submitted to clinicaltrialsgov the protocol for the first human study of our product basis – a placebocontrolled doubleblind randomized study of  healthy individuals between the ages of  and  the age bracket was chosen based upon the fact that these individuals would be the most depleted in their levels of nad the critical coenzyme that declines as we age and is the target of basis we posted it not only because we wanted to demonstrate our dedication to a rigorously architected study but because we are also committed to transparency   we concluded the study a few months ago and we have since analyzed the data and drafted a manuscript that we are submitting for the peerreview process – again because we want to meet and exceed the standards typically found in our broader market this past week we announced the topline results of that study • in the bracketed age group study participating taking our recommended dose of basis saw an average increase in nad levels of  in the first  days and kept that increase constant at  days this equates to nad levels those individuals would have had during their youth  • the p value for this change was  • the placebo group did not see a change at all  • there were no material adverse events and the product was well tolerated this is important in that for the first time ever it was demonstrated that a product basis can safely increase and sustain nad levels the remainder of our findings and full study analysis will be published in the months ahead i am happy to see such fervor regarding the need for these studies and you will see more of them related to basis and our pipeline products in fact a significant amount of our recently announced funding will go toward clinical research conducted at top tier institutions and focused on highseverity areas in human health share· months agowould you recommend elysium health to

claiming to be more scientific than other supplements companies but they are selling their products before doing the trials this is a nootrobox clone look at the team pedigree probably nice dudes but

their new supplement–with the backing of some of the world’s foremost authorities on aging–could change how you get older top photo sarah salmelagetty imagesby jessica leber minute readsay someone came up to you selling a dietary supplement–a pill that you take once a day–that could boost your energy improve your body’s ability to repair its dna and keep you healthier as you get olderadvertisementit might sound like a scam or more likely just another in a sea of confusing undifferentiated claims that make up the  billion dollar supplement industrybut let’s say that someone is mit’s lenny guarente one of the world’s leading scientists in the field of aging research and he’s being advised by five nobel prize winners and two dozen other top researchers in their fields you might pay a little more attention elena ray via shutterstock the scientist and the startupcofounding a supplement company seems an unlikely career move for someone like guarente a man who is one of the most wellrespected scientists in his field “it is a departure” guarente admits mostly for him getting involved in elysium health is a decision born out of opportunity and frustration the opportunity is the chance to make a difference by translating findings in the booming field of aging research directly to consumers today the frustration is that doing this has taken so long in the first place“my biggest hope is that we can make available to people something that is currently unavailable and that it will have a positive impact on their health” guarente sayselysium health actually had its beginnings in conversations between its other two younger cofounders eric marcotulli and dan alminana who were then tech investors and gym buddies even though they’re both quite healthconscious they knew they couldn’t halt the march of aging and all the ailments that come with it far more than diet or anything else people can control the biggest risk factor for many of the diseases that kill us–including diabetes cancer and cardiovascular disease–is simply getting older straight  photography via shutterstock marcotulli knew something about the market opportunity too which has also lately attracted the likes of google with its calico labs project and other silicon valley investors he had studied the story of a company called sirtris pharmaceuticals which in the mids was working to take resveratrol the natural antiaging compound found in red wine and alter it into a more potent form that could be patented and developed into a medical drug in  sirtris–founded by guarente’s former postdoc david sinclair–was acquired by the drugmaker glaxosmithkline for a jawdropping  millionadvertisement“the fundamental question was are there other natural products out there that could be meaningful i think resveratrol was the first and i was thinking there’s maybe the potential for many others” marcotulli remembers thinking as he studied the story while in business schoolthe two started coldcalling scientists involved in aging research and were surprised how many were enthusiastic about the idea including guarente the fda doesn’t recognize aging itself as a condition so instead companies like sirtris and gsk are are taking scientific findings about how we age and translating them into drugs that treat specific agerelated diseases the issue is that the clinical trials involved in doing this can take more than a decade and even then that is no guarantee a drug will be approved the result has been that though scientists have made major strides in understanding how and why we age and demonstrating that this aging can be delayed they’ve so far seen few results in translating their work to help peoplethe two entrepreneurs wanted to take a very different approach than the drug makers sell only unaltered natural products which generally aren’t patented and don’t need fda approval and create new kinds of supplements that make no claim to treat

the activity of sirtuins which is sometimes done by calorie restriction diets can extend lifespan of yeasts worms mice and other animals efforts to develop a drug that can have the same effect without the lack of calories have been going on for the last two decades including at sirtris and glaxosmithkline there are also natural compounds that elevate sirtuins–one is resveratrol which is already

olderadvertisementit might sound like a scam or more likely just another in a sea of confusing undifferentiated claims that make up the  billion dollar supplement industrybut let’s say that someone is mit’s lenny guarente one of the world’s leading scientists in the field of aging research and he’s being advised by five nobel prize winners and two dozen other top researchers in their fields you might pay a little more attention elena ray via shutterstock the scientist and the startupcofounding a supplement company seems an unlikely career move for someone like guarente a man who is one of the most wellrespected scientists in his field “it is a departure” guarente admits mostly for him getting involved in elysium health is a decision born out of opportunity and frustration the opportunity is the chance to make a difference by translating findings in the booming field of aging research directly to consumers today the frustration is that doing this has taken so long in the first place“my biggest hope is that we can make available to people something that is currently unavailable and that it will have a positive impact on their health” guarente sayselysium health actually had its beginnings in conversations between its other two younger cofounders eric marcotulli and dan alminana who were then tech investors and gym buddies even though they’re both quite healthconscious they knew they couldn’t halt the march of aging and all the ailments that come with it far more than diet or anything else people can control the biggest risk factor for many of the diseases that kill us–including diabetes cancer and cardiovascular disease–is simply getting older straight  photography via shutterstock marcotulli knew something about the market opportunity too which has also lately attracted the likes of google with its calico labs project and other silicon valley investors he had studied the story of a company called sirtris pharmaceuticals which in the mids was working to take resveratrol the natural antiaging compound found in red wine and alter it into a more potent form that could be patented and developed into a medical drug in  sirtris–founded by guarente’s former postdoc david sinclair–was acquired by the drugmaker glaxosmithkline for a jawdropping  millionadvertisement“the fundamental question was are there other natural products out there that could be meaningful i think resveratrol was the first and i was thinking there’s maybe the potential for many others” marcotulli remembers thinking as he studied the story while in business schoolthe two started coldcalling scientists involved in aging research and were surprised how many were enthusiastic about the idea including guarente the fda doesn’t recognize aging itself as a condition so instead companies like sirtris and gsk are are taking scientific findings about how we age and translating them into drugs that treat specific agerelated diseases the issue is that the clinical trials involved in doing this can take more than a decade and even then that is no guarantee a drug will be approved the result has been that though scientists have made major strides in understanding how and why we age and demonstrating that this aging can be delayed they’ve so far seen few results in translating their work to help peoplethe two entrepreneurs wanted to take a very different approach than the drug makers sell only unaltered natural products which generally aren’t patented and don’t need fda approval and create new kinds of supplements that make no claim to treat a specific disease but promote general wellness instead“if there’s a benefit that can be had now then i think it doesn’t make sense to wait a decade or more until some derivative from a drug company

workforceleadershipfrom office footwear to bad interview answers this week’s top leadership stories the antiaging pill  mit technology review rewriting life the antiaging pill facing a long wait for evidence a longevity researcher takes an unusual path to market by karen weintraub february   an antiaging startup hopes to elude the us food and drug administration and death at the same time the company elysium health says it will be turning chemicals that lengthen the lives of mice and worms in the laboratory into overthecounter vitamin pills that people can take to combat aging the startup is being founded by leonard guarente an mit biologist who is  “unfortunately” he says and who’s convinced that the process of aging can be slowed by tweaking the body’s metabolism see is there a fountain of youth in our dna everyone is getting older few are happy about it the problem guarente says is that it’s nearly impossible to prove in any reasonable time frame that drugs that extend the lifespan of animals can do the same in people such an experiment could take decades that’s why guarente says he decided to take the unconventional route of packaging cuttingedge lab research as socalled nutraceuticals which don’t require clinical trials or approval by the fda this means there’s no guarantee that elysium’s first product a blue pill called basis that is going on sale this week will actually keep you young the product contains a chemical precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or nad a compound that cells use to carry out metabolic reactions like releasing energy from glucose the compound is believed cause some effects similar to a diet that is severely short on calories—a proven way to make a mouse live longer elysium’s approach to the antiaging market represents a change of strategy for guarente he was previously involved with sirtris pharmaceuticals a highprofile biotechnology startup that studied resveratrol an antiaging compound found in red wine that it hoped would help patients with diabetes that company was bought by drug giant glaxosmithkline but early trials failed to pan out this time guarente says the idea is to market antiaging molecules as a dietary supplement and follow up with clients over time with surveys and postmarketing studies guarente is founding the company along with eric marcotulli a former venture capitalist and technology executive who will be ceo and dan alminana chief operating officer the company says it will follow strict pharmaceuticalquality production standards and make the supplements available solely through its website for  for a day supply or  per month with an ongoing subscription “you have highend prescription drugs up here which are expensive” says guarente gesturing upward “and you have the nutraceuticals down there which are a pig in a poke—you don’t know what you’re getting and you don’t know a lot about the science behind them there’s this vast space in between that could be filled in a way that’s useful for health maintenance” an antiaging pill with an ivorytower pedigree could prove profitable the  billion supplements market is growing at about  percent a year overall alminana says and at twice that rate for online sales elysium declined to name its investors but it has some highlevel endorsements its board includes daniel fabricant former director of the fda’s division of dietary supplements and now ceo of the natural products association a trade association the company also has five nobel prize winners advising it including neuroscientist eric kandel biologist thomas südhof originoflife theorist jack szostak and the  laureate in chemistry martin karplus karplus now an emeritus professor at harvard said in a telephone interview that he was turning  this year and had asked the company to send him a supply of basis as soon as it’s available “i want to remind myself whether i really want to take it or not” says karplus scientists have shown they can reliably extend the life of laboratory mice by feeding them less a process known as “caloric restriction” that process seems to be mediated by biological molecules called sirtuins nad is important because it’s a chemical that sirtuins need to do their work and is also involved in other aspects of a cell’s metabolism in worms mice and people nad levels fall with age says guarente so the idea is to increase levels of the molecule “nad replacement is one of the most exciting things happening in the biology of aging” says nir barzilai director of the institute for aging research at the albert einstein college of medicine in new york who has coauthored scientific papers with guarente but is not involved in elysium “the frustration in our field is that we have shown we can target aging but the fda does not recognize it as an indication” other experts said while nad may decline with age there is limited evidence that aging can be affected by restoring or increasing nad levels “there is enough evidence to be excited but not completely compelling evidence” said brian k kennedy ceo of the californiabased buck institute for research on aging guarente says elysium’s pill includes a precursor to nad called nicotinamide riboside which the body can transform into nad and put to use in addition the pill contains pterostilbene an antioxidant that guarente says stimulates sirtuins in a different way both ingredients can already be found in specialty vitamins  “we expect a synergistic effect from combining them” he says  guarente says elysium plans to gradually add to its product line with other compounds shown in academic labs to extend the healthy lifespan of worms mice or other animals the company will do preliminary testing to make sure the products are not toxic but will not follow the arduous fda approval process vitamins and supplements can be sold over the counter as long as they contain ingredients known to be safe and don’t make overly specific health claims marcotulli says the company has some anecdotal evidence that elysium’s pills make a difference “for older demographics we’ve heard really interesting feedback related to levels of energy it’s very very useful and restorative” he says and he takes the pills himself “when i don’t have a supply i feel actually fuzzy” he said “it’s become a staple of my routine” guarente also says he takes basis every day along with  mg of resveratrol the redwine compound guarente also exercises—though not he says as often as he should he says it doesn’t trouble him that he sees no obvious benefits yet from his supplement regimen too many studies in the antiaging field he says are too shortterm to show real benefits or else they study people who are already unhealthy “i think that’s the way it would be if something is really acting to slow your progression into decrepitude—you’re not going to notice that” guarente says cut off read unlimited articles today become an insider already an insider log in subscribe to

evidence  healthnewsrevieworg story reviews news release review blog posts  posts  story reviews  news release reviews  blog posts menu february   read original story five nobel laureates backing antiaging dietary supplement reviewed by rating categories boston globe supplements tags antiaging five nobel laureates backing antiaging dietary supplement our review summarythe pill described in this story is the first product of elysium health a new company formed with the backing of many leading researchers in the field the company claims to be science and data driven and suggests that its product is superior to other dietary supplements that haven’t been scientifically validated we think the story should have been more forceful in exposing the hypocrisy of that stance the company says it will provide evidence to support its claims at some point in the future but it is selling the supplements now so it is essentially doing the same thing that other unscrupulous supplement sellers are doing — enriching themselves based on the “promise” of a product that hasn’t been shown to provide any health benefit the fact that nobel laureates are the ones doing it is unfortunate since their stature will distract consumers from the emptiness of the company’s claims with all that being said the article does inject some context and a healthy dose of skepticism into this trendy topic it doesn’t accept the company’s claims without challenge it juxtaposes the big name affiliations of the company’s leaders and advisers with the uncertainty surrounding their wares we just think it should have done more on that front and put it higher up in the story  why this mattersdietary supplements are widely available but lightly regulated when big scientific names back such a product good reporting is critical to cut through the hype and shed light on the product’s real value we’re pleased to see that many commenters on this story apparently saw through the smoke screen of nobel names and sniffed out what’s really going on here “mice are not people and these guys are making those claims based on mice trials alone if those pills are such a cat’s meow how about getting some human volunteers to test them on and give enough time to have real provable results then publish a scientific paper based on that” “wow nobel laureates “advising” a company on dietary supplements shades of linus pauling but people still swear by massive doses of vitamin c to cure anything and everything” “apparently even noble laureates need to make a buck where’s the meat…ooops… the data” “how about if you conduct the studies in humans and if they are positive then you market the pill” criteria does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention satisfactory the story tells us early on in the story that a month’s supply of the pill called basis costs  so consumers will pay up to  a year for the privilege of helping the company test its pills does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatmenttestproductprocedure not satisfactory the article quotes the company as saying that higher levels of the “natural compound” found already in the human body that is targeted by active ingredients in basis has been associated with improved health in older mice and that the pill has not been studied in humans however the article doesn’t tell us anything about the mouse studies directly what sort of “improved health” did researchers find in the mice have researchers studied the active ingredients in basis or just the compound that these ingredients target to be clear the story also quotes skeptical researchers who are asking very similar questions for example “what does it mean to improve metabolic health and what exactly is being repaired in the body and is the outcome the same for everyone” but did the story pose these tough questions to the company and fail to get a response if so a brief acknowledgment of that effort would have earned the story a satisfactory rating here another route to a satisfactory score would have been to summarize some previous studies involving the active ingredients in basis such as pterostilbene does the story adequately explainquantify the harms of the intervention not satisfactory the story suggests that supplements such as basis “have to be shown to be safe for humans to take” prior to being sold and the story does not mention any potential harms this language will likely give readers a false sense of security how can we be sure that a product is “safe for humans to take” if it’s never been tested in humans even if we don’t know what specific harms might occur with this supplement the story could have referenced examples of previous supplements that passed regulatory muster but were subsequently shown to cause serious harm eg ephedra it could also have mentioned the harm to your wallet of spending  a year on an untested product does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence satisfactory we thought the story could have done a better job of grilling the nobel laureates associated with this company for example it lets one of them suggest that their product is somehow better than the supplements sold at whole foods and cvs where “you see miles of dietary supplements and vitamins” that have “no scientific basis” in fact a supplement that’s never been tested in humans also has little if any scientific basis for being sold the story does redeem itself later on by explaining the lack of evidence in humans with respect to the basis pill and dietary supplements in general example “there is no scientific evidence yet that the pill would produce the same beneficial effect in humans as in mice” does the story commit diseasemongering not satisfactory the premise of the new supplement — one that is never challenged by the story — is that aging is somehow a “condition” that needs to be treated with a new medicine loss of muscle and other aspects of aging are normal changes that people experience as they age — not conditions in need of a cure the framing of aging as a “condition” opens the door to expensive and untested approaches that waste money and encourage the use of more pills that can interact unpredictably the story should have done more to resist this framing does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest satisfactory the article quotes a reputable source who provides an appropriately skeptical view — one of the strongest aspects of this piece does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives not satisfactory we give the story credit for mentioning that each of the active ingredients in basis are already available in separate pills but since the story is about a company that claims to offer healthier aging in a pill we thought it was especially important to mention nonchemical approaches that are also associated with healthy aging such as a good diet and exercise the story didn’t do that does the story establish the availability of the treatmenttestproductprocedure satisfactory the article mentions the pill will be available online and debuted on tuesday does the story establish the true novelty of the approach satisfactory the story provides excellent context for this product it explains that the active ingredients are sold separately but this is the first time this particular compound has been produced does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release satisfactory the article goes beyond any press release total score  of  satisfactory comments  we welcome

leave this field empty taruk november   at  am about nobel laureates does anyone remember long term capital  they also had a bunch nobel laureates on staff it did not prevent them from loosing their shirts and almost ruining world economy little knowledge is a dangerous thing and we know so little about how body really works not withstanding all the geniuses with fancy titles reply c february   at  am so true taruk it is sad to see scientists involved in sham science for pay on balance mit and other institutions have been weakened by their focus on monetizing science which leads to lots of gamesmanship and productization marvin minsky would not have approved reply allan lindh november   at  pm your review is too harsh the scientists involved are not  yr old linus paulings they are the best in the field with extraordinary records real achievements and they don’t need to make a buck hacking snake oil this may not prove out but the underlying basis and the support are night and day compared to other dietary supplements heaping ignorant scorn on everything is the order of the day but you simply displayed your ignorance in this one reply gary schwitzer november   at  pm allan your own comment – “this may not prove out” – speaks to the focus of our review as one of the four reviewers of this piece i stand by what we wrote nearly  months ago when this review was published “the company says it will provide evidence to support its claims at some point in the future but it is selling the supplements now so it is essentially doing the same thing that other unscrupulous supplement sellers are doing — enriching themselves based on the “promise” of a product that hasn’t been shown to provide any health benefit the fact that nobel laureates are the ones doing it is unfortunate since their stature will distract consumers from the emptiness of the company’s claims” one man’s “heaping ignorant scorn” is another man’s review of the publicly available evidence or lack thereof gary schwitzer publisher healthnewsrevieworg reply dan bellack april   at  am we have heard about “guilt by association” this is a case of “value by association” the appeal of mit harvard and nobel laureate adds value to an untested product as an aging adult i prefer “seasoned adult” i was drawn to the potential offered in the original article being skeptical of most claims i sought out any evidence or reviews by users there are several reviews but no evidence that this product does what it claims this review tells us why we should be skeptical of any of these claims however remember the cigarette companies’ claims that “just because rats got cancer doesn’t mean humans will” may debunk that “all species are unique” idea i will wait to try this product if i ever do until there are human trials and data to support the claims right now i’ll hold on to my money this healthnewsreview is an excellent example of critical thinking and important for anyone considering buying this product jeff sherman september   at  pm i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in  when i was  i have taken about  different fdaapproved and humantested drugs over the years the mechanism of action for the great majority is unknown the human trials i believe ranged from  to  weeks the fda does not test nor approve food supplements i could not wait  years for extensive longitudinal human trials of those medications i needed relief in the shortterm for this debilitating disease my condition is wellmanaged with my current medications aren’t mice similar at the cellular level to humans i have had only a few mildly negative reactions to any of the drugs i have taken those ended immediately when i stopped taking them i am not afraid to try basis for at least  days what have i got to lose aside from  kevin lomangino september   at  am jeff the list of minimally tested supplements that have caused harm to those taking them is long the decision as to whether or not to take such supplements is a personal one and may be influenced by many different factors we would suggest that applying animal research to humans without recognizing the huge gap between animal and human physiology is unwise further reading on that topic httpswwwhealthnewsrevieworgproblemhealthstoriesbasedanimalresearch kevin lomangino managing editor michael january   at  am i would like to suggest that this supplement may just be beneficial or not however it is somewhat refreshing to see a supplement which emanated from actual research one cannot prove the effects of the supplement yet it may have to be tweaked and as with any newly released product evidence may not present itself as to efficacy for quite a long time individuals who this supplement for more then a year or two may just see improved lab results related to liver function but that is a big maybe if you “feel” better on the supplement then it becomes subjective rather than objective one fact is relevant there is no fountain of youth reply shaji january   at  am on the question of whether the story commit disease mongering i believe the conclusion is wrong most chronic diseases appear as we age when we are young our metabolic machinery is able to keep these diseases at bay and merely suggesting that it is an accumulation of insults to cellular machinery that is leading to these diseases is totally untested and lacks scientific evidence other than modifications in dna or other epigenetic changes one can argue equally well that these lesions in our geneticepigenetic or other cellular machinery appear because the cellsbody begins to lose its ability to repair such insults there are certainly better evidence for this  if so what distinguishes atherosclerosis from aging both involve some alternation of the normal cellular machinery which is moreorless intact when we are young if so aging is a disease akin to other chronic diseases that we see in aging us fda even has allowed metformin to be tested in clinical trials as an antiaging agent through monitoring of surrogate diseases markers it is only a matter of time before we classify aging as the biggest disease of all reply gary schwitzer january   at  am and that in turn might then be classified as the greatest act of diseasemongering of all reply tsfranks february   at  pm it reminds me of the movie josey wells in the movie the indian chef suggests to the carpet bagger that he drink the potion he’s selling if his claim that it cures everything is true………same here do the makers use it reply marilyn robinson february   at  pm as ts franks asked do any of the “makers” take the product i do not notice an answer to his question i think i will wait to order until i see a response from the makers thank you i will keep watching for a while to see if an answer does appear would be nice reply michael feldman february   at  pm “the premise of the new supplement — one that is never challenged by the story — is that aging is somehow a “condition” that needs to be treated with a new medicine loss of muscle and other aspects of aging are normal changes that people experience as they age — not conditions in need of a cure”i would disagree with this view of aging that is something that does “not need a cure” just because it’s a natural process falling out of a tree and breaking your leg is a natural process too as is the the occurence of cancer due to immune system deteriation a specific natural process of aging it doesn’t mean we don’t treat such conditions ignoring treatment interventions because aging doesn’t represent a specific disease seems like faulty logic also i think thecriticism that “the story does not compare the approach with existing alternatives” is misplaced the focus of the story was the elysium product it was not meant to be a treatise on aging interventions i think the rest of the critique is basically valid reply dr robert reed march   at  pm twenty years ago vitamin a was all the rage in the anti oxidation community unfortunately over the past twenty years it has become obvious that vitamin a supplements can and do increase overall cancer risks not reduce them furthermore anti oxidation is not a health benefit at the cellular level but rather an interfering property in the body’s continual adjustment to age related changes specifically oxidation occurs for a reason and one is its ability to destroy cells in a timely fashion before they become dysfunctionalread cancerous to the body i suspect this latest fad will go the way of the vitamin a hype and the fenfen disaster of bygone times hopefully there will not be lethal carnage before the hype is replaced by real knowledge reply helix march   at  am re “mice are not people and these guys are making those claims based on mice trials alone if those pills are such a cat’s meow how about getting some human volunteers to test them on and give enough time to have real provable results then publish a scientific paper based on that” i agree with the sentiment here but i think it’s impractical human studies especially antiaging studies literally take decades to produce conclusive results an advantage of mouse studies is the drastically shorter life span of mice which can give a quick indication of the possible benefits of a health regime imo the elysium claims come with a big asterisk the claim is unproven in humans and any real “proof” is years off if one believes their claims though their claims have been demonstrated in mice as with all supplements act accordingly reply bobluhrs march   at  pm the fact it’s unproven doesn’t mean it doesn’t work just that we have no idea if it works i think it is good that they are going ahead with it despite their lack of research on humans provingdisproving this would probably take decades even if there were adequate funding so the real choice of something proven versus something unproven doesn’t exist in this realm small animal studies with shorter lifespans are as of now the only relevant tests even if they aren’t conclusive i hope there will measures of ageing in humans that will point out if something is helping or not without waiting decades to see but i think it’s unrealistic to expect to be able to buy a treatment at your friendly health food store that is proven yet somehow undiscovered by the world it is good to point out that animal studies don’t prove a thing besides the concept they don’t translate to people it’s like the old joke “what’s the problem using lawyers instead of lab rats for medical studies ans it’s hrder to extrapolate the results back to the human population” reply todd kreider april   at  pm i was going to write what allan lindh wrote and think the critique was too harsh of a surprisingly good article one person asked if any of the scientists were taking elysium basis the founder leonard guarente was quoted in another article when the news of the new company came out that he was taking basis along with mg of aspirin  units of vitamin d and mg of resveratrol nobel laureate martin karplus “said in a telephone interview that he was turning  this year and had asked the company to send him a supply of basis as soon as it’s available “i want to remind myself whether i really want to take it or not” says karplus” mit technology review feb   i haven’t tried elysium basis yet and will buy the ingredients separately if they cost less so far they haven’t from what i searched my friend who is  has tried it for  months and is very happy with basis she reported that a few years ago she tried to go from  lbs to  lbs with diet and exercise and met her goal but was “starving” so quit last summer after taking basis for a while she again saw she had dropped to  lbs but that unlike before it was effortless and felt great this is similar to when i took  mg of resveratrol for a few weeks and saw the same percentage drop in weight –  when i reduced the amount to mg a day the weight came back human studies have been conducted through the nr wholesaler chromadex that showed safety and that  mg  mg and  mg of nr increased nad in the subjects they have started a new longer trial and the earlier trials will appear in a peer reviewed publication this spring three major universities have also completed nr trials but publishing takes time i agree that some detail of the mouse studies should have been summarized in the article unlike your  out of  rating i’d give the article a  out of  reply kevin lomangino april   at  am todd as we’ve said time and again anecdotes are not evidence the experience of a few people who’ve taken the supplement is not science claims about safety based on data that haven’t been published aren’t justified our critique of the story and the related product marketing stand kevin lomangino managing editor reply todd april   at  am this simply isn’t true anecdotes are evidence but i agree only some evidence the peer review study will be out very soon although i think only showing that nr significantly increases nad in humans just as it has been shown to in mice i’m still waiting to take it but i know what  mg of resveratrol did to me almost ten years ago what i don’t know is if those good changes in weight loss and stamina would have continued had i not reduced to  mg to say ” so it is essentially doing the same thing that other unscrupulous supplement sellers are doing — enriching themselves based on the “promise” of a product that hasn’t been shown to provide any health benefit” was way over the top have you emailed the six nobel laureates at elysium or the nobel laureate who advises chromaex i thought not kevin lomangino april   at  pm todd we’ll have to agree to disagree on this i don’t see what point there would be to emailing the nobel laureates at elysium either a product has evidence showing a health benefit in humans or it doesn’t this product doesn’t end of story thanks for reading and commenting kevin kathleen bishop april   at  pm thank you for breaking the spell as i was starting to go down the rabbit hole great article when i read the article i got the same feeling i get when i watch an infomercial so i went to their website which is pretty slick the thing that made me research a little further was the lower price if you buy a  month supply this is a classic ripoff tactic where they tap your bank account and it’s difficult to cancel sure enough on another site people were complaining about being charged after cancelation then i found this website and your fair and balanced critique good work i will get a massage with that  a month reply glenn klausner april   at  am what everyone misses here is the power of the human mind the placebo effect is a proven feel good pill if people are really convinced that the supplement they are taking is beneficial their positive thoughts will trancsend into better health mind over matter exists as numerous studies show positive people heal much faster than their negative counterparts let the placebo effect do its work even at high cost if it helps just a thought reply tom sharples may   at  pm clearly it’s not reasonable or practical to expect apriori results proving efficacy in humans – unless you’re willing to wait on hell of a long time for something not to happen i’m not reply thomas heimann may   at  am your article criticises the lack of human trials to establish efficacy mice are not humans well first of all mice do share some similarities that make them effective subjects to test certain treatments most importantly though mice have a very short life span approx  years max so testing nr for example on mice and observing that a previously  year old mice is now exhibiting traits of a  months old mice is significant to replicate this in humans would given the human lifespan vs the lifespan of mice take decades to come up with any conclusions the company elysium does not make any direct claims but it does draw parallels naturally if their product were to effectively slow down your aging or even reverse it to some degree at a cellular level then the person taking the supplements would probably not notice very much so i do agree that this is another product sold to an audience of primarily aging people who want to stop or reverse the process some very smart people to indeed feel that aging is a condition rather than something that inevitably happens and that extending our lifespan is something that absolutely will happen as it has already just compare today’s life expectancy of an american or european to that  years ago it has increased by well over  reply eric peterson phd june   at  pm as a psychologist i would suggest there might be a positive placebo effect nevertheless if the product is as good as the researchers believe why fifty dollars a month if it truly works i know clients would who happily pay thousands per month to potentially live longer… helping rats live longer might be considered a worthy endeavor but hardly cause celebre… simply put i smell a rat show empirical evidence the telomere length is restored and i will be the first in line to buy a decade’s supply… stem cell research appears to provide far more reliable and verifiable results than supplements imo… remember what wc fields once said… reply jacek piterow june   at  am what bugs me the most is the secrecy about ingredients if the goal of the scientists is to allow benefits seen in the lab for general human population not greed and expected results to be seen no sooner then after decades none of inventors will make fortune in their lifetime then why to hide information what is in it it is very uncomfortable to take a chemical on daily bases unknowing what it is unless… and here you can write any conspiracy theory you can come up with saying all that i have purchased one month supply for good of the science and used it seems to get me off the netflix and back to daily chores easier but it may be a placebo effect i think i will try another one placebo or not things are getting done and that whats counts unless i will loose my health to it then that will kinda suck reply marc emrich july   at  pm i am about to start using basis this is in reply to mr piterow’s comment there are only two ingredients in basis both available readily elsewhere but basis is as cheap or cheaper than trying to find the products alone and combining interviews that i have read from dr guarante state that resvatratol efficacy goes up with ingesting the nad and so i plan to begin taking resvaratol supplements as well here is a link to the ingredients httpswwwelysiumhealthcomsupplementfacts reply × our comments policy we welcome comments which users can leave at the end of any of our
