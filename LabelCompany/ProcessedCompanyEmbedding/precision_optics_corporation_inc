is our specialty  we were founded as an optics molding company and today we continue the tradition by offering unmatched polymer optics processing expertise  when your design defies conventional injection molding design rules look no further than the processing engineers at diverse optics to find the solution  sure we use the fundamentals like taguchi design of experiment doe window processing and decoupled scientific molding but we also layer in over  years of our own secret sauce to guarantee your molded optics – thousands of them – are functional works of art if you’ re looking for high volume series production integration of optical and mechanical functionality consistent parttopart repeatability high precision to cost ratio rapid production of precision polymer optics then injection molding is the right choice  compared to other optics manufacturing processes injection molding offers the greatest value in optics manufacturing  nominal material cost coupled with a relatively low cost manufacturing process offers unbeatable savings compared to traditional glass optics manufacturing diverse optics injection molding facts injection molding machines ranging

molding – alot different the same can be said about optics tooling – it’s quite a bit different than traditional commodity injection tooling when you’re working with optical prescription irregularity tolerances in millionths of an inch and your customers expect total perfection shot after shot then your injection molds have to be precise new molds at diverse optics we don’t cut corners on injection molds our new mold procurement process ensures that your tooling is designed and built for years of worryfree series production up to a million molded optics – guaranteed we start by listening to our customer to fully understand the unique requirements of their program we gather our team of experts for a comprehensive program review and provide feedback that often times includes suggestions to improve performance and reduce cost our engineers determine the right mold design concept for your optics based on over  years of experience building hundreds of optics molds we know what works – and more importantly what doesn’t after you are fully satisfied and all requirements questions and concerns have been addressed we move on to tooling fabrication strategic alliances with an extensive support base of experienced domestic and offshore mold makers ensure our customer’s objectives for quality delivery and value are met our engineers match strategic mold making partners to your requirements conduct mold design reviews perform mold flows as necessary provide detailed delivery information and ensure all your specifications are achieved our process includes a complete set of d and d tool designs that are reviewed and “redlined” until we are satisfied upon request designs are shared with our customer for their approval prior to tool build to maintain tight schedules we focus on early delivery of optical pins and inserts only a few weeks into the tool build this enables us to work on optical surfaces concurrently with the rest of the build the mold base and optical components are delivered simultaneously for final assembly inspection and the beginning of mold trials society of plastics industry spi tooling classifications class  mold – guaranteed for  cycles or more built for extremely high production made with only the highest quality materials class  mold – guaranteed for  cycles medium to high production mold good for abrasive materials andor parts requiring close tolerances class  mold – guaranteed for  cycles low to medium production mold class  – guaranteed for  cycles low production mold used only for limited production preferably with nonabrasive materials moderate price range class  – guaranteed for  –  cycles light production  prototype mold used only for limited production preferably with nonabrasive materials low price range acceptance of customer transferred tooling diverse optics welcomes the opportunity for customers to transfer their molds to us from other suppliers – what we call transfer tooling as forrest gump liked to say transfer molds are indeed “like a box of chocolates you never know what you’re going to get” over the years we have inherited many molds from other molders that make us cringe it’s not their fault they just don’t specialize in injection molding precision optics where the traditional practices and customs just won’t work what most commodity injection molders don’t realize is that optics have a prescription and you can’t just cut the mold inserts to a d solid model and expect the resulting optics to deliver optimal performance optics molding requires the highest degree of precision our incoming transfer mold process includes a complete evaluation of your mold in its current state – the way we receive it we’ll document the condition of your mold along with some digital pictures to show you our findings and tell you if your mold has the capability to mold your optics to your print specifications we’ll make recommendations for improvements to your mold to make it production ready and perform those modifications on site in our mold repair and maintenance department being a precision polymer optics molder takes more than injection molding knowhow it takes a complete understanding of optics and how those optics function in your system from laser collimation to imaging to illumination we know optics – upside down and backwards so bring us your problem molds and let diverse optics show you how we can make your problems become successes preventive maintenance the cornerstone of our business is preventive maintenance on our customer’s molds it’s actually quite self serving because well maintained molds make our job easier a well maintained mold operates trouble free and will produce millions of polymer optics conversely a neglected mold causes us nothing but trouble by adding inconsistency and introducing variation diverse optics’ primary focus is running your molds at their optimum performance capability and maximizing mold longevity through complete mold maintenance onsite repair  maintenance cnc and conventional milling machines surface grinders edm conventional lathe  machine tools realtime adjustments are made inhouse during mold trials based on molding technician feedback to ensure rapid start up and adherence to delivery schedules we perform routine preventive maintenance for customer furnished molds as a part of our “evergreen” service to make sure your molds remain perennially fresh the evergreen service includes routine maintenance under normal circumstances and manufacturing conditions repair of any accidental damage and complete major and minor maintenance according to established plastics industry standards at prescribed intervals we perform our standard evergreen policy on your molds performing all required maintenance while the mold remains in our possession during the guaranteed cycle period risk prevention risk prevention is a critical element in all our polymer optics programs that’s why we start with a topnotch preventive mold maintenance program to ensure your molds remain fully functional and production ready but even with the best preventive maintenance sometimes the unthinkable happens and an unforeseeable failure occurs it’s just a part of manufacturing risk tolerance varies greatly by customer industry and budget when it comes to polymer optics manufacturing an ounce of prevention is certainly worth a pound of cure at diverse optics we’ll provide a comprehensive risk assessment and present multiple options that meet your level of risk tolerance and available budget these options might include taking an inventory position to ensure supply diamond turning optics in place of injection molding stocking spares of only the most critical optical mold components pins or building a complete duplicate backup mold whatever your situation we’ll work with you to make sure you can sleep at night home gallery injection molding diamond turning thinfilm coating

laboratory manager total annual compensation k compensation as of fiscal year  precision optics corporation inc key developments omnivision technologies inc and precision optics corp collaborate to integrate ultrasmall image sensors and customized optics for endoscopes jun   omnivision technologies inc together with precision optics corp announced a collaboration to develop a miniaturized highquality optical solution based on omnivisions ov image sensor technology integrated with three precision optics microprecision lenses this camera solution enables the design and manufacture of very small diameter endoscopes which can be used for medical procedures previously performed blind or with suboptimal visualization technologies such as fiber optics minimally invasive surgical procedures are a growing trend globally frequently these include complicated procedures with limited access that call for smaller instruments with improved visualization for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures often these procedures require devices that will work through very small incisions even down to mm or smaller this is particularly true in the disciplines of ophthalmology cardiology and neurology for example precision optics corporation has developed its microprecision lens technology to address the challenges associated with the design and fabrication of very small lenses optics and optical systems as the size of lenses and other optical elements gets smaller than a couple millimeters traditional procedures tooling and fixturing for fabricating glass and polymer lenses become impractical similarly better alternatives to traditional approaches to the design and manufacture of optical systems and the associated mechanics need to be explored the microprecision lens technology is based on a new paradigm developed for the design fabrication and assembly of very small optical elements and systems while maintaining high image quality and low cost this technology has enabled the manufacture of some of the smallest individual optical components and endoscopes in the world –  mm and  mm respectively precision optics corporation inc announces unaudited consolidated earnings

low cost high performance proprietary technology commenting on the results company ceo joseph forkey said in spite of the recent progress precision optics has made with margins cost containment and increasing product and engineering service activities we experienced a  decline in revenues during the three months ended december   compared to the previous year the decline occurred in both the engineering service and production categories with the exception of one product that we no longer manufacture the declines resulted principally from timing delays related to engineering project development and release to production schedules and from the cyclical purchasing patterns of some traditional products by our customers we continue to see robust activity in existing and prospective customer demand for our unique design engineering and production capabilities and believe this quarters revenue decline will be temporary dr forkey continued we are pleased with the margin improvements even at this lower level of revenue which represents our improving operational performance in engineering and production services relating to our core technologies margins increased to  and  during the three and six months ended december   principally as a result of efficient production of three traditional products comprising  of production revenue during the six months and from

optics processing expertise  when your design defies conventional injection molding design rules look no further than the processing engineers at diverse optics to find the solution  sure we use the fundamentals like taguchi design of experiment doe window processing and decoupled scientific molding but we also layer in over  years of our own secret sauce to guarantee your molded optics – thousands of them – are functional works of art if you’ re looking for high volume series production integration of optical and mechanical functionality consistent parttopart repeatability high precision to cost ratio rapid production of precision polymer optics then injection molding is the right choice  compared to other optics manufacturing processes injection molding offers the greatest

optics molding is different than typical injection molding – alot different the same can be said about optics tooling – it’s quite a bit different than traditional commodity injection tooling when you’re working with optical prescription irregularity tolerances in millionths of an inch and your customers expect total perfection shot after shot then your injection molds have to be precise new molds at diverse optics we don’t cut corners on injection molds our new mold procurement process ensures that your tooling is designed and built for years of worryfree series production up to a million molded optics – guaranteed we start by listening to our customer to fully understand the unique requirements of their program we gather our team of experts for a comprehensive program review and provide feedback that often times includes suggestions to improve performance and reduce cost our engineers determine the right mold design concept for your optics based on over  years of experience building hundreds of optics molds we know what works – and more importantly what doesn’t after you are fully satisfied and all requirements questions and concerns have been addressed we move on to tooling fabrication strategic alliances with an extensive support base of experienced domestic and offshore mold makers ensure our customer’s objectives for quality delivery and value are met our engineers match strategic mold making partners to your requirements conduct mold design reviews perform mold flows as necessary provide detailed delivery information and ensure all your specifications are achieved our process includes a complete set of d and d tool designs that are reviewed and “redlined” until we are satisfied upon request designs are shared with our customer for their approval prior to tool build to maintain tight schedules we focus on early delivery of optical pins and inserts only a few weeks into the tool build this enables us to work on optical surfaces concurrently with the rest of the build the mold base and optical components are delivered simultaneously for final assembly inspection and the beginning of mold trials society of plastics industry spi tooling classifications class  mold – guaranteed for  cycles or more built for extremely high production made with only the highest quality materials class  mold – guaranteed for  cycles medium to

production mold used only for limited production preferably with nonabrasive materials moderate price range class  – guaranteed for  –  cycles light production  prototype mold used only for limited production preferably with nonabrasive materials low price range acceptance of customer transferred tooling diverse optics welcomes the opportunity for customers to transfer their molds to us from other suppliers – what we call transfer tooling as forrest gump liked to say transfer molds are indeed “like a box of chocolates you never know what you’re going to get” over the years we have inherited many molds from other molders that make us cringe it’s not their fault they just don’t specialize in injection molding precision optics where the traditional practices and customs just won’t work what most commodity injection molders don’t realize is that optics have a prescription and you can’t just cut the mold inserts to a d solid model and expect the resulting optics to deliver optimal performance optics molding requires the highest degree of precision our incoming transfer mold process includes a complete evaluation of your mold in its current state – the way we receive it we’ll document the condition of your mold along with some digital pictures to show you our findings and tell you if your mold has the capability to mold your optics to your print specifications we’ll make recommendations for improvements to your mold to make it production ready and perform those modifications on site in our mold repair and maintenance department being a precision polymer optics molder takes more than injection molding knowhow it takes a complete understanding of optics and how those optics function in your system from laser collimation to imaging to illumination we know optics – upside down and backwards so bring us your problem molds and let diverse optics show you how we can make your problems become successes preventive maintenance the cornerstone of our business is preventive maintenance on our customer’s molds it’s actually quite self serving because well maintained molds make our job easier a well maintained mold operates trouble free and will produce millions of polymer optics conversely a neglected mold causes us nothing but trouble by adding inconsistency and introducing variation diverse optics’ primary focus is running your molds at their optimum performance capability and maximizing mold longevity through complete mold maintenance onsite repair  maintenance cnc and conventional milling machines surface grinders edm conventional lathe  machine tools realtime adjustments are made inhouse during mold trials based on molding technician feedback to ensure rapid start up and adherence to delivery schedules we perform routine preventive maintenance for customer furnished molds as a part of our “evergreen” service to make sure your molds remain perennially fresh the evergreen service includes routine maintenance under normal circumstances and manufacturing conditions repair of any accidental damage and complete major and minor maintenance according to established plastics industry standards at prescribed intervals we perform our standard evergreen policy on your molds performing all required maintenance while the mold remains in our possession during the guaranteed cycle period risk prevention risk prevention is a critical element in all our polymer optics programs that’s why we start with a topnotch preventive mold maintenance program to ensure your molds remain fully functional and production ready but even with the best preventive maintenance sometimes the unthinkable happens and an unforeseeable failure occurs it’s just a part of manufacturing risk tolerance varies greatly by customer industry and budget when it comes to polymer optics manufacturing an ounce of prevention is certainly worth a pound of cure at diverse optics we’ll provide a comprehensive risk assessment and present multiple options that meet your level of risk tolerance and available budget these options might include taking an inventory position to ensure supply diamond turning optics in place of injection molding stocking spares of only the most critical optical mold components pins or building a complete duplicate backup mold whatever your situation we’ll work with you to make sure you can sleep at night home
