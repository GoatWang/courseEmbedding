november     jeffrey wlodarczak analyst pivotal research group llc      i wanted to focus on f greg i was hoping you could comment on the potential for you all to create an f ott product at least to me it seems like something that could generate very attractive potential upside is that something you could roll out fairly quickly in the context of your f broadcast current rights and then ive got a followup   gregory b maffei president chief executive officer  director liberty media corp   thanks jeff i think were also very excited about the idea to try and utilize the massive amounts of video feed and data that we have in a premiumtype product and given the global nature and extremely dedicated fan base we have it would seem like an ott product is something that makes a lot of sense for them and us   we do have some things to work through on rights i dont think theyre impenetrable but therere things to be worked through and we also just need to do  work out relationships with the teams and how we handle it all so theres not only some work on the product side but there is some licensing work but i dont think its insurmountable how exactly the form of any product may take or what we may do im not yet sure were still at early days but i agree theres a lot of potential   jeffrey wlodarczak   thanks and then more broadly at this point is it reasonable to assume at f that perhaps you may have to take a step back financially before two steps forward as youre investing or can you accelerate financial growth while youre investing   gregory b maffei   i think were still trying to get a handle on that exactly i dont anticipate massive reduction in operating performance there are some positives coming in including incremental broadcast revenue in some cases but i do think well be making some investments but part of its in management part of its in areas like the ott product that you just mentioned i dont think those are going to be massively dilutive but i do think we will be making investments        bryan kraft analyst deutsche bank securities inc      when would    formula  become an atb   gregory b maffei      formula  is a long way away   barton crockett analyst fbr capital markets  co      first on the arrangements with thirdparties for the formula  investment could you just give me the rationale for that is this mainly a way to help the owners of formula  get cash quicker without having to be subject to a lock up or is there some idea that by using these thirdparties that you might get people who would be longer term investors potentially than the core holders of formula      gregory b maffei      one is yeah the cvc group the legacy owners have been in for a long time we did give them some cash and they made the bet that the continued ownership stake that they hold would grow under the management of chase and liberty theyve gotten some of that bounce already but i think they see more upside theyre talking about potentially selling something like a third of what they have left which will leave them still with about half of what they had when we started being involved well see how those exact numbers shake out   importantly one of the groups thats being discussed as an investor to take some of their stake instead of the minority of their stake is the teams themselves and we would consider that quite a positive in terms of anchoring our relationship and aligning our interest with the teams i also think everybody is interested in getting longterm shareholders who are potentially additive to the business but certainly expect to be in for the long positive ride that we are anticipating so i think cvc and we are aligned on that        benjamin daniel swinburne analyst morgan stanley  co llc      i wanted to come back to formula  maybe for mark at this point with the margin loan i think closing next couple of days is the financing all in place to close the second piece of the transaction and any thoughts on permanent financing for the margin loan piece i assume thats something youre going to keep sort of in perpetuity   mark d carleton chief financial officer liberty media corp   yeah i think the financing is all in place right now we obviously as we do with all of our companies look at financing alternatives and different ways to be more efficient at our financing and more efficient and focused with our leverage but everything is in place now to do what we need to do and well keep our eye on the markets and whats happening and when the time comes certainly when we get to closing this transaction well be able to have a lot more direct involvement in that financing and what we do with it but were paying attention   benjamin daniel swinburne   and then on just on tax the tax position at formula  as it gets folded into liberty very free cash flow generative business i noted there are some tax assets  well not tax assets but some tax losses in your proxy filing what do you expect if any leakage in terms of upstreaming cash flow out of formula  to the parent over time should we be assuming thats sort of tax free are we looking at a uk tax rate any helpful thoughts would be helpful   albert e rosenthaler chief corporate development officer liberty media corp      with respect to formula  we retain their tax nols and position with respect to taxability in the uk as we noted earlier there are some changes anticipated in the uk tax rates and with respect to the utilization of losses and interest deductions so that will have a modest increase in the uk taxes we were able to set up the acquisition structure such that we do not believe there is any incremental tax on the repatriation of earnings back to the us though        that should have been able to replicate their structure   benjamin daniel swinburne      and then lastly just the fia can you just maybe spend a minute on the relationship between the fia and formula  and whether you  im assuming you do but just any color on the approval of the fia for this transaction i think the deal closing is subject to their approval   gregory b maffei   youre correct it is subject to their approval chase carey and i have met with the fia in particular jean todt the head of the fia several times and had good conversations with him were proceeding forward with the necessary processes they have for change of control and i have every reason to believe well have a favorable outcome          thomas w eagan analyst telsey advisory group llc   and then separately on liberty media with the investment in f what does that mean regarding the live nation investment is that still fit in the current vehicle and are there operational synergies between f and live nation   gregory b maffei   i think there are  ill handle the second part first i think there are places where live nation can be helpful to formula  there are some involvements already for example live nation has helped organize concerts around some of the racing events live nation has helped with some of the general venue and set up and event processes and event ticketing and the like for example in singapore and there are places i think that they can be positive for each other but particularly where live nation can help formula  f and live nation are not in the same business i think that stake is important but obviously the stake in live nation is smaller than the stake in f well see where the  or what the eventual size of our f business will be well see where the right place for that is        jason boisvert bazinet analyst citigroup global markets inc      when you announced the formula  transaction i dont remember you guys ever sort of explicitly citing the value of tax assets we just got that the tax rate would be low and you could repatriate it back to the us i remember that but is there an explicit value that were missing when we think about the value of this asset   gregory b maffei      there is no explicit tax asset other than i think we have as we said an attractive low tax rate structure and a full basis in our ability to repatriate capital   albert e rosenthaler   there are some losses   gregory b maffei   there are  albert theres some losses      albert e rosenthaler   theres some losses but its not as large as  the overall rate is quite low given the structure that we have   gregory b maffei   theres not a significant tax asset at all        matthew j harrigan analyst wunderlich securities inc      youve got so much going on over at f as well and i know theyre working with qualcomm snapdragon flight and all that on some of these new toys how do you feel about how the rights for new technologies and new modes of viewing and experience get divvied up between the teams and the leagues is that something that  i mean the ownership structure over at f is so complicated    i know its kind of a fuzzy question but theres just so much potential there     gregory b maffei   yeah i dont think we have so much of an issue at f where i think we have much clearer title and much clearer path on rights   forwardlooking statements   the foregoing

common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business
