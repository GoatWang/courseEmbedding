my wife has cancer and she asked me to grow my hair long because she lost hers during chemo she now asked me to get it cut so we went to mitchell christopher and what a great choice that was dean was my stylist and he couldn’t have been any nicer i didn’t get a haircut for over  years and didn’t have a good idea on how to proceed dean made everything so easy i look great everyone in the salon were so friendly we didn’t want to leave my wife while waiting for me also got a haircut not much hair but she looks great and they didn’t charge heri can’t wait for my hair to grow out so i can go back – ben i have never experience such quality as i did at mitchell christopher salon let me tell you that my hair was  different colors  one of those colors were an ugly black dean not only got my hair back to it’s original color but it was all one color  the cut  style were perfect for me i can’t wait to go back again 🙂 – sarah medina i have been to many salons and some are better and friendlier than others however when it was time for me to get a new short hairstyle for the new year i can only trust mariefel at mitchell christopher salon because she truly knows what to do with my very thick
