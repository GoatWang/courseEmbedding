at beckett university leedsi am the youngest in a set of triplets i am having the first of a series of major operations on my feet this summer and i desperately want to work and start up a business which i can run from home and online i am currently making badges by hand i want to be able to be more efficient by buying a machine it will make it faster and cheaper and i will be able to do this whilst recuperatingi love design and making things as well as designing web sites and apps for people i want an opportunity to purchase equipment for a badge making machine key ring puncher plus all the keyrings badges and fridge magnets i intend to sell to local businesses online sales build a web site i can do this myself at no cost and at a later date attend school fairs to offer make your own badgemagnetkey ring stall to children where they draw their own designs on the inserts with their parents supervision and i will make them instantly to take away on the day obviously if i do this i need to include public liability insurance in my funding i have already purchased a number of key rings to test the water and these are proving extremely popular selling more than anticipatedi need the funding to kick start my business by bulk buying supplies and equipment i really hope you will support my venture i have selected a number of rewards for anyone who pledges money i hope that you will enjoy them should you wish to support mei am honest trustworthy and reliable i may only be  years old but i am a charity trustee for yorkshire multiples group a registered charity no  who provide advice information  support to multiple birth families i have actively helped for several years helping raise funds and helping out at events risks and challenges the main challenge i face is keeping up with the production of orders should i be inundated i have the support of my siblings and family who will help out my triplet sister is an artist and triplet brother doing a business degree and my parents are both in business so i have experience on hand should i need advice i have already invested time and some of my own money buying products to test the market so far it has been a little overwhelming with great response but the limitations have been money to proceed in turning it from a hobby into business the funding will enable bulk purchases so that will bring down the cost so i am able to provide a competitive price for my products plus with my computer skills i will be able build a web site with an online shop to enable greater sales i also need to use some of the funds for public liability stall fees when i am able to attend when physically fit i would very much like to attend our charity group and offer a session at reduced fees so that the families with more than one child of the same age can take part in a parentchild led activity often multiple birth families are alienated due to costs of two or three times due to having twins triplets or more of the same age so
