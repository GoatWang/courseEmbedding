technologies in order to improve operational effectiveness for army forces through the identification of an immediate warfighter need and the rapid equipping of the warfighter with safe products in the most expeditious way possible rfp statement of work sow ¶  the work of the ref is supported in large part by contractor staff under what is known as the alternative staffing contract rfp at  in march  the army began planning a procurement for the recompete of the alternative staffing contract which was being performed by caciwgi inc the procurement was conducted by the army contracting office at the aberdeen proving ground the co worked at aberdeen and was not based at the ref location the rfp was issued on december  and was subsequently amended eight times as relevant here the rfp stated that the contractor shall provide all labor management and support necessary for supporting the ref in the successful accomplishment of its mission sow ¶  the solicitation advised offerors that award would be based on the lowestprice technicallyacceptable proposal considering the nonprice factors of technical capabilities and past performance rfp at  the army received seven proposals by the closing date of april   including proposals from vse caci and general dynamics information technology gdit the army source selection authority ssa concluded that vse submitted the lowestpriced technically acceptable proposal of  million and selected vses proposal for award on may  actions of the ref deputy project manager this protest primarily concerns the actions of a former government employee who served as the ref deputy project manager dpm from the time the army began its planning for the procurement until his departure from government service co statement at  hearing transcript tr at  the dpms primary area of responsibility was the acquisitions branch activity for the ref which he describes as the external operations of the ref such as getting equipment into theater agency report ar tab x decl of former dpm july   ¶  in march  the dpm attended a meeting with the co the source selection authority ssa and the ref contracting team lead co statement at  this meeting was for the purpose of discussing the acquisition plan sow and evaluation criteria to be used in the rfp id at  the dpm attended three additional meetings at the ref concerning the solicitation from march to may  tr at  in late september or early october the dpm was asked to review revisions to portions of the sow which pertained to his work responsibilities ar tab y ref responses ¶  in a declaration and in his hearing testimony the dpm stated that he did not review these materials in detail ar tab x decl of former dpmaug   ¶¶  tr at    in early december  the dpm advised the army of his plans to resign tr at  the dpm left his work at the army on december  and was on terminal leave use of his annual leave until his formal end of employment from december   until january   ar tab x decl of former dpm july   ¶  in early january  the dpm requested an opinion from an army ethics counselor concerning his prospective employment as a consultant for a number of contractors who work for the ref including vse ar tab w ethics counselor letter jan   at  see tr at  at about the same time the dpm received an inquiry from vse concerning employment ar tab w ethics counselor letter jan   at  on january   the ethics counselor provided the dpm an opinion which stated that you have advised me that you intend to seek behind the scenes employment as a consultant with several contractors to include vse    id the counselor noted that the dpm had taken action on numerous contracts within the last year and thus had participated personally and substantially in a particular matter in which the companies working on these contracts have a financial interest id the counselor also noted that it is my understanding that you are not currently engaged in any procurement activity but rather work only on existing contracts idat  as discussed in detail below the ethics counselor advised the dpm of the postemployment restrictions that applied to him as a result of his work for the ref but advised that he was not prohibited from providing behindthescenes assistance to contractors id at  the dpm completed his terminal leave and ended his employment with the army on january  at that time the agency completed an outprocessing form which indicated that the former dpm returned all of his governmentissued equipment including his laptop computer ar tab w former dpm outprocessing form on february  the nowformer dpm entered into a consulting agreement with vse ar tab w vse consulting agreement the agreement ran from february  to march  the dpm states that his work for vse actually concluded on february  tr at  as discussed in detail below the former dpm states that his work for vse involved reviewing sections of vses proposal for the alternate staffing contract prior to its submission ar tab x decl of former dpm july   ¶  on april  the former dpm returned to the armys ref to work as a consultant via a subcontract under a contract awarded by the office of the secretary of defense tr at  email from vse to gao nov   email from agency to gao nov   on april  the former dpm signed a nondisclosure agreement with the ref concerning his new consulting work ar tab s former dpm nondisclosure agreement agencylevel protest and co investigation following the award to vse caci filed an agencylevel protest in its protest caci argued that vse gained an improper competitive advantage from its use of a former senior government employee from the very same program which is covered under the solicitation that is the former dpm ar tab n caci protest at  in response to cacis protest the co conducted an investigation regarding the activities of the former dpm in connection with the alternative staffing procurement and his work for vse the co submitted questions and received responses from caci individual contractor personnel the refs deputy director and the former dpm as relevant here the former dpm provided an initial response to the cos questions on july  and a supplemental declaration on july  ar tab w former dpm responses to co investigation july   tab x decl of former dpm july   based on her investigation the co identified the following  findings of fact  the ref states and the former dpm confirms he actively participated in the development of the initial ref staffing requirement procurement strategy initial ref acquisition strategy the initial development of the sow and participated in acquisition strategy discussions  the ref states that the former dpm in his role as ref deputy project manager reviewed the revised sow acquisition branch position descriptions sometime in late september and early october   the ref states that the former dpm provided input to the ref award fee board for the ref acquisition and contracting branches under the incumbent ref staffing support contract which is held by the protester caci  the ref states that the former dpm had full access to his government email accounts and electronic files until january  or february    the ref states that the former dpm completed outprocessing from the ref on january   and turned in his government laptop on february    the former dpm signed a consulting agreement with vse on february   that was effective from february  to march   set to end just five days after the initial due date for proposal submission of march    the former dpm confirms that he reviewed the proposal submission for vse prior to the response due date  the former dpm admits that he told several individuals that he advised one or two competing companies regarding their proposal submissions  the former dpm admits that he  attended a vse proposal presentation meeting and was introduced as a former ref deputy program manager two weeks after the former dpm was outprocessed by the ref and only ten days prior to the proposal submission due date for the alternate staffing requirement  the former dpms nondisclosure agreement with the ref was signed on april   nearly three months after his outprocessing from the ref and nearly two months after the extended due date for submission of proposals ar tab p termination rationale at  based on these findings the co concluded that the former dpms actions and his work on behalf of vse created an appearance of impropriety as follows based on the above findings and in accordance with the definition of participating personally and substantially in a federal agency procurement located at federal acquisition regulation far §  it is my determination that the former dpm participated personally and substantially as a government officer in the preparation of the ref alternate staffing solicitation it is also my determination that the former dpms abovereferenced activities regarding the ref alternate staffing solicitation and his employment as a consultant with vse created the appearance of a conflict of interest i further determine that the former dpms activities and his employment by vse as a consultant created at least the appearance of impropriety regarding the ref alternate staffing procurement and the contract award to vse id at  in her response to the protest and in her hearing testimony the co elaborated that her conclusion regarding an appearance of impropriety was based on the collective effect of the  facts cited in her termination rationale tr at   the co also explained that although she was not able to conclusively establish certain facts she was required under far §  to avoid even the appearance of any improprieties i was not able to conclusively establish that the former dpm had access to competitively useful source selection information that he provided to vse during the period of his consultation with vse however i also was not able to conclusively rule out that possibility also i was not able to conclusively establish that the former dpm had violated any procurement rules or regulations related to his activities after his resignation as ref deputy pmhence my decision ultimately not to request an investigation by the armys criminal investigation command co statement at  in her testimony the co acknowledged that the former dpm was advised by the ethics counselor that he was not prohibited under the postemployment restrictions applicable to government employees under  usc §  from providing behindthescenes activities on behalf of a contractor tr at  see also co statement at  the co stated that she nonetheless believed that the former dpms actions on behalf of vse were in violation of that statute tr at  based on her conclusions the co terminated vses award on august   the co then awarded the contract to gdit the offeror who was next in line for award co statement at  following the notice of termination vse filed this protest with our office discussion vse challenges the cos conclusion that its hiring of the former dpm as a consultant merited termination of the contract specifically vse challenges the cos finding that the former dpms actions on behalf of vse gave the protester an unfair competitive advantage vse argues that the cos termination decision was unreasonable because it improperly relied on assumptions rather than hard facts and was also based on an incorrect understanding of the applicable legal standards for the reasons discussed below we agree one of the guiding principles recognized by our office is the obligation of contracting agencies to avoid even the appearance of impropriety in government procurements see far §  celeris sys inc b mar    cpd ¶  at  guardian techs intl b et al feb    cpd ¶  at  where a firm may have gained an unfair advantage through its hiring of a former government official the firm can be disqualified from a competition based upon the appearance of impropriety which is created by this situationeven if no actual impropriety can be shownso long as the determination of an unfair competitive advantage is based on hard facts and not on mere innuendo or suspicion health net fed servs llc b b nov    cpd ¶  at  see nkf engg inc v us  fd  fed cir  the existence of an appearance of impropriety based on an alleged unfair competitive advantage depends on the circumstances in each case as a general matter in determining whether an offeror obtained an unfair competitive advantage in hiring a former government official based on the individuals knowledge of nonpublic information our office has considered a variety of factors including whether the individual had access to nonpublic information that was not otherwise available to the protester or nonpublic proprietary information of the protester and whether the nonpublic information was competitively useful see textron marine sys b aug    cpd ¶  at  itt fed servs corp bmay    cpd ¶  at  holmes and narver servs incmorrisonknudson servs inc et al b b oct    cpd ¶  at  an unfair competitive advantage is presumed to arise where an offeror possesses competitively useful nonpublic information that would assist that offeror in obtaining the contract without the need for an inquiry as to whether that information was actually utilized by the awardee in the preparation of its proposal health net fed servs llc supra  cpd ¶  at  n aetna govt health plans inc foundation health fed servs inc b et al july    cpd ¶ at  n in reviewing bid protests that challenge an agencys conflict of interest determinations the court of appeals for the federal circuit has mandated application of the arbitrary and capricious standard established pursuant to the administrative procedures act see axiom res mgmt inc v united states  fd   fed cir  thus to challenge an agencys identification of a disqualifying conflict of interest a protester must demonstrate that the agencys determination did not rely on hard facts but was instead based on mere inference or suspicion of an actual or potential conflict or is otherwise unreasonable see turner constr co inc v united states  fd   fed cir  pai corp v united states  fd   fed cir  in axiom the court of appeals noted that the far recognizes that the identification of conflicts of interest    are factspecific inquiries that require the exercise of considerable discretion axiom res mgmt inc  fd at  the standard of review employed by this office in reviewing a contracting officers conflict of interest determinationincluding findings concerning actual or apparent improprieties arising from such conflicts under far part mirrors the standard required by axiom and turner in this regard we review the reasonableness of the contracting officers investigation and where an agency has given meaningful consideration to whether a conflict of interest exists will not substitute our judgment for the agencys absent clear evidence that the agencys conclusion is unreasonable see telecommunication sys inc b oct    cpd ¶  at  pccp constructors jv bechtel infrastructure corpb et al aug    cpd ¶  at  based on the legal standards discussed above we conclude that the co had the authority under far §  to terminate vses contract if she reasonably found that there was an actual or apparent impropriety arising from vses hiring of the former dpm the authorities also make clear that the co was not required to conclude that vse actually gained a competitive advantage and instead could have concluded that there was an appearance of an impropriety based on the possibility that the dpm could have conferred a competitive advantage to the firm to support the latter finding however the co needed to identify hard factsas opposed to suspicion or innuendothat showed that vse may have gained an unfair competitive advantage through its hiring of the former dpm see turner constr co inc  fd at  former dpms actions concerning the rfp we first address the cos findings of fact concerning the former dpms actions during his time as a government employee finding nos  and  as discussed above the co found that the former dpm actively participated in the development of the initial ref staffing requirement procurement strategy the initial ref acquisition strategy the initial development of the sow and participated in acquisition strategy discussions ar tab p termination rationale at  the co also found that the former dpm reviewed the revised sow acquisition branch position descriptions in late september or early october  id the co explains that her findings of fact were based on information provided by the ref to the cos investigation following the caci protest and the cos attendance of a meeting in march  meeting with the former dpm co statement at  the cos findings pertain to two periods of time  march through may  and  late september to early october  the former dpms actions from march through may  the cos understanding of the former dpms role in the procurement from the start of the procurement planning process in march  through may  was based on her attendance at a meeting with the former dpm and information provided by the ref in response to the cos postaward investigation specifically the co states that in march  she attended a meeting with the former dpm the ref contracting team lead and the ssa the purpose of the meeting was to help develop the statement of work the acquisition strategy plan as well as the evaluation criteria tr at  after this meeting the co did not meet again with the former dpm instead her primary contact was the ref contracting team lead tr at   the refs responses to the cos investigation advised generally that the former dpm participated in developing the initial procurement strategy for the contract action developed portions of the sow and reviewed the sow as deputy project manager ar tab y ref responses ¶  the ref also explained that the former dpm initially prepared the acquisition branch portion of the sow during late spring  ar tab y ref responses ¶  the acquisition branch requirements were in section  of the sow apart from the march  meeting and the refs responses to her questions the co states that her understanding of the former dpms role in the procurement was based on her assumption that the ref contracting team lead reported to the former dpm in this regard the co states that the ref contracting team lead was her counterpart for the ref and the person with whom she interacted on a daily basis during the development of the rfp tr at  the co stated that she understood that the ref contracting team lead reported to the former dpm and based on this understanding assumed that the former dpm had overall responsibility for the rfp tr at    based on her assumption that the former dpm had overall responsibility for the rfp she also assumed that the former dpm had access to nonpublic procurement sensitive information tr at  co in this particular procurement he was overseeing at least the initial beginnings of the procurement vse and the former dpm raise several challenges to the cos assumptions with regard to the initial acquisition strategy and development of the sow the former dpm states that his involvement with the solicitation was minimal limited to the very early phases of the refs development of the solicitation and was generally not reflected in the solicitation ar tab x decl of former dpm july   ¶  for example he initially recommended that the rfp be awarded on a best value rather than a lowcost technically acceptable basis id the solicitation was ultimately issued on a lowcost technically acceptable basis the former dpm also states that he recommended that the staffing for the acquisition branch activity portion of the sow be organized into execution teams to address specific agency needs id this recommendation was not adopted additionally the former dpm states that he edited a draft of what became sow ¶  to reflect his proposal for the execution teams and may have provided some edits to other parts of sow ¶  tr at  the co acknowledged that the former dpm made these recommendations during the march  meeting tr at  the co also agreed however that the final version of the rfp does not reflect the former dpms substantive suggestions tr at   with regard to the former dpms suggestion that the award be on a bestvalue basis or use a different approach to the organization of personnel the army has not provided any basis to conclude that the former dpms suggestion of alternate approaches constituted nonpublic information that provided a competitive advantage with regard to the cos assumption that the former dpm supervised the ref contracting team lead the former dpm testified that the ref contracting team lead did not in fact report to him and was instead in a separate line of command tr at  vse posthearing exhibit at  in her testimony the co acknowledged that she did not know for certain whether the ref contracting team lead reported to the former dpm and that she simply assumed that he reported to the former dpm tr at  as noted above the cos assumption that the former dpm had access to nonpublic procurement sensitive information was based in part on her assumption that he supervised the ref contracting lead and therefore had overall responsibility for the rfp the army has not rebutted the dpms testimony in fact the army has not provided any information that demonstrates that the ref contracting team lead reported to the former dpm or that the former dpm had supervisory responsibility for the contracting team leads work on the rfp or for the rfp as a whole moreover while the co testified that she believed that the former dpms actions conferred a competitive advantage on vse tr at  she acknowledged in her response to the protest that i was not able to conclusively establish that the former dpm had access to competitively useful source selection information that he provided to vse during the period of his consultation with vse co statement at  specifically with respect to the former dpms activities prior to may  the co conceded that she could not identify specific nonpublic competitively useful information to which he may have had access tr at     in sum there is nothing in the record to date that shows that the former dpm had access to competitively useful nonpublic information from march through may  the former dpms actions from late septemberearly october  with regard to the former dpms activities after may  the co states that she was not involved with his work and did not have personal knowledge of his actions tr at  instead she relied on the ref responses which indicated that the former dpm reviewed the revised sow position acquisition branch descriptions sometime in late sep and early oct  ar tab y ref responses ¶  the former dpm acknowledged that he was asked in late septemberearly october  to review the draft sow concerning the positions that involved the ref acquisition branch ar tab x declaration of former dpm aug   ¶  during the hearing he testified that he does not recall whether he was provided the entire sow or just section  which pertained to his area of responsibilitytr at  the former dpm stated that he began to review the sow positions but found significant errors that did not make sense but appeared to be copy and paste mistakes ar tab x declaration of former dpm aug   ¶  he states that he then ceased his review and brought the errors to the attention of the ref deputy director who asked the former dpm to address the matter id the former dpm states that he refused to do so and did not work on the sow after that time id based on the ref response the co found that the former dpms review of the sow in late septemberearly october created an appearance of impropriety ar tab p termination rationale at  in her testimony however the co acknowledged that she does not know what the former dpm did with regard to the revised sow tr at   specifically the co does not know whether he reviewed the sow for content made revisions or made other comments id she stated however that she believes that the word review as used in the refs response to her investigation was meant to indicate that he did substantive work rather than a check for typographical errors tr at  in this regard the co stated that she assumed that the former dpm had overall responsibility for the rfp and that he would review the statement of work prior to release to make sure that it  captured everything that the ref wanted tr at  more significantly the co acknowledges that the draft sow was released for public review in early september  immediately prior to the former dpms review tr at     in this regard the co testified as follows gao so just to be clear    is it your understanding that whatever the former dpm reviewed in late september or early october  was subsequently made public co eventually yes gao so was there anything that he reviewed that would give someone a competitive advantage based upon the fact that he had seen it but no one else had co my argument there is that he had knowledge of  no tr at  the co also testified that the former dpms access to information throughout the development of the rfp could have provided a competitive advantage based on the timing of his access in this regard the co explained that even if all of the information reviewed by the former dpm was subsequently disclosed his access to that information before the rfp was released could have provided offerors with a competitive advantage tr at  as discussed above however the former dpms consulting agreement with vse was signed on february   well after the december   release date for the rfp the co does not explain how this sequence of events could have allowed the former dpm to give vse an unfair competitive advantage based on his access to information before it became public on this record we think that the cos findings of fact nos  and  do not establish that the former dpm had access to competitively useful nonpublic information and do not support the cos conclusion that his role in advising vse gave rise to a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety as our office has recognized a government employees participation in the drafting of an sow or performance work statement does not necessarily demonstrate that the employees postgovernment work for an offeror created a conflict of interest where the employees work was later released to the public as part of the solicitation see itt fed servs corpb may    cpd ¶  at  here the army has not explained how the former dpms contributions to or review of documents that were available to the public through the issuance of the rfpand in some cases in draft form before his input or reviewconstitute hard facts that he had access to competitively useful nonpublic information former dpms participation in the caci award fee board next the co found that the former dpm provided input to the ref award fee board in connection with the incumbent contract performed by caci finding no  ar tab p termination rationale at  the cos finding was based on the following statement provided by the ref in response to her investigation ref leadership has no knowledge of whether the former dpm had access to cacis staffing pricing or other nonpublic information under the current ref staffing support contract the former dpm provided input to the ref award fee board for the ref acquisition and contracting branches ar tab y ref responses ¶  in a declaration submitted with vses protest the former dpm states that his work with the ref involved oversight of the acquisitions branch which included four caci employees assigned to the branch ar tab x decl of former dpm aug   ¶  the former dpm states that his work for the award fee board required him to provide input concerning the quality of cacis performance on a point scale under four categories id see also tr at  specifically he explained his role as follows i provided those assessments which i understood would be combined with the input of other civilians overseeing the member contractor workforce to determine the contractors fee award while i participated in approximately four round table discussions during the  years serving as the dpm with the other section leaders i was not privy to the deputy directors final rollup of the agencys assessment of caci performance or fee award i also did not have access to any caci cost or price related information as part of the fee award input process or for any other reason ar tab x decl of former dpm aug   ¶  the former dpm also states that he did not know the amount of cacis award fee tr at  in her testimony the co stated that she concluded that the former dpms participation in the award fee board gave him access to proprietary information concerning cacis incumbent contract that would have been competitively useful for the followon competition tr at  the co stated in her direct testimony that she understood that the former dpm was aware of what their award fee and the percentage based on the total contract value was    and could do simple math and determine what their pricing was tr at  the co also explained that she signed the award fee and was provided documentation concerning the award fee boards work tr at  the co also acknowledged however that she did not participate in the award fee board review process and did not know what the former dpm and the other award fee board members were provided to review tr at  the co stated that she assumed that the former dpm had access to information concerning cacis award fee based on the document she reviewed as well as her belief that the former dpm had input into those documents tr at    she conceded however that she was not certain whether the former dpm had actually reviewed the same documents that she was provided tr at  additionally the co acknowledges that she assumed that cacis award fee was nonpublic information but was not certain tr at  on this record we think that the cos finding here relied on her assumptions rather than hard facts to the extent that the co believed that hard facts existed concerning the information that the former dpm may have accessed through his work on the caci award fee board the agency has not provided evidence to support the cos belief former dpms access to computer files and equipment next we address the cos finding that the former dpm had access to computer files that may have contained procurement sensitive information and that he continued to have access to this information during his terminal leave through his laptop computer finding nos  and  with regard to the former dpms laptop and computer access files the co was advised by the ref as follows the former dpm had full access to his government email accounts and electronic files up until  feb  the former dpm turned in his laptop computer on  feb  after  feb  ref leadership has no knowledge of whether or not the former dpm had access to contract or solicitation information      the former dpm completed outprocessing procedures with the ref on  jan  and turned in his laptop computer on  feb  ar tab y ref responses ¶¶  during her investigation the co was provided the former dpms outprocessing form which indicated that he completed his outprocessing from government employment on january   ar tab w former dpm outprocessing form at  the form states that the former dpm returned his computer and all other government equipment on january  id as discussed above the former dpm was on terminal leave from december   through his outprocessing date on january   in his response to the cos investigation the former dpm stated that he returned his laptop to the ref onabout  december  but that he retained his common access card cac until january   to complete work on officer evaluation reports oers ar tab w former dpm responses to co investigation ¶  the former dpm also stated in a declaration provided with vses protest that he retained his governmentissued blackberry device during his terminal leave but that it did not give him full access to his email accounts or other electronic files ar tab x decl of former dpm aug   ¶  in another declaration provided with vses comments on the agency report the former dpm stated that he retained his cac during his terminal leave in order to be able to generate an electronic signature required for the oers decl of former dpmsept   ¶  he stated however that he was not able to use his cac because he did not have his governmentissued laptop which was enabled with a cac reader id the former dpm provided emails indicating that he sought assistance from an ref employee to obtain software for his personal computer that would have allowed him to use his cac at home but was unsuccessful in installing the software id ¶  attach former dpms and ref employees emails jan   as a result the former dpm completed his oers at the ref using a colleagues computer around the time he completed his outprocessing id ¶  during the hearing the former dpm affirmed his statement that he returned his laptop prior to going on terminal leave tr at  he conceded however that he has no documentation of this fact tr at  he also acknowledged that at the time he completed outprocessing he did not dispute or seek to clarify the notation on his outprocessing form that shows that he returned his laptop on january   tr at  the co concluded based on the refs responses and the outprocessing form that the former dpm did not return his laptop until he outprocessed on january  ar tab p termination rationale at  the co acknowledged that the former dpm stated in his response to the investigation that he returned his laptop on december   and that he provided additional details to corroborate his account in his declarations in support of vses protest the co stated however that she did not believe the former dpms accounts in making her termination decision and as of the date of the hearing does not believe that his additional information is credible tr at   the co appears to have believed that this was significant because as discussed below she also relied on the refs statement that the former dpms laptop permitted him to access information on the ref network during the time he was on terminal leave see ar tab p termination rationale at  tab y ref responses ¶  we find that the co acted reasonably and within her discretion to conclude that the former dpms laptop was returned in january  rather than december  as stated by the former dpm although the former dpm has provided a declaration and testimony which corroborate his account that he returned his computer in december this evidence was provided after the co made her decision to terminate vses contract in our view the co could reasonably reject the former dpms statement that he returned the laptop in december and instead rely on the evidence provided in his outprocessing form which states that the laptop was returned on january   next based on the refs responses to her questions the co found that the former dpm had full access to his government email accounts and electronic files until january  or february   ar tab p termination rationale at  although the ref response does not specifically explain the basis for its statement it appears that the ref response assumed that the former dpm could have accessed his email and files on the ref network through his laptop see ar tab y ref responses ¶  the co stated that she believed that the former dpm would have had access through the ref computer networks to information pertaining to cacis incumbent contract and the alternative staffing procurement the co also stated that she was aware of two computer systems at the ref where information was stored the refs classified secret internet protocol router network siprnet and a networked drive known as the k drive to which all government and contractor personnel had access tr at   in this regard the co stated that she believed that all government and personnel had access to the k drive for this reason she believed that the ref would have used only the siprnet to store procurement sensitive information tr at   the co also acknowledged that she did not access the siprnet and believed that there were no files to access on the k drive tr at   in her testimony the co states that her understanding of the way in which the ref maintained the alternative staffing procurement files was based on conversations with the ref contracting team lead tr at  she acknowledged however that she did not ask him whether the former dpm had access to those files tr at  the co also acknowledges that she did not investigate whether the former dpm had actually accessed any ref computer files during his terminal leave tr at  the former dpm acknowledged that he had access to both the k drive and the ref siprnet when he had his computer ar tab x decl of former dpm august   ¶  tr at  the former dpm further states that he was not aware of any folders on the k drive that contained procurement sensitive information relating to the alternate staffing procurement tr at  the former dpm stated that he believed that all government and contractor personnel could access the k drive and that it was possible to restrict certain folders with password protection tr at  he contends however that he was not given access to any folders on the k drive pertaining to the alternate staffing procurement tr at  after the hearing the army provided two declarations concerning the storage of information at the ref the first declaration states as follows all soft copy contracting documents regarding the caci incumbent contract and source selection sensitive material applicable to the recompete for this effort is maintained on the shared k drive in a restricted file titled professional staffing contract decl of ref chief of contracts oct   at  the second declaration provided a list of the current and former ref members whose names are or were on the access list that provides them access to the caci recompete materials stored on the refs k drive decl of senior desktop support engineer oct   at  the former dpm was on that list id a third document was provided to the co along with these declarations but was not provided by the army to the protester and intervenor until october  after the parties submitted their posthearing comments this email from the ref deputy director of operations ddo to the co stated that when the ddo was asked to investigate whether the former dpm had access to the restricted files on the k drive he found that neither he nor his supervisor knew the answer email from ref ddo to co oct   the ddo further stated that he found that myself and the ddos supervisor had access to this folder and we didnt know about it and that if this folder was password protected i never received anything or any instruction on how to access it id thus while we find that the co reasonably concluded that the former dpm retained his laptop until he completed his outprocessing this fact alone does not demonstrate that he had access to competitively useful nonpublic information during his time as a government employee at the ref or more specifically the period of december   through january   as cited in the cos termination rationale as discussed above the co assumed that the former dpm had access to the ref computer files concerning cacis incumbent contract and the alternative staffing procurement but did not know for certain what files the former dpm could access or what information could have been retrieved in fact the co was in error in assuming this information would be on the siprnet and not on the k drive although the co is entitled to broad deference in her conclusions the facts here are ambiguous in this regard the posthearing declarations submitted by the army are not specific as to what materials were stored on the k drive and whether there was procurementrelated information on the drive at the time the former dpm had access moreover the co has not commented on the posthearing declarations and thus has not made any findings based on the new information in any event as discussed below we think that in light of the cos statement that her findings of fact collectively informed her decision and in light of the defects in other parts of her determination we cannot conclude that the cos finding regarding the laptop is sufficient standing on its own to justify the termination former dpms postemployment activities with vse finally we address the cos findings with regard to the former dpms postemployment activities the co made five findings of fact concerning the former dpms activities after terminating his government employment he signed a consulting agreement with vse on february   finding no  he reviewed vses proposal submission finding no  he told several individuals that he had advised offerors who submitted proposals for the alternate staffing solicitation finding no  he attended a vse proposal presentation meeting and was introduced as the former ref dpm finding no  and he signed a nondisclosure agreement with the ref on april   months after leaving government employment finding no  as discussed below the co concluded that the former dpms work for vse may have violated the criminal statutes that apply to a former government employees postemployment activities the record shows however that the cos understanding of those restrictions was not consistent with the applicable statutes and regulations the provisions of  usc § a  impose a permanent prohibition against an individual who has terminated his or her employment as an officer or employee of the united states from making any communication intended to influence a united states government employee in connection with a particular matter in which the former officer or employee participated personally and substantially as such officer or employee and which involved a specific party or specific parties at the time of such participation similarly the provisions of  usc § a impose a year prohibition against a former government employee from making a communication intended to influence a united states government employee in connection with a particular matter which the former officer or employee knows or reasonably should know was actually pending under his or her official responsibility as such officer or employee within a period of  year before the termination of his or her service or employment with the united states as discussed above the ethics counsel advised the former dpm that the lifetime and year prohibitions under  usc § a and  applied to him with regard to matters where he participated personally or substantially or that were pending under his official responsibility during the one year period before terminating his government employment ar tab w ethics counselor letter at  despite these prohibitions the ethics counselor advised the former dpm that the prohibitions did not apply to employment as a consultant working behind the scenes and not actually representing his employer to the federal government id at  with regard to the former dpms activities on behalf of vse finding nos   and  the record shows that the co considered his actions to be per se improper in her testimony the co acknowledges that the ethics counselor had advised the former dpm that he was not prohibited from behindthescenes activities on behalf of a contractor tr at  see ar tab w ethics counselor letter at  the co testified however that she did not know what the terms behindthescenes meant with regard to the activities that the former dpm was permitted to undertake on behalf of vse gao what is your understanding of behind the scenes what would that term mean co to be honest i dont have  i dont know its vague what does that mean theres no definition listed even in the ethics opinion as to what behind the scenes is      protesters counsel  i think you were asked this question earlier but i want to make sure that ive got it on the record what in your mind did that allow him to do co i have no idea this statement is very vague tr at   despite her lack of understanding of the meaning of this term the co nonetheless concluded that the former dpms work was not behindthescenes employment and but instead involved prohibited representing back to the agency protesters counsel did anything that the former dpm did constitute representing vse back to the agency thats involved in the procurement here co yes protesters counsel what did he do that you believe constitutes representing back to the agency co he admitted in his responses to my factfinding questions that he reviewed the proposal submission for vse protesters counsel and its your understanding that reviewing the proposal submissions constitutes representing back to the agency co yes tr at  in addition to the cos belief that the former dpms work on the vse proposal constituted representing back to the government the co also concluded that the former dpms participation in an internal vse meeting was improper the cos termination decision cited as a finding of fact a meeting at which the former dpm was introduced to vse employees as the former ref dpm ar tab p termination rationale at  this information was provided to the co by a former vse consultant who saw the former dpm at a vse meeting on february   ar tab z decl of former vse consultant july   ¶  co statement at   the former dpm acknowledges attending this meeting ar tab w former dpm response to co investigation ¶  the co understood that the meeting did not involve government personnel co statement at  tr at  the co nonetheless concluded the former dpms participation gave rise to an appearance of impropriety because they highlighted his very public as opposed to behindthescenes role as a consultant to vse co statement at  in this regard the co provided the following testimony on her view that the former dpms participation constituted more than behindthescenes actions protesters counsel in the co statement you assert the former dpm engaged in a very public as opposed to behindthescenes role as a consultant correct co correct protesters counsel by asserting that he had a very public as opposed to behindthescenes role are you saying that you think he acted in a manner that was inconsistent with the ethics counselors instructions co yes      protesters counsel so your interpretation of behindthescenes means that he cant actually work with other people who are involved in the proposal co right protesters counsel what could he do co behindthescenes i dont know what he could do i dont actually have a definition behindthescenes would mean maybe providing advice to one person helping to write the proposal not going forward into a meeting and stating im here ask me questions tr at   we conclude that the cos findings with regard to the dpms postemployment activities as they related to  usc § a were unreasonable the co determined that the former dpms actions were improper based on his assistance to vse in reviewing its proposal prior to submission and his participation in meetings at vse where his former work for the ref was disclosed while  usc § a prohibits former government employees from representing back to the government it does not contain a general prohibition on providing behindthescenes advice or assistance to offerors as relevant here the regulations promulgated by the office of government ethics oge provide the following guidance with regard to the terms communication or appearance and behindthescenes assistance  communication a former employee makes a communication when he imparts or transmits information of any kind including facts opinions ideas questions or direction to an employee of the united states whether orally in written correspondence by electronic media or by any other means this includes only those communications with respect to which the former employee intends that the information conveyed will be attributed to himself although it is not necessary that any employee of the united states actually recognize the former employee as the source of the information  appearance a former employee makes an appearance when he is physically present before an employee of the united states in either a formal or informal setting although an appearance also may be accompanied by certain communications an appearance need not involve any communication by the former employee  behindthescenes assistance nothing in this section prohibits a former employee from providing assistance to another person provided that the assistance does not involve a communication to or an appearance before an employee of the united states  cfr § d emphasis added the abovequoted oge regulation provides the following relevant example indicating what kinds of behindthescenes activities are permitted for a former government employee a government employee administered a particular contract for agricultural research with q company upon termination of her government employment she is hired by q company she works on the matter covered by the contract but has no direct contact with the government at the request of a company vice president she prepares a paper describing the persons at her former agency who should be contacted and what should be said to them in an effort to increase the scope of funding of the contract and to resolve favorably a dispute over a contract clause she may do so  cfr § d example  as the regulation and this example make clear the bar on representing back to the government does not prohibit a former government employee from providing behindthescenes assistance such as using his or her knowledge to assist an employer with matters concerning the former employees work for the government the co does not explain why the former dpms actions constituted a communication or an appearance as those terms are defined in  cfr § d above in this regard the co does not contend that the former dpms name was associated with the vse proposal or that he was ever physically present before a government official in connection with the proposal in sum while the co believed that the former dpms consulting agreement with vse his assistance to vse in reviewing its proposal and his participation in an internal vse meetings were in violation of the statutory and regulatory prohibitions on representing back to the government she provides no support for this conclusion instead the record shows that the cos conclusion was based on her incorrect understanding of the applicable postemployment statutes and regulations next the co explains that the former dpms statements concerning his assistance of offerors finding no  confirmed for her that he was coaching other companies tr at  as discussed above the co received declarations from two contractor personnel who stated that the former dpm stated that he had coached one or more offerors for the alternative staffing contract co statement at    ar tab z decl of caci employee july   at  tab z decl of caci employee july   at  tab z decl of reger group employee july   at  in response to the cos investigation the former dpm stated that i did share with a few individuals that i advised one or two competing companies ar tab w former dpm responses to co investigation ¶  the co acknowledges that she does not know when the statements were made by the former dpm she added however that it did not matter to her when the statements were made tr at  the co agreed however that she understood that the statements were made to contractor staff and not to government officials tr at  as discussed above we conclude that the cos belief that the former dpms actions in support of vse were per se improper were not consistent with the applicable postemployment statutes and regulations for this reason we do not think that the co reasonably concluded that the former dpms statements to other nongovernment individuals concerning those same activities created the appearance of an impropriety finally the co concluded that the former dpms execution of a nondisclosure agreement with the ref three months after his outprocessing from the ref and nearly two months after the extended due date for submission of proposals was evidence of an appearance of impropriety finding no  ar tab p termination rationale at  the co does not explain however why the former dpms signing of a nondisclosure agreement after completing his employment as a government employee was improper or gave the appearance of impropriety as discussed above the former dpm returned to work at the ref as a consultant on april   and the parties agree that the nondisclosure agreement discussed by the co in her findings was related to his new role as a consultant rather than his prior work as a government employee see email from vse to gao nov   email from agency to gao nov   moreover the co acknowledges that the nondisclosure agreement had nothing to do with any postemployment restriction that applied to the former dpm stemming from his status as a former government employee tr at  on this record we conclude that the cos finding of fact concerning the nondisclosure agreement provides no support for her termination rationale conclusion based on the record here we conclude that the cos decision to terminate vses award because the procurement was tainted by the appearance of impropriety stemming from the protesters hiring of the former dpm was not reasonable a finding that an actual or apparent impropriety was created by a firms hiring of a former government employee must be based on hard facts rather than suspicion or innuendo which demonstrate that the former employee could have conferred an unfair competitive advantage to that firm see health net fed servs llc supra  cpd ¶  at  turner constr co inc  fd at  as discussed above the co identified  findings of fact and stated that these findings collectively informed her judgment in the armys response to the protest the co did not state that any particular findings were more important than others or that there was any overriding theme that informed her judgment aside from her sense that something was going on that just wasnt adding up and that an outsider would think that something was amiss tr at   the cos findings concerning the former dpms activities in connection with the rfp assumed that they gave rise to a competitive advantage for vse finding nos  and  the co acknowledged however that she did not identify any nonpublic procurement sensitive information that the former dpm might have accessed regarding the rfp which could have provided a competitive advantage with regard to the caci award fee finding no  the co based her findings on assumptions concerning information she believed the former dpm may have accessed despite not being certain about the actual information to which the former dpm had access thus these findings are not based on hard facts of an appearance of impropriety but on assumptions with regard to the cos findings concerning the former dpms laptop finding no  we agree that the co was within her discretion to disregard the former dpms explanations and rely upon the information provided by the ref which showed that he returned his laptop on january   however the cos assumptions regarding the former dpms access to ref computer systems which may have contained proprietary caci information and procurement sensitive information concerning the rfp finding no  were erroneous and based on assumptions rather than hard facts although the agency has provided additional declarations concerning the networks where the information is currently stored the record is not clear as to what information was stored during the time the former dpm might have had access moreover the co has not examined or addressed this newlyproduced information with regard to the former dpms postemployment activities the co viewed his actions as per se unreasonable because in her view they constituted more than behindthescenes advice finding nos  the co acknowledged however that she did not understand what behindthescenes advice meant and the record shows that her understanding of his actions is inconsistent with  usc § a and the associated regulatory guidance in sum we do not think that the cos findings regarding the laptop and the uncertain information regarding the former dpms access to computer files can support the termination decision in light of the significant concerns about her findings regarding his access to nonpublic rfp information his postemployment activities on behalf of vse or his role in the caci award fee board on this record bearing in mind the collective nature of the cos analysis of her findings of fact we are unable to unravel or segregate the effects of the unsupported assumptions and incorrect legal conclusions from the reliance on otherwise reasonable conclusions for this reason we sustain the protest recommendation for the reasons discussed above we recommend that the army conduct a new review of the former dpms role in the procurement consistent with our decision to determine whether the award to vse should be terminated specifically we recommend that the co reconsider the available information and obtain any new information necessary to establish the hard facts concerning the former dpms actions we also recommend that the co evaluate these facts under the appropriate legal authorities in making her new judgment in the event that the army determines that the former dpms and vses actions merit termination of the contract the agency should document the bases for that decision in the event that the army determines that there is no basis to find that the former dpms and vses actions created an actual or apparent impropriety that warrants termination of vses contract it should reinstate the award to the protester we also recommend that vse be reimbursed the costs of filing and pursuing this protest including reasonable attorney fees bid protest regulations  cfr § d  vse should submit its certified claim for costs

the unfair competitive advantage analysis stemming from a firms hiring of a former government employee is virtually indistinguishable from the concerns and considerations that arise in protests alleging that a firm has gained an unfair competitive advantage arising from its unequal access to information as a result of an organizational conflict of interest see health net fed servs llc supra at  n  while the agencys and intervenors posthearing comments suggest that the former dpm may also have had insight and input as to who would be the evaluators for this acquisition the record does not show that this is an issue that has been considered by the co a notice on the fedbizopps website shows that a draft sow was released by the agency on september   and was revised on september  the cos termination rationale cites an outprocessing date of february   in her testimony the co clarified that she believed that the former dpm returned his laptop on the date he actually completed outprocessing ie january  see tr at  the co testified that she did not know whether it was possible to look into computer files and determine whether or not the former dpm accessed information in the computer system tr at  we note for the record that there is no finding by the co that the former dpm had access to offeror proposalsaside from vseor to agency evaluation documents the oge was established by the ethics in government act of  and is the agency that provides overall direction oversight and accountability of executive branch policies designed to prevent and resolve conflicts of interest oge website available at httpwwwusogegovaboutmissionandresponsibilitiesmissionresponsibilities the co also stated that she considered relevant a statement by a caci employee that the employee had heard from other individuals that the former dpm had attended a party celebrating the award of a different contract not the alternate staffing contract at issue here to one of the firms that had partnered with vse on the alternate staffing contract tr at  citing ar tab z decl of caci employee july   ¶  the co acknowledges that this declaration was not based on firsthand knowledge and that the co did not receive any information from an individual with firsthand knowledge of this alleged event tr at  even if we assume that that the information was correct the co did not clearly explain why the former dpms attendance of a party for an unrelated contract award after he had left government employment created an appearance of impropriety our decision is not intended to reflect our judgment that the former dpms actions are per se permissible or that they do not raise any legitimate concerns that his hiring by vse as a consultant creates an appearance of impropriety instead our decision reflects our conclusion that based on the cos findings and responses to the protest many of her findings of fact relied on assumptions rather than hard facts and that her understanding
