chrysostom clerics between desert and empire j h w g liebeschuetz traces the path by which asceticism generally and monasticism specifically became so influential a part of christianity examines the relationship of two great fourthcentury bishops with secular especially imperial authority ambrose and john chrysostom clerics between desert and empire j h w g liebeschuetz description j h w g liebeschuetz compares the personalities and the respective careers of two of the greatest of the early christian fathers ambrose and john chrysostom while the statesmanlike ambrose ended his life as a pillar of the western establishment chrysostom the outspoken idealist died in exile however their views and ideals were remarakably similar both bishops were concerned with the social role of the church both were determined opponents of what they called the arian heresy and each attracted a dedicated following among his urban congregation this similarity liebeschuetz argues was due not to the influence of one on the other but was a consequence of their participation in a christian culture which spanned the divide between the eastern later byzantine and western parts of the roman empire the monastic movement figures throughout the book as an important influence on both men and as perhaps the most dynamic development in the christian culture of the fourth century show more ambrose and
