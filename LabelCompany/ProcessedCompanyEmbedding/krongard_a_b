newsletter…which recommended these trades   commission report ww norton  footnote on p  alvin bernard buzzy krongard was executive director of the cia from march  until november  previously he had served as a consultant to cia directors george j tenet  and robert james woolsey jr  the informed insider trading of stock options carried out by people with prior knowledge of the terror attacks of  is once again in the news max keiser of the keiser report recently interviewed lars schall a german journalist who has written extensively on the terror traders of  in the center of the discussion of the informed trading done by people who evidently knew the attacks were coming stands one very conspicuous individual ab buzzy krongard then executive director of the cia krongard would be considered a person of interest in any proper criminal investigation of  or the insider trading that preceded it krongard has been suspected of being connected to the suspicious trading since october  in one of my first articles about  the profiteers of  i wrote the following investigations into the unusually high number of put options betting that the price of united airlines ual and american airlines shares would fall have revealed that alex brown inc an investment banking firm purchased many of these option contracts alex brown inc was until  managed by the man who is now the executive director of the central intelligence agency ab buzzy krongard krongard  former head of baltimorebased alex brown americas oldest investment bank joined the cia three years ago as a counselor to director of central intelligence george tenet krongard switched careers shortly after helping engineer the  billion merger of alex brown and bankers trust new york corp gaining  million in bankers trust stock in the process president bush appointed krongard executive director of the central intelligence agency on march  from february  until march  krongard served as counselor to the director of central intelligence until  krongard was chairman of the investment bank ab brown having previously worked in various capacities at alex brown krongard was quoted on the relationship between wall street and the cia in a washington post article if you go back to the cias origins during world war ii in the office of strategic services krongard told the post the whole oss was really nothing but wall street bankers and lawyers who is buzzy krongard the hypothesis of my book solving  the deception that changed the world is that the terror attacks were a falseflag operation planned and carried out by israeli military intelligence with the assistance and support of zionist agents in high positions in the us government these zionist agents would include people like dov zakheim at the pentagon and michael chertoff then assistant attorney general who was responsible for the federal investigation and prosecution of the crimes of  in this position chertoff managed the federal noninvestigation of  in which the crucial evidence was confiscated and destroyed without being properly examined my hypothesis is not that  was an inside job but that it was an israeliplanned falseflag operation the israeli operation was facilitated by highlyplaced zionist agents within the us government military and intelligence spheres if buzzy krongard is a suspect in the crimes of  the question that needs to be answered is was krongard acting as an agent for israeli military intelligence at alex brown and the cia the evidence indicates that he served as an agent for israel in both positions alvin bernard krongard born  is the son of raphael harris krongard and rita keyser krongard both his mother and father were born in baltimore to jewish immigrant families from polandrussia his first wife patricia lion was also jewish while krongards jewish roots are never mentioned in the various articles about him his jewish ethnicity clearly plays the key role in his efforts to support israeli enterprises in the united states when a highlevel person like krongard conceals his jewish roots while actively serving the state of israel it indicates that he is seeking to hide his true identity and loyalty to a foreign state for such a person to be the administrative chief of the central intelligence agency says a great deal about the degree of israeli penetration of the us intelligence community alvin bernard krongard at princeton  krongards paternal grandparents immigrated from lowicz poland to the united states in  the family name and first names were changed krongaard is a scandinavian name that his grandfather took after they arrived in the united states krongaard means land or property of the crown the immigration records indicate that his grandfather morris krongard did not enter the us under that name krongards mother rita rebecca keyser was born in baltimore to abraham and ethel keyser russian jewish immigrants who had also arrived in the us in  she was raised in washington where she attended high school and graduated from strayer business college she worked as a legal secretary for a washington maritime lawyer before her marriage to raphael harris krongard in  the krongards lived in ashburton maryland and had three children alvin howard joel and a daughter marilyn who died in  alvin krongard graduated from princeton and went on to serve on active duty in the us marine corps in the mediterranean from  although the details are not given it seems likely that he served in lebanon where the us marines were sent in  he returned to the united states and married patricia lion he worked at her family business lion brothers from  after a two year stint at bachestern brothers boyce he joined the baltimore investment bank of alex brown in  after twenty years buzzy krongard became ceo of alex brown in july  alex brown and israel as ceo of americas oldest investment bank krongard was well placed to assist companies spawned by israeli military intelligence under krongard alex brown became a leading us partner for these israeli companies in may  krongard and mayo a shattuck went to israel on a threeday trip during which they met with then prime minister shimon peres as the baltimore sun reported shortly before their trip to israel a b krongard alex browns chairman and chief executive and mayo a shattuck iii president and chief operating officer are to meet with israeli prime minister shimon peres and dov lautman the prime ministers special emissary for economic development obviously this is a trip of some significance mr shattuck said we want to be perceived as the premiere underwriter and adviser for hightech and health care companies in israel the time has come to build stronger affiliations at the senior management level the meeting with mr peres was arranged through giza group one of israels leading private investment banking firms mr shattuck said when alex brown officials meet with mr peres they expect to talk about how the company can link israeli firms to us capital markets mr shattuck said alex brown which had  million in revenues in  is known worldwide for its expertise in taking hightech and health care companies public last year it managed  initial public offerings tops in the united states r william burgess jr head of alex browns technology investment banking group compared israel to silicon valley in california and route  in boston which have spawned some of the worlds largest hightech companies my hope would be to do several initial public offerings a year for israeli companies and several mergers and acquisitions said mr burgess who will also make the trip alex brown has been doing business with companies in israel for at least five years in  alex brown was serving as the financial advisor for scitex an israeli company connected to military intelligence yair shamir the son of yitzhak shamir the zionist terrorist who killed folke bernadotte before becoming prime minister was general manager of scitex krongards threeday visit to israel and meeting with the prime minister was arranged by the giza group a tel avivbased investment banking firm at the time of krongards visit aviv boim was a vice president of giza ltd boim remained at giza for two more months until august  and then joined krongards company as an associate of alex brown from august  to february  aviv boim worked with alex browns technology group in london where he managed initial public offerings mergers and acquisitions concerning israeli companies on october   the baltimore sun reported that krongard was still bullish on israel krongard had addressed the marylandisrael development center the previous day there is great market demand for israels products krongard said israel has the brain power its human capital is exceptional the marylandisrael development center was started in  as a nonprofit group to form business partnerships between maryland and israeli companies the article noted that just the week prior to his speech at the marylandisrael development center krongard and alex brown had taken the israeli company orckit communications ltd public tel avivbased orckit makes systems that enable telephone companies to provide highspeed voice and digital transmission the sun reported yair shamir was a director of orckit orckit and unit  of israeli military intelligence orckit is a company that was created by the former commander of unit  the signal intelligence branch of the israeli military as efi landau reported in globes israel even orckit’s win in the large tender of the us telephone company gte one of the eight largest telephone companies in the world did not persuade company president yitzhak tamir to grant an open on the record press interview however cracks can be seen in the shrouds hiding the company from the media contributing perhaps to the recognition that the company’s most precious asset is its workers and it cannot hurt if more is known about them orckit was established in  by military intelligence electronic unit  graduates eric paneth and yitzhak tamir the unit has provided israeli hightech a significant proportion of its engineers and managers paneth was commander of the unit replacing zohar zisappel chairman of the radbynet group orckit and tikcro are not your usual companies these are typical israeli military dualuse companies they have hidden military and intelligence functions but are presented as normal commercial enterprises with companies like orckit buzzy krongard and his team at alex beam certainly must have been aware that they were investing in companies closely tied to the israeli military in february  buzzy krongard joined the cia as a consultant to director george tenet in a bizarre move krongard left his  million a year job as head of bankers trust bt he had just completed the bt merger with alex brown in the fall of  and suddenly he was leaving aviv boim also left bt alex brown in february and joined orckit as chief financial officer the merger between bankers trust and alex brown the first between a bank and a securities brokerage since the depression however went sour shortly after krongard left the company the newly merged company reported a record loss in  and was soon taken over by deutsche bank mayo shattuck stayed on at alex brown but resigned suddenly the day after  while it is clear that krongard jumped ship because he knew that the bt alex brown merger would soon fail why did he go to work for the cia what we do know is that krongard had worked closely with computer companies spawned by israeli military intelligence after he joined the cia as counselor to the director krongard soon became engaged in setting up the cia venture capital firm called inqit inqtel that was supposed to keep the agency abreast of computer technology how much israeli software do you think found its way onto the cia computer network under buzzy krongards reign in october  the washington post reported on the genesis of inqtel a lot of people wondered what cia director george j tenet had in mind a year and a half ago when he brought in wall street heavyweight ab buzzy krongard to serve as his counselor now they know part of the story the man who helped underwrite microsoft and aol as head of alex brown  co has done it again helping tenet  co start up a cia venture capital firm called inqit thats supposed to keep the agency abreast of computer technology but krongards influence at langley extends well beyond this foray into silicon valley george will say make this happen  said krongard  explaining in a telephone interview exactly what it is he does for the director of central intelligence the idea is for inqit to fund promising technologies the idea for the venturecapital fund was hatched in conversations between the new cia director george tenet and a former investment banker named a b buzzy krongard who joined the agency in february  as counselor to the director the director of the cia is often little more than a mannequin who gives a name and a face to the agency while the daytoday operations are managed by the executive director like krongard george tenet is similar to leon panetta both are sons of immigrants who owned diners one in little neck new york the other in monterey california what is it about tenet and panetta that made them suitable to be directors of the cia they are clearly not leaders of men or strong thinkers could it be that they were men who were known to be weak and amenable and who could easily be controlled by people like krongard krongard became the executive director of the cia in march  and remained at that position for more than three years until november  he was responsible for getting cia security contracts for blackwater in afghanistan and iraq later his brother howard aka cookie as inspector general of the state department denied knowing that buzzy sat on the board of blackwater during congressional hearings into his obstruction of the investigation of contract fraud and crimes carried out by blackwater the congressional investigation did not result in any criminal charges being laid against either of the krongard brothers krongard exhibited the requisite secretiveness when asked to explain his interest in intelligence and how he came to land a job in george j tenets inner circle the washington post reported on march   the day after he was named executive director of the cia if you go back to the cias origins during world war ii in the office of strategic services he explained the whole oss was really nothing but wall street bankers and lawyers krongard was the chief operating officer the daytoday administrative leader of the cia from march  until november  in this position he was certainly aware of the planeintobuilding drill planned for september   at the national reconnaissance office a subagency of the cia although krongard is probably not an architectural level planner of the terrorism of  the evidence indicates that he served as a highlyplaced manager who served as an important conduit linking israeli military intelligence with the cia alvin krongard his second wife cheryl and jim

objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
