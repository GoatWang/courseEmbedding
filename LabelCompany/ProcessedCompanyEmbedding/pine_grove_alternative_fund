the meaning assigned to them in the prospectus of the master fund   note  fair value hierarchy   the master fund has a threetier fair value hierarchy the basis of the tiers is dependent upon the various “inputs” used to determine the value of the master fund’s investments these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below level  — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level  — inputs are quoted prices for similar assets in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as models or other valuation methodologies the master fund’s investments in private investment funds which are generally included in this category include investments in private investment funds where the master fund has the ability to withdraw at the net asset value per share or its equivalent at june   or within three months thereafter under normal market conditions and there are no other potential liquidity restrictions such as redemption gates or suspensions   level  – inputs are unobservable for the asset and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset as of the measurement date  investments in private investment funds that are currently subject to liquidity restrictions that will not be lifted within three months of the measurement date will be considered level        level      level      level      total   private investment funds                         convertible arbitrage a                         distressed –

                            total                                    pine grove alternative institutional fund notes to schedule of investments unaudited june   a convertible arbitrage convertible arbitrage is a strategy that entails purchasing convertible securities convertible bonds or preferred stock and hedging the equity risk by shorting the underlying common stock some managers attempt to hedge other risks associated with convertible arbitrage such as interest rate risk and credit risk one of the main risks in this strategy is the possibility of losses in the portfolio of long or short positions that are not offset by corresponding gains in the portfolio of short or long positions   b distressed – corporate distressed corporate managers typically invest in the senior secured andor liquidating debt of companies in financial distress andor those entering or exiting bankruptcy these investments can result in substantial or total loss due to business and financial risks but this is often mitigated by collateral coverage distressed investing is often associated with relative illiquidity reduced transparency and valuation involving significant management judgment     c distressed – structured products distressed structured products managers buy pools of assets that have been securitized bonds backed by the cashflows from these assets often this includes pools of mortgages that are not guaranteed by the government it may also include pools of leveraged loans commercial real estate student loans and other kinds of assets usually the pools were once rated investment grade but the assets turned out to be of worse quality than the first investors originally thought they would be some managers may also buy agency derivatives one of the main risks in this strategy is the possibility of losses in the portfolio of long positions if the manager assumptions regarding prepayments defaults recovery etc prove to be too aggressive also agency derivatives in particular are very sensitive to borrower prepayment rates as well as the level of short term interest rates   d hedged credit hedged credit managers typically take long and short positions in fixed income instruments of companies across the credit spectrum some also buy structured products these managers may also buy equities usually in companies that have some issue eg they just came out of bankruptcy or are otherwise difficult to understand these managers hedge by shorting stocks and bonds that they think have a lot more downside than upside even if only during a crisis one of the main risks in this strategy is the possibility of losses in the portfolio of long or short positions that are not offset by corresponding gains in the portfolio of short or long positions due to incorrect analysis of idiosyncratic factors   e longshort equity longshort equity managers attempt to buy undervalued equities and short overvalued equities managers selected for investment by the investment manager typically attempt to be either market neutral or have low net exposure to the equity markets in this way the manager is not relying on the market going up or down to make money one of the main risks in this strategy is the possibility of losses in the portfolio of long or short positions that are not offset by corresponding gains in the portfolio of short or long positions short selling creates additional risk of limited upside and unlimited downside   f other other represents investments in private investment funds for which the master fund expects to receive the redemption proceeds upon sale of the underlying investments the master fund has redeemed from these private investment funds and has received a majority of the redemption proceeds the current portfolio of underlying investments held by such private investment companies is illiquid in nature and is not necessarily indicative of the active investment strategies of such private investment funds            pine grove
