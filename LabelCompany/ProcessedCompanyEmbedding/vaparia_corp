and results of operations for the three month and nine month periods ended september   and  should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report our discussion includes forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans objectives expectations and intentions actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of factors including those set forth underrisk factors appearing in the posteffective amendment no  to our registration statement on form s as filed with the securities and exchange commission on june   this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission we use words such as anticipate estimate plan project continuing ongoing expect believe intend may will should could and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements in addition any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forwardlooking statements such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this report overview vaparia corporation is a development stage consumer products and wellness company focusing on the research development manufacturing and commercialization of novel indemand proprietary products designed to deliver fastacting convenient solutions for contemporary lives and lifestyles the basis of our product development is proprietary patented and patentpending technologies and formulas focused on three specific markets the smokefree tobacco alternative market ecigarettes vaparia corporation currently contemplates filing with the us food and drug administration fda center for drug evaluation and research to become the first ecigarette company to secure fasttrack status and then seek fda approval as a smoking cessation product the overthecounter otc consumer market with products intended to increase energy and alertness suppress appetite and aid in restful sleep and the pharmaceutical market  partnering with international pharmaceutical companies that seek to utilize our technologies to maximize and extend the value and the lives of their proprietary patented product portfolios our experience and our understanding of vaporizing technology and vapormethod medicant delivery has todate resulted in our licensing one patent and optioning two patent applications from an affiliate chong corporation which has been assigned the patent and patent applications by two members of our current management team alexander chong and william bartkowski and others as coinventors pursuant to an exclusive license and option to license agreement prior to establishing our whollyowned subsidiary vaparia solutions in  the principals of vaparia had  years collective experience in vaporization and ecigarette technology having been partners in a joint venture with pioneers in the industry and having undertaken significant work internationally researching and developing products shepherding them through the patent process and introducing them into the us wholesale and retail supply chain  exclusive license and option to license agreement effective december   vaparia solutions entered into an exclusive license and option to license agreement with the chong corporation a related party for an intellectual property portfolio including a license for the lobelia patent patent no   issued october   a method for lobelia delivery is provided comprising providing a lobelia solution suitable for vaporization in a compact handheld device providing the compact handheld device vaporizing the lobelia solution at a low temperature upon activation by a user such that an effective serving of lobelia is provided to the user this patent covers a formulation for an fda exempt herbal remedy that contains lobeline an alkaloid that produces effects similar to nicotine and caffeine and can be commercialized as a smoking alternative and respiratory tonic and restorative we believe that the benefits of commercializing this formulation include providing a product for introduction into todays ecigarette and vapor market that would not be subject to taxes similar to tobacco taxes that are now being introduced throughout the country on ecigarette and vapor products that contain nicotine the exclusive license and option to license agreement also includes an option to license the following patent applications device patent application   a control system for a handheld vapor delivery device comprising a circuit configured to provide a precise amount of power from a power source to heat a heating element to a minimum required temperature to completely vaporize a predetermined volume of a liquid and control a precise duration of time to supply the precise amount of power to completely vaporize the predetermined volume of liquid at the required temperature the application also utilizes alkaline battery chemistry and an enclosed cartridge that eliminates leaking and reduces the risks of oxidation contamination and adulteration making the device suitable for pharmaceutical applications and vaporized medicants and methods of use patent application  medicant solutions ie suitable for vaporization at a low temperature medicants or active ingredients that are covered by the application include energy boosters analgesics sleep aids motion sickness remedies and erectile dysfunction remedies under the terms of the agreement chong corporation a related party controlled by our chief executive officer was paid a license issue fee and option to license fee of  in the form of  shares of vaparia solutions  series a convertible preferred stock these shares were exchanged for shares of our  series a convertible preferred stock in the acquisition of vaparia solutions on july   and vaparia solutions is obligated to pay a chong corporation a  royalty commencing january   of no less than  per year the license subject to option is exercisable at any time during the term of the agreement at an option price not higher than  million which may be payable in cash equity or note acceptable to vaparia solutions subject to the availability of sufficient capital it is our intention to exercise this option  while vaparia solutions has historically outsourced its licensing and research and development activities to chong corporation  over time and subject to the availability of sufficient capital it is our intention to bring those activities under the operations of our company we need to raise approximately  in capital to provide funds for the further development of our business including costs associated with research and development and the hiring of additional personnel and to pay our operating expenses and obligations until such time if ever that we are able to generate sufficient working capital from our operations we do not have any firm commitments for this additional capital and given the small size of our company the early stage of our operations we may find it difficult to raise sufficient capital to meet our needs if we are unable to access capital as needed our ability to grow our company is in jeopardy and absent a significant increase in our revenues we may be unable to continue as a going concern going concern we incurred net losses of approximately  for the nine months ended september   the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on vaparia solutions financial statements for the year ended december   contained an explanatory paragraph regarding its ability to continue as a going concern based upon its recurring losses these factors among others raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty there are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to generate consistent revenues or report profitable operations or to continue as a going concern in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our company  results of operations we have been in the developmental stage since inception with only organizational matters up to september   and we have not generated any revenues from our operations through september   our operations mainly consisted of closing the transaction by which we acquired vaparia solutions in july  our total operating expenses increased substantially for the third quarter and first nine months of  from the comparable periods in  which is generally attributable to onetime expenses associated with the acquisition we expect that our operating expenses will increase as we continue to develop our business and we devote additional resources towards promoting that growth most notably reflected in anticipated increases in general overhead salaries for personnel and technical resources however as set forth elsewhere in this report our ability to continue to develop our business and achieve our operational goals is dependent upon our ability to raise significant additional working capital as the availability of this capital is unknown we are unable to quantify at this time the expected increases in operating expenses in future periods liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to satisfy its needs for cash as of september   we had  in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of  as compared to cash and cash equivalents of  and a working capital deficit of  at december   our current assets declined  and our current liabilities increased  at september   from december   our principal sources of operating capital have been two loans from related parties totaling  and the issuance of a convertible note for  on july   the note is due december   and bears interest at  per annum the note is convertible in  shares of our common stock at  per share we do not have any commitments for capital expenditures our working capital is not sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next  months and to satisfy our obligations as they become due as described earlier in this report we will need to raise at least  in additional capital during the next  months as we do not have any firm commitments for all or any portion of this necessary capital there are no assurances we will have sufficient funds to fund our operating expenses and continued development of our products and to satisfy our obligations as they become due in that event our ability to continue as a going concern is in jeopardy net cash used in operating activities we used  of cash in our operating activities during the first nine months of  compared to  used by our operating activities for the nine months of  the increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net loss after adjusting for noncash expenses partially offset by an increase in accounts payable net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in the first nine months of  for a total amount of  reflects funds repaid to vaparia from a related party chong corporation and also cash received from reverse merger compared to net cash used by investing activities in the first nine months of  for a total amount of  which reflects the loan to chong corporation net cash provided by financing
