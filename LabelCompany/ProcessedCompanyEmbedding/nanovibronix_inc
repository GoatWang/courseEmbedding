healing of nerve origin currently under clinical research no limitation in treatment duration the treatment may help avoiding trigeminal neuralgia surgery trigeminal neuralgia background and testimonials trigeminal neuralgia is severe spastic lancinating facial pain due to a disorder of the th cranial nerve diagnosis is clinical   trigeminal neuralgia etiology trigeminal neuralgia is usually caused by an intracranial artery or a venous loop that compresses the trigeminal nerve at its root entry zone into the brain stem other less common trigeminal neuralgia causes include compression by a tumor and occasionally a multiple sclerosis plaque at the root entry zone but these are distinguished usually by accompanying sensory and other deficits the mechanism is suggested to be a nerve compression which causes local demyelination which may result in ectopic impulse generation andor disinhibition of central pain pathways involving the spinal trigeminal nucleus trigeminal neuralgia symptoms and signs pain occurs along the distribution of one or more sensory divisions of the trigeminal nerve most often the maxillary upper jaw the pain is paroxysmal spastic lasting seconds up to  min but attacks may recur rapidly it is lancinating excruciating and sometimes incapacitating trigeminal neuralgia pain is often precipitated by stimulating a facial trigger point eg by chewing brushing the teeth or smiling sleeping on that side of the face is often intolerable trigeminal neuralgia diagnosis trigeminal neuralgia symptoms are almost pathognomonic neurologic examination is normal in trigeminal neuralgia thus neurologic deficits usually loss of facial sensation suggest that the tnlike pain is caused by another disorder eg tumor stroke multiple sclerosis plaque vascular malformation other lesions that compress the trigeminal nerve or disrupt its brain stem pathways conventional trigeminal neuralgia treatment drugs  usually anticonvulsants or painkillers that may become ineffective with disease progression and carry various adverse effects surgical intervention  if pain is severe despite the pharmacologic treatment a surgical treatments are considered however efficacy may be temporary and improvement may be followed by recurrent pain that is more severe than the preceding episodes  related documents

indwelling urinary catheters increase antibiotic efficacy and decrease pain and discomfort associated with urinary catheter use the trial was conducted at two skilled nursing facilities near buffalo ny in which  subjects were evaluated in the trial  patients had active uroshield devices and  patients were treated with placebo devices at the start of the trial all  subjects exhibited significant colonization of multiple microorganisms in both the catheter device as well as retained urine from the bladder of the  samples analyzed most were counted at greater than  colony forming units cfu at the day evaluation all  subjects in the control group still exhibited greater than  cfus in both the catheter and urine samples the  subjects in the uroshield™ treatment group exhibited a significant reduction in both the number and types of cfus exhibited in the samples the live cfu count in most of the catheter and urine samples in the uroshield™ treatment group were less than  and in many of the samples they were measured at less than  which represents a greater than  reduction in cfus in addition at the day follow up none of the subjects in the uroshield™ treatment arm developed a
