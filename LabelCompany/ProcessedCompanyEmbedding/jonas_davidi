opportunity to ask questions on todays call and now allow me to turn the call over to straight path’s ceo davidi jonas davidi the floor is yours davidi jonas thank you and thank you all for joining us on todays call i would like to discuss some recent developments in our three segments as well as provide some outlook regarding where we are heading allow me to begin with straight path’s ip group following our successes at the federal circuit court of appeals as well as the related hearings at the patent trial and appeals board we are now facing an appeal back to the federal circuit on the ptabs conclusions and some of the interparty reviews challenging the patentability of our patent of course the ptabs conclusions were informed by the federal circuit’s earlier decision but nonetheless the appellants have appealed as a matter of right during the pendency of the appeal there is a possibility that some or all of our cases pending in federal district court will remain or be stayed the court in the eastern district of virginia for instance has elected to keep the stay in place but the other courts have not yet decided in the coming weeks and months we intend to move forward with attempts at resolution andor furthering the progress of our cases moving on to straight path ventures our wireless hardware development segment we recently reported that our gigabit mobility lab conducted a successful indoor demonstration of a development stage prototype  ghz g ph transceiver the press release describing some of the results as well as a link to a brief video can be found on our website the accomplishments of our lab led by our chief technology officer jerry pi exceeded our expectations in a matter of a few short months and on a relatively small budget we were able to demonstrate the ability of phased arrays and beamforming with industry standard modulation at  ghz while we still have a lot of work to get to a commercial product this is an important milestone for our company we are planning an outdoor demonstration in the coming months where we hope to cover a much longer distance and continue to showcase our engineering prowess and the  ghz frontier of course we hope this raises the profile of not just our technical expertise but of what can be achieved with  ghz to date much of the industrys millimeter wave testing and demonstrations have been focused at  ghz we hope our efforts will bring greater focus to  ghz as well moving on to straight path spectrum as our press release disclosed following the release of the umfu report and order the report and order released in july adopted rules quite in line with straight path’s goals and advocacy the fcc’s rules include flexible use rates for incumbents repacking the  ghz band  mhz channel sizes partial economic areas instead of counties unlike at  ghz pushing out the next substantial service demonstration to  access to the bands for satellite in a manner that protects terrestrial services and technical rules that allow for wide area coverage aside from the commission’s rulemaking activity we are seeing growing adoption of  ghz mainly as a result of our investments and efforts for example we recently signed a multiyear lease agreement with a nationwide advanced network communications provider which will serve potentially thousands of customers across dozens of markets using cambridge broadband network’s  ghz pointtomultipoint radios and spectrum lease term out at the same time we have been seeing growing interest in  ghz from operators across the country in anticipation of the availability of  ghz pmp we engaged new lessees to initiate them into  ghz we currently have customers operating on channels covering more than  of our licensed holdings by mhzpops following the conclusion of our independent investigation we disclosed the results of the investigation to the fcc and provided additional information requested by the commission the commission recently sent us a letter of inquiry requesting additional information as part of their investigation we continue to fully cooperate with the commission while we cannot foretell how long the investigation will take nor what the outcome will be we hope that the investigation will be brought to a satisfactory resolution in a shorter time as is practicable we will continue to provide updates as developments warrant we continue to be active in the commissions ongoing rulemaking proceeds we submitted comments to the further notice of proposed rulemaking along with many other industry participants while we expect the snprm to move a bit slower than the initial report and order one can sense the importance that the industry and the commission placed on millimeter wave for the future of wireless communication we hope that as the leaders in license millimeter waves  ghz and  ghz will set the tone we have seen a transformation of these bands with the emergence of new technologies and customer demand we hope to play a vital part in the next generation of fixed and mobile wireless communications with that allow me to turn the call over to our cfo jonathan rand jonathan jonathan rand thank you davidi the fcc’s upper microwave flexible use report and order is certainly of a historic nature as the fcc took great steps for the united states to maintain its worldwide competitive stature in wireless communications by making a significant new portion of bandwidth available to support the explosive growth of data consumption via mobile users the fact that straight path has been in the middle of this process playing a significant role in both the regulatory proceedings and now also via innovative development of nextgeneration wireless technology testifies to our commitment and vision to make meaningful contributions to the wireless communications industry i am pleased to outline our financial results as we completed the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  and three months ended july  i’ll start with the focus on q and then move to a broader look at the entire  fiscal year for q we recognized revenue of  this revenue was generated solely by our spectrum subsidiary and is leveled with spectrum lease revenue from the previous quarter we expect to see spectrum revenue return to a modest quarterly increase as it had earlier in fiscal  if there is a successful commercial launch and subsequent wireless operator adoption of the cambridge  ghz pointtomultipoint radios expected at the earliest in q of calendar  we would then expect spectrum lease revenue to increase more rapidly total cost and expenses for the quarter were  million consisting of direct cost of revenues research and development expense and our sga this compares to  million in q and  million oneyear ago we continue to support critical research and development efforts in q we achieved important progress in our gigabit mobility lab and expensed an additional  towards rd resulting in our recent g  ghz transceiver indoor demonstration a major milestone for our venture segment and team in july cambridge reached the third of three development milestones towards its  ghz pointtomultipoint prototype so we expensed the final  against the  million prepaid under our development arrangement with cambridge this quarters sga spend totaled  million including noncash compensation of approximately  this is up from last quarters sga spending of  million primarily due to an increase of expenses regarding our class action litigation and related regulatory matters and the cost of  for  ghz pointtopoint equipment deployed via new spectrum lessees as i will describe further below with  of revenue and  million in costs and expenses we are reporting an operating loss of  million for q this compares to a  million operating loss last quarter and  million operating loss in the yearago quarter the loss for this quarter reflects extra spending for sga items of equipment litigation and regulatory matters moving on to the full fiscal year of  we closed fiscal  with  million of cash and cash equivalents versus  million at the end of q and  million on hand at the close of fiscal year  total revenue recognized for fiscal  was  million versus  million in the previous year this drop is due to the reduction in our ip groups recognized revenue of  million in this fiscal year versus  million in fiscal  as we recognized revenue from settlement and licensing arrangements entered into in prior years this year’s spectrum revenue of  increased by  over fiscal  total cost and expenses for fiscal  were  million versus  million for the previous year this reduction in total costs and expenses is mainly due to a significant decrease in direct cost of revenue in line with the reduced revenue recognized from our ip settlement offset by increases in sga and rd spending this years  million of expenses breaks out percentage wise approximately as follows  direct cost of revenues  noncash compensation  sga spending excluding the noncash compensation and  towards rd now i’d like to provide some of the expectations we have for the upcoming quarters our operational spending budget for fiscal  is  million which consist of approximately  million per quarter for our general operations  million for the fullyear of support for our gigabit mobility lab and approximately  million to fund matters related to the shareholder litigation and fcc investigation although this last component in particular is subject to change depending on future developments we have also committed to increasing our purchase of cbnl  ghz hardware by about  million as noted last quarter to a total of approximately  million in total for the year on the revenue side we anticipate there will be an increase in spectrum lease revenue in fiscal  more likely in the latter half of the year dependent primarily on the cbnl  ghz pointtomultipoint hardware being commercialized successfully and in a timely manner as we previously disclosed in july we signed a multiyear spectrum lease agreement with a nationwide advanced network communications provider to lease our  ghz spectrum in dozens of cities for use with cbnl pointtomultipoint radios once they are commercially released cbnl is expecting to test working prototypes with several us operators in the coming months even if the cbnl radios are ready for commercial deployment that particular lease should let generate several hundred thousand dollars of spectrum lease revenue in fiscal  with the expectation to rampup significantly although of course there are various risks inherent to predict future revenue based on new technology and other factors its important to note that this transaction does not sell any spectrum as is typical in our spectrum leasing arrangements the operator is leasing the spectrum while we maintain full ownership of the spectrum i wanted to clarify this for our investors as there may have been some confusion related to an announcement released this past july our further consideration regarding revenue lets look at our ip group going forward our ip group recorded no revenue in this quarter and the  we recorded in q marks the final payment for all settlement and license agreements we have entered into to date only in the event that we enter into new settlement and license agreements or sell some or all of the ip will the ip group generate revenue in the future certainly the fact that we have prevailed in our appeal to the us court of appeals and subsequently on remand at the patent trial and appeal board puts the ip group in a better position to generate future revenues although of course that outcome is not certain and there are still significant challenges to meet there was one change in our financial statements id like to highlight regarding our purchase of pointtopoint hardware as our investment to increase market adoption of  ghz spectrum in the advance of the availability of cambridges system in fiscal q this was recorded as property and equipment net of depreciation in our balance sheet for faster adoption and due to the marketing aspect of this campaign we have reallocated that purchase to a marketing expense which will be recorded either in sga for hardware install or as prepaid marketing expense for all related hardware yet to be installed the bottom line regarding our cash balance of a  million versus our various anticipated operational expenses and possible revenue for fiscal  is that we feel our foreseeably available resources place us in a comfortable position for at least the next  months i hope this provides you with good insight into our fiscal status and forwardlooking vision for straight path there will not be a qa session on
