our services accordingly our management has broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds to nonfixed costs an example of changes to this spending allocation for nonfixed costs include management deciding to spend less of the allotment on product development and more on sales and marketing such changes to spending may occur due to seasonal variations in market demand for our services relative to when the funds are received if necessary jevgeni karamkov our sole officer and director has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process but we will require full funding to implement our complete business plan there are thousands of event promoters of different popularity who compete directly with us some of these competitors have established businesses with substantial following and valuable contacts we will attempt to compete against these groups by establishing networks of promoters who will keep on a regular basis personal contact with our clientele we cannot assure you that such a marketing plan will be successful or that competitors will not copy our business strategy our inability to achieve profit and revenue due to competition will have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations company description we were incorporated in the state of nevada on august   we are in the business of event organization and promotion to date we have not yet generated any revenue to generate revenue at events we will be preselling tickets to customers via promoters local stores and websites as well as charging an entrance fee at the door for walkin customers promotion as a general term includes all the ways available to make a product andor service known to and purchased by customers and clients to organize our events we plan to invite the dj in demand at that particular time and make sure the venue will be suitable for the expected amount of clients who will want to attend we plan to organize the events from start to finish by using existing venues we would also be open to help promoting other events if the profit margins will be advantageous to our company being a dj himself our president was involved in the organization of dj events for  years preceding the formation of our company during his dj career he developed valuable contacts in the estonian entertainment and promotions industry mr karamkov’s experience and contacts will be highly valuable to our company and we intent to take advantage of his experience our business strategy is to continue organizing dj events in nightclubs we also intend to begin organizing live music concerts in estonia alternative form of revenue will require us to find sponsors willing to advertise their company at our events sponsors will pay a fee in return for their product being advertised at our events to attract prominent sponsors our events and brand must become popular with high numbers of attendance we intend to invite wellknown djs and live bands to perform at our events our costs will increase every time we invite a more popular dj not only the dj will be more expensive but the promotion and advertisement of high quality djs will be more costly net profit if any will be the amount remaining after deducting the costs of advertising the event and paying the performers  sarvik corp was incorporated in nevada on august   our
