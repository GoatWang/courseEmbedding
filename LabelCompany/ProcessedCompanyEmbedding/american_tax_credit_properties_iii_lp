ten year credit period was fully exhausted with respect to all of the properties as of december   the required holding period of each property in order to avoid lowincome housing tax credit recapture is fifteen years from the year in which the lowincome housing tax credits commence on the last building of the property the compliance period the compliance period of all of the local partnerships had expired as of december   in addition certain of the local partnerships entered into agreements with the relevant state tax credit agencies whereby the local partnerships must maintain the lowincome

property is placed in service regardless of a sale of the properties by the local partnerships after the compliance period the extended use provisions note that the existence of extended use provisions does not extend the compliance period of the respective local partnerships however such provisions may limit the number and availability of potential purchasers of the properties

partnerships in re american tax credit properties limited partnerships resetaa font size print court of chancery of delawarenew castle county in re american tax credit properties limited partnerships civil action no      decided december   craig b smith and robert j katzenstein of smith katzenstein  furlow llp wilmington for plaintiff alan j stone and david j teklits of morris nichols arsht  tunnell wilmington for defendants opinioni introductiontrial in this consolidated action was held on september     at issue is whether the defendant partnerships american tax credit properties ii lp “atc ii” and american tax credit properties iii lp “atc iii” are required to provide plaintiff everest properties inc “everest” with a copy of the current list of names addresses and ownership interests of limited partners pursuant to section  of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act “drulpa” and section  of the respective partnership agreements   the outcome in both cases turns on whether plaintiff became a “substitute limited partner” of the respective partnerships or is merely the assignee of economic rights of its transferor   thus the issue is similar to that decided by this court in monterey investments inc v healthcare properties lp del ch ca no  steele vc  wl  june   and other recent cases   for the reasons discussed infra i find that plaintiff is a substitute limited partner of both partnerships and as such is entitled to the lists at issueii backgrounda the defendant partnershipsdefendants american tax credit properties ii lp and american tax credit properties iii lp collectively “defendant partnerships” are delaware limited partnerships organized in  and  respectively for the purpose of investing in other limited partnerships which are eligible to receive low income housing tax credits   defendant richman tax credit properties ii lp “richman ii” is the sole general partner of atc ii richman tax credits inc “richman credits” in turn is the sole general partner of richman ii defendant richman tax credit properties iii lp “richman iii” is the sole general partner of atc iii richman housing credits inc “richman housing” in turn is the sole general partner of richman iiib admission of transferees of limited partnership unitsboth the atc ii and atc iii partnership agreements collectively “partnership agreements” contemplate the admission of transferees of limited partnership units as either assignees or substitute limited partners   this distinction is significant   an assignee of limited partnership units who does not become a substitute limited partner obtains economic rights in the defendant partnerships but does not obtain the other rights enjoyed by limited partners such as the right of access to partnership books and records or voting rights  see partnership agreements § c admission as an assigneethe ability of limited partners to assign partnership units is subject to restrictions primarily designed to prevent the partnership units from being publicly traded thus protecting the limited partnerships tax status and avoiding potential adverse tax consequences  see partnership agreements §  additionally a limited partner may not assign a partnership unit without the consent of the general partner which consent may not be unreasonably withheld  see partnership agreements § d subject to these restrictions limited partners are free to assign their partnership units   there is no dispute in this matter that everest and its transferor satisfied the requirements of the partnership agreements for admission as an assignee or that the general partner acting through their agent consented to such admission admission as a substitute limited partnerthe partnership agreements also expressly contemplate the admission of assignees of limited partnership units as substitute limited partners   section d of the partnership agreements provides for the admission of an assignee of units as a substitute limited partner provided that certain conditions are satisfied including the following   the instrument of assignment sets forth the intention of the assignor that the assignee succeed to the assignors interest as a limited partner in his place   the assignee shall have fulfilled the requirements for admission as an assignee   the assignee shall have agreed to sign and be bound by the partnership agreements and related documents or amendments thereto   and  “the general partner shall have consented to such substitution which consent may be withheld for any reason”  see partnership agreements §§ d and c ml fundml fund administrators inc “ml fund” is an entity affiliated with merrill lynch  co inc which underwrote the offerings of the partnership units   according to the partnership agreements ml fund provides a variety of “administrative services” to the partnerships and the limited partners  in addition although not among the powers expressly delegated to ml fund in the partnership agreements the defendants concede that ml fund also functions as transfer agent for the partnerships   in this connection ml fund prepares and processes the forms that are used by persons making application for the transfer of unitsml fund acts on behalf of the partnerships in every aspect of the relations between the partnerships and the limited partners or other investors   all correspondence regarding the partnerships is distributed by ml fund while the letterhead indicates that correspondence originated from atc ii and atc iii the originating address listed is that of investor services which is in fact ml fund additionally the partnerships annual reports state that all questions regarding an interest holders interest or the partnerships activities or operations should be directed to investor services ie ml fundthe evidence shows that ml fund maintains the only current list of limited partners   this list is maintained among other reasons for the purpose of communicating with the limited partners regarding the partnerships including the sending out of quarterly and annual reports   section  of the partnership agreements provides for the creation of a list of the names and addresses of the limited partners which information is required to be set forth in schedule a to those agreements  partnership agreements § d section  further mandates that schedule a be amended at least once each calendar quarter  partnership agreements § ein this litigation the defendants take the position that the list maintained by ml fund is not schedule a and is not a list of limited partners at all   at the same time the general partners of the defendant partnerships do not seem to know who other than ml fund is responsible for maintaining schedule a or where other than in the records maintained by ml fund it may be found d everests purchase of limited partnership unitsin november of  everest with the assistance of the chicago partnership board entered into purchase agreements to acquire five limited partnership units in each of atc ii and atc iii in connection with the transfer of ownership of the limited partnership units the chicago partnership board filled out and forwarded to ml fund various forms including the purchase agreements and other documents for the purpose of facilitating the transfer of the partnership units of atc ii and atc iii from the seller to everest   these were in the form used by ml fund and followed exactly those prescribed by the national association of securities dealers “nasd”the nasd prescribed forms resulted from a public rulemaking proceeding conducted by that selfregulatory organization for the purpose of amending its uniform practice code to require member organizations to use standardized transfer forms when transferring interests in limited partnerships   the forms are intended to provide a uniform “one size fits all” way to make uniform the format for gathering transfer information by members and registered representatives reduce the information necessary to perform a valid transfer and eliminate delays and inefficiencies in the transfer and settlement process  see nasd notice to members  march  on january   the united states securities and exchange commission “sec” approved the proposed amendments which became effective may     the standardized transfer forms include the following transferors sellers application for transfer transferees buyers application for transfer registration confirmation form  and  distribution allocation agreement request for admission as substitute limited partnerthe documents forwarded to ml fund by the chicago partnership board were identical to those required to be used by nasd members and included   the transferors sellers application for transfer  and  the transferees buyers application for transfer   both applications contained similar language indicating the transferors intent to transfer and assign and the transferees desire to accept “all rights and interests of the partnership” as well as the transferors and transferees intent for the transferee to “succeed the transferor to such interest as a substitute limited partner successor in interest or assignee”  the defendants urge that because the form uses the disjunctive in referencing the interest to which the transferor is to succeed everest did not effectively request the general partners consent to its admission as a substitute limited partner   that is defendants argue that because the nasd form includes references to “successor in interest” and “assignee” in addition to “substitute limited partner” as possible interests to which the transferee could succeed everest did not adequately request admission as a substituted limited partnereven if the nasdmandated transfer application form was ambiguous but see discussion infra pp  there is other documentary evidence which substantiates everests contention that it requested admission as a substituted limited partner   in the course of discovery ml fund produced from its files a registration confirmation form dated january   which identifies everest as registered owner of the “partnership interests” and references atc iiis partnership tax identification number  see pls trexh  the document produced is in the form required by the nasd uniform practice code the confirmation form states “your transfer request has been processed   the effectiveadmission date as a limited partner in the partnership is indicated below”   everest did not produce a copy of this form from its files nor did the chicago partnership boardat her deposition the ml fund representative asserted that the confirmation form although found in ml funds files and produced by it were not documents which ml fund prepared nor were they the type of documents which ml fund would supply to persons seeking to transfer partnership units  the registration confirmation form is one prescribed by the nasd and mandated for use by its members   from this i conclude that this form was sent to ml fund by chicago partnership board as part of its package of nasdmandated forms seeking transfer of partnership units to everest  it clearly evidences everests request for admission as a substituted limited partner consent to admission as substitute limited partnerfollowing receipt of the application for transfer of the limited partnership units ml fund reviewed and processed the documentation and on january   approved the transfers and registered five units of atc ii and atc iii in the name of everest   ml funds records further indicate that everest became the registered owner of the limited partnership units as of april     the discovery record shows that ml fund added everest to the database maintained by it of limited partners of both defendant partnerships   specifically ml fund produced a computer screen printout which shows everests interest in atc ii and atc iii the date the transfer was approved and most significantly everests status as a partner of the defendant partnerships   additionally all correspondence sent to everest after the effective date of the transfer of partnership units addresses everest not as an assignee but as a limited partner   at some point after the transfer of the partnership units to everest a request was made to ml fund for everests status vis a vis the defendant partnerships   in response to the request ml fund sent a letter dated may   to everest stating “the sale of ownership that was requested in the abovenamed limited partnership is effective as of ”  see pltrexh on july   in accordance with section  of drulpa and section  of the defendant partnership agreements everest made a written request for a copy of a current list of names addresses and interest owned by each holder of limited partnership units of the partnerships  the defendant partnerships responded by sending a letter dated july   requesting additional information in order to assess the appropriateness of the demand letter  on july   everest filed this action for a determination of its entitlement to the lists of limited partnersiii discussionplaintiff contends that it has satisfied all of the requirements of the partnership agreements necessary for becoming a substitute limited partner and that the general partners through the actions of ml fund have consented to its admission as a substitute limited partner   everest argues that ml fund was expressly or impliedly authorized to give such consent or at a minimum acted with apparent authority in doing so   defendants on the other hand contend the general partners did not consent to everests admission as a substitute limited partner and further that plaintiff failed even to make a request for such admissionplaintiffs entitlement to the relief it seeks turns on whether it requested admission as a limited partner and if so on whether the general partners of atc ii and atc iii consented to everests admission as a substitute limited partnera everest requests admission as substitute limited partner the evidence adduced in discovery indicates that everest did in fact request admission as a substitute limited partner of the defendant partnerships   both the transferors and the transferees application for transfer of partnership units stated that they were requesting the transfer of “all rights and interests as set forth in the partnership below” and also that the transferor and transferee “succeed to such interests as a substitute limited partner successor in interest or assignee”   while the defendants argue that the language is ambiguous as to which interest the transferee wished to succeed i am persuaded to read these forms as requesting admission as a substitute limited partner first and then only if that request was refused for admission as successor in interest or assignee   this reading is supported at least in the case of atc iii by the registration confirmation form produced from ml funds filesi also conclude that it is appropriate to give a broad reading to the nasd forms so as to give them the fullest effect permissible in the circumstances and thus to accomplish the purpose underlying their adoption by the nasd and approval by the sec of course the nasd rulemaking did not and could not change the substantive operation under delaware law of the partnership agreements   for example the nasd forms do not dispense with the need to obtain the consent of the general partners   however those forms were adopted specifically to facilitate and make uniform the process by which partnership units are transferred and requests for admission as either a substitute limited partner or assignee are made   it is inconsistent with that purpose to read the nasd forms narrowly as suggested by defendants   therefore even without regard to the one registration confirmation form produced by ml fund i find that the transfer application forms adequately express both the transferors and everests request that everest be admitted as a substitute limited partnermonterey investments inc v healthcare properties lp delch ca no  steele vc  wl  june   is not inconsistent with this conclusion   in monterey vice chancellor steele was asked to consider whether or not the language of a partnership agreement requiring the seller “to express clearly the sellerassignors intent to assign wholly or partially its precise partnership interest” was satisfied by a purchase agreement expressing “nothing more than the sellerassignors assignment of ‘certain rights to limited partnership interests ․ on the terms and conditions specified in these purchase documents’ ”  monterey at  the nasd forms at issue here expressly request everests admission as a substitute limited partner and thus differ critically from the purchase agreement form discussed in monterey   rather the nasd forms at issue here bear a strong resemblance to the “agreement of transfer” forms which vice chancellor steele held in that same case to satisfy the requirements of the partnership agreement that a request be made of the general partner  id at b ml fund consents to substitution as limited partnerthe partnership agreements define “consent” to include “prior written consent” or “the act of granting such consent as the context may require”   partnership agreements article two thus while the general partners must consent to the substitution of everest as a limited partner that consent may consist of a writing granting consent as was expressly required by the partnership agreement at issue in monterey or the act of authorizing the admission of everest as a substitute limited partner   unlike the situation in monterey therefore the partnership agreements at issue here do not require that the general partners evidence their consent in a writing there is of course no evidence that the general partners themselves ever even considered everests requests for admission as a substitute limited partner   rather it is clear from the record that ml fund alone considered those requests   the evidence also demonstrates that ml fund processed everests requests and consented to everests admission by the act of registering the transfers entering everests name in the partnership records as a limited partner of both partnerships and confirming to everest that the transfer it requested had been accomplished   i find that assuming ml fund was authorized to give consent to everests admission as a substitute limited partner these acts of ml fund plainly evidence that consent was given   thus the issue is whether ml fund was authorized to do so either expressly or impliedly  power to delegate section  of the defendant partnership agreements grant the general partners the exclusive discretion to manage and control the business of the partnership  partnership agreements § a there is no statutory provision regarding the delegation of authority by a general partner rather “the specific rights and responsibilities of parties in a general or limited partnership are determined by the parties particular partnership agreement”   katell at  citing  delc §§ a and c  see also monterey at  noting obligation to refer to terms of partnership agreement when determining legal status in limited partnership section  of the partnership agreements provides that each of the general partners has the power to delegate its authority including the power to do the following“delegate any or all of the powers rights and obligations under the partnership agreements and may appoint employ contract or otherwise deal with any person for the transaction of the business of the partnership which person may under supervision of the general partner perform any acts or services for the partnership as the general partner may approve”partnership agreements § h emphasis added the general partners therefore had the power to delegate the performance of any acts or services under the partnership agreements for which the general partner is responsible including the act of consenting to the admission of an assignee as a substitute limited partner ml funds authority to consent to everests admission there is no dispute that the general partners of the defendant partnerships delegated substantial responsibility for the transfer of limited partnership units to ml fund the defendants concede that ml fund is the transfer agent for the defendant partnerships and that ml fund is authorized to review and approve the paperwork before recording the transfer of partnership units   they concede ml fund is authorized to consent to the admission of transferees as assignees and further concede that ml fund maintains all communications with the limited partners concerning the transfer process   in sum defendants concede that ml fund is authorized to perform every function pertaining to the transfer of partnership units including the determination of whether the provisions of the partnership agreements have been satisfied except they argue ml fund is not authorized to consent to the admission of an assignee as a substitute limited partnerto support this argument the defendants rely principally on the testimony of neal a ludeke vice president and treasurer of the two general partners   at trial mr ludeke testified conclusorily that ml fund has “no role or authority” with respect to the admission of substitute limited partners  tr trans    defendants also rely although to be a less clear purpose on the deposition testimony of margaret a burke manager of the investor communications group of ml fund to the effect that i the ml fund records do not distinguish between limited partners and assignees burke depo  and ii ml fund never consults with the general partners when processing transfer requests  id at mr ludekes other testimony at trial undermines defendants litigation position by showing the general partners complete lack of information about or involvement in the transfer of partnership interests or the admission of assignees as substitute limited partners   at trial ludeke testified that he never sees the documentation relating to the transfer of partnership interests tr tran  since the closing on the sale of partnership units seven to nine years ago he has not “seen anything that would look like a schedule a” and cannot say if schedule a was amended since that time to reflect changes in the composition of the group of limited partners see tr tran  and  no request has ever been made to the general partners for the admission of anyone as a substitute limited partner  tr tran   and he does not know if anyone has ever made such a request of ml fund has ever inquired of ml fund about that subject and does not know if any other person from the general partners has made such inquiry  idmoreover in deposition neither representative of the general partners mr ludeke and ms gina scotti could say where schedule a was kept or who kept it   ms scotti said that schedule a was in the closing binders relating to the offering of the partnership units and was in mr ludekes possession   mr ludeke thought ms scotti had itconsidered as a whole the evidence shows convincingly that ml fund has routinely performed all of the functions associated with the transfer of partnership units including giving consent to the admission of both assignees and substitute limited partners   thus i reject as unsubstantiated defendants assertion that ml fund lacked authority and find that the general partners have delegated all transfer responsibilities to ml fund either expressly or impliedly by their complete failure otherwise to instruct ml fund or to establish procedures at the general partner level for the processing of requests for admission as a substitute limited partner   indeed the most likely conclusion to be drawn from the evidence presented is that the general partners simply paid no attention at any time to any transfer or any request for admission as a substitute limited partner leaving those matters entirely to ml fund this is hardly surprising in the circumstances   until everest wrote in july  requesting a copy of the partnerships lists the general partners had never had any reason to distinguish between assignees and substitute limited partners and in fact had made no such distinction everests insouciance is no defensedefendants rely on the testimony of david lesser executive vice president of everest in conjunction with the decision in monterey to argue that everests own insouciant or inattentive behavior precludes it from relying on the action taken by ml fund to establish everests status as a limited partner   defendants point to mr lessers testimony that he was aware of the distinction between an assignee holder and a substitute limited partner and that under certain partnership agreements assignees are limited to economic rights  tr tran  further defendants cite mr lessers testimony that despite his awareness of this distinction he never reviewed the defendant partnership agreements to ascertain the requirements for becoming a substitute limited partner  tr tran  defendants then draw a comparison between everests behavior and the courts finding in monterey that it was wholly unreasonable for the plaintiffs there to rely upon the confirmation forms which did not specifically reference their admission as a substitute limited partner to determine their legal status in the limited partnership   see monterey at  here ml fund had the actual authority to consent to everests request for admission as a substitute limited partner   thus the issue of the reasonableness of everests reliance is irrelevant as everest does not rely on the theory of equitable estoppel discussed in monterey   i also note that the transfer forms at issue in monterey were not the nasdmandated forms at issue here   as previously discussed the nasd forms were developed and authorized by the sec specifically for the purpose of facilitating the transfer of partnership interests between buyers and sellers   the natural import of this is that parties using the nasd forms unless they are otherwise specifically advised or the partnership agreement is to the contrary should be entitled to rely on them as sufficient to accomplish the transfer therein requested  ultimately i conclude that the central premise of defendants position must fail   the evidence considered as a whole does not support defendants attempt to maintain at once that ml fund was authorized to consent and in this case did consent to the admission of everest as an assignee but was not authorized to consent to its admission as a substitute limited partner   it could be that ml fund was expressly authorized to do neither one nor the other   nevertheless the evidence convincingly shows that ml fund has routinely done both and i conclude that it was authorized to do so expressly or impliedly by the general partnersiv conclusionfor all the foregoing reasons i conclude that everest is a substitute limited partner of the defendant partnerships and as such is entitled to the entry of an order requiring that the defendant partnerships furnish it with the current lists of their limited partners derived from the ml fund databasesit is so orderedfootnotes   as noted defendants concede everests admission as an assignee there is also no dispute that the transfer application executed by everest i gave its power of attorney for it to become a signatory to the partnership agreements and related documentation and ii expressed its agreement to accept and be bound by the terms of those agreements   while a written services contract between ml fund and the partnerships apparently does exist neither plaintiff nor defendants sought to introduce it into evidence   at the posttrial argument however counsel for the defendant partnerships stated that the services contract did not contain a provision addressing the disputed issues in this casewhile not all inclusive the partnership agreements do specify some of the services which ml fund provides including the following   preparation and dissemination of the partnerships financial statements   coordination of tax returns and the distribution of tax information to the limited partners   preparation of the quarterly and annual reports of the partnerships provided by the general partners and others  and  maintenance of communications in coordination with the general partners with limited partners   in coordination with the distribution of mailings ml fund provides the names and addresses reflecting the holders of partnership interests on a specific date   at her deposition gina scotti corporate secretary of the general partners stated that schedule a if they had it would probably be located in a closing binder   according to ms scotti for each investor closing a closing binder would be created and a schedule a would be attached to the partnership agreement located in the closing binder   ms scotti further testified that neal ludeke is the person who retained the closing binders   the chicago partnership board is a broker dealer providing matching services for limited partnerships   the board essentially acts as a clearing house matching individuals seeking to sell limited partnership units with individuals seeking to purchase limited partnership units   in this regard the board acts as an intermediary as well as an attorneyinfact for the buyer and seller and facilitates the paperwork necessary to complete the transfer of partnership units   because the units in the defendant partnerships are not intended to be publicly traded in order to protect important tax advantages the partnership agreements require transferors to effect transfers of their units only through broker dealers whose procedures the general partner has determined are not incident to a public trading market   the board provides such a matching service   the purchase agreement contained language indicating the sellers desire to sell and assign to the transferee “all of the sellers right title and interests” and also that it become “effective as of the date the transferee becomes a substitute limited partner on the books and records of the partnership”   this provides some evidence of the transferors desire that everest succeed to all of the transferors interest in the defendant partnerships as of the date of the transfer of the partnership units   the transferors sellers application for transfer which the chicago partnership board forwarded to ml fund provided as followsthe transferor hereby makes application to transfer and assign subject to the general partners rights to the transferee all rights and interests as set forth in the partnership below and for the transferee to succeed to such interest as a substitute limited partner successor in interest or assigneeplaintiffs trial exhs  and    similarly the transferees buyers application for transfer provides as followsthe transferee hereby makes application to accept subject to the general partners rights from the transferor all rights and interests as set forth in the partnership below and intends to succeed the transferor as a substitute limited partner or assignee and agrees to accept all the terms and conditions of the partnership agreement and related documentsplaintiffs trial exhs  and    the registration confirmation form provides in full as followsyour transfer request has been processed   the effectiveadmission date as a limited partner in the partnership is indicated below   information pertaining to your account has been entered pursuant to the partnership agreement on the partnerships records as shown   this documentation informs you of your registration in the partnership and should be retained with your permanent recordsplaintiffs trial exh    at her deposition the ml fund representative also stated that she was not sure if the specific forms used in this case were supplied by ml fund   however she did state that the documents were nasd documents that they mirrored those ml fund uses in connection with the transfer of partnership units and that they met the requirements ml fund has established for the purpose of transferring units of the defendant partnership   the corresponding form relative to the atc ii transfer request was not produced by ml fund instead ml fund produced another registration confirmation form wholly unrelated to either everest or the defendant partnerships   i do not attribute any significance to the absence of the second registration confirmation form   in the demand letter everest stated that its purpose in requesting the list of names and addresses of unit holders as well as the number of units held by each was to assist everest in increasing its ownership of units in the partnership by enabling them to make tender offers to unit holders to purchase their units   in its response to everests request for the list of names and addresses of the limited partners the defendant partnerships requested that everest provide among other information the following   the number of units owned by everest and the dates they were purchased   the basis for its belief that everests proposed offer to purchase units is a proper ground under applicable law to receive the requested information  and  compliance of the proposed offer with article seven of the defendant partnership agreements   plaintiff appears to have abandoned its argument based on equitable estoppel   see pls posttrial reply brief at    section  of the partnership agreements parallels section  of drulpa which vests general partners of limited partnerships with the sole authority to manage the partnership affairs   delc § a  katell v morgan stanley group inc delch ca no  chandler vc  wl  june   mem op at    defendants claim that no request for admission has ever been made to the general partners as opposed to ml fund for admission as a substitute limited partner is not meaningful in the context   this court has found that the nasd approved and mandated forms submitted to ml fund in this matter and presumably in other instances contain a request for admission as a substitute limited partner   delivery of ml fund the agent is all that was required   in accordance with established practice those requests were processed and approved by ml fund everests name was entered in the records as a partner and the transfer was confirmed to everest   he fact that these steps were all taken pursuant to delegated power rather than by the general partners themselves is insignificantlamb vice chancellor findlaw career center attorney corporate counsel academic judicial clerk summer associate intern law librarian paralegal legal
