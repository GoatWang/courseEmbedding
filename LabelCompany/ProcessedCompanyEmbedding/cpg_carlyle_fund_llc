this week as the private equity firm seeks other ways to gain more traction with socalled liquid alternative funds developing mutual funds has historically been challenging for private equity firms because the average buyout fund is illiquid with a typical life span of  years but as these firms diversified into relatively more liquid alternative assets such as credit and hedge funds they have

the macro trend of traditional pensions in the form of defined benefit plans giving way to defined contribution plans such as ks may fuel interest in other asset classes outside stocks and bonds he said but he has said it will take time to become a major force “all of the legal issues haven’t been resolved … but inevitably there will be a desire by people who have iras ks and other kind of vehicles to participate in private equity” rubenstein said recently “it’s probably a generational thing before you see a big impact on numbers for firms like ours” photo courtesy of shutterstock
