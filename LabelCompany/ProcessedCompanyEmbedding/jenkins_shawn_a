please refer to our annual report on form k and other sec filings during the course of todays call we will also refer to certain nongaap financial measures you can find important disclosures about those measures in our press release with that let me turn the call over to shawn shawn jenkins thanks mike good afternoon everyone and thank you all for joining us today benefitfocus delivered strong first quarter result with both revenue and profitability outperforming our targets consolidated nongaap gross margin increased approximately  basis points and adjusted ebitda margin improved by over  basis points both compared to the first quarter of  we are proud of our execution during the quarter and remain on track to become free cash flow positive by the fourth quarter of this year for the quarter total revenue increased  yearoveryear to  million and the strength of our customer relationships is reflected in our revenue retention rate that once again exceeded  also during the quarter our employer segment revenue increased  over the prior year as our installed base of large employer customers increased to  the growth in our employer business reflects continued momentum within enterprise accounts the positive impact from our expanded enterprise and strategic account teams strong traction from our expanded portfolio of products with both new and existing customers and steady advancement of our partner ecosystem i am pleased with our performance in the first quarter as the operational leverage in our model is becoming readily apparent with the  selling season kicking off it remains to early to provide specific details on new order activity levels in q yet we are confident that benefitfocus is well positioned to benefit from a number of important market dynamics that we believe are poised to intensify over the coming quarters and years a key trend is the secular shift of core operational activities to the cloud one of the many benefits of the move to the cloud is flexibility and within benefits administration this has enabled hr departments to better engage employees and offer a more personalized benefits experience these improvements are allowing employees to utilize a broad and growing number of services to best serve their familys needs including consumer directed healthcare high deductible health plan health savings account and a wide variety of voluntary benefits our flexible and scalable platform is an important way employers can facilitate this shift as our easytouse tools inform users of their options while simultaneously generating accelerated speedto value and significant longterm roi to our customers another market dynamic is the complexity of the benefits market including regulatory factors and the accelerating evolution of consumer directed offerings together the shift of personalized benefits regulatory change and employers desire to bend the healthcare cost curve add additional strain on outdated legacy systems and highlight the tremendous value of the benefitfocus platform specifically our cloudbased software platform which is written as a single code base and releases new functionality four times a year best positions our customers to more rapidly and cost effectively adapt to these periods of significant market and regulatory change let me briefly share some thoughts with you on the status of the regulatory environment as many of you are aware congress continues to push back and forth on the aca repeal and replace reconciliation bill while the successful completion of a repeal and replace will have numerous derivative impacts in implementations on other legislation such as broader tax reform and cost sharing subsidies the process remains fluid as the parties work to finalize this chapter of healthcare reform importantly benefitfocus remains very well positioned regardless of the legislative outcome from washington from a company specific perspective we are establishing ourselves as the market standard and our expanded sales force is positively impacting the flywheel which not only drive topline revenue growth but increased operational leverage from an industry perspective the previously mentioned trends of the move to the cloud and consumer personalization are not only the most significant drivers of demand in this industry but also helped elevate and exemplify our unique value to endusers however in the nearterm the uncertainty lingering around the timing of regulatory change leads us to reiterate the market outlook we provided two months ago during our q call we continue to approach this years selling season with cautious optimism as the regulatory uncertainty could impact the timing of customers inevitable move to the cloud for benefits administration during the quarter we made significant progress on three strategic priorities that we highlighted at the start of  the first priority is to grow the business during the first quarter our new sales executives continued to ramp as planned within our employer segment our multitiered sales model demonstrated impressive progress and is enabling our sales executives to address our diverse employer market and execute on our land and expand strategy you may recall our employer segment includes our enterprise accounts which focused on employers with over  employees strategic accounts which sell to employers with between  and  employees and our back to base team which sells to our growing installed base of employer customers let me provide some additional color on our teams performance in the quarter our enterprise teams momentum continues to grow highlighting both our momentum and opportunity we closed an impressive win in q with a large multinational aerospace and defense corporation that selected benefitfocus marketplace the benefitsstore our benefit service center and core analytics with over  employees this highly acquisitive enterprise needed a flexible cloudbased platform to retire their heavily customized legacy onprem application this industry leaders selection of benefitfocus reflects our ability to streamline administration improve efficiencies integrate with saps employee central and improve communication to a diverse workforce during q our strategic account team also logged impressive wins including a luxury clothing and lifestyle corporation who selected benefitfocus marketplace our benefitstore and aca management  reporting this strategic account with over  employees selected benefitfocus to drive participation in their new high deductible and hsa offerings to deliver a consolidated and coherent voluntary benefits experience to enhance user experience for both their fulltime and parttime employees and to improve data quality and data integrations as our strategic sales team ramps in line with our expectations we are optimistic the velocity of this segment will accelerate as these new sales team members build tenure as i mentioned earlier the traction of our expanded portfolio of products continues to be strong and fueled impressive attach rates from new customer bookings and growth in back to base transactions during the first quarter in our carrier segment we experienced good renewal and upsell activity in the quarter with  of the top  carriers on our platform we are focused on crossselling solutions into our underpenetrated installed base and with the assistance of our market adoption team help our existing carriers expand the size of their membership on our platform during q we demonstrated progress in each of these initiatives and experienced specific strength in developing new expansion opportunities through the use of proprietary tools that show existing customers further cost savings by leveraging our broad suite of products the second of our  priorities is to continue to improve profitability and achieve positive free cash flow by the fourth quarter of this year as previously stated during q we posted impressive margin expansion once again as our team did a phenomenal job of operational execution in capturing the benefits of our growing scale our results reflect our ability to leverage the significant investments we have already made in our products technology and distribution that together position benefitfocus to drive longterm value to our shareholders from both topline growth and profit expansion as we continue to demonstrate operational scale we remain confident in our ability in  to deliver  to  basis points of consolidated gross margin improvement and greater acceleration of adjusted ebitda while simultaneously allocating ample resources to support our longterm topline growth and ongoing investments in sales marketing and product development the third priority is to drive continuous solution innovation and efficiencies across our worldclass platform and products our engineering team is focused on driving innovation within the massive  trillion benefits industry this results in a systematic increase in products that not only enables benefitfocus to capture more wallet and mine share but also drives a steady increase in our addressable market last month at our annual one place user conference we unveiled a number of new enhancements to our bestinclass platform and announced a suite of new products which both enrich the comprehensiveness of our offering and further expand our employer pepm opportunity to now nearly  this is a meaningful and impressive increased from the approximate  total employer pepm opportunity we had at our ipo just a few years ago some of the specific announcements included new advanced reporting functionality for both our carrier and employer customers which improves visibility as well as confirm the quality and data accuracy of files consolidated billing to manage invoice reconciliation on our platform which serves as our customers enrollment system of record and to simplify complexity and cultivate data for strategic insights we also announced the release of benefitfocus business intelligence which is a portfolio of software and software enabled services that will help our customers drive optimal outcomes speaking of optimal outcomes this week and next week we are hosting our open enrollment success even which brings together our technology solutions and customer success organizations to prepare for this years upcoming open enrollment not only are these groups collaborating on how to ensure this open enrollment is our best enrollment yet but its also on additional ways we can further extend our competitive advantage finally i would like to provide an update on our cfo search since launching our search for jeffs replacement after q earnings call we have met with a number of very talented individuals and i am confident that our focus on this search will yield positive results starting next month our president ray august will serve as our interim cfo and lead our experienced and talented finance organization during this period of transition as many of you know ray has a strong operational and accounting background and is a member of the american institute of certified public accountants before i turn the call over i want to thank all of the benefitfocus associates this great start of the year would not have been possible without all of your hard work and dedication thank you all for all you do to make benefitfocus such a great company with that i will hand it over to jeff jeff take it away jeff laborde thank you shawn we are pleased with our results this quarter which exceeded our revenue and profitability targets i will begin by reviewing the details of our financial performance for q and then i will pass the call over to ray to provide our guidance for q and fiscal  total revenue for the first quarter was  million an increase of  compared to the first quarter of  this result exceeded our guidance and reflects contribution from the sales of products to both new and existing customers and high revenue retention as well as the completion of certain professional services projects ahead of schedule employer revenue for the quarter was  million up  compared to the year ago period and as discussed last quarter reflects the favorable impact of the shift of revenue from our aca reporting product into q this year from q of last year carrier revenue of  million was up  compared to the same period last year the sequential decline in carrier revenue reflects the accelerated revenue recognition from a professional services contract that benefited q as we discussed in prior quarter total software subscription revenue was  million representing  of total revenue and grew  yearoveryear employer software subscription revenue was  million and grew  yearoveryear total professional services revenue was  million representing  of total revenue and an increase of  over q  as previously mentioned professional services revenue benefited from the completion of certain projects ahead of schedule resulting in modestly higher revenue recognized from professional services in the quarter versus our original expectations nongaap gross profit totaled  million or  nongaap gross margin which compares favorably to the  nongaap gross margin in q of  and the  nongaap gross margin in the prior quarter the nearly  basis point improvement over last year and over  basis points sequential improvement reflects the many operational benefits of our increasing revenue scale ongoing progress in our infrastructure optimization efforts and continued cost management nongaap software gross margin of  was down from  in the year ago period and largely reflects an increase in thirdparty service expenses for subsegment of rha product customers sequentially nongaap software gross margin improved by over  basis points the sequential decline in professional services gross margin resulted from the quarteroverquarter decline in services revenue which reflects the impact of typical seasonality and as mentioned last quarter the accelerated revenue recognition of a large services contract in q last year in addition to our strong revenue gross margin performances i am also pleased with the companys yearoveryear and sequential improvements in adjusted ebitda result q adjusted ebitda of  million was  million ahead of our guidance and at  of revenue reflects continued improvement from  of revenue in the prior quarter and a negative  of revenue in q  aside from sales and marketing operating expenses declined as a percentage of revenue which demonstrates our increasing operational scale we are pleased with our ability to invest for growth will simultaneously driving adjusted ebitda expansion nongaap net loss per share was negative  based on  million weighted average shares outstanding and was at the highend of our guidance for loss of negative  to a negative  per share and the year ago period loss of negative  per share gaap results for the quarter included gross profit  million representing a margin of  and an operating loss of negative  million translating into a net loss per share of negative  moving to the balance sheet we ended q with cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of  million total deferred revenue declined  million sequentially to  million the decline in deferred revenue reflects the recognition of revenue from our aca products in the quarter seasonality and our deemphasis of certain lower margin carrier professional services engagements on the statement of cash flows cash used in operations totaled  million for the quarter and compares favorably to the  million used in operations during the same year ago period the first quarter remains our seasonally heaviest cash outflow quarter as shawn previously highlighted with the benefit of our topline growth and our improving margin profile benefitfocus remains on track to become free cash flow positive by the fourth quarter of this year with that i would like to pass the call over to ray ray august thank you jeff i would also like to congratulate the team for the strong performance in the quarter as i highlighted last month at our one place analyst briefing operationally we are focused on automating manual processes ensuring data accuracy and visibility leveraging data standards and investing in training tools to enhance the skills of our associates our commitment to these areas not only delivers ongoing product and service enhancements for our customers that deepens our competitive differentiation and drives topline growth but also generates efficiencies within our organization and improves our profitability with the investments in our platform and products continuing to drive efficiencies and as our scale improves we remain confident in our ability to achieve  to  basis points of total gross margin improvement in  our consistent profitability and cash flow improvement over the last year enabled us again to opportunistically negotiate more favorable terms on our revolving loan facility recall that in late october  we amended and extended our agreement to expand the size of our aggregate loan amount from  million to  million the details of the new amendment will be filed in conjunction with our q tomorrow now turning to our outlook for the second quarter of this year we are targeting revenue of  million to  million while our first half revenue expectations remain unchanged as mentioned on our prior quarters earnings call q revenue will be impacted in the yearoveryear comparison by the shift of aca product revenue out of q into q additionally as jeff mentioned earlier q professional services revenue benefited from the completion of several professional service projects ahead of schedule which resulted in the shift of revenue out of q and into q from a profitability perspective we expect adjusted ebitda of  million to  million a nongaap net loss of negative  million to negative  million and a nongaap net loss per share of negative  to a negative  based on  million weighted average shares outstanding for the full year we are reiterating our existing  outlook this includes total revenue in the range of  million to  million we expect adjusted ebitda of  million to  million a nongaap net loss of minus  million to minus  million and a nongaap net loss per share of minus  to minus  based on  million weightedaverage shares outstanding additionally we continue to expect free cash flow which we define as cash provided by or used in operations less capital expenditures to be positive by the fourth quarter of  in summary q was a great start to the year while we are approaching this years selling season with cautious optimism to reflect the impacts of ongoing revenue regulatory uncertainty we remain tremendously excited about the massive longterm opportunity in front of us with that we are now ready to take your questions operator please begin the questionandanswer session at this time questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from nandan amladi of deutsche bank please proceed with your question nandan amladi hi good afternoon thanks for taking my question so you mentioned a couple of times that in the script that you are viewing of this years enrollment fees for new customer with cautious optimism because of regulatory changes how much of a driver is regulatory change versus just automating what has thus far been a fairly manual benefits process shawn jenkins sure great question thanks nandan first of all we are obviously really proud of our sales team and the first quarters great execution really top to bottom is a refresher for everybody on the call our benefitfocus has now our largest sales team in the companys history and the activity levels are really terrific as we engage with a large employers the primary motivation of them moving from their legacy onpremise or of outsourcing arrangements moving to the cloud to gain the efficiencies of cloudbased infrastructure the softwareasaservice delivery model we deliver at the benefitfocus platform in one code base four software releases each year has been the main macro theme here very much of a tailwind and as you mentioned there are still a lot of paper in the benefits industry and islands of information and with the benefitfocus platform we improve that dramatically and thats whats really propelled our growth and will continue to into the future as we look at this particular selling season which we are entering right now where employers make their decisions about their benefits for the upcoming open enrollment season which start in october november of this year for a january   effective date the employer looks at the totality of their benefits spend they look at the programs they are offering and we are very optimistic that the tailwinds in the macro themes are in the favor moving to the cloud moving to the benefitfocus platform but when you have this much back and forth in washington it does get the attention obviously of employers as they make their plans for the year so we are as we mentioned cautiously optimistic for the selling season i think the nice thing is regardless of how the adjustments to the affordable care act end up coming whether there is repeal and replace or whether there are incremental changes all of that really proves to why an employer needs the modern cloud infrastructure to communicate these benefits to employees to be able to keep up with the regulatory environment to be able to adapt to the economic changes that are happening with the way employers are funding benefits so if anything its sort of a period that we have seen before in prior washington back and forth on healthcare but we are really proud of the large sales team that we have in the field and the high activity levels that we are having and because we are just now starting that selling season thats why we are using the idea of cautious optimism at this point nandan amladi fair enough and a quick followup on the sales organization you have made some changes last year that moving people to the national accounts team and so on you just mentioned that you now have the largest team in your history what is the growth trajectory you expect to see for the remainder of the year on the sales capacity shawn jenkins yes a good followup so just for reference we now have three employer sales teams at benefitfocus what we refer to as enterprise which sells to employers who have  or more employees that team is fully staffed our strategic accounts team which sells to  to  employees and they are at levels that we wanted them to be at the beginning of the year and they are ramping as planned a lot of great new folks in there i am really proud of our management team and the recruiting team and really the talent that we have been able to bring on to our sales team is incredibly impressive and then we have a back to base team which sells into our installed customer base which has obviously gotten quite large now with  large employers so those three teams are at the size we want them to be at this point in the year they are ramping as planned we will do a little bit of incremental adding throughout the year just opportunistically as we go but we have got the size of the team in place that we wanted to nandan amladi thank you shawn jenkins thank you operator our next question comes from brian peterson of raymond james please proceed with your question brian peterson yes thanks guys and congrats on the upside this quarter so you referenced some new carrier products last year and you mentioned on the call this quarter shawn where are some of those new wins going to start to hit the pl as we think about  and into  shawn jenkins yes great question well one of the major new products that we rolled out in the second half of  was our certified carrier partner program and we did announce our first certified carrier win in the fourth quarter that implementation will take better part of this year so that will begin to contribute in the second half of  we also did some significant updates to our data exchange the exchange of product for carriers and we see some really good traction both in late  and in our pipeline for   where this phenomenon where employers are getting more and more payroll files and disparate information from brokers and they need help collecting that and organizing that and getting it into their membership systems we had several of those wins on the last couple of quarters and those are beginning to actually contribute now and they will through the balance of the year so a lot of exciting things happening in the carrier business and really liking what we are seeing both in the pipeline but also in the customer relationships brian peterson got it and then maybe just sticking on the same theme but in the employer side a lot of the newer products there which ones have really been driving the accretive nature to pepm and anything that you can say on overall deal sizes in that segment thanks shawn jenkins yes well deal sizes continue to grow and really meaningfully of the last two years our size of employer has grown and the attach rate of our products continues to expand so directionally both of those are in our favor as we mentioned on the prepared remarks we now have approximately  pepm as a tam in our employer business thats up from  just a few years ago at our ipo and we are really pleased to see really the broad adoption of products whether its the benefitstore which provides a wide variety of voluntary benefits to our employers our core and advanced analytics is extremely popular and at our one place conference just last month we introduced a new benefitfocus business intelligence and we have gotten great feedback from our customer base and prospective customers so far and one that i am particularly excited about is this notion of consolidated billing its a new product that we introduced at one place and if you think about what we have historically done at benefitfocus is communicating benefits for an employer enrolling employees signing them up getting all their information and getting that data to the right place now what we are beginning to do is handle the other side of that coin if you will where we will consolidate the bills for the employer show them a reconciled view of all the bills they have and then provide a mechanism for them to pay their insurance carriers it really is a terrific administrative service for the employer but we think it fits very nicely with our benefitsstore for example as employers offer more and more of wider array of benefits they need more help with all the reconciliation of those bills and we have built a terrific technology that takes manual processes and the handling of paper bills and really eliminate that so we are getting great feedback from our customers as early we just launched that new product but i think the last point i would make brian goes back to the size of the employer one of the reasons we see our benefitfocus winning in the larger and larger space the enterprise space is we really have now a tremendously wellrounded product offering in the field and these large employers expect that level of service and they are excited to be moving paperbased processes or traditional outsourcing models now to the cloud on the benefitfocus platform so each time we add those expand our tam i think we also become that much more attractive to the next large employer brian peterson understood thanks shawn shawn jenkins thank you operator our next question comes from john difucci of jefferies please proceed with your question howard mai hi this is howard ma on for john thanks for taking my question shawn so my question is on the health of the public data exchanges and how we could potentially impact both the carrier business and the employer business but i think something like  of  carriers withdraw from their public data exchanges so one of my initial interpretations of this is that it could actually be positive for the private exchange market and for benefitfocus as carriers might refocus more attention and resources on the private exchanges and it could also lead to more employers setting up private exchanges but i am curious on your perspective shawn jenkins yes great question very insightful too by the way howard just by the way of background at benefitfocus we are engaged in providing both insurance carriers large health plans life insurance companies and employers the worlds best we believe cloud platform to manage all the benefits communicate those benefits we have not provided the technology to the public exchanges whether at the federal or state level something we looked at years ago and just felt like it would have a lot of backandforth and we ended up being right about that and so we see this shift back to the private sector if you will as bullish for benefitfocus as you point out i would agree with your statement or your directional thesis what we proven here is that employers are very important the funding by employers the programs that they offer both health insurance but all of the other voluntary benefits that go with it and clearly whether its the state or federal government we now have a scenario where the private exchange whether people continue to use that term private exchange a lot or whether it just becomes more referred to as a marketplace for benefits i think those are going to become more and more popular more and more necessary they really are becoming the safety net if you will and if there are some changes to the way the public exchanges and the public subsidies as those are affected will stand out and it would be in some way thats going to put we believe more people into the private sector and it goes along with this is employment right so more people are employed employers are fighting for talent a lot of people that would of been on the public exchanges might have been underemployed or unemployed and so as people come back into the workforce they are going to be looking for a marketplace from their employer or perhaps their carrier or their broker and we think all of those things are good for the benefitfocus story in the next couple of years howard mai shawn thanks i eternally appreciate those insights and if i could sneak in another shawn jenkins sure howard mai you have carefully reallocated some of your salespeople to focus on the larger employers with  or more employees in your discussions with some of these new you call them the enterprise sales force i am just curious if you have seen any unexpected insights as we know many of these large employers i imagine almost all of them use onprem suite and those suite really vary in terms the robustness and benefits administration so could you comment i guess on number one the competitive dynamics are you finding that you might need to give some volume discounts to compete with not even compete but just to get in the door and to complement an existing suite and just any other i guess sales cycle or anything that you said you are differences versus the  for  range shawn jenkins sure well in the plus range which we now refer to as enterprise we did really create a dedicated team over a year ago mainly because we saw this phenomenon where larger and larger employers were coming to benefitfocus and benefitfocus become a public company back in  it took a couple of years for larger enterprises to really learn who the company was our brand recognition is growing every day and so we began to get in more and more conversations with larger and larger employers also as we built out our product suite with consolidated billing the benefitstore service center analytics we really now have the broad cloud platform that these large employers are looking for and they are seeing the move to the cloud in other areas of their business of being very successful right they are seeing the savings they are seeing their employees engage with other areas of their business whether its finance or expense management or crm or whatnot and benefits needs to move there too for all the reasons that we are discussing today from a competitive standpoint we certainly dont see any pricing pressures there is not really new entrance particularly as you go upmarket large employers they want to work with a large company they want to see big research and development they want to see a large customer community thats growing its vibrant and if anything historically they have been paying for a lot of manual processes a lot of paper to be handled a lot of phones to be answered and so we are able to offer selfservice mobile capability a much better experience i mean by far than the traditional ways either onprem or outsourcing model and we can do that with leverage and you can see that leverage showing up in our model so we are very optimistic about really the strategic accounts but also the enterprise space and we think each new large employer that we add makes the ecosystem that much more attractive and the investment in rd gets the leverage that much more so really excited about that trend howard mai okay thats great to hear thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from ross macmillan of rbc capital markets please proceed with your question robert simmons hi this is robert simmons on for ross i was wondering if you could update us on the deferred revenue runoff dynamics for this year and next jeff laborde sure robert its jeff we have the broader longterm trend at work or at play going back over two years now where particularly on our the carrier side of our business and the nature of our accounting and revenue recognition dynamics for the professional services work that we do in that business that area of the business we were heavily engaged at the time in a lot of work customization work in particular very large projects or multiyear that gave rise to a significant amount of that deferred revenue that has since then continued to particularly as we have stopped signing up for really a lot of those new projects and focused instead on productizing that kind of work that kind of work has declined in volume pretty significantly and so what you have seen is that balance continue to decline pretty consistently with some offsets from timetotime as you would expect on new professional services projects that are ordinary course but also on our software revenue we do not have in terms as a point of comparison with other saas software businesses historically that as a leading metric for us our new order activity primarily because in the past we often did a lot of monthly invoicing contracts as opposed to annually contracts that is something we are changing to come more in line with the industry norm and so in particular as that service deferred services revenue starts to bottom out and you see that bleed off and we do get more of our newer contracts that we sign on to an annual upfront payment we would expect not in the next couple of quarters in the coming years to see that become a more relevant metric that also will start to grow again with the business robert simmons great can you quantify how big a runoff you are expecting this year and for next year and maybe do you have an idea of the timing of when it might turn around jeff laborde no i dont think we have in the past provided guidance specifically on deferred i dont expect the trend that i alluded to to reverse within the next few quarters its probably something within the next couple of years that would revert robert simmons got it and do you expect the seasonality going forward be similar to what embedded guidance for this year or is there any changes you expect in terms of timing of revenue thats recognized jeff laborde we historically have had a fair amount of seasonality in the business driven by our selling season for many enterprise software businesses q is the strongest of new order activity period of the year for us its driven more in the second half of q and on into q as companies are leading into their end of the year open enrollment cycles that seasonality continues to stay intact from a new order standpoint one of the things that has diluted that a little bit are some of these larger enterprise accounts that do take more time to implement and as a result over time we do expect that that might start to flatten revenue out a little bit at least in terms of q q and q but i think we do expect q to continue to be one of our heaviest quarters in terms of new software revenue as those customers come live out of our selling season and into actual live deployment and the professional services that comes along with implementing those robert simmons okay great thanks shawn jenkins thank you operator our next question comes from jesse hulsing of goldman sachs please proceed with your question jesse hulsing thanks for taking my question shawn i wanted to dive a little bit into your mix of new orders when you look at strategic versus enterprises in the adds this quarter any shift towards the bigger accounts and when you look at the pipeline in the selling season should we expect you to sign a higher mix of larger accounts or do you expect things to be similar to last year just curious about that shawn jenkins yes well i think what we saw last year certainly in  as we really begin to sign these enterprise accounts  employees and more as we define it at greater volumes because the market was ready for that our brand was really getting recognized our broad portfolio of products and we had really allocated of our seasoned sales people to that segment of course in  second half we brought on a fair number of what we call freshman first year folks into the strategic account area their activity is great and they are in the field for their first selling season so i think it will look perhaps similar to last year where we continue to see very good activity on the enterprise side however we do have a bigger team in that strategic account so as we get into selling season clearly we will have a better handle on that but against a couple year trajectory of our deal size getting larger our average employer getting larger overall and multiproduct sales both of those things are still intact this year so we would think that most likely our average size is going to bigger this year than last year jesse hulsing yes its helpful and within that strategic segment how is the competitive landscape trending are you seeing more competitiveness as some of the suite vendors add functionality and i guess do a better job of addressing this market with cloud solutions shawn jenkins yes for me when an employer is wanting to add more benefits they want to have multiple health insurance plans they will need high deductible plans health savings account enrollment they need to communicate things like gap insurance voluntary programs where an employee pays out of their paycheck or maybe with a credit card and there is no erp vendor or payroll system or even the traditional outsourcer that is really addressing that broad selection of benefits even employers that have  employees or  employees they are expecting the rollout    different benefit types to an employee and the legacy systems regardless of whether they are onprem or delivered over the internet they dont have the breadth of ecosystem of those carriers the engineering team focused on that so if anything i think that we are picking up pace and we have great channel partners too that now are distributing the benefitfocus platform with their sales teams so we are not seeing new entrance particularly in the  plus space thats a big employer with big expectations and they certainly will be regardless of what happens with the affordable care act back and forth they are going to want to offer more consumer oriented benefits which requires a lot more communication a lot more variety and linkages between these different benefit types and thats just its a big market and i think we are starting to prove that jesse hulsing yes and the back to base team how is that initiative going and i guess as the mix when you look at new software bookings are you seeing the mix trending up from a contribution point of view from that base selling motion shawn jenkins yes so our back to base team we talked directly about the numbers last year when we brought it to market for the first time and we had five people in the back to base team its now larger than that coming into this year they had a great year in  they are off to a really good start in  so you will start to see those numbers show up later this year in the second half of the year we would think in the next couple years the base the customer base is largest it is now will be a more meaningful contributor to the subscription revenue and particularly as we roll out additional products which we have a really good habit of doing each year so we got more to sell with base is larger and the back to base team is getting larger so we are particularly excited about that and that just points to high retention rates better margin we attach more products better cash flow for us and happier customers that are getting more value out of the benefitfocus platform jesse hulsing got it thanks shawn i appreciate it shawn jenkins yes thank you operator our next question comes from frank sparacino of first analysis please proceed with your question frank sparacino hi guys shawn maybe for you just going back to some of the earlier comments on the enterprise side i was curious if you can give us an update on sort of the go live that have been completed and implementations scheduled maybe for the rest of  you had one very large employer north of  employees signed last year i think it was supposed to go live in the first half of this year but maybe just some thoughts around what that looks like shawn jenkins yes i would call it on plan so last year we really began to see these larger and larger accounts and the dynamic of these enterprise accounts particularly when they starting getting over   they go live in a cadence thats more aligned with their it infrastructure and whatnot and the ones that we signed last year we feel are moving at the pace we thought they would and on schedule if not maybe even a little ahead of schedule some of them are big and some of them wont go live until this summer but the implementation team is doing terrific and matter of fact we even mentioned in the prepared remarks that we had a couple of projects go live early in the first quarter and really proud of the work that our implementation and project teams are doing so we are in good shape there frank sparacino and maybe just one followup on the aca compliance side of things i think last year that was roughly a  million boost in the second quarter is the contribution similar this year and i dont know if you have seen any sort of the trail off as it relates to aca compliance just given the uncertainty and it has to do that people dont believe the employer mandate is going to get enforced at all so any thoughts there ray august yes hi this is ray last year we saw the  million in q in aca revenue and as w said in the prepared remarks we have now recognized that in q and it is a similar amount and we are taking that amount ratably through the rest of the year as well so we are continuing to see demand around aca and we expect it to continue shawn jenkins yes and i would add too just a little more color on what employers are thinking we havent seen any trail off of people saying i dont think i need to do this they are pretty clear even with the degree from of pundits in washington regardless of what happens on a repeal or replace situation its pretty clear that you have got the current back pattern at least for several years even if they do make some changes probably   at the earliest before they would start pulling at some of those things the employers believe that for the next several years they are going to need to do the irs reporting at a minimum and its showing up in what ray said ray august yes we are actually already working on the  aca customer jeff laborde and to add in from a modeling perspective is because it is a bit of a quirk with the shift from last year the timing from yeartoyear on a more normalized basis so sequentially the subscription software excluding the lumpsum aca amounts would have been up modestly in q and embedded in the q guidance are you will have your software revenue growth accelerates from q we believe on a normalized basis not aca basis if that helps frank sparacino it does thank you guys shawn jenkins thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from steve wardell of chardan please proceed with your question steve wardell hi guys thanks for taking my question you had mentioned previously that you are seeing a little bit of an hr contracting pause can you tell us more about this i know you are going into the selling season now do you think thats continuing how do you think it will play out in terms of whats happening in congress can you give us some more color on that shawn jenkins sure on the last call our prior call we mentioned that in the fourth quarter we saw with the election and all that and uncertainties that was going at hr department in general i think many other companies talked about this and benefits saw a little bit of pause clearly we got off to good start in the first quarter here at benefitfocus and we talked about in the prepared remarks and a few other comments here that we are just starting the selling season here our employers tend to look at their benefits package of now april may june july make their decisions and then get prepared for open enrollment which they tend to do in november timeframe so its too early to really tell if that pause will continue we have really put together a great sales team though our largest sales team our activity levels are very strong and we will just need to get into the selling season a bit further to see how employers interpret the aca changes that might be coming their way regardless the macro themes the tailwinds that we see moving to the cloud are very much intact and so we are just using the term cautious optimism steve wardell great thanks and when you look at existing customers of benefitfocus what are the products for the   year that they maybe looking to add what sense do you get from talking to customers about the popular products that they may want to add to their suite of products shawn jenkins sure its good distinction actually because in our existing customer activity we dont really see any pause we see a lot of enthusiasm for the new products that we rolled out at one place as well as the things like our benefitstore that we have had for the last couple of years so a lot of enthusiasm around introducing voluntary benefits through the benefitstore our analytics and our new business intelligence capability the benefitfocus business intelligence suite we are hearing a lot of good things about our new consolidated billing offering where we will take all the bills on behalf of the employer and consolidate them reconcile them to their payroll and help them pay their carriers efficiently so this idea of a wide array of benefits a more flexible benefits offering to the employees and then the administrative capability to get the data the insight and then make all that efficient and accurate really is the theme so the customer community is extremely vibrant and active and our sales there looks really strong steve wardell great thank you shawn jenkins thank you operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the questionandanswer session i would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks shawn jenkins great well this is shawn thanks everyone for joining the call tonight and one more shout out to the benefitfocus team you guys are tremendous to work with and all of our great customers we appreciate

entrepreneurship people products and process may   shawn jenkins a friend of mine was the ceo of a very successful software company for a number of years one day he shared with me his framework for managing the company it was simple people products and process he said he focused his time on those three areas   people my friend told how he met with all of the recruiters and always was available to take any call on nights and weekends he would do calls with prospective people building the team was the most important thing he said   products developing new products or buying companies that had quality products took up the second slot of his time this one sounds as obvious as the first but we all have seen companies who lose their product focus developing existing products and strategically adding new products is critical to any companys success in software where disruption is a way of life product strategy is a fast paced part of everyones role   process it may surprise you to hear of a ceo who was interested in the mundane processes of a business yet that was his third focus area he loved to see data on the processes at work in the business he would analyze the data suggest process changes move people around and monitor some more over time the business became very profitable no doubt in part because of the process improvements led by my friend   when i get busy my mind tends to draw me back to the simple things often i find myself writing down these three words people product and process they remind me of the main areas of focus for managers at all levels perhaps they will
