construction of this firstofakind plant in lake charles louisiana is under way the ready for commissioning date is august  natref refineryedit sasol is also involved in conventional oil refinery the natref refinery was commissioned in sasolburg in  the refinery is a joint venture between sasol ltd and total south africa pty ltd sasol has a  percent interest in natref and total south africa a  percent shareholding the refining capacity of natref to  barrels per day natref is one of the only inland refineries in south africa it was designed to get the most out of crude oil and is equipped with stateoftheart technology the refinery uses the bottoms upgrading refining process using medium gravity crude oil and is capable of producing  more white product than coastal refineries that have to rely on heavy fuel oil some of the products produced from the refinery are diesel petrol jet fuel lpg illuminating paraffin bitumen and sulfur natref has been certified in terms of the iso  environmental management system historyedit the incorporation of sasoledit south africa has large deposits of coal which had low commercial value due to its high fly ash content it was thought that if this coal could be used to produce synthetic oil petrol and diesel fuel it would have significant benefit to south africa in the s south african scientists started looking at the possibility of using coal as a source of liquid fuels this work was pioneered by p n lategan working for the transvaal coal owners association he completed his doctoral thesis from the imperial college of science in london on the lowtemperature carbonisation of south african coal in  a white paper from the government was issued describing various oilfromcoal processes being used overseas and their potential for south africa in the s a young scientist named etienne rousseau obtained an msc from the university of stellenbosch his thesis was entitled the sulfur content of coals and oil shales rousseau became sasol’s first managing director after world war ii angovaal bought the rights to a method of using the fischertropsch process patented by m w kellogg limited and in  sasol was formally incorporated as a stateowned company as south african coal oil and gas corporation commissioning of the sasol  site for the production of synfuels started in  construction of the sasol  site was completed in  with the sasol  site coming on stream in  the zevenfontein farm house served as sasol’s first offices and is still in existence today coal miningedit to support the required economies of scale for coaltoliquids ctl process to be economical and competitive with crude oil all stages of the operations from coal mining to the fischertropsch process and product work up must be run with great efficiency due to the complexity of the lurgi gasifers used the quality of the coal was paramount the initial annual output from the sigma underground mine in sasolburg was  million tons annual coal production from this mine peaked in  at  million tons today the majority of the gasifers in sasolburg have been replaced with autothermal reformers that feed natural gas piped from mozambique natural gas generates approximately  –  less carbon dioxide for the same energy produced as coal and is thus significantly more environmentally friendly gastoliquids gtl technology converts natural gas predominately methane to liquid fuels today sasol mines more than  million tons mt of saleable coal a year mostly gasification feedstock for sasol synfuels in secunda sasol mining also exports some  mt of coal a year this amounts to approximately  of all the coal mined in south africa underground mining operations continue in the secunda area bosjesspruit brandspruit middelbult syferfontein and twistdraai collieries and sigma mooikraal colliery near sasolburg as some of these mines are nearing the end of their useful life a rbn mine replacement program has been undertaken the first of the new mines is the rbn thubelisha shaft which will eventually comprise an operation delivering more than eight million tons per annum mtpa of coal over  years the impumelelo mine which will replace the brandspruit operation is set for first production in  it will be ramped up to produce  mtpa and can later be upgraded to supplying some  mtpa this coal will be used exclusively by the sasol synfuels plant an underground extension of the middelbult mine is also on the cards with the main shaft and incline shaft being replaced by the shondoni shaft the first coal from the new complex is expected to be delivered in  the secunda collieries form the worlds largest underground coal operations in conjunction with the continuous improvement in the fischertropsch process and catalyst significant developments were also made in mining technology coal mining at sasol from the early days has been characterised by innovation sasol mining mainly utilises the room and pillar method of mining with a continuous miner sasol successfully used the longwall mining method from  to  today sasol is one of the leaders in coal mining technology and was the first to develop inseam drilling from surface using a directional drilling methodology this has been developed into an effective exploration tool working with fifth dimension sasol developed a virtual reality technology to help train continuous miner operators in a d environment in which various scenarios can be simulated including sound dust and other signs of movement this has recently been expanded to include shuttle car roofbolting and loadhaul dumper simulators fischer tropsch reactor technologyedit the initial reactors from kellogg and lurgi gasifiers were tricky and expensive to operate the original reactor design in  was a circulating fluidised bed reactor cfbr with a capacity of about  barrels per day sasol improved these reactors to eventually yield about  barrels per day the cfbr design involves moving the whole catalyst bed around the reactor which is energy intensive and not efficient as most of the catalyst is not in the reaction zone sasol then developed fixed fluidized bed ffb reactors in which the catalyst particles were held in a fixed reaction zone this resulted in a significant increase in reactor capacities for example the first ffb reactors commercialised in   m diameter had a capacity of about  barrels per day while the design in  m diameter had a capacity of  barrels per day further advancements in reactor engineering have resulted on the development and commercialisation of sasol slurry phase distillate sspd reactors which are the corner stone of sasol’s first of a kind gtl plant in qatar from fuels to chemicalsedit the fuel price is directly linked to the oil price and is thus subject to potentially large fluctuations with sasol only producing fuels this meant that its profitability was largely governed by external macroeconomic forces that it had no control over how could sasol be less susceptible to the oil price the answer was right in front of them in the treasure chest of chemicals coproduced in the fischertropsch process chemicals have a higher value per ton of product than fuels in the s ammonia styrene and butadiene became the first chemical intermediates sold by sasol the ammonia was then used to make fertilizers by  sasol was a major player in the nitrogenous fertilizer market this product range was further extended in the s to include both phosphate and potassiumbased fertilizers today sasol sells an extensive range of fertilizers and explosives to local and international markets and is a world leader in its lowdensity ammonium nitrate technology with the extraction of chemicals from its fischertropsch product slate coupled with downstream functionalization and on purpose chemical production facilities sasol moved from being just a south african fuels company to become an international integrated energy and chemicals company with over  chemical products being sold worldwide some of the main products produced are diesel petrol gasoline naphtha kerosene jet fuel liquid petroleum gas lpg olefins alcohols polymers solvents surfactants detergent alcohols and oil field chemicals comonomers ammonia methanol various phenolics sulphur illuminating paraffin bitumen acrylates and fuel oil these products are used in the production process of numerous everyday products made worldwide and benefit the lives of millions of people around the world they include hotmelt adhesives car products microchip coatings printing ink household and industrial paints mobile phones circuit boards transport fuels compact discs medical lasers sun creams perfumes and plastic bottles in south africa the chemical businesses are integrated in the fischertropsch value chain outside south africa the company operates chemical businesses based on backward integration into feedstock andor competitive market positions for example in europe asia and the usa social investments and sponsorshipedit sasol devotes most of its sponsorship investment in south africa to sports among others sasol sponsors south africas national teams including the south africans womens football team – banyana banyana the south african paralympics team the south african mens national wheelchair basketball team vw – sasol racing rally car sasol also sponsors

environmental conservation programmes on the other hand focused on wild dogs vultures and ground hornbills the support of educational programmes including natural history publications birding related projects sasol also supports the following corporate initiativescitation needed nepad business foundation business trust black management forum controversiesedit in  sasol agreed to pay an administrative penalty of r million as part of a settlement agreement with the competition commission of south africa for alleged price fixing in which a competitor alleged that sasol was abusing its dominance in the markets for fertilisers by charging excessive prices for certain products sasol won an appeal on the case and will not be paying the settlement anymore sasol also had to pay a € million fine to the european commission ec in  which is about r billion for participating in a paraffin wax cartel despite its indication that it would appeal the fine amount the full amount had to be paid to the ec within three months of the fine being issued see alsoedit list of petroleum companies fischertropsch process referencesedit this article has an unclear citation style the references

the companys chemical production capacity in the united states enabling sasol to further strengthen its position in a growing global chemicals market the us gulf coasts robust infrastructure for transporting and storing abundant lowcost ethane was a key driver in the decision to invest in america the ethane cracker will also be supported by six chemical manufacturing plants by january  construction was in full swing in  sasol is to begin construction on a gastoliquids facility that will produce up to  barrels of diesel fuel and other liquids by converting natural gas when completed

agreement between sasol petroleum international empresa nacional de hidrocarbonetos enh and the international finance corporation technologyedit fischertropsch processesedit the sasol slurry phase distillate spdtm process transform natural gas into energy and chemical products including transport fuels base oils waxes paraffins and naphtha the threestage process combines three proprietary technologies natural gas is combined with oxygen to form a syngas which is then subjected to a fischertropsch conversion resulting in waxy syncrude finally this is cracked down to produce the end product the strength of the sasol spdtm process is not simply in the inherent quality of the three component technologies but more importantly how they are combined and integrated to increase efficiencies and optimise output this integration is grounded in sasol’s  years experience in synthetic fuels production the liquid fuels produced through its gtl and ctl technologies are highperformance lowemission products the synthetic gtlbased diesel is an environmentally cleaner burning fuel as it leads to a reduction in carbon monoxide hydrocarbon and particulate matter without compromising nox emissions even when compared to european sulfurfree diesel a hightemperature syngas conversion process is operated in secunda in a series of  sasol advanced synthol sastm reactors at high pressure with the aid of an ironbased fischertropsch catalyst at about  °c to yield primarily c – c range hydrocarbons the process also produces water and oxygenated hydrocarbons which are then purified and marketed the c stream is split into ethylene and ethane the ethane is further cracked to yield additional ethylene which are then converted into polyethylene for the polymer business propylene from secunda and sasolburg plants are also converted into highvalue products such as polypropylene butanol butyl acrylate and ethyle acrylate the acrylates are used to make superabsorbent polymers which are used in diapers through proprietary technology hexene octene and pentene are recovered from the oil stream international customers use these as comonomers for making speciality grade polymers some of the higher olefins c – c are converted into detergentrange alcohols a lowtemperature syngas conversion process is operated in sasolburg based on an ironbased catalyst in fixedbed tubular and sasol slurry phase distillate™ processes to produce mainly linear hydrocarbon waxes and paraffins the syngas mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is also converted in methanol butanol and ammonia ammonia is then further converted into nitric acid and ammoniumbased fertilizers and explosives tetramerisationedit in  sasol technology research and development began research on

the companys chemical production capacity in the united states enabling sasol to further strengthen its position in a growing global chemicals market the us gulf coasts robust infrastructure for transporting and storing abundant lowcost ethane was a key driver in the decision to invest in america the ethane cracker will also be supported by six chemical manufacturing plants by january  construction was in full swing in  sasol is to begin construction on a gastoliquids facility that will produce up to  barrels of diesel fuel and other liquids by converting natural gas when completed the project will encompass  acres  ha or approximately  square miles at peak the project will create  construction and  permanent jobs and cost  billion to  billion qataredit oryx gtl plant – qatar

agreement between sasol petroleum international empresa nacional de hidrocarbonetos enh and the international finance corporation technologyedit fischertropsch processesedit the sasol slurry phase distillate spdtm process transform natural gas into energy and chemical products including transport fuels base oils waxes paraffins and naphtha the threestage process combines three proprietary technologies natural gas is combined with oxygen to form a syngas which is then subjected to a fischertropsch conversion resulting in waxy syncrude finally this is cracked down to produce the end product the strength of the sasol spdtm process is not simply in the inherent quality of the three component technologies but more importantly how they are combined and integrated to increase efficiencies and optimise output this integration is grounded in sasol’s  years experience in synthetic fuels production the liquid fuels produced through its gtl and ctl technologies are highperformance lowemission products the synthetic gtlbased diesel is an environmentally cleaner burning fuel as it leads to a reduction in carbon monoxide hydrocarbon and particulate matter without compromising nox emissions even when compared to european sulfurfree diesel a hightemperature syngas conversion process is operated in secunda in a series of  sasol advanced synthol sastm reactors at high pressure with the aid of an ironbased fischertropsch catalyst at about  °c to yield primarily c – c range hydrocarbons the process also produces water and oxygenated hydrocarbons which are then purified and marketed the c stream is split into ethylene and ethane the ethane is further cracked to yield additional ethylene which are then converted into polyethylene for the polymer business propylene from secunda and sasolburg plants are also converted into highvalue products such as polypropylene butanol butyl acrylate and ethyle acrylate the acrylates are used to make superabsorbent polymers which are used in diapers through proprietary technology hexene octene and pentene are recovered from the oil stream international customers use these as comonomers for making speciality grade polymers some of the higher olefins c – c are converted into detergentrange alcohols a lowtemperature syngas conversion process is operated in sasolburg based on an ironbased catalyst in fixedbed tubular and sasol slurry phase distillate™ processes to produce mainly linear hydrocarbon waxes and paraffins the syngas mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is also converted in methanol butanol and ammonia ammonia is then further converted into nitric acid and ammoniumbased fertilizers and explosives tetramerisationedit in  sasol technology research and development began research on the selective trimerisation of ethylene to hexene this led to the development and patenting of  trimerisation catalyst systems a groundbreaking innovation was made in  with the discovery of a tetramerisation catalyst that could make octene in high selectivity this was considered impossible by international experts in the field construction of this firstofakind plant in lake charles louisiana is under way the ready for commissioning date is august  natref refineryedit sasol is also involved in conventional oil refinery the natref refinery was commissioned in sasolburg in  the refinery is a joint venture between sasol ltd and total south africa pty ltd sasol has a  percent interest in natref and total south africa a  percent shareholding the refining capacity of natref to  barrels per day natref is one of the only inland refineries in south africa it was designed to get the most out of crude oil and is equipped with stateoftheart technology the refinery uses the bottoms upgrading refining process using medium gravity crude oil and is capable of producing  more white product than coastal refineries that have to rely on heavy fuel oil some of the products produced from the refinery are diesel petrol jet fuel lpg illuminating paraffin bitumen and sulfur natref has been certified in terms of the iso  environmental management system historyedit the incorporation of sasoledit south africa has large deposits of coal which had low commercial value due to its high fly ash content it was thought that if this coal could be used to produce synthetic oil petrol and diesel fuel it would have significant benefit to south africa in the s south african scientists started looking at the possibility of using coal as a source of liquid fuels this work was pioneered by p n lategan working for the transvaal coal owners association he completed his doctoral thesis from the imperial college of science in london on the lowtemperature carbonisation of south african coal in  a white paper from the government was issued describing various oilfromcoal processes being used overseas and their potential for south africa in the s a young scientist named etienne rousseau obtained an msc from the university of stellenbosch his thesis was entitled the sulfur content of coals and oil shales rousseau became sasol’s first managing director after world war ii angovaal bought the rights to a method of using the fischertropsch process patented by m w kellogg limited and in  sasol was formally incorporated as a stateowned company as south african coal oil and gas corporation commissioning of the sasol  site for the production of synfuels started in  construction of the sasol  site was completed in  with the sasol  site coming on stream in  the zevenfontein farm house served as sasol’s first offices and is still in existence today coal miningedit to support the required economies of scale for coaltoliquids ctl process to be economical and competitive with crude oil all stages of the operations from coal mining to the fischertropsch process and product work up must be run with great efficiency due to the complexity of the lurgi gasifers used the quality of the coal was paramount the initial annual output from the sigma underground mine in sasolburg was  million tons annual coal production from this mine peaked in  at  million tons today the majority of the gasifers in sasolburg have been replaced with autothermal reformers that feed natural gas piped from mozambique natural gas generates approximately  –  less carbon dioxide for the same energy produced as coal and is thus significantly more environmentally friendly gastoliquids gtl technology converts natural gas predominately methane to liquid fuels today sasol mines more than  million tons mt of saleable coal a year mostly gasification feedstock for sasol synfuels in secunda sasol mining also exports some  mt of coal a year this amounts to approximately  of all the coal mined in south africa underground mining operations continue in the secunda area bosjesspruit brandspruit middelbult syferfontein and twistdraai collieries and sigma mooikraal colliery near sasolburg as some of these mines are nearing the end of their useful life a rbn mine replacement program has been undertaken the first of the new mines is the rbn thubelisha shaft which will eventually comprise an operation delivering more than eight million tons per annum mtpa of coal over  years the impumelelo mine which will replace the brandspruit operation is set for first production in  it will be ramped up to produce  mtpa and can later be upgraded to supplying some  mtpa this coal will be used exclusively by the sasol synfuels plant an underground extension of the middelbult mine is also on the cards with the main shaft and incline shaft being replaced by the shondoni shaft the first coal from the new complex is expected to be delivered in  the secunda collieries form the worlds largest underground coal operations in conjunction with the continuous improvement in the fischertropsch process and catalyst significant developments were also made in mining technology coal mining at sasol from the early days has been characterised by innovation sasol mining mainly utilises the room and pillar method of mining with a continuous miner sasol successfully used the longwall mining method from  to  today sasol is one of the leaders in coal mining technology and was the first to develop inseam drilling from surface using a directional drilling methodology this has been developed into an effective exploration tool working with fifth dimension sasol developed a virtual reality technology to help train continuous miner operators in a d environment in which various scenarios can be simulated including sound dust and other signs of movement this has recently been expanded to include shuttle car roofbolting and loadhaul dumper simulators fischer tropsch reactor technologyedit the initial reactors from kellogg and lurgi gasifiers were tricky and expensive to operate the original reactor design in  was a circulating fluidised bed reactor cfbr with a capacity of about  barrels per day sasol improved these reactors to eventually yield about  barrels per day the cfbr design involves moving the whole catalyst bed around the reactor which is energy intensive and not efficient as most of the catalyst is not in the reaction zone sasol then developed fixed fluidized bed ffb reactors in which the catalyst particles were held in a fixed reaction zone this resulted in a significant increase in reactor capacities for example the first ffb reactors commercialised in   m diameter had a capacity of about  barrels per day while the design in  m diameter had a capacity of  barrels per day further advancements in reactor engineering have resulted on the development and commercialisation of sasol slurry phase distillate sspd reactors which are the corner stone of sasol’s first of a kind gtl plant in qatar from fuels to chemicalsedit the fuel price is directly linked to the oil price and is thus subject to potentially large fluctuations with sasol only producing fuels this meant that its profitability was largely governed by external macroeconomic forces that it had no control over how could sasol be less susceptible to the oil price the answer was right in front of them in the treasure chest of chemicals coproduced in the fischertropsch process chemicals have a higher value per ton of product than fuels in the s ammonia styrene and butadiene became the first chemical intermediates sold by sasol the ammonia was then used to make fertilizers by  sasol was a major player in the nitrogenous fertilizer market this product range was further extended in the s to include both phosphate and potassiumbased fertilizers today sasol sells an extensive range of fertilizers and explosives to local and international markets and is a world leader in its lowdensity ammonium nitrate technology with the extraction of chemicals from its fischertropsch product slate coupled with downstream functionalization and on purpose chemical production facilities sasol moved from being just a south african fuels company to become an international integrated energy and chemicals company with over  chemical products being sold worldwide some of the main products produced are diesel petrol gasoline naphtha kerosene jet fuel liquid petroleum gas lpg olefins alcohols polymers solvents surfactants detergent alcohols and oil field chemicals comonomers ammonia methanol various phenolics sulphur illuminating paraffin bitumen acrylates and fuel oil these products are used in the production process of numerous everyday products made worldwide and benefit the lives of millions of people around the world they include hotmelt adhesives car products microchip coatings printing ink household and industrial paints mobile phones circuit boards transport fuels compact discs medical lasers sun creams perfumes and plastic bottles in south africa the chemical businesses are integrated in the fischertropsch value chain outside south africa the company operates chemical businesses based on backward integration into feedstock andor competitive market positions for example in europe asia and the usa social investments and sponsorshipedit sasol devotes most of its sponsorship investment in south africa to sports among others sasol sponsors south africas national teams including the south africans womens football team – banyana banyana the south african paralympics team the south african mens national wheelchair basketball team vw – sasol racing rally car sasol also sponsors the annual sasol rally the sasol new signatures art competition the black

competition commission of south africa for alleged price fixing in which a competitor alleged that sasol was abusing its dominance in the markets for fertilisers by charging excessive prices for certain products sasol won an appeal on the case and will not be paying the settlement anymore sasol also had to pay a € million fine to the european commission ec in  which is about r billion for participating in a paraffin wax cartel despite its indication that it would appeal the fine amount the full amount had to be paid to the ec within three months of the fine being issued see alsoedit

and an integrated gtl and chemicals facility in westlake and almost the entire community of mossville both across the calcasieu river from lake charles louisiana and is the largest foreign investment in the history of the state of louisiana it was stated once commissioned this worldscale petrochemicals complex will roughly triple the companys chemical production capacity in the united states enabling sasol to further strengthen its position in a growing global chemicals market the us gulf coasts robust infrastructure for transporting and storing abundant lowcost ethane was a key driver in the decision to invest in america the ethane cracker will also be supported by six chemical manufacturing plants by january  construction was in full swing in  sasol is to begin construction on a gastoliquids facility that will produce up to  barrels of diesel fuel and other liquids by converting natural gas when completed the project will encompass  acres  ha or approximately  square miles at peak the project will create  construction and  permanent jobs and cost  billion to  billion qataredit oryx gtl plant – qatar main article oryx gtl the oryx gtl plant in qatar is a joint venture between sasol and qatar petroleum launched in  the more than  barrels per day  md plant produces a combination of gtl diesel gtl naphtha and liquid petroleum gas uzbekistanedit main article uzbekistan gtl the proposed uzbekistan gtl project is a partnership between sasol uzbekneftegaz and petronas mozambiqueedit sasol gas pipeline – temane – mozambique sasol is developing a  mw gasfired electricity generation plant in partnership with power utility edm this gas project came into operation in  and is a joint venture agreement between sasol petroleum international empresa nacional de hidrocarbonetos enh and the international finance corporation technologyedit fischertropsch processesedit the sasol slurry phase distillate spdtm process transform natural gas into energy and chemical products including transport fuels base oils waxes paraffins and naphtha the threestage process combines three proprietary technologies natural gas is combined with oxygen to form a syngas which is then subjected to a fischertropsch conversion resulting in waxy syncrude finally this is cracked down to produce the end product the strength of the sasol spdtm process is not simply in the inherent quality of the three component technologies but more importantly how they are combined and integrated to increase efficiencies and optimise output this integration is grounded in sasol’s  years experience in synthetic fuels production the liquid fuels produced through its gtl and ctl technologies are highperformance lowemission products the synthetic gtlbased diesel is an environmentally cleaner burning fuel as it leads to a reduction in carbon monoxide hydrocarbon and particulate matter without compromising nox emissions even when compared to european sulfurfree diesel a hightemperature syngas conversion process is operated in secunda in a series of  sasol advanced synthol sastm reactors at high pressure with the aid of an ironbased fischertropsch catalyst at about  °c to yield primarily c – c range hydrocarbons the process also produces water and oxygenated hydrocarbons which are then purified and marketed the c stream is split into ethylene and ethane the ethane is further cracked to yield additional ethylene which are then converted into polyethylene for the polymer business propylene from secunda and sasolburg plants are also converted into highvalue products such as polypropylene butanol butyl acrylate and ethyle acrylate the acrylates are used to make superabsorbent polymers which are used in diapers through proprietary technology hexene octene and pentene are recovered from the oil stream international customers use these as comonomers for making speciality grade polymers some of the higher olefins c – c are converted into detergentrange alcohols a lowtemperature syngas conversion process is operated in sasolburg based on an ironbased catalyst in fixedbed tubular and sasol slurry phase distillate™ processes to produce mainly linear hydrocarbon waxes and paraffins the syngas mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is also converted in methanol butanol and ammonia ammonia is then further converted into nitric acid and ammoniumbased fertilizers and explosives tetramerisationedit in  sasol technology research and development began research on the selective trimerisation of ethylene to hexene this led to the development and patenting of  trimerisation catalyst systems a groundbreaking innovation was made in  with the discovery of a tetramerisation catalyst that could make octene in high selectivity this was considered impossible by international experts in the field construction of this firstofakind plant in lake charles louisiana is under way the ready for commissioning date is august  natref refineryedit sasol is also involved in conventional oil refinery the natref refinery was commissioned in sasolburg in  the refinery is a joint venture between sasol ltd and total south africa pty ltd sasol has a  percent interest in natref and total south africa a  percent shareholding the refining capacity of natref to  barrels per day natref is one of the only inland refineries in south africa it was designed to get the most out of crude oil and is equipped with stateoftheart technology the refinery uses the bottoms upgrading refining process using medium gravity crude oil and is capable of producing  more white product than coastal refineries that have to rely on heavy fuel oil some of the products produced from the refinery are diesel petrol jet fuel lpg illuminating paraffin bitumen and sulfur natref has been certified in terms of the iso  environmental management system historyedit the incorporation of sasoledit south africa has large deposits of coal which had low commercial value due to its high fly ash content it was thought that if this coal could be used to produce synthetic oil petrol and diesel fuel it would have significant benefit to south africa in the s south african scientists started looking at the possibility of using coal as a source of liquid fuels this work was pioneered by p n lategan working for the transvaal coal owners association he completed his doctoral thesis from the imperial college of science in london on the lowtemperature carbonisation of south african coal in  a white paper from the government was issued describing various oilfromcoal processes being used overseas and their potential for south africa in the s a young scientist named etienne rousseau obtained an msc from the university of stellenbosch his thesis was entitled the sulfur content of coals and oil shales rousseau became sasol’s first managing director after world war ii angovaal bought the rights to a method of using the fischertropsch process patented by m w kellogg limited and in  sasol was formally incorporated as a stateowned company as south african coal oil and gas corporation commissioning of the sasol  site for the production of synfuels started in  construction of the sasol  site was completed in  with the sasol  site coming on stream in  the zevenfontein farm house served as sasol’s first offices and is still in existence today coal miningedit to support the required economies of scale for coaltoliquids ctl process to be economical and competitive with crude oil all stages of the operations from coal mining to the fischertropsch process and product work up must be run with great efficiency due to the complexity of the lurgi gasifers used the quality of the coal was paramount the initial annual output from the sigma underground mine in sasolburg was  million tons annual coal production from this mine peaked in  at  million tons today the majority of the gasifers in sasolburg have been replaced with autothermal reformers that feed natural gas piped from mozambique natural gas generates approximately  –  less carbon dioxide for the same energy produced as coal and is thus significantly more environmentally friendly gastoliquids gtl technology converts natural gas predominately methane to liquid fuels today sasol mines more than  million tons mt of saleable coal a year mostly gasification feedstock for sasol synfuels in secunda sasol mining also exports some  mt of coal a year this amounts to approximately  of all the coal mined in south africa underground mining operations continue in the secunda area bosjesspruit brandspruit middelbult syferfontein and twistdraai collieries and sigma mooikraal colliery near sasolburg as some of these mines are nearing the end of their useful life a rbn mine replacement program has been undertaken the first of the new mines is the rbn thubelisha shaft which will eventually comprise an operation delivering more than eight million tons per annum mtpa of coal over  years the impumelelo mine which will replace the brandspruit operation is set for first production in  it will be ramped up to produce  mtpa and can later be upgraded to supplying some  mtpa this coal will be used exclusively by the sasol synfuels plant an underground extension of the middelbult mine is also on the cards with the main shaft and incline shaft being replaced by the shondoni shaft the first coal from the new complex is expected to be delivered in  the secunda collieries form the worlds largest underground coal operations in conjunction with the continuous improvement in the fischertropsch process and catalyst significant developments were also made in mining technology coal mining at sasol from the early days has been characterised by innovation sasol mining mainly utilises the room and pillar method of mining with a continuous miner sasol successfully used the longwall mining method from  to  today sasol is one of the leaders in coal mining technology and was the first to develop inseam drilling from surface using a directional drilling methodology this has been developed into an effective exploration tool working with fifth dimension sasol developed a virtual reality technology to help train continuous miner operators in a d environment in which various scenarios can be simulated including sound dust and other signs of movement this has recently been expanded to include shuttle car roofbolting and loadhaul dumper simulators fischer tropsch reactor technologyedit the initial reactors from kellogg and lurgi gasifiers were tricky and expensive to operate the original reactor design in  was a circulating fluidised bed reactor cfbr with a capacity of about  barrels per day sasol improved these reactors to eventually yield about  barrels per day the cfbr design involves moving the whole catalyst bed around the reactor which is energy intensive and not efficient as most of the catalyst is not in the reaction zone sasol then developed fixed fluidized bed ffb reactors in which the catalyst particles were held in a fixed reaction zone this resulted in a significant increase in reactor capacities for example the first ffb reactors commercialised in   m diameter had a capacity of about  barrels per day while the design in  m diameter had a capacity of  barrels per day further advancements in reactor engineering have resulted on the development and commercialisation of sasol slurry phase distillate sspd reactors which are the corner stone of sasol’s first of a kind gtl plant in qatar from fuels to chemicalsedit the fuel price is directly linked to the oil price and is thus subject to potentially large fluctuations with sasol only producing fuels this meant that its profitability was largely governed by external macroeconomic forces that it had no control over how could sasol be less susceptible to the oil price the answer was right in front of them in the treasure chest of chemicals coproduced in the fischertropsch process chemicals have a higher value per ton of product than fuels in the s ammonia styrene and butadiene became the first chemical intermediates sold by sasol the ammonia was then used to make fertilizers by  sasol was a major player in the nitrogenous fertilizer market this product range was further extended in the s to include both phosphate and potassiumbased fertilizers today sasol sells an extensive range of fertilizers and explosives to local and international markets and is a world leader in its lowdensity ammonium nitrate technology with the extraction of chemicals from its fischertropsch product slate coupled with downstream functionalization and on purpose chemical production facilities sasol moved from being just a south african fuels company to become an international integrated energy and chemicals company with over  chemical products being sold worldwide some of the main products produced are diesel petrol gasoline naphtha kerosene jet fuel liquid petroleum gas lpg olefins alcohols polymers solvents surfactants detergent alcohols and oil field chemicals comonomers ammonia methanol various phenolics sulphur illuminating paraffin bitumen acrylates and fuel oil these products are used in the production process of numerous everyday products made worldwide and benefit the lives of millions of people around the world they include hotmelt adhesives car products microchip coatings printing ink household and industrial paints mobile phones circuit boards transport fuels compact discs medical lasers sun creams perfumes and plastic bottles in south africa the chemical businesses are integrated in the fischertropsch value chain outside south africa the company operates chemical businesses based on backward integration into feedstock andor competitive market positions for example in europe asia and the usa social investments and sponsorshipedit sasol devotes most of its sponsorship investment in south africa to sports among others sasol sponsors south africas national teams including the south africans womens football team – banyana banyana the south african paralympics team the south african mens national wheelchair basketball team vw – sasol racing rally car sasol also sponsors the annual sasol rally the sasol new signatures art competition the black tie ensemble the south african national youth

black management forum controversiesedit in  sasol agreed to pay an administrative penalty of r million as part of a settlement agreement with the competition commission of south africa for alleged price fixing in which a competitor alleged that sasol was abusing its dominance in the markets for fertilisers by charging excessive prices for certain products sasol won an appeal on the case and will not be paying the settlement anymore sasol also had to pay a € million fine to the european commission ec in  which is about r billion for participating in a paraffin wax cartel despite its indication that it would appeal the fine amount the full amount had to be paid to the ec within three months of the fine being issued see alsoedit list of petroleum companies fischertropsch process

in the history of the state of louisiana it was stated once commissioned this worldscale petrochemicals complex will roughly triple the companys chemical production capacity in the united states enabling sasol to further strengthen its position in a growing global chemicals market the us gulf coasts robust infrastructure for transporting and storing abundant lowcost ethane was a key driver in the decision to invest in america the ethane cracker will also be supported by six chemical manufacturing plants by january  construction was in full swing in  sasol is to begin construction on a gastoliquids facility that will produce up to  barrels of diesel fuel and other liquids by converting natural gas when completed the project will encompass  acres  ha or approximately  square miles at peak the project will create  construction and  permanent jobs and cost  billion to  billion qataredit oryx gtl plant – qatar main article oryx gtl the oryx gtl plant in qatar is a joint venture

generation plant in partnership with power utility edm this gas project came into operation in  and is a joint venture agreement between sasol petroleum international empresa nacional de hidrocarbonetos enh and the international finance corporation technologyedit fischertropsch processesedit the sasol slurry phase distillate spdtm process transform natural gas into energy and chemical products including transport fuels base oils waxes paraffins and naphtha the threestage process combines three proprietary technologies natural gas is combined with oxygen to form a syngas which is then subjected to a fischertropsch conversion resulting in waxy syncrude finally this is cracked down to produce the end product the strength of the sasol spdtm process is not simply in the inherent quality of the three component technologies but more importantly how they are combined and integrated to increase efficiencies and optimise output this integration is grounded in sasol’s  years experience in synthetic fuels production the liquid fuels produced through its gtl and ctl technologies are highperformance lowemission products the synthetic gtlbased diesel is an environmentally cleaner burning fuel as it leads to a reduction in carbon monoxide hydrocarbon and particulate matter without compromising nox emissions even when compared to european sulfurfree diesel a hightemperature syngas conversion process is operated in secunda in a series of  sasol advanced synthol sastm reactors at high pressure with the aid of an ironbased fischertropsch catalyst at about  °c to yield primarily c – c range hydrocarbons the process also produces water and oxygenated hydrocarbons which are then purified and marketed the c stream is split into ethylene and ethane the ethane is further cracked to yield additional ethylene which are then converted into polyethylene for the polymer business propylene from secunda and sasolburg plants are also converted into highvalue products such as polypropylene butanol butyl acrylate and ethyle acrylate the acrylates are used to make superabsorbent polymers which are used in diapers through proprietary technology hexene octene and pentene are recovered from the oil stream international customers use these as comonomers for making speciality grade polymers some of the higher olefins c – c are converted into detergentrange alcohols a lowtemperature syngas conversion process is operated in sasolburg based on an ironbased catalyst in fixedbed tubular and sasol slurry phase distillate™ processes to produce mainly linear hydrocarbon waxes and paraffins the syngas mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is also converted in methanol butanol and ammonia ammonia is then further converted into nitric acid and ammoniumbased fertilizers and explosives tetramerisationedit in  sasol technology research and development began research on the selective trimerisation of ethylene to hexene this led to the development and patenting of  trimerisation catalyst systems a groundbreaking innovation was made in  with the discovery of a tetramerisation catalyst that could make octene in high selectivity this was considered impossible by international experts in the field construction of this firstofakind plant in lake charles louisiana is under way the ready for commissioning date is august  natref refineryedit sasol is also involved in conventional oil refinery the natref refinery was commissioned in sasolburg in  the refinery is a joint venture between sasol ltd and total south africa pty ltd sasol has a  percent interest in natref and total south africa a  percent shareholding the refining capacity of natref to  barrels per day natref is one of the only inland refineries in south africa it was designed to get the most out of crude oil and is equipped with stateoftheart technology the refinery uses the bottoms upgrading refining process using medium gravity crude oil and is capable of producing  more white product than coastal refineries that have to rely on heavy fuel oil some of the products produced from the refinery are diesel petrol jet fuel lpg illuminating paraffin bitumen and sulfur natref has been certified in terms of the iso  environmental management system historyedit the incorporation of sasoledit south africa has large deposits of coal which had low commercial value due to its high fly ash content it was thought that if this coal could be used to produce synthetic oil petrol and diesel fuel it would have significant benefit to south africa in the s south african scientists started looking at the possibility of using coal as a source of liquid fuels this work was pioneered by p n lategan working for the transvaal coal owners association he completed his doctoral thesis from the imperial college of science in london on the lowtemperature carbonisation of south african coal in  a white paper from the government was issued describing various oilfromcoal processes being used overseas and their potential for south africa in the s a young scientist named etienne rousseau obtained an msc from the university of stellenbosch his thesis was entitled the sulfur content of coals and oil shales rousseau became sasol’s first managing director after world war ii angovaal bought the rights to a method of using the fischertropsch process patented by m w kellogg limited and in  sasol was formally incorporated as a stateowned company as south african coal oil and gas corporation commissioning of the sasol  site for the production of synfuels started in  construction of the sasol  site was completed in  with the sasol  site coming on stream in  the zevenfontein farm house served as sasol’s first offices and is still in existence today coal miningedit to support the required economies of scale for coaltoliquids ctl process to be economical and competitive with crude oil all stages of the operations from coal mining to the fischertropsch process and product work up must be run with great efficiency due to the complexity of the lurgi gasifers used the quality of the coal was paramount the initial annual output from the sigma underground mine in sasolburg was  million tons annual coal production from this mine peaked in  at  million tons today the majority of the gasifers in sasolburg have been replaced with autothermal reformers that feed natural gas piped from mozambique natural gas generates approximately  –  less carbon dioxide for the same energy produced as coal and is thus significantly more environmentally friendly gastoliquids gtl technology converts natural gas predominately methane to liquid fuels today sasol mines more than  million tons mt of saleable coal a year mostly gasification feedstock for sasol synfuels in secunda sasol mining also exports some  mt of coal a year this amounts to approximately  of all the coal mined in south africa underground mining operations continue in the secunda area bosjesspruit brandspruit middelbult syferfontein and twistdraai collieries and sigma mooikraal colliery near sasolburg as some of these mines are nearing the end of their useful life a rbn mine replacement program has been undertaken the first of the new mines is the rbn thubelisha shaft which will eventually comprise an operation delivering more than eight million tons per annum mtpa of coal over  years the impumelelo mine which will replace the brandspruit operation is set for first production in  it will be ramped up to produce  mtpa and can later be upgraded to supplying some  mtpa this coal will be used exclusively by the sasol synfuels plant an underground extension of the middelbult mine is also on the cards with the main shaft and incline shaft being replaced by the shondoni shaft the first coal from the new complex is expected to be delivered in  the secunda collieries form the worlds largest underground coal operations in conjunction with the continuous improvement in the fischertropsch process and catalyst significant developments were also made in mining technology coal mining at sasol from the early days has been characterised by innovation sasol mining mainly utilises the room and pillar method of mining with a continuous miner sasol successfully used the longwall mining method from  to  today sasol is one of the leaders in coal mining technology and was the first to develop inseam drilling from surface using a directional drilling methodology this has been developed into an effective exploration tool working with fifth dimension sasol developed a virtual reality technology to help train continuous miner operators in a d environment in which various scenarios can be simulated including sound dust and other signs of movement this has recently been expanded to include shuttle car roofbolting and loadhaul dumper simulators fischer tropsch reactor technologyedit the initial reactors from kellogg and lurgi gasifiers were tricky and expensive to operate the original reactor design in  was a circulating fluidised bed reactor cfbr with a capacity of about  barrels per day sasol improved these reactors to eventually yield about  barrels per day the cfbr design involves moving the whole catalyst bed around the reactor which is energy intensive and not efficient as most of the catalyst is not in the reaction zone sasol then developed fixed fluidized bed ffb reactors in which the catalyst particles were held in a fixed reaction zone this resulted in a significant increase in reactor capacities for example the first ffb reactors commercialised in   m diameter had a capacity of about  barrels per day while the design in  m diameter had a capacity of  barrels per day further advancements in reactor engineering have resulted on the development and commercialisation of sasol slurry phase distillate sspd reactors which are the corner stone of sasol’s first of a kind gtl plant in qatar from fuels to chemicalsedit the fuel price is directly linked to the oil price and is thus subject to potentially large fluctuations with sasol only producing fuels this meant that its profitability was largely governed by external macroeconomic forces that it had no control over how could sasol be less susceptible to the oil price the answer was right in front of them in the treasure chest of chemicals coproduced in the fischertropsch process chemicals have a higher value per ton of product than fuels in the s ammonia styrene and butadiene became the first chemical intermediates sold by sasol the ammonia was then used to make fertilizers by  sasol was a major player in the nitrogenous fertilizer market this product range was further extended in the s to include both phosphate and potassiumbased fertilizers today sasol sells an extensive range of fertilizers and explosives to local and international markets and is a world leader in its lowdensity ammonium nitrate technology with the extraction of chemicals from its fischertropsch product slate coupled with downstream functionalization and on purpose chemical production facilities sasol moved from being just a south african fuels company to become an international integrated energy and chemicals company with over  chemical products being sold worldwide some of the main products produced are diesel petrol gasoline naphtha kerosene jet fuel liquid petroleum gas lpg olefins alcohols polymers solvents surfactants detergent alcohols and oil field chemicals comonomers ammonia methanol various phenolics sulphur illuminating paraffin bitumen acrylates and fuel oil these products are used in the production process of numerous everyday products made worldwide and benefit the lives of millions of people around the world they include hotmelt adhesives car products microchip coatings printing ink household and industrial paints mobile phones circuit boards transport fuels compact discs medical lasers sun creams perfumes and plastic bottles in south africa the chemical businesses are integrated in the fischertropsch value chain outside south africa the company operates chemical businesses based on backward integration into feedstock andor competitive market positions for example in europe asia and the usa social investments and sponsorshipedit sasol devotes most of its sponsorship investment in south africa to sports among others sasol sponsors south africas national teams including the south africans womens football team – banyana banyana the south african paralympics team the south african mens national wheelchair basketball team vw – sasol racing rally car sasol also sponsors the annual sasol rally the sasol new signatures art competition the black tie ensemble the south african national youth orchestra and the techno x festival of science engineering and technology environmental conservation programmes on the other hand focused on wild dogs vultures and ground hornbills the support of educational programmes including natural history publications birding related projects sasol also supports the following corporate initiativescitation needed nepad business foundation business trust black management forum controversiesedit in  sasol agreed to pay an administrative penalty of r million as part of a settlement agreement with the competition commission of south africa for alleged price fixing in which a competitor alleged that sasol was abusing its dominance in the markets for fertilisers by charging excessive prices for certain products sasol won an appeal on the case and will not be paying the settlement anymore sasol also had to pay a € million fine to the european commission ec in  which is about r billion for participating in a paraffin wax cartel despite its indication that it would appeal the fine amount the full amount had to be paid to the ec within three months of the fine being issued see alsoedit list of petroleum companies fischertropsch process

the companys chemical production capacity in the united states enabling sasol to further strengthen its position in a growing global chemicals market the us gulf coasts robust infrastructure for transporting and storing abundant lowcost ethane was a key driver in the decision to invest in america the ethane cracker will also be supported by six chemical manufacturing plants by january  construction was in full swing in  sasol is to begin construction on a gastoliquids facility that will produce up to  barrels of diesel fuel and other liquids by converting natural gas when completed the project will encompass  acres  ha or approximately  square miles at peak the project will create  construction and  permanent jobs and cost  billion to  billion qataredit oryx gtl plant – qatar

pipeline – temane – mozambique sasol is developing a  mw gasfired electricity generation plant in partnership with power utility edm this gas project came into operation in  and is a joint venture agreement between sasol petroleum international empresa nacional de hidrocarbonetos enh and the international finance corporation technologyedit fischertropsch processesedit the sasol slurry phase distillate spdtm process transform natural gas into energy and chemical products including transport fuels base oils waxes paraffins and naphtha the threestage process combines three proprietary technologies natural gas is combined with oxygen to form a syngas which is then subjected to a fischertropsch conversion resulting in waxy syncrude finally this is cracked down to produce the end product the strength of the sasol spdtm process is not simply in the inherent quality of the three component technologies but more importantly how they are combined and integrated to increase efficiencies and optimise output this integration is grounded in sasol’s  years experience in synthetic fuels production the liquid fuels produced through its gtl and ctl technologies are highperformance lowemission products the synthetic gtlbased diesel is an environmentally cleaner burning fuel as it leads to a reduction in carbon monoxide hydrocarbon and particulate matter without compromising nox emissions even when compared to european sulfurfree diesel a hightemperature syngas conversion process is operated in secunda in a series of  sasol advanced synthol sastm reactors at high pressure with the aid of an ironbased fischertropsch catalyst at about  °c to yield primarily c – c range hydrocarbons the process also produces water and oxygenated hydrocarbons which are then purified and marketed the c stream is split into ethylene and ethane the ethane is further cracked to yield additional ethylene which are then converted into polyethylene for the polymer business propylene from secunda and sasolburg plants are also converted into highvalue products such as polypropylene butanol butyl acrylate and ethyle acrylate the acrylates are used to make superabsorbent polymers which are used in diapers through proprietary technology hexene octene and pentene are recovered from the oil stream international customers use these as comonomers for making speciality grade polymers some of the higher olefins c – c are converted into detergentrange alcohols a lowtemperature syngas conversion process is operated in sasolburg based on an ironbased catalyst in fixedbed tubular and sasol slurry phase distillate™ processes to produce mainly linear hydrocarbon waxes and paraffins the syngas mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is also converted in methanol butanol and ammonia ammonia is then further converted into nitric acid and ammoniumbased fertilizers and explosives tetramerisationedit in  sasol technology research and development began research on the selective trimerisation of ethylene to hexene this led to the development and patenting of  trimerisation catalyst systems a groundbreaking innovation was made in  with the discovery of a tetramerisation catalyst that could make octene in high selectivity this was considered impossible by international experts in the field construction of this firstofakind plant in lake charles louisiana is under way the ready for commissioning date is august  natref refineryedit sasol is also involved in conventional oil refinery the natref refinery was commissioned in sasolburg in  the refinery is a joint venture between sasol ltd and total south africa pty ltd sasol has a  percent interest in natref and total south africa a  percent shareholding the refining capacity of natref to  barrels per day natref is one of the only inland refineries in south africa it was designed to get the most out of crude oil and is equipped with stateoftheart technology the refinery uses the bottoms upgrading refining process using medium gravity crude oil and is capable of producing  more white product than coastal refineries that have to rely on heavy fuel oil some of the products produced from the refinery are diesel petrol jet fuel lpg illuminating paraffin bitumen and sulfur natref has been certified in terms of the iso  environmental management system historyedit the incorporation of sasoledit south africa has large deposits of coal which had low commercial value due to its high fly ash content it was thought that if this coal could be used to produce synthetic oil petrol and diesel fuel it would have significant benefit to south africa in the s south african scientists started looking at the possibility of using coal as a source of liquid fuels this work was pioneered by p n lategan working for the transvaal coal owners association he completed his doctoral thesis from the imperial college of science in london on the lowtemperature carbonisation of south african coal in  a white paper from the government was issued describing various oilfromcoal processes being used overseas and their potential for south africa in the s a young scientist named etienne rousseau obtained an msc from the university of stellenbosch his thesis was entitled the sulfur content of coals and oil shales rousseau became sasol’s first managing director after world war ii angovaal bought the rights to a method of using the fischertropsch process patented by m w kellogg limited and in  sasol was formally incorporated as a stateowned company as south african coal oil and gas corporation commissioning of the sasol  site for the production of synfuels started in  construction of the sasol  site was completed in  with the sasol  site coming on stream in  the zevenfontein farm house served as sasol’s first offices and is still in existence today coal miningedit to support the required economies of scale for coaltoliquids ctl process to be economical and competitive with crude oil all stages of the operations from coal mining to the fischertropsch process and product work up must be run with great efficiency due to the complexity of the lurgi gasifers used the quality of the coal was paramount the initial annual output from the sigma underground mine in sasolburg was  million tons annual coal production from this mine peaked in  at  million tons today the majority of the gasifers in sasolburg have been replaced with autothermal reformers that feed natural gas piped from mozambique natural gas generates approximately  –  less carbon dioxide for the same energy produced as coal and is thus significantly more environmentally friendly gastoliquids gtl technology converts natural gas predominately methane to liquid fuels today sasol mines more than  million tons mt of saleable coal a year mostly gasification feedstock for sasol synfuels in secunda sasol mining also exports some  mt of coal a year this amounts to approximately  of all the coal mined in south africa underground mining operations continue in the secunda area bosjesspruit brandspruit middelbult syferfontein and twistdraai collieries and sigma mooikraal colliery near sasolburg as some of these mines are nearing the end of their useful life a rbn mine replacement program has been undertaken the first of the new mines is the rbn thubelisha shaft which will eventually comprise an operation delivering more than eight million tons per annum mtpa of coal over  years the impumelelo mine which will replace the brandspruit operation is set for first production in  it will be ramped up to produce  mtpa and can later be upgraded to supplying some  mtpa this coal will be used exclusively by the sasol synfuels plant an underground extension of the middelbult mine is also on the cards with the main shaft and incline shaft being replaced by the shondoni shaft the first coal from the new complex is expected to be delivered in  the secunda collieries form the worlds largest underground coal operations in conjunction with the continuous improvement in the fischertropsch process and catalyst significant developments were also made in mining technology coal mining at sasol from the early days has been characterised by innovation sasol mining mainly utilises the room and pillar method of mining with a continuous miner sasol successfully used the longwall mining method from  to  today sasol is one of the leaders in coal mining technology and was the first to develop inseam drilling from surface using a directional drilling methodology this has been developed into an effective exploration tool working with fifth dimension sasol developed a virtual reality technology to help train continuous miner operators in a d environment in which various scenarios can be simulated including sound dust and other signs of movement this has recently been expanded to include shuttle car roofbolting and loadhaul dumper simulators fischer tropsch reactor technologyedit the initial reactors from kellogg and lurgi gasifiers were tricky and expensive to operate the original reactor design in  was a circulating fluidised bed reactor cfbr with a capacity of about  barrels per day sasol improved these reactors to eventually yield about  barrels per day the cfbr design involves moving the whole catalyst bed around the reactor which is energy intensive and not efficient as most of the catalyst is not in the reaction zone sasol then developed fixed fluidized bed ffb reactors in which the catalyst particles were held in a fixed reaction zone this resulted in a significant increase in reactor capacities for example the first ffb reactors commercialised in   m diameter had a capacity of about  barrels per day while the design in  m diameter had a capacity of  barrels per day further advancements in reactor engineering have resulted on the development and commercialisation of sasol slurry phase distillate sspd reactors which are the corner stone of sasol’s first of a kind gtl plant in qatar from fuels to chemicalsedit the fuel price is directly linked to the oil price and is thus subject to potentially large fluctuations with sasol only producing fuels this meant that its profitability was largely governed by external macroeconomic forces that it had no control over how could sasol be less susceptible to the oil price the answer was right in front of them in the treasure chest of chemicals coproduced in the fischertropsch process chemicals have a higher value per ton of product than fuels in the s ammonia styrene and butadiene became the first chemical intermediates sold by sasol the ammonia was then used to make fertilizers by  sasol was a major player in the nitrogenous fertilizer market this product range was further extended in the s to include both phosphate and potassiumbased fertilizers today sasol sells an extensive range of fertilizers and explosives to local and international markets and is a world leader in its lowdensity ammonium nitrate technology with the extraction of chemicals from its fischertropsch product slate coupled with downstream functionalization and on purpose chemical production facilities sasol moved from being just a south african fuels company to become an international integrated energy and chemicals company with over  chemical products being sold worldwide some of the main products produced are diesel petrol gasoline naphtha kerosene jet fuel liquid petroleum gas lpg olefins alcohols polymers solvents surfactants detergent alcohols and oil field chemicals comonomers ammonia methanol various phenolics sulphur illuminating paraffin bitumen acrylates and fuel oil these products are used in the production process of numerous everyday products made worldwide and benefit the lives of millions of people around the world they include hotmelt adhesives car products microchip coatings printing ink household and industrial paints mobile phones circuit boards transport fuels compact discs medical lasers sun creams perfumes and plastic bottles in south africa the chemical businesses are integrated in the fischertropsch value chain outside south africa the company operates chemical businesses based on backward integration into feedstock andor competitive market positions for example in europe asia and the usa social investments and sponsorshipedit sasol devotes most of its sponsorship investment in south africa to sports among others sasol sponsors south africas national teams including the south africans womens football team – banyana banyana the south african paralympics team the south african mens national wheelchair basketball team vw – sasol racing rally car sasol also sponsors the annual sasol rally the sasol new signatures art competition the black

vultures and ground hornbills the support of educational programmes including natural history publications birding related projects sasol also supports the following corporate initiativescitation needed nepad business foundation business trust black management forum controversiesedit in  sasol agreed to pay an administrative penalty of r million as part of a settlement agreement with the competition commission of south africa for alleged price fixing in which a competitor alleged that sasol was abusing its dominance in the markets for fertilisers by charging excessive prices for certain products sasol won an appeal on the case and will not be paying the settlement anymore sasol also had to pay a € million fine to the european commission ec in  which is about r billion for participating in a paraffin wax cartel despite its indication that it would appeal the fine amount the full amount had to be paid to the ec within three months of the fine being issued see alsoedit
