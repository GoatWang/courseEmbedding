clearly outlined his foreign policy views in his book the reluctant sheriff  in his book haass argued that the united states should play the role of international sheriff maintaining international order often means “assuming the role of international sheriff one who forges coalitions or posses of states and others for specific tasks” haass writes haass   in other words haass called on the united states to assume the role of an international sheriff that forges posses of states that worked together to patrol the international system while haass argued that the approach would largely benefit the international system he also made it clear that he intended for the united states to play the role of international sheriff to pursue its own preferences for the world in the years ahead “what will prove crucial is the ability of the united states to persuade others to adopt and abide by its preferences – and the will and the ability of the united states to act as a sheriff to mobilize itself and others to insist on them when resistance emerges” haass notes haass   after haass completed the reluctant sheriff he provided a bolder vision for us foreign policy in his lecture “imperial america” at the atlanta conference in november  in his lecture haass argued that the leaders of the united states should adopt “an imperial foreign policy” to construct and manage an informal american empire haass  the united states should attempt to “organize the world along certain principles affecting relations between states and conditions within them” haass argued haass  providing more details he pointed to the british empire as his model “the us role would resemble th century great britain” haass explained haass  by following the model of the british empire haass believed that the united states could maintain a system of informal control over the world when possible but turn to direct control if necessary “indeed an american empire would have to be informal if it were to succeed if only because american democracy could not underwrite an imperial order that required constant costly applications of military power” haass concluded haass  in a may  interview with bbcs hardtalk speaking as president of the council on foreign relations haass predicted that we are entering a new era in world history in part due to the muting of us dominance by the more diffuse power wielded by states and nonstate entities as a result of the proliferation of nuclear arms and cyberterrorism and several policy failures which may bring about an era of disorder in the absence of any clear superpower the failures in policy he points to are many of the rationales leading up to the  invasion of iraq including the notion that the iraqi regime had any involvement with the september  attacks or terrorism in general but excluding the prominent intelligence of the time which indicated that saddam husseins regime did most likely possess weapons of mass destruction a point which he now concedes along with many of his colleagues and the international intelligence community got wrong he explained that he believes the existing problems of the region which were exacerbated by the illadvised invasion of iraq were compounded by subsequent errors including the withdrawal of us troops carried out under the obama administration another major error according to haass was the failure of the united states and the united kingdom to intervene after it became clear that chemical weapons had been used during the syrian civil war leaving room for the islamic state to gain a foothold he has also stated he was against us involvement in the libyan civil war but said that if becoming involved was unavoidable better follow up was an absolute necessity not fulfilled resulting in a situation in which the people of libya are arguably worse off now than they were under the deeply flawed leadership of muammar gaddafi these seemingly incongruous positions he argues demonstrate that consistency when it comes to foreign relations is a bad idea and that each situation requires a customfit approach maintaining a consistent interventionist or conversely

would largely benefit the international system he also made it clear that he intended for the united states to play the role of international sheriff to pursue its own preferences for the world in the years ahead “what will prove crucial is the ability of the united states to persuade others to adopt and abide by its preferences – and the will and the ability of the united states to act as a sheriff to mobilize itself and others to insist on them when resistance emerges” haass notes haass   after haass completed the reluctant sheriff he provided a bolder vision for us foreign policy in his lecture “imperial america” at the atlanta conference in november  in his lecture haass argued that the leaders of the united states should adopt “an imperial foreign policy” to construct and manage an informal american empire haass  the united states should attempt to “organize the world along certain principles affecting relations between states and conditions within them” haass argued haass  providing more details he pointed to the british empire as his model “the us role would resemble th century great britain” haass explained haass  by following the model of the british empire haass believed that the united states could maintain a system of informal control over the world when possible but turn to direct control if necessary “indeed an american empire would have to be informal if it were to succeed if only because american democracy could not underwrite an imperial order that required constant costly applications of military power” haass concluded haass  in a may  interview with bbcs hardtalk speaking as president of the council on foreign relations haass predicted that we are entering a new era in world history in part due to the muting of us dominance by the more diffuse power wielded by states and nonstate entities as a result of the proliferation of nuclear arms and cyberterrorism and several policy failures which may bring about an era of disorder in the absence of any clear superpower the failures in policy he points to are many of the rationales leading up to the  invasion of iraq including the notion that the iraqi regime had any involvement with the september  attacks or terrorism in general but excluding the prominent intelligence of the time which indicated that saddam husseins regime did most likely possess weapons of mass destruction a point which he now concedes along with many of his colleagues and the international intelligence community got wrong he explained that he believes the existing problems of the region which were exacerbated by the illadvised invasion of iraq were compounded by subsequent errors including the withdrawal of us troops carried out under the obama administration another major error according to haass was the failure of the united states and the united kingdom to intervene after it became clear that chemical weapons had been used during the syrian civil war leaving room for the islamic state to gain a foothold he has also stated he was against us involvement in the libyan civil war but said that if becoming involved was unavoidable better follow up was an absolute necessity not fulfilled resulting in a situation in which the people of libya are arguably worse off now than they were under the deeply flawed leadership of muammar gaddafi these seemingly incongruous positions he argues demonstrate that consistency when it comes to foreign relations is a bad idea and that each situation requires a customfit approach maintaining a consistent interventionist or conversely

fill america’s shoes new york – it is increasingly clear that us president donald trump represents a departure when it comes to america’s global outlook and behavior as a result the united states will no longer play the leading international role that has defined its foreign policy for three quarters of a century under democratic and republican presidents alike we have already seen many examples of this change the traditional us commitment to global organizations has been superseded by the idea of “america first” alliances and security guarantees once regarded as a given are increasingly conditioned on how much allies spend on defense and whether they are seen to derive unfair advantage from trade with the us more broadly foreign trade is viewed with suspicion – supposedly a source of job loss rather than an engine of investment job creation growth and stability immigration and refugee policies have become more restrictive less emphasis is being placed on promoting democracy and human rights more dollars are going to defense but fewer resources are being devoted to supporting global health or development this is not to be confused with isolationism even trump’s america will continue to play a meaningful role in the world it is using military force in the middle east and afghanistan increasing diplomatic pressure on north korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs and renegotiating the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico and the policies of states cities and companies will translate into an american commitment to climate change despite trump’s decision to abandon the paris agreement still a shift away from a usdominated world of structured relationships and standing institutions and toward something else is under way what this alternative will be however remains largely unknowable what we do know is that there is no alternative great power willing and able to step in and assume what had been the us role china is a frequently mentioned candidate but its leadership is focused mostly on consolidating domestic order and maintaining artificially high economicgrowth rates to stave off popular unrest china’s interest in regional and global institutions seems designed mostly to bolster its economy and geopolitical influence rather than to help set rules and create broadly beneficial arrangements likewise russia is a country with a narrowlybased economy led by a government focused on retaining power at home and reestablishing russian influence in the middle east and europe india is preoccupied with the challenge of economic development and is tied down by its problematic relationship with pakistan japan is held back by its declining population domestic political and economic constraints and its neighbors’ suspicions europe for its part is distracted by questions surrounding the relationship between member states and the european union as a result the whole of the continent is less than the sum of its parts – none of which is large enough to succeed america on the world stage but the absence of a single successor to the us does not mean that what awaits is chaos at least in principle the world’s most powerful countries could come together to fill america’s shoes in practice though this will not happen as these countries lack the capabilities experience and above all a consensus on what needs doing and who needs to do it a more likely development is the emergence of a mix of order and disorder at both the regional and global level china will promote various trade infrastructure and security mechanisms in asia the  remaining members of the transpacific partnership may launch their trade pact without the us less clear is whether china is prepared to use its influence to restrain north korea how india and pakistan will avoid conflict and the resolution of asia’s many territorial disputes it is all too easy to imagine an asian and pacific future characterized by higher spending on arms of all types – and thus more susceptible to violent conflict the middle east is already suffering unprecedented instability the result of local rivalries and realities and of  years during which the us arguably first did too much and then too little to shape the region’s future the immediate danger is not just further deterioration in failed states such as yemen syria and libya but also direct conflict between saudi arabia and iran europe may be something of an exception to such trends as the election of president emmanuel macron in france has given rise to a government that is committed to reforming the eu but the eu itself faces an uncertain future given brexit and slowmotion crises in italy and greece not to mention the potential for additional russian mischief or worse donate now to all of this one could add the meltdown in venezuela and the alltoofamiliar horrors in south sudan and the democratic republic of the congo and then there is the growing gap between global challenges such as how to govern cyberspace and the willingness of governments to work together to address them there is no little irony in this global turn of events for decades many countries criticized us policy both for what it was and what it was not these same countries now face the prospect of a world in which american leadership is likely to be less of a factor it is far from clear

aslanidis jun   another useless article by an official academic whatever the real reason no other country can replace the usa doesnt have anything to do with foreign policy it has everything to do with that theres no other country that can replace the us trade deficits ie no other country wants to absorb the worlds output read more reply comment commented robert chadis jun   this is not to be confused with isolationism even trump’s america will continue to play a meaningful role in the world  crap usa has always been isolationist and failed except in dire circumstances to play a meaningful role in the world  read more reply comment commented can calhan jun   i certainly agree with the point that mr neunuebel puts forward by saying that all of the handwringing issues the author brings up have been ever present when the us was the so called leader of global affairs america has been the part of the problems rather than solutions i doubt very much that us is not aware of its wrong foreign policy it has been practicing it has been consciously designed the consequences with which the whole world has been facing in afghanistan iraq yemen syria are the outcomes of the foreign policy if as the author claims that us was the leader of the world there is no one else to hold accountable for the issues but us for example one of the biggest failures of us was that it never used democratic principles as a must in dealing with undemocratic systems on the contrary it has been interested in gain determined in line with its economic and political interests regardless of considering the long term painful consequences donald trump he is probably the worst one that us has ever experienced in the context of democracy human rights and environment read more reply comment commented data drivenfp jun   china until  it had the largest share of the world gdp for  years now its climbing back up what will chinese world leadership look like read more reply comment commented david neunuebel jun   well slit my throat this is an astoundingly ridiculous article all of the handwringing issues the author brings up have been ever present when the us was the so called leader of global affairs they didnt and wont crop up just because we have four years of an idiot for president regarding the statement about chinas artificially high economicgrowth rates by all metrics china is considered the nd largest economy in the world behind the us and maybe even  if that is then artificial then one must assume that the metric is equally as useless in evaluating the us economy as  the article is a silly waste of time and i of course wasted it read more reply comment commented odyssios redux jun   trump represents a departure when it comes to america’s global outlook and behavior only to its superficial aspects  the manner in which and manners with which it presents itself to the world  his policies are unchanged only his manner is different his foreign policy is a continuation of previous administrations which is an incomprehending and blundering bullying isis for example lets ignore its genesis is in no way an existential threat to anyone outside the middleeast hellish to live with but we dont the occasional isisinspired atrocity is a pinprick not an existential crisis yes even the infamous  the view of trump as an anomaly is i think wrong when was he first praised as plausibly presidential when he threw missiles at an empty airfield then used an  ton bomb on a largely deserted area that is americas comfort zone and that will not be missed by others at allamerica as guardian of democratic ideals dont make me sneer saudi arabia is only one of the more egregious counterexamples warlord duterte of the philippines is another and try to tell me with a straight face that were supporting democracy in either iraq or afghanistan libya we darent mention and so on none of these little difficulties can be laid at the donalds feet america will go on galumphing around the planet for quite a while after trump is a bad memory the world needs neither nanny nor sheriff movie sense read more reply comment commented chandrashekar mudraganam jun   recent developments under the trump administration do point to a reorientation of americas approach on its global leadership role but it is too early to point a significant shift from its earlier policy america first in a welcome step for the us to strengthen itself however the emerging world order points to an era where the responsibility of managing and influencing global affairs will not be confined to america alone but will be increasingly shared by other emerging powers in various parts of the globe the us must enhance its relations with like minded emerging powers such as india which are capable and more importantly willing to shoulder additional responsibility at least in their part of the world convergence of mutual interests at a global level to ensure peaceful rise of nations is essential for such partnerships and alliances read more reply comment commented harvey sapolsky jun   if we do less others will do more and with some learning various regional powers or groups will calm their parts of the globe they may even begin to cooperate we have little interest in most distant disputes read more reply comment commented robert bruce jun   laments for the loss of american global leadership are in truth based far more on fear of international instability than on any real loss of global vision from the us lets be honest  many if not most of the leadership exercised by america has been a disaster for the world from the reckless invasion of iraq in  to the financial excesses which led to the global banking collapse in  if the absence of a strong american agenda allows the rest of the world to mature and take responsibility for growing a new international community perhaps we should welcome rather than fear the open page it presentsof course national agendas remain partisan as they always have but regardless of trump we are inching inexorably towards a more integrated global society the reality of problems which can only be solved through global cooperation from climate change and tax evasion to combating infectious disease or internet saboteurs these common issues will sooner or later ensure that everyone has to come back to the same tableof course we are now in for a long interim while trump remains president but like the demise of coal and the replacement of jobs by new automated technology the underlying global trends taking shape today are unstoppable the only question is how long it will take us to respond to them with greater global cooperationrobert p bruce  author wwwtheglobalracenet read more comment commented stephan edwards jun   global cooperation perhaps but has a student of history i find global war a much more likely prospect global cooperation requires a certain level of willing sacrifice by the people unfortunately the losers of globalization are so very tired of making sacrifices for strangers their is no will or acceptance for it at this point a growing plurality of people in the first worlds middle and working classes that would not urinate on a foreigner if he was on fire the chances of anymore sacrifices for china mexico india or nearly any rd world nations closely approximates zero read more comment commented lt lee jun   most of the leadership exercised by america has been a disaster for the world from the reckless invasion of iraq in  to the financial excesses which led to the global banking collapse in  at the same time it failstake care of its own people and turns itself into a second tier countryhttpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticlesamericaisnowasecondtiercountrythey real question is does the world really need another america read more reply comment commented gerry h jun   who will fill americas shoes lets have a stab at this china will spend a trillion building a highspeed transport system to europe africa and asia to allow its economic miracle conclude its final chapter and become the worlds industrial backbone from africa the caravan will return with produce from the many chineseacquired agricultural landseurope having for years successfully stitched up the us for its heavy defence needs will now turn increasingly to independence in the economic political and military fields thanks to the spirit of goodwill there the eu will democratically reform and overcome its internal contradictions the euro will flourishafrica will go through a population explosion and africans will migrate to every corner of the planet economic development there will be achieved with continuing help from the chinese who will lift the continent from poverty following the same path as they have themselves start with simple things first like roads and rail trade and export then continue a step at a timethe united states will continue to spend trillions on military bases around the world and on preparing for a world war with russia china and the arab countries in the long run the cost of their military adventurism will bankrupt the nation much like the nuclear arms race bankrupted the ussr slowly the world will come to realise that prosperity and wellbeing come from social justice and respect the planetdestroying arsenals will fall into disrepair and the worlds focus will be on ecosystem repair and undoing the damage done to the climate by a corporateindustrialmilitaryneoliberal culture out of control politicians will step up who know that to have our planet we will need to save it from destruction whether any of them will be american we may only guess read more comment commented stephan edwards jun   if you believe this i have a bridge to sell you great view of brooklyn spirit of goodwill in europe would greece italy or cyprus agree i think not and the chances of china doing anything for africa that does not directly advantage china closely approximateszero as for social justice respect in the world that is quite possibly the funniest thing i have heard in decades social justice  respect in china where in china justice is reserved for the rich powerful and the princes of the right families has for the peasants not a chance and if anything africa is in even worse shape and shows no signs of changing my personal guess is the system will disintegrate into war but i hope im wrong but if you believe china will spread social justice  respect you should look at the facts in china read more reply comment commented ariel tejera jun   they say the best information is normally hidden you know a case in question is the silence looming of the weight of germany in the world stage is deafening neither the uk nor us want to plan about or be aware of the existence of the germans whose strategic position has only improved enormously in the last decades and who now stand as silent unassuming growing giant read more reply comment commented ariel tejera jun   mr haas who will fill those shoes indeed however as strident as our antiglobalist rhetoric becomes big finance and bit technology can only congratulate themselves they don’t have to care at all why every law goes to their benefit and everyone else has to adapt the american empire is different to others i think because even if america now steps back its legacy flourishes people everywhere now has to pay for big finance’s extravaganzas and wait to be displaced at work by big technology let the citizens find fault in immigrants trade in their political parties don’t wake them up read more reply comment commented j von hettlingen jun   richard n haass laments that america under trump is abandoning its role as guarantor of the current global world order  a role that has defined its foreign policy for three quarters of a century under democratic and republican presidents alike that order has enabled  years of prosperity thanks to marketoriented regimes of trade liberalisation increased capital mobility and appropriate social welfare policies countries in europe the middle east and asia have been able to share americas security umbrella  through nato and various other alliancestrump sees foreign policy and trade through the prism of his america first approach while slashing the budget for foreign policy and agencies that promote soft power he has increased military spending he is making americas decadesold allies to foot their defence bill and has threatened to impose punitive tariffs to tackle trade deficits he blames the loss of jobs and falling incomes on foreign competition and globalisation he doesnt believe in climate change and ditched the paris agreement in an effort to reopen mines and explore gas and oil fields but history had taught us a lesson that nativism protectionism and isolationism are a toxic mix for economic and military disaster the author  a neocon foreign policy wonk  says a vacuum emerges with a shift away from a usdominated world of structured relationships and standing institutions it is still too early to discern what this alternative will be it is true that there is no alternative great power willing and able to step in and assume what had been the us role the eu is americas oldest ally but it is far from being strong to lead the world in fact without active us engagement in europe an aggressively revanchist russia will step in even though its narrowlybased economy is struggling westernled anctions and falling energy prices have taken a heavy toll on russias economy but it doesnt deter putin from staging a return to global power focusing on europe and the middle east china is seen as the only power that can challenge americas leadership but it is focused mostly on consolidating domestic order and maintaining artificially high economicgrowth rates to stave off popular unrest china’s interest in regional and global institutions seems designed mostly to bolster its economy and geopolitical influence rather than to help set rules and create broadly beneficial arrangements beijing welcomed trumps leaving the transpacific partnership to expand its influence in the region but china will unlikely use its influence to restrain north korea because it needs it as a buffer state between south korea and its border despite huge influence on pakistan its reluctant to help india and pakistan reconcile india has border disputes with both china and pakistan the south china sea is also another venue of territorial disputes between china and the littoral countries thereif the us gives up on its asian allies such as the philippines south korea and taiwan those countries may have no choice but to submit themselves to beijing other us allies such as japan and india may be forced to militarise and challenge china openly thus an american withdrawal from the region could very well eventually bring on a military conflict therethe middle east with its pertual conflicts sparked by the shiasunni schism pits the shiamajority iran against the saudiled sunni coalition africa has been plagued by drought population explosion and the corrupt regimes have failed to address the socialeconomic woes that easily lead to violencethe author points out that people despite criticising the us for what it was and what it was not will one day look back with fondness the global order the america has secured they face the prospect of a world in which american leadership is likely to be less of a factor it is far from clear that they are prepared for such a world or that they will find themselves better off in it read more reply comment commented john reid jun   reports of the collapse of the eu are rather exaggerated see httpswwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejunyearagobritainvotedleaveeuworsebothworlds read more reply comment commented william l williams jun   it will be a combination of the eu the brics the united states and japan i would hope that there would be less hubris and less exceptionalism once the unilateral power system is eliminated read more reply comment commented anthony deangelis jun   i have a hard time listening to anyone who supported gwbs foreign excursions and who was the coordinator for the future of afghanistan asking nato members to increase their share of defense spending is fair they havent been meeting their obligations the paris accord was never approved by congress companies are free to continue moving towards green energy  this author champions globalism and free trade as if it was a law of nature and not something that has both pros and cons and while globalism has created jobs in the us and foreign companies employ americans to produce goods that will be used in the us the us has a trade deficit with nearly every industrialized nation reevaluating trade policies and looking to encourage companies to employ americans is not a bad thing as for this hyperbole who will fill our shoes get real russia and china have no interest in being the worlds police the usa has squandered american wealth by injecting itself into countless unnecessary wars and crisis we have poor relations with other countries because we cannot stop meddling i look forward to a time where a country that has never been invaded by a foreign enemy stops spending b on defense or at least rename it for what it is a b budget for assaulting every nation in the free world that decided to do something we do not like a multipolar world where the us is no longer dominate would be great the us would act in a civilized manor and no longer need to waste endless amounts of money on defense read more reply comment commented smahmud ali jun   dr haass a prominent us practitionerturnedstrategist lays out the challenges flowing out of systemic transitional fluidity however the suggestion that the usdesignedandled liberal order has been in place for three quarters of a century ignores the fact that such an order has been much more shortlived than that the usa with the help of its allies and partners in the second world war  which incidentally included stalins ussr and chiang kaisheks china  established a multilateralist and collegial system of collective global governance via the san francisco conferences starting in late the un especially the unsc and its vetowielding p at its core  were fashioned to collaboratively manage the planets postwar problems but as the usa and the ussr charted their nationalinterestfocused and ideologicallydriven courses the p was much less effective than its early promise the bipolarity cleaving the systemic core formalised by nsc and the korean war ensured there were at least two hemispheric orders  the usled capitalist west and the sovietled communistsocialist east each challenging the others leadership and reducing the planet to a battleground for their competing ideals and interests with the world perennially shivering on the brink of thermonuclear catastrophe the usled oecd was the dominant politicaleconomic aggregation of power in the world but it only covered a small part of the planet there was no world order for the us to lead until soviet evisceration effected via clandestine sinous strategic collaboration in central america southern africa and the horn south asia indochina and most spectacularly afghanistan supplanted bipolarity at the systemic core with unipolarity although large swathes of the worlds surface remained beyond its ken this postsoviet era could accurately be generalised as the usled liberal world order but such orders last only as long as major players acquiesce in it and accept their own subordination to the primate in late  when the cpccc and the cmc jointly identified the usa japan and the rok as the source of the most acute threats to chinese security and began preparing to deter intervention that voluntary subordination ended in  the dodona summer study similarly identified china as a constant competitor and later viewing it as a nearpeer rival america prepared to neutralise chinese challenges to us primacy by definition the system was no longer unipolar in a nonunipolar system again by definition there simply could not be a global order this is why it would be logical to state that the usdesignedandled order acquired and retained its virtually global character between the end of  when the ussr collapsed and the summer of  when beijing began girding itself against the systemic primate and certainly by the end of  when the executive and legislative branches in washington took policymeasures against chinas challenges to american primacy the globality of the usled order endedso when eminent analysts premise their analyses on assertions of a very shortlived usled order as the global norm then all inferences flowing from such analyses must logically be much more imperfect than the simple frailties of human cognition would warrant this would be a difficult methodology for delivering practical policy options read more reply comment commented steve hurst jun   a somewhat uscentric and egotistical point of view with no great review of some of the problems the us has caused as  million americans are on food stamps perhaps global domination is not top of their agendathe idea macron can save france by saving the eu is somewhat detached from reality it would be simple enough to save france by quitting the euro but that will not happen with macronbtw us fertility rates are a problem and on a downward drift and

comment commented stephan edwards jun   the people of the us got tired mr haass they got tired of the leaders sacrificing their interests for others because it was necessary for our allies they got tired because they looked around realized since they didnt have to shoulder the burdens or sacrifices of guns or butter we paid for the guns they got the butter secondly and i am sure it is coincidental the well connected and powerful got very very rich by sacrificing the interests of the commoners they did a wonderful thing by letting china into the wto for china and the rich but not for people who watched their jobs shipped off to china because leadership means sacrifices must be made bluntly the withdrawal is because the commoners are so very tired of sacrifices i would suggest mr haass that if the sacrifices had been shared instead of strictly from those who had no voice in matters there might be some support for playing a leadership role but there was not and if frankly let others pay the price for leadership for has far as the commoners are concerned we have payed way to much for global leadership and gained absolutly nothing read more featured economicsjul    the
