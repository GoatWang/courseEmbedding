on fda review of nda on pain management jun   intellipharmaceutics international inc has announced that a joint meeting of the anesthetic and analgesic drug products advisory committee and drug safety and risk management advisory committee of the fda has been scheduled for july   to review the its new drug application for rexista abusedeterrent oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets for the treatment of moderate to severe pain the companys nda submission for rexista was accepted for review by the fda on february   the fda set a target action date under the prescription drug user fee act of september   rexista is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily aroundtheclock longterm opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate the submission is supported by pivotal pharmacokinetic studies that demonstrated that rexista is bioequivalent to oxycontin the submission also includes abusedeterrent studies conducted to support abusedeterrent label claims having reference to the fdas abusedeterrent opioids  evaluation and labeling guidance published in april  if approved rexista may be the only abusedeterrent oxycodone product with properties that may provide early warning of drug abuse if the product is manipulated or abused the company previously announced the results of a food effect study which showed that rexista can be administered with or without a meal ie no food effect providing another point of differentiation from currently marketed oral oxycodone extended release products there can be no assurance that will not be required to conduct further studies for rexista that the fda will ultimately approve the nda for the sale of rexista in the us market or that it will ever be successfully commercialized rexista abuse deterrent oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets nda product candidate is intended as an abuse and alcoholdeterrent controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride for the relief of pain the rexista longacting formulation of oxycodone is intended to present a significant barrier to tampering when subjected to various forms of physical and chemical manipulation commonly used by abusers it is also designed to prevent dose dumping when inadvertently coadministered with alcohol dose dumping is the rapid release of an active ingredient from a controlledrelease drug into the blood stream that can result in increased toxicity side effects and a loss of efficacy dose dumping can result by consuming the drug through crushing taking with alcohol extracting with other beverages vaporizing or injecting in addition when crushed or pulverized and hydrated the proposed extended release formulation is designed to coagulate instantaneously and entrap the drug in a viscous hydrogel which is intended to prevent syringing injecting and snorting rexista formulation is difficult to abuse through the application of heat or an open flame making it difficult to inhale the active ingredient from burning rexista formulation contains a blue dye that is emitted once the tablet is tampered with or crushed and may act as a deterrent to a user who attempts to abuse it orally or via the intranasal route intellipharmaceutics seeks acquisitions may   intellipharmaceutics international inc has filed a shelf registration in the amount of

to provide lifecycle management or new chemical entity delivery system solutions for virtually any small molecule the flexibility of this technology allows us to quickly develop complex drug delivery solutions we operate in the niche market created by the expiration of drug product patents and drug product exclusivity periods there are two ways that we employ our controlledrelease technologies which represent substantial opportunities for us to license our technologies and products nda strategy for branded immediaterelease multipletimesperday drugs we formulate improved replacement products typically by developing a new patentable controlledrelease onceaday drug these drugs can be licensed to and sold by the pharmaceutical company that made the original immediaterelease product this protects against revenue erosion in the brand by providing a clinically attractive patented product that competes favorably with the generic immediaterelease competition which arises on expiry of the original patents the regulatory pathway for this approach requires new drug applications nda via a  b pathway this accelerates development timelines and reduces costs in comparision to new drug applications for new chemical entities anda strategy for existing controlledrelease onceaday products covered by patents about to expire or already expired we can formulate generic products which are bioequivalent to the branded products such products can be licensed to and sold by distributors of generic products our scientists have previously demonstrated a successful track record with such products having developed several drugs on a private contract basis the regulatory pathway for this approach requires an abbreviated new drug application anda   about us strategic focus partners

surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using
