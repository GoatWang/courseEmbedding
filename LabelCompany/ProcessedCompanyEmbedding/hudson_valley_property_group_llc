either a fhahud refinance or a  low income housing tax credittax exempt bond transaction we would work with local and state agencies to maximize the financial support for the project typically in the form of subsidies and grants how would the redevelopment benefit your organization this would benefit your organization in several ways you would get a newly renovated property at no outofpocket expense to your organization you would also have the opportunity for an upfront cash payment as well as increased longterm cash flows from operational efficiencies how is hvpg different how is hvpg uniqueaside from having the prerequisite expertise and experience we set ourselves apart in our flexibility we are comfortable playing different roles depending upon your organization’s interest and needs we can simply act as a fee developer guiding your organization through the complicated process we can also act as a development partner providing financial guarantees and covering all out of pocket expenses with the project how would the transaction be structuredwe would be happy to walk you and your organization through the details of how the transaction would be structured in short your organization will be able to maintain a longterm ownership position and can keep control of the operations if it desires what role would hvpg play what role would the organization playthis is entirely negotiable you let us know what you want us to do we would usually provide financial guarantees obtain financing oversee the construction and assist in all aspects of permanent loan conversion our longterm involvement depends on the final deal structure and the guarantees provided we would expect you to provide us with all pertinent information about the property we would also expect to work closely with you in determining together what improvements should be made to the property and what services can be enhancedoffered how would hvpg be compensated how would the organization be compensatedour compensation depends entirely on the role that we would play the more financial risk we take on the more we would look to share in the economics of the transaction we are flexible in what roles and responsibilities we would take if the organization would like to retain ownership we would provide development expertise predevelopment funding and constructioncompletion guarantees on a feeforservice basis in this case we would act as a fee developer and not join in the ownership of the property we would only receive payment out of developer fees which are paid by the rehabilitation budget – not by the organization in a codevelopment scenario where we assume all or a portion of the constructionperiod financial guarantees the organization could potentially receive the upfront payment a portion of the developer fee and cash flow is there a need to restructure the ownership of the building if so how does the organization maintain control of operationsit depends on how we finance the rehab if we use tax credits then we’d have to restructure ownership during the tax credit compliance period the organization would maintain ownership along with tax credit investors during this time and have opportunity to control operations after compliance the tax credit investors exit and the organization retains ownership if we did an fhahud refinancing then the current ownership of the building will not change if there is a need to restructure to bring in investors exactly how would this need be accommodated what percent of ownership would we be able to maintainthis is relevant if we pursue refinancing utilizing tax credits and taxexempt bonds this is something with which we have extensive experience and expertise we would oversee the entire process including working with the investors the question about ownership is a complicated one during the tax credit compliance period the tax credit investors technically are involved in ownership they exit after compliance the longterm ownership of the property is not impacted by this financing structure to the extent that you want us to help with longterm financial guarantees we can we would look for a fair compensation for that risk usually in the form of a split of ownership which is entirely negotiable in most instances such a refinancing can provide the organization with additional capital to support its mission is this from the reduced interest expense reductions in other operating expensethe organization can benefit in different ways including but not limited to a potential upfront payment management fees and increased longterm cash flows from operational efficiencies would the potential upfront cash payment be paid to the hdfc or to the sponsor the organizationif the hdfc acts as fee owner only the potential cash payment would be paid to the sponsor this can be structured to achieve your goals hudson valley property group  vesey st th fl new york ny  phone  fax  email
