contact us suppliers minyari  waca in january  newcrest mining limited relinquished several mining leases located within the company’s north telfer project area this ground which hosts substantial gold ± copper mineralisation was successfully amalgamated into antipas north telfer exploration licences in december  as a consequence the north telfer project now hosts a number of historically defined gold ± copper prospects including “walkup” highgrade drilling targets at the minyari deposit waca deposit and judes prospectthe minyari dome hosts several mineral systems including both the minyari and waca deposits where at the former significant highgrade gold mineralisation occurs from within one to several metres of the surface including high to very high grade oxide and primary sulphide gold ± copper mineralisation the vast majority of historic drilling in the area is shallow aircorerabrc in nature generally less than  to  metres deepacross the minyari dome including locally at the minyari and waca deposits highly favourable geological conditions exist for highgrade gold mineralisation including the domal structure itself carbonate bearing reactive host rocks including the formation which hosts the telfer deposit excellent structural framework showing a high degree of similarity to structures which control mineralisation across the telfer dome and fertile granites the company has interpreted a telfer style model for highgrade gold mineralisation involving blind thrust controlled enechelon highgrade gold vein and fold corridors may be applied to the minyari dome these highgrade opportunities have not been not tested by drilling although these highgrade mineralisation controls appears evident from the very limited deeper rc ± diamond drilling and also exposures within the shallow “metallurgical sampling” open pit at the minyari deposit​the company has completed its validation of the historic data and technical review including the identification of significant highgrade north telfer project drilling targets​significant high grade gold with copper mineralisation has been identified at minyari and waca with strong exploration upside please read
