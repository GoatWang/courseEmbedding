httpwwwlogitechcom ■ guerrino de luca had the experience that logitech needed when he became its president and chief executive officer in  he was an engineer who knew marketing under his direction sales of logitech products exploded in  after  years in existence the company sold its 00 millionth mouse it sold its 0 millionth mouse in  its 00 millionth in  and its  millionth in  de luca led logitech into new markets such as those of webcams and gameconsole controllers rivaling ibm and microsoft in the worldwide sales of computer peripherals apple de luca received a bachelors degree in electrical engineering from the university of rome he began his career at italys olivetti working in research and development and eventually becoming the manager of product development and sales for olivettis networking unit after  years at olivetti he took a job at apple spending most of his time in paris where he took charge of apples european marketing in april  he guerrino de luca apwide world photos  was appointed president of claris corporation a subsidiary of apple that developed personal software in the mids apple was suffering from net losses and demoralized management and in february  de luca was appointed executive vice president of marketing and made responsible for directing apples worldwide sales efforts he worked hour days seven days a week trying to repair apples sales efforts until he quit out of exhaustion leaving the company on september   logitech logitech had had problems in the s when personalcomputer sales dipped in  logitech mouse sales dipped as well because the company sold its mice primarily to computer manufacturers logitech proceeded to sell its european and american factories in order to pay debts leaving most of its manufacturing to be carried out in china the then ceo daniel borel decided to try to separate logitech sales from computer sales by emphasizing direct retail markets producing peripherals that computer owners would buy independently in order to enhance their technological experiences in spite of borels efforts logitech continued to suffer from poor marketing strategies until de luca joined as president and ceo in february  with borel becoming chairman of the board de luca brought to his work an ebullient personality and a mischievous streak as well as a talent for mixing comfortably with his employees which enabled him to learn from workers what was working well and what was not he quickly made his presence felt at logitech by reorienting the corporate culture to being consumer rather than technology directed—meaning the company would tout style and special features instead of merely pushing out the latest technological advances de luca pushed wireless and optical computer interfaces he also engineered the purchase in november  of the quickcam division from connectix for  million thus increasing logitechs worldwide share of webcam sales from  to  percent that year logitech introduced the first computer video camera with a builtin microphone from  to  logitechs stock price quadrupled and sales grew  percent annually in  logitech shares were worth  each in august  they were worth  each after briefly hitting a high of  for fiscal  logitech grossed 0 million while netting  million in  logitech pressed into the internet market by introducing itouch software that enhanced keyboard functionality in navigating the web in  logitech provided apple with a new mouse to ship with its macintosh computers logitech was in possession of  percent of the computermouse market worldwide you have your hand on your mouse  percent of the time youre using the pc its about time people paid attention to it de luca told forbescom august   for fiscal  logitech grossed  million netting  million in  personalcomputer sales dropped  percent during a global downturn in the hightech industry yet logitech stock increased 0 percent on sales of  million and profits of  million de luca remarked on forbescom  we are in the pc industry but we are not influenced by pc sales november   that is his marketing strategy had successfully persuaded retail consumers to buy logitech products not as necessary components of new computers but as enhancements for computers they already owned in   percent of logitechs income resulted from retail sales the remaining  percent being earned through personalcomputer manufacturers in january  de luca dyed his hair fuschia before a meeting with zurich bankers which he had promised to do if his sales staff met their goals for  the incident solidified his reputation as a goodnatured leader his daughter told him his pink hair was cool in  logitech expanded into the gameconsole market by introducing a cordless joystick and a steering wheel for sonys playstation  in addition de luca directed the purchase of labtech the manufacturer of computer speakers and headsets in  industry analysts and journalists expressed worry over logitechs expansion into accessories for game consoles and handheld computers as well as into the manufacture of trackballs wireless and optical mice and computer video cameras during a period of lagging computer sales yet logitech achieved a  percent gross margin in  while capturing  percent of the world computer video camera market and  percent of the world trackball market and it sold over  million units of a new line of cordless keyboardmouse combination financial analysts had trouble understanding how logitechs opticalmouse sales remained strong de luca noted that his companys own survey indicated that consumers liked the way the optical mice glowed he had hired a european design firm to create mice that were not only comfortable in the hand but looked sleek and stylish logitech ads showed him smiling and toying with mice that were both functional and beautiful in  logitech reached  billion in revenue for the first time for the fiscal year  logitech netted  million still in business week de luca insisted we can never afford to think we walk on water june   reminding himself that any success could be fleeting but he seemed to have tapped into an essential truth in marketing people want beauty in their lives even in everyday tools such as mice and keyboards and will pay for it see also entry on logitech international sa in international directory of company

chief executive officer logitech international – sidelights guerrino de luca has guided logitech international into one of the worlds most successful makers of computer peripherals as president and chief executive officer since  de luca has overseen the companys entry into the retail sector with welltimed launches of the newest mice game controllers digital pens and even mp and bluetooth wireless accessories he credits his long stint with apple computer as key to helping logitech become dominant in its market i learned a lot about products he told kim girard in chief executive  a lot about designing and ease of use and how to think of the customer and the consumer and the user first born in  de luca hails from lanciano a town near rome italy he attended the university of rome and after earning a degree in electrical engineering went to work for one of italys biggest companies olivetti founded as a manufacturer of typewriters early in the twentieth century olivetti was branching out into consumer electronics by the time de luca joined it including video display terminals and the first rudimentary computers that offered videotext services over telephone lines in the preinternet era to european consumers he eventually rose to become director of olivettis networking products division before moving over to apple computer de luca rose to head apples european marketing division before being made chief executive officer for claris apples independent software maker in  by that time apples onceimpressive sales figures had slowed down but under de lucas management claris did well and even entered the top ten rankings among the worlds software companies in  when apple chief executive of ficer gil amelio shifted some of his executives in a reorganization plan designed to rescue apples stillplummeting sales and reputation de luca was put in charge of worldwide marketing he was even predicted as a possible future ceo of apple himself but  brought many other changes for the company among them the return of one of its founders steve jobs and amelio was soon ousted jobs became apples ceo and with that de luca resigned from the company a year later he candidly admitted to a reporter for a london newspaper that while he had immense respect for jobs whom he conceded may be the greatest most creative person on earth he told cliff joseph in the independent  hes not a nice person to work with a year later de luca moved on to logitech which had been founded  years earlier in switzerland as president and chief executive officer up until this point logitech was a relatively unknown maker of mice and other computer peripherals its revenues relied on deals it struck with computer manufacturers like hewlettpackard and dell to produce the mice that came along in the box with the pc hardware and monitor de luca with his excellent track record in marketing strategies was brought aboard to help establish the companys products on the consumer market by themselves the advantages of this plan were twofold logitech products if sold separately at retail netted the company much higher profit margins than in contracts with computer manufacturers secondly if the personal computer market slowed or even stalled users were still likely to purchase the latesttechnology mouse or other peripheral as a budgetconscious upgrade de luca believed it crucial that logitech seek out new technologies and one of his first major scores at the company involved its acquisition of a webcam manufacturer connectix for  million at the end of  logitech executives had originally hesitated over the deal because they had been working on their own version of a webcam but the decision proved lucrative in the end during the next three years logitech sold 0 million worth of webcams mostly to homecomputer users it was a segment of the market that had been largely ignored in favor of courting large corporate business which proved uneasy with moving into the videoconferencing frontier de luca moved forward with other new products most of them priced under 00 such as speakers microphones gaming controllers for sony playstation  and a new wireless mouse and keyboard combination even he could sometimes err he admitted to investors business daily writer patrick seitz citing the wirelessperipheral package as one example of a time when logitech nearly missed the boat fresh from my marketing skills at apple i said people dont buy combination products they buy the best mouse or the best keyboard he told seitz i was profoundly wrong de luca has been credited with helping logitechs financial performance surge ahead in the peripherals market in  the year after he became ceo logitech posted sales of  million three years later that figure had more than doubled to 0 million its stock traded on the swiss stock exchange and the nasdaq global select market was a favorite of analysts and investors alike with the price of its share quadrupling since de luca came on board furthermore the strategy to enter the retail market had proved wise there had indeed come a downturn in computer sales during the recession that began in  but logitech had done surprisingly well despite it as home users opted to upgrade their mice or keyboard or add new webcam technology instead of replacing the entire desktop or notebook computer perhaps recalling his time at apple de luca has deliberately tried to cultivate a good working relationship with his staff at logitech which has offices in fremont california he once issued a target goal to his sales force and promised he would dye his hair pink if it were achieved it was and he did turning up at a conference of investment bankers in switzerland with fuchsia highlights it really tested my selfconfidence de luca recalled in an interview with businessweek  but people thought this guy comes from california and even if we dont understand it it must be ok he lives in san francisco with his wife daniela who is an artist they have two grown daughters sources businessweek  february   chief executive  july  p  independent london england september   p  investors business daily  october
