companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations by beth laurence jd share on google plus share on facebook a limited liability company llc offers protection from personal liability for business debts just like a corporation however unlike a corporation which must pay its own taxes an llc is a passthrough tax entity the profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship moreover while setting up an llc is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship running one is significantly easier than running a corporation here are the main features of an llc limited personal liability like shareholders of a corporation all llc owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims this means that if the business itself cant pay a creditor  such as a supplier a lender or a landlord  the creditor cannot legally come after an llc members house car or other personal possessions because only llc assets are used to pay off business debts llc owners stand to lose only the money that theyve invested in the llc this feature is often called limited liability exceptions to limited liability while llc owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions this protection is not absolute this drawback is not unique to llcs however  the same exceptions apply to corporations an llc owner can be held personally liable if he or she personally and directly injures someone personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the llc defaults fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees wages intentionally does something fraudulent illegal or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else or treats the llc as an extension of his or her personal affairs rather than as a separate legal entity this last exception is the most important if owners dont treat the llc as a separate business a court might decide that the llc doesnt really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts to keep this from happening make sure you and your coowners act fairly and legally do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors creditors or other outsiders fund your llc adequately invest enough cash in the business so that your llc can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities keep llc and personal business separate get a federal employer identification number open up a businessonly checking account and keep your personal finances out of your llc accounting books create an operating agreement having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your llcs separate existence for more on this see nolos article the llc operating agreement for more information on llc limited liability protection and the differences in state laws see  llcs and limited  liability  what protection do you get   additional protection business insurance a good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not for instance if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a clients back your liability insurance policy should cover you insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court in addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations insurance can protect the llcs assets from lawsuits and claims but your llc wont be protected if it doesnt pay its bills commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts whether or not theyre personally guaranteed for more information on insurance see nolos article obtaining small business insurance llc taxes unlike a corporation an llc is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes instead it is what the irs calls a passthrough entity like a partnership or sole proprietorship this means that business income passes through the business to the llc members who report their share of profits  or losses  on their individual income tax returns each llc member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the irs while an llc itself doesnt pay taxes coowned llcs must file form  an informational return with the irs each year this form which partnerships also have to file sets out each llc members share of the llcs profits or losses which the irs reviews to make sure llc members are correctly reporting their income for more information on llc taxes see nolos article how llcs are taxed llc management the owners of most small llcs participate equally in the management of their business this arrangement is called member management there is an alternative management structure  somewhat awkwardly called manager management  in which you designate one or more owners or even an outsider to take responsibility for managing the llc the nonmanaging owners sometimes family members who have invested in the company simply sit back and share in llc profits in a managermanaged llc only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the llc choosing manager management sometimes makes sense but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities for more information see nolos limited liability company llc faq forming an llc to create an llc you file articles of organization in some states called a certificate of organization or certificate of formation with the llc division of your state government this office is often in the same department as the corporations division which is usually part of the

which you need only specify a few basic details about your llc such as its name and address and contact information for a person involved with the llc usually called a registered agent who will receive legal papers on its behalf some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the llc members in addition to filing articles of organization you must create a written llc operating agreement you dont have to file your operating agreement with the state but that doesnt mean you can get by without one the operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the

management services are intended for use by our insureds  on a limited basis however we will provide products liability risk management services on a feeforservice basis  for more information please contact our risk management department at riskmanagementmedmarccom or at  is the fact that a product is approved by the fda sufficient enough information about the product to obtain a quote from medmarc fda approval of a product is important to the underwriting analysis as is the regulatory history of the company but it is not sufficient information for medmarc’s underwriters to provide a coverage quote in order to understand the company’s risk profile and coverage needs underwriters also will require information about the company’s size financial condition management team operations loss history and other information related to the company’s history and product lines what is medmarc’s capacity for medmarc’s products liability policy our capacity is  million per policy  for our manufacturers’ errors and omissions eo policy our capacity is  million   capacity is subject to underwriting and is not available for all applicants  what is medmarcs target risk medmarc provides coverage for the manufacturers and distributors of medical devices pharmaceuticals biotechnology in vitro diagnostics personal hygiene products and animal care products  we cover both original equipment manufacturers oems and contract manufacturers  we cover companies at every stage of their evolution—from clinical trialstage startups to multinational companies with extensive product lines what risk management services does medmarc provide through our risk management department medmarc helps medical technology and life sciences companies manage their products liability risks  we can identify your potential products liability exposures through our risk assessment process and then help you develop and implement strategies to mitigate your risk   we provide assistance with areas of your operations that tend to give rise to products liability such as supply chains product warnings and instructions for use and manufacturing procedures  there is a close association between regulatory compliance and products liability  for this reason we offer a variety of services designed to help companies comply with fda requirements  we also provide employee training that is designed to heighten awareness about products liability risk and the impact that it can have on your operations and bottom line will medmarc accept other carriers’ applications yes  medmarc is happy to accept applications from other carriers but please be aware that we may require additional information as a distributor do i need products liability coverage we recommend that distributors purchase their own products liability insurance policies  if a distributor is required to repackage or install a product or if the distributor provides training on the use of the product the distributor may have a potential exposure that is not typically covered under the manufacturer’s policy  furthermore independent acts of negligence on the part of the distributor typically would not be covered under the manufacturer’s policy or by contractual indemnification agreements a us distributor that imports products from a manufacturer located outside of the united states should be aware that the foreign manufacturer’s policy may not provide coverage in the us or may not provide coverage for the defense of claims in the us which could become very costly  medmarc’s risk management department has published an article that explains distributor risks the article is titled “why distributors may be more  vulnerable to products liability than they realize” and it is available on medmarc’s website in our resource library does your policy cover sales representatives “sales reps” the actions or omissions of sales reps when acting in the scope of their employment are covered under medmarc’s products liability insurance coverage such circumstances include when sales reps  provide product consultations  make device technical adjustments  are present in operating rooms during surgeries to answer questions deemed essential for patient care or  are present during patient monitoring visits to ensure compliance with clinical trial protocols by surgical staff and nurses for more information see the ask an expert by fran stockwell “do distributors require professional liability insurance coverage in addition to products liability insurance coverage”   does your policy cover explants of implantable devices our products liability policy covers explantations ie the surgical removal of implantable devices only when the product causes the patient harm what is the difference between a claimsmade policy and an occurrence policy insurance coverage can either be on a claims made or occurrence basis these terms refer to what the policy covers during the policy period a claimsmade policy provides insurance for claims made during a policy year or tail period regardless of when the loss occurred and an occurrence policy provides insurance for losses that occurred only during the policy year as specified on the declarations form a claims made policy provides coverage for claims made and reported during the policy term as long as they were made after the retroactive date the retroactive date is the start date of the first claimsmade policy obtained so long as it has been kept active via renewal that date remains the same and is not advanced as long as the policy is renewed for example if a client first obtains claimsmade coverage on october   and it is now  and theyve maintained the same coverage their claimsmade policy covers all incidents since october   if the client no longer has coverage in  and a patient sues in  for an incident that occurred in  the client does not have coverage for that incident unless they purchased tail coverage  an occurrence policy in contrast covers incidents that occur but are not necessarily reported during the term the policy is in force for example if a client obtained an occurrence policy covering  and a patient is injured by the clients product in  but does not sue for their injuries until  the client has coverage from their  policy even if they are no longer insured will medmarc provide coverage for nonmedical products because of our familiarity and longstanding connection with this industry we recognize that life sciences companies sometimes have product lines that include nonmedical products often we can accommodate this coverage need  your medmarc underwriter can answer any questions you might have about covering nonmedical products and will walk you through specific coverage options for your insureds what information do you need to assess a clinical trial risk for clinical trial submissions include the draft or final study protocol and the patient informed consent document in order to expedite our review how do i obtain a quote for manufacturers errors and omissions eo coverage from medmarc the eo application can be found here along with a completed application your medmarc underwriter simply needs a sample of your client’s contracts or purchase orders that they use with their customers how does medmarc calculate minimum premiums minimum premiums differ depending on
