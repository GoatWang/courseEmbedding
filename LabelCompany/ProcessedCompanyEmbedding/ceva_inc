can be greatly simplified by choosing from a wide variety of processor and hardware ip that is optimized for advanced wireless communications applications and that supports different modes of operation and different communications standards integrates powerful vector capabilities alongside general computation engines combines the hardware platform with a wide range of readily available phy and mac software ip is backed by access to advanced support tools including reference platforms and software development kits target markets wireless terminals smartphones tablets and data cards demand support for standards such as lte and ltea hspa wcdma tdscdma and legacy gsmgprsedge iot and cellular mm iot devices and mm comms require multiple wireless communication standards including lte
