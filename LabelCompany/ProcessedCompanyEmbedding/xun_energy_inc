landowner the person who generally owns all or part of the minerals under his lands and is entitled to lease the same lease  a legal instrument executed by a mineral owner granting exclusive right to another to explore drill and produce oil and gas from a piece of land  used in conjunction with the actual location of a wells or unit leasehold an oil and gas property that is leased from the land owner for a royalty based on production of oil and gas from the property as developed by the leasee lessee the person who receives the lease sometimes called the tenant lessor the person giving the

overriding royalty or similar burden offset well  a well drilled on the next location to the original well the distance from the first well to the offset well depends upon spacing regulations and whether the original well produces oil or gas  a well drilled on one tract of land to prevent the drainage of oil or gas to an adjoining tract where a well is being drilled or is already producing oil  gas lease a contract between mineral owner otherwise known as the lessor and a company or working interest owner otherwise known as the lessee in which the lessor grants the lessee the right to explore drill and produce oil gas and other minerals for a specified primary term and as long thereafter as oil gas or other minerals are being produced in paying quantities this lease gives the lessee a working interest the oil and gas lease is granted in exchange for royalty payments to the lessor it is simply a ticket to hunt oil well a well that produces crude oil which is not associated with natural gas operator company which operates an oil and gas lease either on its own behalf or if a member of a consortium on behalf of lessee’s takes primary responsibility for daytoday operations for an activity exploration development or production on the oil and gas lease override royalty an overriding royalty interest can be assigned from a working interest owner to a person an overriding royalty interest may also be generated by someone who has leased a person’s minerals and then assigns their leasehold to a working interest owner and retains an override neither a royalty nor overriding royalty interest owner pays any well costs associated with the drilling recompletion or workover of a well they also do not pay any of the monthly operating expenses associated with a well like mineral and royalty owners the owner of overriding royalty interests receives a portion of the income from the production of oil and gas the main difference is that the owner of an overriding royalty does not own the minerals under the ground only proceeds from the production of minerals once the lease has expired and production has ceased the overriding royalty interest expires conversely the owners of minerals and royalties maintain their ownership after production ceases plug to fill a well’s borehole with cement or other impervious material to prevent the flow of water gas or oil

plugging a well to fill up the borehole of an abandoned well with mud and cement to prevent the flow of water or oil from one strata to another or to the surface in the industry’s early years wells were often improperly plugged or left open modern practice requires that an abandoned well be properly and securely plugged property land covered by the oil and gas lease production the process of extracting crude oil or natural gas from the underground formations to the surface via natural reservoir pressures or by artificial lift proved developed reserves proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered i through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and ii through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well proved reserves proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible  from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time i the area of the reservoir considered as proved includes a the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts if any and b adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can with reasonable certainty be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data ii in the absence of data on fluid contacts proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons lkh as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience engineering or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty iii where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil hko elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty iv reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques including but not limited to fluid injection are included in the proved classification when a successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and b the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities including government entities proved undeveloped reserves undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion i reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances ii undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time iii under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty

pump jack a pump jack nodding donkey pumping unit horsehead pump beam pump sucker rod pump srp grasshopper pump thirsty bird jack pump is the over ground drive for a reciprocating piston pump in an oil well it is used to mechanically lift liquid out of the well if there is not enough bottom hole pressure for the liquid to flow all the way to the surface reservoir a subsurface porous permeable or naturally fractured rock body in which oil or gas are stored most reservoir rocks are limestones dolomites sandstones or a combination of these the four basic types of hydrocarbon reservoirs are oil volatile oil dry gas and gas condensate an oil reservoir generally contains three fluids—gas oil and water—with oil the dominant product in the typical oil reservoir these fluids become vertically segregated because of their different densities gas the lightest occupies the upper part of the reservoir rocks water the lower part and oil the intermediate section in addition to its occurrence as a cap or in solution gas may accumulate independently of the oil if so the reservoir is called a gas reservoir associated with the gas in most instances are salt water and some oil volatile oil reservoirs are exceptional in that during early production they are mostly productive of light oil plus gas but as depletion occurs production can become almost totally completely gas volatile oils are usually good candidates for pressure maintenance which can result in increased reserves in the typical dry gas reservoir natural gas exists only as a gas and production is only gas plus fresh water that condenses from the flow stream reservoir in a gas condensate reservoir the hydrocarbons may exist as a gas but when brought to the surface some of the heavier hydrocarbons condense and become a liquid rod sucker rod steel rods that are screwed together to form a “string” that connects the pump inside a well’s tubing down hole to the pump jack on the surface pumping rods royalty a percentage interest in the value of production from a lease that is retained and paid to the mineral rights owner the share of the production or proceeds therefrom reserved to the lessor under the terms of the mineral lease normally royalty interests are free of all costs of production as distinguished from costs of marketing except production taxes and is established in the lease by reserving a royalty which is usually expressed fractionally ie  service rig a service rig is a piece of equipment which is used for servicing wells such as oil and gas wells service rigs are not intended for drilling but for the completion of other tasks related to operating oil and gas wells some companies which operate wells maintain their own service rigs while others prefer to rent them because they can be very expensive specialty crews run service rigs when they are needed for routine maintenance and emergencies swab a tool which is lowered down the pipe on a wire line the swab is then pulled out of the hole as it travels up the pipe rubber elements expand so that the fluid in the pipe is trapped above the swab and pushed to the surface this operation is necessary when the formation

five billion we also forward split our outstanding common stock on an  basis management believed that with the name change recapitalization and forward split the company was better positioned to pursue other business opportunities on december   the company executed a letter of intent with global energy acquisitions llc “gea” which provided in part for the company to acquire from gea a  gross royalty interest in up to  producing oil wells in kentucky closing of the transaction was subject to completion by each party of their own due diligence and the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement after further review gea elected to terminate the letter of intent and neither party would be under any contractual obligation to the other with respect to closing the transaction on february   xun energy established two subsidiaries in the state of kentucky we hired mr m grubb to be its operations manager in kentucky the business model was to acquire oil and gas leases with a proven history of oil production and work the abandoned oil and gas wells the company focused its efforts on reentering existing oil and gas wells that previously produced oil and gas or were producing oil and gas at a fractional output compared to early drilling activity the company would undertake workover activities that included one or more of varieties of remedial operations on producing wells or inactive wells to try to increase production on february   xun energy closed on the acquisition of three oil and gas leases in kentucky on march   xun energy completed its first workover well xun on march   xun energy produced  barrels of kentucky sweet crude oil from its first workover oil well xun this was an important milestone for the company as we sold the oil which generated the first revenue for the company in its history of operations unfortunately the well bore was badly damaged from a previous workover and ceased producing after several days of production the company abandoned the oil well as the cost of repairing the damage was greater than drilling a new offset well on april   the company filed a form k super k with the sec disclosing that the company is no longer a shell and produced oil that was sold and generated its first revenue for the company on may   the company accepted an offer to purchase from lea kennedy dba luxembarings “purchaser” to purchase  million of the company’s common stock based on the average of  consecutive trading day’s close prior to date of closing the offer to purchase was scheduled to close on or before june   the purchaser failed to complete the transaction after mutually agreed extensions of the closing date the failure of the purchaser to complete the transaction caused damage to the company the company ran out of cash and could not operate or maintain its oil and gas leases in kentucky as a result the company forfeited its oil and gas leases while attempting to raise capital to continue operations in kentucky the company has retained legal counsel to take legal action against the purchaser for failing to complete the purchase transaction and for damages to the company as a result of the failure to complete the transaction    with the loss of properties in kentucky and after having consulted with current and potential investors xun energy shifted its business model and began to research other venues for oil and gas properties venues that historically produce high outputs of oil and gas such as in the states of texas oklahoma pennsylvania kansas and canada although potential investors were prepared to invest more funds than what needed to do kentucky workover and exploration xun energy began negotiations for higher quality leases it also diversified its affiliations with new investor sources with interest in oil and gas production in november  xun energy began action to acquire the west crockett prospect in west texas the project consisted of six  sparsely drilled and yet to be fully developed leases totaling  acres of leasehold on which the first well was drilled in  the field still produces today the companys plan was to acquire the leases and begin an aggressive development program of drilling and completing  oil wells increasing production from the current  to  barrels oil per month bopm to oil production output of  barrels of oil per month within  months of closing on february   the company entered into an acquisition agreement which when closed would transfer the west crockett prospect to xun energy closing was scheduled for april   and amended to close on or before may   xun energy could not arrange enough financing for the  million acquisition on the tight schedule required and this resulted in xun energy losing its earnest deposit currently xun energy is extracting oil from its working pennsylvania rice property and actively negotiating to acquire additional properties in texas in  concurrently company
