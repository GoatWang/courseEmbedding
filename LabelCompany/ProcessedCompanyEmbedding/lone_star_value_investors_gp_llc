portfolio holdings new positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore

class of investment are managed futures   commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because hedge funds are usually

value seeks to upgrade ciber’s board of directors lone star value seeks to upgrade cibers board of directors criticizes boards poor performance corporate governance and compensation practicesnominates slate of three highlyqualified independent director candidates feb    et from lone star value management llc new york feb   prnewswire  lone star value management llc together with its affiliates lone star value we or us is a significant longterm shareholder of ciber inc ciber or the company nyse cbr with ownership of approximately  million shares of common stock  lone star value announced today that it delivered a formal notice to ciber of its intention to nominate three director candidates for election to the board of directors of ciber the board at the upcoming  annual meeting of ciber shareholders the  annual meeting lone star value is dedicated to enhancing shareholder value and improving shareholder rights for all ciber shareholders  in our view upgrading the incumbent board is a critical first step for shareholders to realize our goals lone star value believes that cibers stock is deeply undervalued due in large part to failures of oversight by the incumbent board and poor corporate governance  we fear many of the incumbent board members are more focused on their director fees and the prestige of serving on a public board in their hometown of denver than they are on maximizing value for cibers shareholders  during chairman jacobs tenure as a board member for example cbr stock has declined by more than  while he has made over  million in director fees  in addition average board member compensation during chairman jacobs tenure has risen from approximately  per year to approximately  per year and is paid mainly in cash  not the compensation terms shareholders want to see in a turnaround situation  as a sign of a poorly performing board management team turnover has been alarmingly high over the past ten years with four different ceos and four different cfos  we believe the incumbent board until very recently has repeatedly failed to find a suitable ceo to lead the company toward profitability and performance in line with its peers  cibers dismal operating performance for example is represented by a cumulative net loss to shareholders of more than  million share since  in gaap earnings and it has reported annual net losses in gaap earnings every year since  while its industry peers were much more profitable during this time period to be clear we have tremendous confidence in cibers new ceo michael boustridge  we believe he and his management team are beginning to execute on a longawaited turnaround of cibers operations as evidenced by cibers improved financial results in q   of course the incumbent board will try to take credit for hiring mr boustridge as ceo but it should be pointed out that the incumbent board only hired mr boustridge as ceo after our activist effort was initiated a year ago after lone star value gained representation on the board and after it had become undeniable that the previous ceo david peterschmidt hired by chairman paul jacobs had been a failure over his year tenure  we also have deep respect for ciber board member and company founder bobby stevenson both for founding the company and for owning almost  of its stock  unlike the other board members we believe mr stevenson thinks like an owner and is much more focused on shareholder value creation than his director fees we believe this board has failed in one of the most important roles for any board  recruiting the right management talent and creating the right incentives by compensating them based on performance  cibers unfortunate history with its former ceo mr peterschmidt is a strong example of the boards failure in this regard  chairman jacobs hired david peterschmidt as ceo in july  a time when ciber was in desperate need of a turnaround but unfortunately mr peterschmidt had no turnaround expertise  two years into mr peterschmidts tenure the board had apparently become concerned about his performance and decided to appoint mr boustridge to the board so he could step in as ceo if needed  a direct quote from chairman jacobs in  clearly explains the reasoning behind adding mr boustridge to the board in  michael was brought onto our board two years ago with succession planning in mind  we are fortunate to have a strong and qualified candidate with global operating experience  and because michael has been on our board he has a perspective of the role that no outside candidate could bring yet despite every indication that mr peterschmidt was grossly underperforming and had been for two years the board did nothing about it for another two years  it was not until lone star value launched a campaign to seek change on the board in  that cibers incumbent directors finally took action to replace the failed ceo  even then this board which well knew that mr boustridge would replace mr peterschmidt as ceo still renewed mr peterschmidts contract on march   and kept him on the payroll as a consultant for an additional year after his replacement as ceo  this board led by chairman jacobs rewarded mr peterschmidt with an exit package worth more than  million  mr peterschmidts exit package included a  oneyear consulting contract  cbr shares medical benefits moving costs from colorado to california closing costs related to the sale of mr peterschmidts home and the cost of renewing his executives status as a global services member on united airlines for two years  we believe mr peterschmidts superfluous addition to his compensation package was completely unnecessary and not required by his employment contract – essentially it was a tip while presiding over a period of disruptive management turnover and unnecessary compensation practices the board has also continually had poor corporate governance which is a sure sign of an entrenched board  the board has shown little appetite for fresh perspective in the boardroom with barely any turnover over the last  years  further the board has sought to stifle shareholders ability to seek change on the board through among other things a classified board structure and an absolute prohibition on the shareholders ability to call special meetings or act by written consent  leading proxy advisory firm institutional shareholders services iss rates cibers overall corporate governance with the lowest possible governance score of  on a scale of  to  with  indicating maximum corporate governance risk  two specific corporate governance areas have been highlighted by iss in its  grade maximum governance risk rating – shareholder rights and executive compensation furthermore through the course of our involvement with ciber the board has shown disregard for shareholder input and nonchalance in breaking its contractual commitments to shareholders  last year pursuant to an agreement with lone star value the incumbent board agreed to add a shareholder representative on the board richard coleman who has added tremendous value in the boardroom and whom we are renominating for election to the board this year in our agreement the board committed to actively search for two additional board members in order to upgrade and enhance the talent on the board  in the year since then one director betsy atkins joined the board but promptly resigned after only three months  other than that there is no evidence that the board took its obligations to upgrade and enhance the talent on the board seriously  in failing to replace ms atkins and to add an additional new director the board led by mr jacobs failed to honor its responsibilities to shareholders and its agreement with us lone star value has clearly expressed its views on the urgent need for improvement of cibers board and corporate governance practices to chairman jacobs in numerous calls and emails  the incumbent board has so far refused to make the necessary changes to avoid a proxy contest  we have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the behavior of the incumbent board will not change unless the personnel changes  we are convinced that reconstituting the board is imperative to improving shareholder value and rights  an upgraded board will be in a far stronger position to help the new management team in their continuing turnaround efforts at ciber  accordingly lone star value today submitted formal nominations of three highlyqualified director candidates richard k coleman jr robert g pearse and joshua schechter for election to the board at the  annual meeting  our nominees experience encompasses technology telecom business services financial and turnaround expertise  messrs coleman pearse and schechter not only possess substantial and relevant turnaround experience and a wellbalanced mix of skills but each also boasts an exceptional track record of creating shareholder value  each is committed to the highest levels of corporate

search lone star value nominates five candidates for election to board of dakota plains lone star value nominates five candidates for election to board of dakota plains seeks to upgrade board overhaul corporate governance and maximize stockholder value mar    et from lone star value management llc old greenwich conn march   prnewswire  lone star value management llc together with its affiliates lone star value we or us the largest stockholder of dakota plains holdings inc dakota plains or the company nyse mkt dakp with ownership of approximately  of the companys outstanding shares announced today that it has formally nominated five candidates for election to the companys board of directors the board at the companys upcoming  annual meeting of stockholders the  annual meeting lone star value a stockholder of dakota plains since early  is committed to maximizing value for all dakota plains stockholders by upgrading and replacing the existing board overhauling the companys corporate governance and compensation policies and running a proper strategic alternatives process we believe the companys poor stock price performance is a direct result of the failures of the ceo and incumbent board  we are confident our five nominees will dramatically improve the board by adding a stockholders perspective and the required expertise to improve performance  we believe the need for an immediate upgrade to the board is undeniable given dakota plains stock price decline of  during craig mckenzies tenure as ceo and its decline of  since the board was partially reconstituted last year as we have noted in prior press releases dakota plains ceo craig mckenzie and chairman adam kroloff have a long history of destroying stockholder value beyond dakota plains canadian superior energy inc  stock price declined over  while mckenzie served as ceo and toreador resources corporation  stock price massively underperformed peer group while mr mckenzie served as ceo and declined more than  while mr kroloff served as a director under pressure from lone star value dakota plains made several defensive and unilateral changes to the board and bylaws in february   the board also made multiple claims and promises to stockholders that it has failed to keep in what can only be seen as a ploy to gain support prior to last years annual meeting dakota plains announced a strategic alternatives process in february  the board has failed to show any progress in its strategic alternatives process and terminated its advisors a few months ago after incurring  million in costs in   we believe the companys original announcement was just for show and question whether a legitimate process was ever truly pursued in december  dakota plains issued very precise ebitda guidance for  of  million with ceo mckenzie saying at the time while the volumes we are providing in our  guidance represent significant growth over  i believe they will prove to be conservative… we dont make guidance lightly  those who follow the company would know we didnt provide guidance at all last year  and so with  million of the ebitda guidance were certainly seeing that is something that we can deliver for stockholders and based on ongoing discussions were hopeful that well be in a position to do even better  ceo mckenzie reaffirmed this guidance a few months later stating we are right in line with our  plan…and we have no reason to believe that were not going to be meeting our guidance so therefore today it is reiterated in may of  ceo mckenzie removed dakota plains  guidance citing a change in market conditions  either he did not understand the companys profit drivers in december  or he issued misleading guidance and reiterated this guidance in an attempt to create stockholder support ahead of the  annual meeting the companys actual ebitda for  was  million  below the ceos december  forecast the board claimed to be acting in the best interest of its stockholders but has unilaterally adopted numerous antistockholder provisions contrary to best corporate governance practices such as amending the bylaws to prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent and calling special meetings until the conclusion of the  annual meeting further amending the bylaws prior to the conclusion of the  annual meeting to perpetuate the suspension of such critical stockholder rights until the conclusion of the  annual meeting and adopting a poison pill earlier in january  we firmly believe that each of these stockholderunfriendly changes should have been approved by stockholders prior to their adoption in accordance with best corporate governance practices rather than being unilaterally adopted by the incumbent board to us these violations of stockholder rights and broken promises can only be explained by a desire by the incumbent board to stay in power another year and enrich themselves at stockholders expense  again we would like to remind stockholders that the companys stock price has declined  since the board was partially reconstituted in february   it is evident to us that significant changes to the board are necessary given the companys continued underperformance under the leadership of the incumbent board we believe another major factor contributing to the destruction of stockholder value at dakota plains is the extravagant compensation packages given to ceo mckenzie and the members of the board  the compensation paid to ceo mckenzie during his first two years for example totaled approximately  million  this amount equates to a staggering  of the companys ebitda during this period  in addition board members each receive compensation totaling  in cash and stock per year which we believe is excessive given the companys size and poor performance given the significant value destruction that has persisted under the incumbent board lone star value calls on the board to hold the  annual meeting without delay in order to allow stockholders to elect representatives who have their best interests in mind at this critical stage for the company  we further call on the board to terminate the poison pill immediately and to refrain from taking any of the following actions prior to the  annual meeting without prior stockholder approval delaying the  annual meeting maintaining the poison pill making any acquisitions issuing equity or equitylinked securities or adopting any corporate governance changes that serve to further entrench the board including classifying the board lone star value would like to remind each of the incumbent directors that they have a fiduciary duty to act in stockholders best interests and any breaches thereof may have serious personal consequences that may even result in personal liability under certain circumstances if elected our independent nominees would commit to the following actions at dakota plains implement a payforperformance structure for management to better align executive compensation with stockholder value creation reduce board compensation review all expenses especially corporate overhead with a goal of significantly reducing all corporate costs improve corporate governance and analyze all strategic alternatives over the short medium and long term with a sole goal of maximizing value for stockholders lone star values nominees lone star value has nominated five highlyqualified director candidates for election to the board at the  annual meeting whose experience encompasses transportation energy investment banking mergers  acquisitions capital markets and turnaround expertise  our nominees are jeff eberwein michael hidalgo kevin rendino josh schechter and galen vetter  we believe our five nominees possess a wellbalanced set of skills that will create

at aviat networks seeks to refresh a stale and entrenched board improve corporate governance and maximize shareholder value by the election of six candidates to aviat’s board october    am eastern daylight time new yorkbusiness wirelone star value management llc “lone star value management” and together with its affiliates and director nominees “lone star value” a significant shareholder in aviat networks inc a delaware corporation “aviat” or the “company” nasdaqavnw with ownership of approximately  million shares of common stock today announced that it had given formal notice to aviat of its intention to nominate director candidates for election to the board of directors of aviat the “board” at the upcoming  annual meeting of aviat shareholders the “ annual meeting” lone star value is dedicated to maximizing shareholder value improving corporate governance and upgrading the board at aviat lone star value notes that aviat’s stock price has declined from  when the current company was formed in january  to a price of  today a decline of over  aviat’s shares have performed poorly due to very disappointing financial and operating performance from  to  for example aviat generated cumulative net losses of almost  million in fact aviat has reported negative earnings in all of the last  years dating back to its creation from the harrisstratex networks merger we believe substantial change is needed at aviat in order to improve performance and this change must start by refreshing and upgrading its board the incumbents of aviat will no doubt ask for more time to turn things around yet it is too much to believe that the same stale board pursuing the same strategy will suddenly find success if elected by our fellow shareholders our board nominees will seek to ensure all actions are taken to realign the business to its core markets and customers in order to return aviat to profitability we will take these actions with a sense of urgency that has not existed with the current board in addition we will diligently evaluate all strategic alternatives to create value for aviat shareholders these changes can only occur with the addition of fresh highlyqualified and independent directors to the board lone star value believes the current aviat board of which six of the eight total members have served together as a team since the company’s creation in  is in dire need of new talent and a fresh perspective we further believe that current management and board compensation are excessive given the company’s  million in cumulative net losses we particularly object to executive chairman kissner’s recentlysigned compensation package which we believe is excessive in view of years of unaddressed poor performance in our opinion kissner’s new employment contract as executive chairman is forcing aviat’s longsuffering shareholders to pay for two ceos aviat should instead create compensation packages with a payforperformance structure to help turn aviat into a profitable organization and to better align incentives with shareholder value creation lone star value has expressed its views to the board and management of aviat in person at company headquarters and in followup conference calls we have engaged in constructive discussions with the company with the goal of meaningfully improving aviat’s board corporate governance practices and shareholder alignment lone star value believes its suggestions would meaningfully improve shareholder rights and representation at aviat unfortunately to date the company has not responded positively to the suggestions made by lone star value and offered us only one board seat which we believe is insufficient change given aviat’s extremely poor longterm track record accordingly lone star value is nominating six highlyqualified director candidates for election to the board at the  annual meeting whose experience encompasses telecom technology financial and turnaround expertise lone star value’s candidates are richard k coleman jr dilip singh robert g pearse jonathan p foster alan l bazaar and jeffrey e eberwein each of whom we believe has significant and relevant experience as well as an exceptional track record of creating shareholder value lone star value’s director nominees possess a wellbalanced mix of skills to ensure that the company evaluates with an open mind and a keen sense of urgency all strategic alternatives to maximize value for all shareholders in addition to lone star value’s six nominees we intend to vote lone star value investors lp’s “lone star value investors” shares for ceo michael antonio pangia and board member raghavendra rau to leverage their knowledge and backgrounds lone star value remains open to continuing its discussions with the board regarding its composition and corporate strategy and remains amenable to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution to reconstitute the board in a manner that is in the best interests of all shareholders in the event an agreement is not reached however lone star value is fully prepared to solicit the support of its fellow shareholders to elect all six of its director nominees at the  annual meeting our nominees if elected will take their fiduciary responsibility very seriously and will represent the interests of all shareholders not just lone star value lone star value’s independent and highlyqualified candidates are richard k coleman jr age  who is the founder and president of rocky mountain venture services since  his company has helped companies plan and launch new business
