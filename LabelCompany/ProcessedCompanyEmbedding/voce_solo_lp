distribution blog discogs amazon login   your cart is empty     yeh c spencer  solo voice ix lp solo voice i  x is the first lp by c spencer yeh devoted entirely to the voice yehs practice has its most obvious precedents in the sound poetry scene of the s and s  recalling an outlier group like the four horsemen at their most raw and averbal as much as the circles and canons forged around postlettrist france  as well as in figures like joan la barbara over the past few years he has moved from virtuosic intensely physical performances to more focused studies whose specific attachment to performance situations and even the body has become increasingly tenuous maintaining a strict fidelity to the specific properties of his voice yeh initially relied only on amplification largely in order to bring into focus a rich grain of otherwise inaudible phenomena before gradually introducing various studio techniques to fold the temporality of performance in on itself here he has edited out the breaths from recordings made in the studio letting his vocalizations run together in palpitating continua the effect is an elision of phrasing as an element of both linguistic and musical convention and an uncanny protraction of the voice into vast hypnotic slurs solo voice i  x resumes the development of techniques and strategies which taken together form a kind of composition unto themselves deftly sequenced by yeh the lp progresses from a series of shorter tracks each honing in on a particular sound or technique towards more openended territory in which the formal rigor of the first half begins to dissolve with yehs voice playing off both silence and itself label info none  us  primary information  € go back         highlight le fruit vert heartbreaking album by this

sessions were recorded a little more than  years ago near the end of tatums life perhaps it was mere coincidence that it came at an end of that era in music as well the shift to rock and roll and rhythm and blues many of the songs are much olderyet it all holds up so well this is acoustic piano played by a man who learned it in the cultural glory days of the parlor player piano the symbol of middle class arrival in its dayin these recordings you hear everything about the piano from a man for whom the piano was everything in tea for two he does what many classical composers have done in writing variations on a simple theme only these are performances as well as compositions there are stories that he could play tea for two for an hour and never repeat the same variation on it twice it has to be heard to be believedif it were possible to build a piano with more than  keys tatum would already know where they were and what to do with themanother of my favorites i didnt know what time it was this is the kind of song sinatra described as a saloon song tatum preserves that quality of the song while making it fit together like a well crafted sonata there are even a few soft diminished chimes the time time to listen to more tatumcomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web address belowproduct not

tarranihall of fametop  revieweron february  format mp musicverified purchasenote this review is for the track album titled solo piano which has also been incorrectly linked to another set by the same name that one contains  tracks if you are scratching your head as you read this review you are probably on the page to which this site erroneously cross linked product pagesthis is mckennas first album as a leader and a truly auspicious start of his long careersince there are sound samples in this page ill refrain from any pretentious analysis and let those convey the essence of the music i will say that mckennas signature sound  especially his left hand  are already prominent in his playing he was twentyfive when this album was recorded for abc records in nyc on october  the song selections are fairly generic for a mid s piano album but its clear that mckenna makes each one his own this album has the same tracks as the original abc  release in  but the session produced two additional tracks  warm valley and limehouse blues  that were included on a reissue titled piano solo that is a two album reissue that you may want to consider that set also contains an outofprint  album titled lullabies of jazz in addition to the two tracks from the  sessionregardless of which way you decide to go you will not go wrong with this album is you are a jazz pianist or a mckenna fan

appealingvivid detailconsunattractive frame designbest usesdecorationfill wall spacegiftcomments about uncommongoods personalized lp recordmy husband is a record collector so when i saw this item on uncommon goods it was a nobrainer to get this as his wedding gift from me it took about  weeks to receive it i was so excited when my husband opened the box until i saw a nick at the top of the wooden frame that was very noticeable i was very upset as id spent a lot of money on this item but he said hed just use a black marker to cover it up and once it was hung he couldnt see the nick anyway he absolutely loves it but im still upset about the amount of money i paid to receive a defective piece of wooden frame the packaging was great so im not quite sure how the nick got there i gave it a  star because of the idea of it and the fact that my husband loves it and doesnt want to send it back for a new onedisplay locationhallwaywas this a giftyeswas this review helpful yes  no  you may also
