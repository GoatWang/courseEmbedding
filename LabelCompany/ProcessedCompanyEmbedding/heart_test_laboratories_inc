affordable screening tools for the early detection of heart disease through continuous development of innovative electrocardiography” the problem heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide us healthcare costs in billions                                                        cardiac testing today asymptomatic patient screening not done on a routine basis because effective low cost tools are not readily available symptomatic patient ecg test – lack of sensitivity as a screening test but used regularly to determine if a heart attack has taken place  ecg based stress test – improved sensitivity over standard ecg  ct scan – used for obtaining a calcium score  ct based angiogram – an alternative to nuclear stress test  nuclear stress test – test showing blood flow to the heart tissue  echocardiogram – used for detecting structural abnormalities  invasive angiogram – gold standard for detecting cad  lack of innovation ecg invented before electronics computers and software circa  medical community has many established practices and procedures using traditional ecg technology technology until recently was not available to properly analyze additional signal data that has been present skills necesary to innovate in this area require multiple disciplines that include mathematics programming and a deep knowledge of cardiac function significant research required to assess the value of using other waveforms and metrics to provide valuable clinical information our solution myovista is a low cost accurate screening test to assist in the assessment of heart disease myovista is an important new screening tool for leading cause of death and largest spend area in healthcare effective screening can help shift focus to earlier lower cost treatments and better patient outcomes targeting the diagnostic gap – a lack of high quality tools for effective low cost heart screening myovista – simple noninvasive electrophysiology based medical device with innovative and intuitive user interface m and  years of time investment to date rd is complete – myovista fully developed and now moving into production with units shipping early  incorporates standard ecg produces conventional ecg tracing with interpretive software and myovista report familiar lead placement – no retraining ideal screening tool physician reimbursement rd completed targeting the diagnostic gap

hypertension or stroke however in the usa there are few validated commercially available noninvasive and accurate techniques to assess cardiac disease with the exception of blood pressure and framingham risk markers all other measurements currently require costly and specialized equipment however the myovista a new noninvasive device is now available for clinical study furthermore and importantly in addition to identifying which patients might progress to later stages of disease the earlier detection may also allow the device to be used to assess therapeutic progress a novel electrocardiographic recording method the myovista obtains and processes signal information in a way that permits high resolution of the electrical activity associated with the myocardium the clinical set up of this technique is identical to traditional lead ecg however the recording is focused on the early detection of myocardial abnormalities by nonlinear analysis of electrophysiological phenomenon propagated by changes of cellular metabolism level in the cardiac muscle and the direction timing and velocity of ion flow this novel assessment may be capable of detecting subclinical myocardial dysfunction in a variety of heart diseases and may be especially of value in patients at risk for coronary artery disease about la biomed founded in  la biomed is one of the countrys

associate professor of medicine in cardiology at mount sinai’s zena and michael a wiener cardiovascular institute and the mariejosée and henry r kravis center for cardiovascular health the clinical study is expected to enroll  patients and take between  months to complete  mount sinai is ranked as a top  hospital for cardiology by us news’  annual survey heart disease is the leading cause of death in the us being responsible for  in every  deaths approx  per year us it is the leading cause of deaths worldwide more than all cancers combined and is the largest spend area in healthcare  heart disease is known as the silent killer because most affected people do not know they have it ie they are asymptomatic more than half of patients find out through an adverse event angina heart attack or even death the “diagnostic gap” in heart disease today is noninvasive low cost screening to identify asymptomatic patients before an adverse event occurs  existing ecg technology is generally not considered effective for use on asymptomatic patients the us preventive services taskforce and other healthcare bodies around the world recommend against screening with resting or exercise electrocardiography ecg for the prediction of coronary heart disease chd events in asymptomatic adults at low risk for chd events htl believes the myovista will provide the opportunity for effective low cost testing for heart disease in primary care this would enable physicians to have a valuable additional tool to assist in the process of determining referrals to a cardiologist “we are excited that mount sinai has decided to initiate an important clinical study of the myovista mount sinai is one of the most respected medical institutions in the world and has a strong reputation for research along with being recognized as a center of excellence in cardiology  our goal is to save lives and save healthcare dollars by both finding people with heart disease much earlier and reducing expensive cardiac testing on people that do not require treatment” stated mark hilz heart test laboratories ceo about heart test laboratories inc “htl” htl develops medical devices using patented technology that focus on the early detection of heart disease the myovista’s innovative technology facilitates the early identification of ischemic and other heart abnormalities which can enable improved screening for coronary arterial disease and other cardiac abnormalities the myovista provides two tests in one and is easy for physicians to use by using standard lead resting ecg protocols the myovista provides an ecg test incorporating interpretive analysis as well as easy to understand proprietary informatics that assist a physician in identifying heart disease at an early stage  the myovista provides additional information to physicians in their decision process to refer patients to a cardiologist for further diagnostic testing and treatment the myovista has a  inch high resolution touchscreen and incorporates user features and functionality commonly associated with a tablet device which make it intuitive and easy to use thereby reducing training time its proprietary informatics provide information to physicians that suggest ischemic and certain types of structural heart abnormalities the myovista is ideally suited for use in both primary care and hospital environments heart disease kills  million people worldwide each year more than all cancers combined and is the largest spend area in healthcare the myovista helps to address the “diagnostic gap” in heart disease today which is the identification of asymptomatic patients prior to an adverse cardiac event such as a heart attack htl expects to seek fda clearance for the myovista in the near future
