the principal venue for his sales was the hungry i a comedy club in san francisco when she discovered his deception she remained silent she later explained her behavior i was afraid of him because he threatened to have me done in if i said anything but margaret even publicly acknowledged him as the artist while later claiming it was tortuous for her she rationalized the situation on the ground that at least they were being shown in  walter began exhibiting the big eyes paintings as his own in february the work was shown on a wall of the bank of america in sausalito he took nine paintings to

expressed outrage calling it the most grotesque announcement yet from the new york worlds fair he described keane as a painter celebrated for grinding out formula pictures of wideeyed children of such appalling sentimentality that his product has become synonymous among critics definition of tasteless hack work the painting contains about  children and hence is about  times as bad as the average keane robert moses stung by the resulting criticism prevented the painting from being displayed at the fair during this time her artwork was sold under the name of her husband walter keane who claimed credit for her paintings at the height of the artworks popularity she was painting nonstop for  hours a day career after walter keaneedit in  keane announced on a radio broadcast she was the real

walter was the real artist at the trial the judge famously ordered both margaret and walter to each create a bigeyed painting in the courtroom to determine who was telling the truth walter declined citing a sore shoulder whereas margaret completed her painting in  minutes after a threeweek trial the jury awarded her  million in damages after the verdict keane said i really feel that justice has triumphed its been worth it even if i dont see any of that four million dollars a federal appeals court upheld the verdict of defamation in  but overturned the  million damage award keane says she doesnt care about the money and just wanted to establish the fact that she had done the paintings the artworks keane created while living in the shadow of her husband tended to depict sadlooking children in dark settings after she left walter moved to hawaii and after years of following astrology palmistry handwriting analysis and transcendental meditation became a jehovahs witness her work took on a happier brighter style the eyes i draw on my children are an expression of my own deepest feelings eyes are windows of the soul keane explains many galleries now advertise her artworks as

to follow their husband’s lead no matter the path although she had been painting since she was a girl ms keane believed a female artist wouldn’t sell as well as a man she never doubted her talent — she paints to this day at her home in napa and sells work at keane eyes gallery in san francisco — but her newfound confidence paralleled the rise of the women’s movement and an acceptance of outsider and pop artists deeply private and now a jehovah’s witness she has an unlikely story placed her in the middle of a profound cultural shiftto prepare for the role ms adams sat with ms keane at her

to margaret” ms adams said drying her eyes “that’s how i knew it was the right fit because when i’m drawn to a character it’s because of the person”when margaret ulbrich met walter keane in the s in san francisco he portrayed himself as a real estate salesman turned painter of parisian street scenes divorced and with a young daughter she saw him as a provider and a romantic “in the beginning he was just the most charming person you could ever meet” ms keane said but a few years into their marriage she discovered a crate of street scenes and realized her husband’s work was actually painted by someone else “he had me completely fooled” she said “i thought he was an artist”confronted with his lie walter convinced her that his muse was just in repose “he’s saying ‘well i’m rusty and i’ll learn if you’ll teach me a little bit’ ” she recalled “and i wanted to believe him and i tried to teach him and then it was my fault he couldn’t learn because i wasn’t teaching him right”meanwhile ms keane’s bigeyed canvases were beginning to draw attention and thanks to walter’s promotional skills buyers as the images gained favor — with the public if not the art world — walter thought to make inexpensive prints and license the urchins for postcards mugs plates and more “he made them famous overnight” ms keane said “i don’t know if they would have ever gotten off the ground otherwise” video

long collected keanes which he had first seen while growing up in suburbia “i found them interesting because i found them quite disturbing” he said “it was like ‘why do you have a picture of a crying child on a wall’ ”the divided response to the work pilloried as kitsch by critics but resurrected as a pop culture fad every few years also attracted him “the polarization of it — some people loved it some people hated it — i’ve experienced that myself” he saidhe commissioned portraits from ms keane and was struck by her demeanor “in some ways” he said “she’s the quietest feminist ‘i am woman you can barely hear me speak’ ” but “underneath there was a spark” he added “this person who could easily be thought of a victim but she wasn’t a victim” advertisement continue reading the main story across from ms adams ms keane’s silver bangles clanking as she talked might have been the loudest things about her though interest in her work and prices on the secondary market have spiked with

sweetly talked about the other qualities they share“we’re polite women who are ornery inside” ms adams said “we’ll get you when you least expect it”that was evident at a questionandanswer session
