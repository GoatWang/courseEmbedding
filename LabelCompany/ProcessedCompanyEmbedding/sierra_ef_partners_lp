fluid released into a wetland in belmont county ohio during construction of rover pipeline sierra club judges dapl ruling reckless spill record pushes pipeline companys shares below  for first time energy transfer partners the company behind the controversial dakota access pipeline and the fracked gas rover pipeline has quite the extensive spill history a new analysis shows after crunching the numbers from the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa thestreet revealed that the dallasbased company spilled hazardous liquids near water crossings more than twice the frequency of any other us pipeline company this decadeaccording to the report the company has spilled hazardous liquids five times near water crossings since 0 when phmsa started collecting detailed data the companys spills account for almost  of all hazardous liquid spills near water crossings since 0 primarily because of a gallon gasoline spill in  near the susquehanna river in lycoming county pennsylvania thestreet only included onshore spills in its analysis and included subsidiary companies since 0 the company has spilled hazardous liquids  times in all ranking only behind enterprise products partners lp epd and magellan midstream partners lp mmp according to thestreets tallyenergy transfer owns about  miles of natural gas natural gas liquids refined products and crude oil pipelines across the countryalexis daniel an energy transfer spokesperson defended the companys safety record not only does energy transfer partners adhere to the approved regulatory standards but it is always energy transfer partners priority to go above and beyond when building pipelines and is a common practice on all projects she told thestreet for example on rover the pipeline route will be flown every ten days weather permitting versus every  days which is the current requirement for visual inspection of the pipelinestill its been a rough few months for energy transfer in may the federal energy regulatory commission ferc rejected the energy transfers request to resume horizontal directional drilling at two sites for the rover pipeline after numerous leaks into ohios wetlands including  million gallons of drilling fluid spill near the tuscarawas river in addition to various clean air and clean water act violations across the state and earlier this week a federal judge ruled that that the trump administration failed to consider the dakota access pipelines impact on the hunting and fishing rights of the standing rock sioux tribe while the ruling did not shut down operations on the oil pipeline which started flowing earlier this month the judge has ordered a new environmental review a day after the judges order energy transfer shares fell to  on friday—the
