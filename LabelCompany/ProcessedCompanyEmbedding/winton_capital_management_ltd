has been authorized and regulated by the fsa in the united kingdom since june  investment goal the investment objective of the diversified program is to achieve long term capital appreciation through compound growth this goal is achieved by pursuing a diversified trading scheme that does not necessarily rely upon favourable conditions in any particular market or on market direction strategy the investment strategy of the winton futures program is to invest globally long and short using leverage in a diversified range of liquid instruments including exchange traded futuresoptions and forwards currency forwards traded over the counter and other related instruments by following a systematic investment process that is based on statistical research winton futures program follows a disciplined investment process that is based on statistical analysis of historical data the initial stage of the process involves collecting cleaning and organizing large amounts of data  the winton futures program uses a wide variety of data inputs including factors that are intrinsic to markets such as price volume and open interest and those that are external to markets such as economic statistics industrial and commodity data and public company financial data winton conducts statistical research into the data in an attempt to quantify the probability of particular markets rising or falling conditional on a variety of quantifiable factors winton’s research is used to develop mathematical models that attempt to forecast market returns the variability or volatility associated with such returns often described as “risk” the correlation between different markets and transaction costs these forecasts are used in investment strategies that determine what positions should be held to maximize profit within a certain range of risk as a result of winton’s research it expects that investments made in accordance with this process will have an improved chance of being successful which is expected to lead to profits over the longterm key personnel david harding chief executive officer  david harding is the founder and ceo of winton capital since graduating from cambridge university
