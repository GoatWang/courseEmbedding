thu may nd  print this article ceterix orthopaedics inc has raised  million in a new round of funding to expand the market for its minimally invasive surgical tools the technology enables surgeons to place stitches in very tight joint compartments while protecting sensitive surrounding structures such as nerves arteries and cartilage this technology has applications in numerous procedures in knees hips and shoulders the company formerly known as suturepro technologies inc released its first product last year aimed initially at helping doctors fix tears of the knees meniscus rather than removing the cartilage and potentially damaging nerves and other structures according to the company more than  physicians in the us use the tools the procedure was developed by justin saliman md an orthopedic surgeon at cedarssinai in los angeles due to the difficulty of access and the limitations of current arthroscopic instruments the vast majority of meniscal tears are not repaired but are either partially or totally resected  said john mccutcheon ceterixs president and ceo in a  press release this means that almost a million patients each year are undergoing procedures that will significantly increase their risk of osteoarthritis later in life previous investors novo as versant ventures and am ventures participated in the round which also included debt financing from silicon valley bank and oxford finance armentum partners acted as financial advisor to ceterix in the transaction in addition ceterix announced the issuance of two key us patents related to methods of meniscal and soft
