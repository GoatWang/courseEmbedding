from a global monk the current abbot damian carr was elected in june  trappist preservesedit in  shortly after their arrival in spencer a small stovetop batch of mint jelly was made by brother john berchmans  one of the monks with mint from their herb garden since monastic austerity at that time precluded the jelly from being served to the monks at meals it was sold at the porters lodge the response to the jelly encouraged the monks to try making and selling other varieties soon jellymaking proved to be a successful and compatible monastic industry contributing about half of the income needed to run the abbey the jams and jellies made by the monks are sold under the brand name trappist preserves and are now available in supermarkets in the united states particularly in the new england region in  the monks produced  million jars of preserves in  flavors turning one and a half tons of fruit into preserves daily  spencer breweryedit the monks concerned with the increasing costs of maintaining the abbey became interested in brewing beer like other trappist monasteries in  several fact finding missions were dispatched—first to the belgian beer fest in boston then to several trappist breweries in europe where they met some skepticism from their european counterparts eventually sympathizing the established brewers made three recommendations for the new enterprise
