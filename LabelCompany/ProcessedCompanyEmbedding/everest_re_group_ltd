suitable value stock now july    am edt by zacks equity research zackscom shutterstock photo value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment after all who wouldnt want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value one way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process lets put everest re group ltd re stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for valueoriented investors right now or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks pe ratio a key metric that value investors always look at is the price to earnings ratio or pe for short this shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world the best use of the pe ratio is to compare the stocks current pe ratio with a where this ratio has been in the past b how it compares to the average for the industrysector and c how it compares to the market as a whole on this front everest has a trailing twelve months pe ratio of  as you can see in the chart below again this level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large as the pe for the sp  stands at about  if we focus on the longterm pe trend everests current pe level puts it on par with its high value over the past five years further the stocks pe compares favorably with the zacks categorized insurance  property and casualty industrys trailing twelve months pe ratio which stands at  this indicates that the stock is undervalued right now compared to its peers however we should also point out that everest has a forward pe ratio price relative to this years earnings of  so it is fair to expect an increase in the companys share price in the near future ps ratio another key metric to note is the pricesales ratio this approach compares a given stocks price to its total sales where a lower reading is generally considered better some people like this metric more than other valuefocused ones because it looks at sales something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings right now everest has a ps ratio of about  this is lower than the industry average which comes in at  right now everest is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the ps metric which suggests that the companys stock price has already appreciated to some degree relative to its sales broad value outlook in aggregate everest currently has a zacks value style score of a putting it into the top  of all stocks we cover from this look this is because some of its other key metrics are favorable for example the peg ratio for everest is just  a level that is lower than the industry average of  the peg ratio is a modified pe ratio that takes into account the stocks earnings growth rate additionally its pcf ratio another great indicator of value comes in at  which is better than the industry average of  clearly re is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles what about the stock overall there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name in particular it is worth noting that the company has a growth grade of c and a momentum score of a this gives re a zacks vgm scoreor its overarching fundamental gradeof a you can read more about the zacks style scores here   meanwhile the companys recent earnings estimates have been encouraging as the current year has seen four upward estimate revision in the past  days compared to none downward while the next year have seen one upward and one downward in the same time frame as a result the current year consensus estimate has moved north by about  in the past two months while the next year estimate has inched higher by  you can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below everest re group ltd price and consensus everest re group ltd price and consensus  everest re group ltd quote this bullish trend is why the stock boasts a zacks rank  buy and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term bottom line everest is an inspired choice for value investors as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front however with a sluggish industry rank bottom  out of  industries it is hard to get too excited about this company overall in fact over the past six months the zacks insurance  property and casualty industry has clearly underperformed the broader market as you can see below so value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn favorable in this name first but once that happen this stock could be a compelling pick looking for stocks with skyrocketing upside zacks has just released a special report

market close zacks earnings esp expected surprise prediction looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive
