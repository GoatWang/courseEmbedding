which provide most home lighting are used in products from nightlights to floodlights the most common incandescent is a pearshaped a bulb with a mediumsized screwtype base incandescent lights use electricity to heat a filament until it glows white hot producing light about  percent of the electricity used by incandescent bulbs is lost as heat this style typically burns for  to  hours halogen halogen bulbs contain a small capsule filled with halogen gas which emits a bright white light long life and full spectrum halogen bulbs use less energy and last longer than standard incandescent bulbs of the same wattage the life of these bulbs is around  to  hours or two to five years linear fluorescent linear fluorescent bulbs also known as fluorescent tubes are more energy efficient than incandescents or halogens because they dont produce much heat these are the thin long tube lights often found in kitchens for undercabinet lighting or in garages workshops and basements the tubes can last from  to  hours— to  times longer than incandescent lights fluorescent bulbs require and are powered by fluorescent ballasts compact fluorescent compact fluorescents also known as cfls provide as much light as regular incandescent bulbs while using just onefourth of the energy for example a watt compact fluorescent light bulb yields the same amount of light as a watt incandescent bulb compact fluorescent bulbs last about  hours— times longer than incandescent bulbs high intensity discharge high intensity discharge or hid bulbs include metal halide high pressure sodium and mercury vapor lights as their name implies hid bulbs emit a very large amount of light using relatively little power they are a mainstay of parking lot street and warehouse lighting like fluorescent bulbs hid bulbs also require a ballast stage and studio stage bulbs and photography lights are specialized high output lights used in the entertainment industry as well as in just about any stage or photography

recognizable guide comparing an led bulb to an incandescent will give you a rough estimate of just how well it will light a room as a very ballpark figure for led wattages  or  the incandescent wattage value is usually close to what you need lumens  lumens directly measure just how much light the bulb gives out in total on average a watt incandescent shines at  lumens with roughly  lumens of difference above or below the variance depends on manufacturer and age of the lamp leds are directly rated for their max lumen rating and last much longer without dimming of the bulb color temperature  your guide to how the light itself will look lower values are warmer with k being a more incandescent warm white while higher temperatures like k will deliver a very harsh stark white light our lighting guide lets you select a color temperature and see how it transforms a kitchen driver content  because of their design leds do not typically run on ac voltage many leds require some form of driver to convert the voltage from ac to dc for proper operation the majority of socketbased led lamps are selfdriven but you should always check before buying to make sure that you buy both an led and a driver at the same time if it isnt selfdriven
