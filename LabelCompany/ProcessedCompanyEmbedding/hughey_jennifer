merrill douglasno tags available jennifer hughey wasnt looking for a career in logistics but somehow it sucked her in in  hughey was senior finance manager at whirlpool corp when her former boss dan clifford recruited her to join him at the eureka company clifford president of eureka now called electrolux home care products north america wanted hughey to develop a strategy to boost the firms bottom line first as a consultant then as an executive hughey concentrated on aftermarket sales and consumer services next clifford asked her to take on logistics as well hughey didnt have a supply chain and logistics background but she had just earned an mba and clifford felt she possessed the right skills nine months later the company named her vice president supply chain in this role she oversees demand and supply planning manages inbound transportation runs the distribution center dc and supervises product flow to retail chains a unit of swedens ab electrolux electrolux home care products north america based in peoria ill sells floor cleaners under the names eureka electrolux sanitaire and beam hughey arrived at the company just in time to take part in a major transformation as the vacuum cleaner industry saw consumer pricing drop electrolux cut back its north american production and started sourcing most of its products from asia we transitioned quickly without investing in the right systems hughey recalls a solid supply chain partnership helped solve the problem dhl handled freight forwarding for inbound shipments and electrolux used the forwarders lognet system to track goods in transit when you increase the volume of containers shipped from  to  you appreciate that visibility says hughey other improvements included creating a foreign trade zone ftz at electroluxs dc in el paso texas finished goods and components that the company imports to the facility dont have to clear customs until electrolux ships products into us commerce which saves on duties and fees electrolux also doesnt have to pay duties on components it imports to el paso then ships to its plant in juarez mexico recently electrolux started using logilitys voyager solution to help forecast customer demand a function the company had been handling mainly with excel spreadsheets the starting point of any great supply chain is the forecast hughey says if the forecast isnt accurate then the wrong products will be on the ocean and in the dc voyagers supply planning and inventory management features will also help electrolux eventually the company will add a warehouse management system hughey and her team can now give consumers a steady supply of highquality vacuums thanks to a clean sweep of the electrolux supply chain the big questions what do you do when youre not at work
