industry update  omni partners llp “omni” the alternatives specialist set up by trading veteran steve clark in  today announces the launch of the omni secured lending fund i lp enabling institutional investors to directly access the shortterm secured property lending market within the uk the fund‘s investment proposition is to take advantage of the vacuum created by banks withdrawing from shortterm property lending in the uk in order to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns the fund focuses on the short end of the lending market whereby lenders are able to obtain an interest rate premium and demand more security in return for issuing lending decisions quickly addressing investor demand the fund has been structured with a relatively short duration compared with other direct

macro fund i limited fund investment objectives the omni macro fund follows a discretionary macro strategy that seeks to capitalise on global macro themes the fund is committed to achieving opportunistic returns whilst limiting downside risk through robust risk management guidelines and procedures significant expertise is placed on the preservation of capital through portfolio construction disciplined trading acumen and exposure guidelines portfolio investments are expressed across multiple asset classes such as commodities foreign exchange fixed income and stock indices there are five core considerations in the development of the macroeconomic view supply demand moneycredit mass psychology and individual psychology the rationale for trades is a result of the extensive fundamental and technical analysis we undertake implementing the macro view capitalises on essential trade execution skills such as sizing timing and risk management investable themes in the portfolio tend to be medium to longterm in duration and are broken down into cycles within these periods core trades are generally positioned on the mediumterm with the fund actively trading around these core views opportunistically preservation of capital is key to the funds investment approach this is possible only through the use of a proactive approach to risk management therefore the fund invests almost exclusively in products and markets that provide superior liquidity under any market conditions typically over  of the portfolio can be liquidated in one global business day aum

aspects of the transaction legal and regulatory issues political considerations broader corporate landscape company fundamentals market views overall macroeconomic environment for further details please contact the investor relations team     investorrelationsomnicouk omni event risk management actively managing downside risk is vital in the delivery of consistent absolute returns it is the investment teams key belief that the market will always offer opportunities to make profits but it is the avoidance of loss that is paramount in maintaining consistently positive performance as a result of the thorough research and analysis that the investment team undertakes the cio is able to acquire strong conviction in the transactions in which he invests this results in a relatively concentrated portfolio where a limited number of positions constitute most of the risk in the portfolio downside risk is mitigated by the use of a full range of risk management approaches
