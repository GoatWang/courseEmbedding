measure under gaap because it allows us to evaluate how our store base is performing by measuring the change in periodoverperiod net sales in stores that have been open for the applicable period we present pro forma adjusted net income pro forma diluted weighted average shares outstanding and pro forma adjusted eps because we believe investors understanding of our operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income and earnings per diluted share adjusted for nonrecurring charges associated with events such as our ipo and refinancing transactions you are encouraged to

material in addition comparable store sales pro forma adjusted net income pro forma diluted weighted average shares outstanding and pro forma adjusted eps may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies comparable store sales pro forma adjusted net income pro forma diluted weighted average shares outstanding and pro forma adjusted eps have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap  we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results
