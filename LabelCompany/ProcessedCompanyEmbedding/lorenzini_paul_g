          no ed appeal from the circuit court of the city of st louis 0cc honorable david l dowd filed june   opinion cathedral properties llc employer appeals the grant of paul g and laverne s lorenzinis plaintiffs motion for default judgment in a garnishment proceeding awarding them  in damages  in costs and 00 in attorneys fees  we affirm as modified i background in march  plaintiffs filed a petition for money had and received and for unjust enrichment against employee alleging he failed to repay them  in july  the  because defendant keith short is employed by cathedral properties llc we will refer to him as employee for purposes of this opinion trial court granted plaintiffs a default judgment against employee in the amount of  plus per diem interest the underlying judgment when plaintiffs were unsuccessful in collecting the underlying judgment from employee they attempted to garnish his wages from employer in october  plaintiffs filed a garnishment application directed to employer employer was served with a writ of garnishment and interrogatories it is undisputed that employer timely answered the interrogatories and indicated it possessed  in wages owed to employee for a 0day garnishment period plaintiffs filed a second garnishment application directed to employer in december  employer was served with a writ of garnishment and interrogatories but employer failed to timely answer the interrogatories plaintiffs filed a motion for default judgment against employer based upon its failure to timely answer interrogatories the motion for default requested damages in the amount of the underlying judgment and costs plaintiffs then served employer with notice that a hearing would be held on the motion for default a few days before the hearing was initially scheduled employer filed an answer to the interrogatories indicating it possessed 0 in wages owed to employee for a 0day garnishment period the hearing was held and after the hearing the trial court took the case under submission at some point thereafter plaintiffs counsel advised employers counsel and the court that plaintiffs were no longer seeking the full amount of the underlying judgment but were only seeking damages in the amount of money employer owed to employee or  plaintiffs counsel also advised employers counsel and the court that plaintiffs were requesting  in costs of collection and 00 in attorneys fees thereafter the trial court entered a default judgment against employer awarding plaintiffs  in damages  in costs and 00 in attorneys fees employer appeals  ii discussion employers brief raises four points on appeal employers first point on appeal asserts the trial court erred in awarding plaintiffs  in damages employers second point on appeal alleges the trial court did not have authority to award plaintiffs  in costs and 00 in attorneys fees finally employers third and fourth points on appeal contend the trial court erred in awarding attorneys fees because plaintiffs failed to properly request such relief in their motion for default judgment a the trial court did not err in awarding plaintiffs  in damages in their first point on appeal employer asserts the trial court erred in entering a default judgment awarding plaintiffs  in damages because plaintiffs did not follow the proper procedure when employer failed to timely answer plaintiffs second set of interrogatories specifically employer contends rule 0  required plaintiffs to file a motion to compel before filing a motion for default judgment we disagree  background law and standard of review a garnishment proceeding is generally governed by rule  and chapter   moore automotive group inc v goffstein 0 swd   mo banc  thus in determining whether rule 0 mandates a plaintiff to file a motion to compel before filing a motion for default judgment we must interpret missouri supreme court rules and state statutes governing garnishment proceedings our interpretation of missouri supreme court rules and statutes involves questions of law which we review de novo lindquist v midamerica orthopaedic surgery inc  swd 0 0 mo app ed  stating that statutory interpretation is  all references to rules are to missouri supreme court rules  unless otherwise indicated most of rule  and chapter  refer to the employer as garnishee refer to the judgment creditor as either plaintiff or garnishor and refer to the employee as debtor or defendant in order to assist the reader this court will refer to the parties to a garnishment action simply as employer plaintiff and employee when discussing and citing provisions in rule  and statutes in chapter    a question of law which is reviewed de novo state ex rel usaa casualty insurance co v david  swd   mo app ed 0 stating that interpretation of missouri supreme court rules is guided by principles similar to those used in our interpretation of state statutes our primary role in interpreting missouri supreme court rules and statutes is to ascertain the intent of the supreme court and legislature from the language used to give effect to that intent if possible and to consider the words used in their plain and ordinary meaning state ex rel usaa casualty  swd at  whitelaw v director of revenue  swd   mo app ed   the plain and ordinary meaning of rule 0 did not require plaintiffs to file a motion to compel before filing a motion for default judgment rule 0 states in relevant part if the employer fails to answer or improperly answers interrogatories the court shall upon motion order the employer to answer or properly answer the interrogatories failure of the employer to comply with such an order may upon motion of the plaintiff or the court subject the employer to a finding that the employer is in default and the plaintiff may take judgment by default against the employer we find that the plain and ordinary language of rule 0 did not require plaintiffs to file a motion to compel before filing a motion for default judgment because the only mandatory language in rule 0 applies to the trial court not to the plaintiff the portion of the rule providing the court shall upon motion order the employer to answer or properly answer the interrogatories requires a court to issue an order to compel only if a motion to compel is filed by the plaintiff emphasis added see ssm health care st louis v schneider  swd  0 mo app ed  interpreting portion of statute providing the court shall upon motion of any party dismiss the action    without prejudice to require the court to dismiss the action without prejudice if a motion to dismiss is filed state ex rel usaa casualty  swd at  interpreting the term shall in a missouri supreme court rule as mandatory  rule 0 not only mandates a court to issue an order compelling the employer to answer or properly answer the interrogatories when the plaintiff chooses to file a motion to compel but also sets forth the procedural mechanism for the plaintiff and court to follow when a motion to compel is filed and the employer fails to comply with an order to compel specifically the rule provides failure of the employer to comply with such an order may upon motion of the plaintiff or the court subject the employer to a finding that the employer is in default and the plaintiff may take judgment by default against the employer rule 0 emphasis added because the term may is permissive rather than mandatory see eg schubert v tolivar  swd   mo app ed  we interpret this part of the rule simply  to allow the plaintiff or court to make a motion for default judgment and  to permit the plaintiff to take a default judgment against the employer  section 0 rsmo  permitted plaintiffs to file a motion for default judgment when employer failed to file a timely answer to interrogatories section 0 rsmo   is a counterpart to rule 0 the statute and rule can be construed together and each can be given effect northwest professional condominium association v kayembe  swd  0 mo app ed  section 0 provides that when the employer does not timely file an answer the plaintiff may take judgment by default against the employer or the court may upon motion compel him to answer by attachment of his body     emphasis added as we previously indicated the word may is permissive rather than mandatory see schubert supra thus we interpret section 0 to allow the plaintiff to file a motion for default judgment or to file a motion to compel when the employer fails to file a timely answer to interrogatories we also interpret the statute to allow the court to compel an answer by attachment when a motion to compel is filed by the plaintiff  all statutory references are to rsmo  unless otherwise indicated  these procedural matters are neither addressed by nor inconsistent with the plain and ordinary language of rule 0 where the legislature has enacted a statute pertaining to a procedural matter which is not addressed by or inconsistent with any supreme court rule the statute must be enforced state ex rel kinsky v pratte  swd   mo app ed  thus pursuant to section 0 plaintiffs could file a motion for default judgment when employer failed to file a timely answer to interrogatories  conclusion we conclude rule 0 did not require plaintiffs to file a motion to compel before filing a motion for default judgment and section 0 permitted plaintiffs to file a motion for default judgment when employer failed to file a timely answer employer admits in its brief that it owed employee  generally the liability of the employer is measured by its liability to its employee butler v physicians planning service corp  swd   mo app ed  see also section 0 therefore the trial court did not err in entering a default judgment in favor of plaintiffs which awarded them  in damages point one is denied b the trial court did not err in awarding plaintiffs  in costs in its second point on appeal employer first argues the trial court did not have statutory authority to award plaintiffs costs we disagree in awarding costs a trial court is limited to awarding only those costs granted by virtue of express statutory authority williams v trans states airlines inc  swd  0 mo app ed  internal quotations omitted accordingly the issue in this portion of the second point on appeal involves statutory interpretation see id statutory interpretation is a question of law which this court reviews de novo lindquist  swd at 0 our primary role in interpreting statutes is to ascertain the intent of the legislature from the language used to  give effect to that intent if possible and to consider the words used in their plain and ordinary meaning whitelaw  swd at  section 0 rsmo supp   provides in all cases between the plaintiff and the employer a court of competent jurisdiction may order the parties to pay or recover costs as in ordinary cases between plaintiff and defendant emphasis added by using the word may the legislature intended for a court to have discretionary authority to award costs to the plaintiff or the employer see city of centralia v norden  swd  0 mo app wd  finding court had discretion to award costs pursuant to statute additionally section 0 explains that in ordinary cases between a plaintiff and defendant the prevailing party is entitled to costs in all civil actions or proceedings of any kind the party prevailing shall recover his costs against the other party except in those cases in which a different provision is made by law accordingly we hold that the plain and ordinary meaning of sections 0 and 0 authorize the trial court to award costs to a prevailing plaintiff or employer here plaintiffs prevailed on their motion for default judgment therefore in accordance with our interpretation of sections 0 and 0 the trial court had authority to award plaintiffs costs  with respect to employers argument that the trial court erred in awarding plaintiffs costs point two is denied c  the trial court erred in awarding plaintiffs 00 in attorneys fees all references to section 0 are to rsmo supp  employer asserts section 0 prohibited the trial court from awarding costs section 0 provides in relevant part that no final default judgment shall be rendered against the employer    for a greater amount than the employer shall appear to be liable for to the employee when read in isolation section 0 arguably appears to exclude costs from a final default judgment in garnishment cases however in ascertaining the legislative intent of a statute we review the provisions of the entire legislative act and must harmonize all of the provisions if reasonably possible chester bross construction co v missouri department of labor and industrial relations division of labor standards  swd   mo app ed 0 moreover we presume every statutory provision has effect id guided by these principles we find that to narrowly interpret section 0 as employer contends would render sections 0 and 0 meaningless as we explain above the plain and ordinary meaning of sections 0 and 0 expressly grant the trial court discretionary authority to award costs to the prevailing party in all garnishment actions between a plaintiff and employer thus we conclude employers interpretation of section 0 lacks merit   employer also argues in its second point on appeal that the trial court did not have authority to award plaintiffs attorneys fees whether a trial court has authority to award attorneys fees is a question of law which we review de novo  inc v crestwood commons redevelopment corp 0 swd   mo app ed 0 missouri courts follow the american rule with respect to awards of attorneys fees id at  the american rule generally provides that each party is required to bear the expense of its attorneys fees id however there are four common exceptions to the rule which allow a court to award attorneys fees if  a statute authorizes an award of fees  a contract authorizes an award of fees  a party expends fees to defend collateral litigation or  a court of equity deems fees are warranted in order to balance benefits where very unusual circumstances have been shown see id consolidated public water supply district no c of jefferson county v kreuter  swd   mo app ed  none of these exceptions apply in this case a court may also be allowed to award attorneys fees as sanctions in two limited circumstances first rule d provides a limited remedy of awarding attorneys fees for frivolous or bad faith litigation see rule d consolidated public water supply  swd at  n discussing former version of rule  providing for sanctions and secondly a trial court may award attorneys fees as sanctions pursuant to its inherent powers mitalovich v toomey  swd  0 mo app ed  plaintiffs assert the trial court had authority to award attorneys fees only pursuant to its inherent authority to award fees as sanctions specifically plaintiffs argue the trial court had the inherent power to sanction employer because it violated provisions of rule  by failing to pay plaintiffs after admitting it possessed money owed to employee and by failing to timely answer  plaintiffs second set of interrogatories  plaintiffs cite only one case where an appellate court has affirmed a trial courts use of its inherent powers to award attorneys fees as sanctions mitalovich v toomey  swd  we find however that mitalovich is inapplicable to the instant case our decision in mitalovich to affirm the award of attorneys fees was premised upon our courts conclusion that the award of attorneys fees in that case was actually imposed by the court as a sanction we conclude the award of attorneys fees was imposed as a sanction for two compelling reasons first the award was made because of fathers transgression in failing to appear for a hearing which failing occasioned expenses of effort and money by mother second the court unequivocally denominated it a sanction in its order imposing the award  swd at 0 unlike in mitalovich the record on appeal in the instant case does not provide any clear indication as to why the trial court awarded attorneys fees furthermore the court did not denominate the award as a sanction in its judgment because we cannot conclude the award of attorneys fees was imposed by the trial court as a sanction we must find the court did not have authority to award attorneys fees to plaintiffs with respect to employers argument that the trial court erred in awarding plaintiffs attorneys fees point two is granted  iii conclusion as authorized by rule  we modify the judgment to exclude all references to the award of attorneys fees and as modified affirm the judgment of the trial court awarding plaintiffs  in damages and  in costs  rule 0a requires an employer whom admits in its answers to interrogatories that it is possesses money owed to the employee to pay such money no later than ten days after the return date of the writ of garnishment or levy see also rule 0d rule 0b requires the employer to file and serve answers to interrogatories during the ten days immediately after the return date of the writ  in employers third and fourth points on appeal it contends the trial court erred in awarding attorneys fees because plaintiffs failed to properly request such an award in their motion for default judgment it is unnecessary for us to reach this issue because our determination that the attorneys fees award was not authorized is dispositive points three and four are denied   glenn a norton presiding judge mary k hoff j and lawrence e mooney j concur 0 search this case google
