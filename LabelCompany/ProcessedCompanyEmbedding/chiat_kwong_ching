as an excellent investment destination work on the bridge began this year and so far  of investors in the complex have been cambodians “some buy the apartments for their children some for investment reasons the people who buy the units for investment usually buy the whole floor and not the cheapest ones” he said with a chuckle “so i have to deliver a good product that is my moral obligation“i believe that for every young family there is a need to upgrade if homes are affordable then it is likely that after a few years prices will increase creating equity so it will still be affordable to
