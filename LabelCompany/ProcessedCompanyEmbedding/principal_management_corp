citizenship is required for ownership of a c corporation or an llc in what state should i form my llc or corporation unless you plan on having a large multistate operation it is generally best to form your company in the state in which it is locatedgenerally speaking most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business andor a physical presence in that state if you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign out of state company with your home state

businesses one person can be the only shareholder the only director and the only officer what is a c corporation a c corporation is a completely separate tax and legal entity from its owners and owners who work in the business are treated and taxed as employees of the corporation note the c in c corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code c corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations c corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to passthrough to the personal income tax statements of the owners as such c corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting

corporate shares it doesnt necessarily reflect their real value and is typically set at a low value ie one dollar or one cent the par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class the shares can be sold to the initial shareholders at par value or more but the price must be the same for each share not all states require a par value unless you specify otherwise incfile will authorize  shares this is due to the fact that  is easily divisible by      with a par value of one cent or at no par value
