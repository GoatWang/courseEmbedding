specialty psychiatry number of employees  employees employees number  employees july  july  terrible experience easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money pros not much the orange guy logo that about sums up my likes i have nothing nice or positive to contribute cons kareo is outdated and difficult to navigate compared to other available software it lacks functionality and intuition completely incapable of anticipating the needs of its user the ability to sort through super bills is ridiculously inefficient i have many examples of poor software design that is making my life hell the soft ware has so many an unexpected error has occurred alerts that prevents me from entering the patient chart and no one on the support team ever knows how to fix it i was unable to view my patient charts for  days with no solution from program designers there is a significant lack of accountability for their shortcomings which needs to be addressed urgently i am getting further and further behind in my documentation because this error message prevents me from viewing notes at all i have been told x now that a supervisor will call me back no one ever does it was fixed very briefly last week but here i am again massive improvements to expand the functionality are needed kareo is not a big player in our market and likely never will be if big changes are not made immediate attempts to find some tools that will drive efficiency are critical this ehr software is not designed to save medical organizations time and effort in processing patient information as much as they may think it does     nataile from inspire communication inc specialty speech therapy number of employees  employees employees number  employees july  july  new customer to kareo and so far im loving it easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money pros we are switching from clinicsource to kareo and so far we are loving the extra features we get  textemail alert for patients ease of site navigation multifunctionality and i absolutely love all the reports and tracking systems i cant wait to see where are earning and losing money cons the only issue i keep hitting is the template system i understand why it is as complicated as it is but i would love an even more comprehensive guide on how to create templates from scratch and any templates related to speech therapy would be nice there are zero at this time     jessica from integrated wellness group specialty mental  behavioral health number of employees  employees employees number  employees july  july  somewhat frustrating easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money pros our providers find entering notes for patient visits to be very user friendly and billing finds posting payments for patients to be easier than our previous system cons reporting options are limited cannot scheduling recurring biweekly appointments which is a regular thing for our office electronic eligibility check does not work     simone from forest clinica familiar specialty family medicine number of employees  employees employees number  employees july  july  user intuitive but lacking support easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money pros easy interface that is simple and fairly fluid staff with limited ehr systems are able to learn kareo quickly cons too many glitches and inadequate access to customer support unacceptable to wait over  hours for assistance with an urgentcritical system issue     lisa from advanced physical therapy inc specialty physical therapy  rehab number of employees  employees employees number  employees june  june  billing manager easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money there is a lot of click here and click there to get anywhere which i believe this software should be easier to use than the older software that we had but it is not takes more time to do anything there is no discharge feature i wish customer service would be more helpful pros very inexpensive easy set up getting clearance from the insurances to switch over to the new clearing house was a piece of cake cons customer service is hard to get once they think your all set so now i am trying to train myself ugh     rhonda from mbs ga specialty billing services number of employees  employees employees number  employees june  june  the ehr does not have many bells and whistles as a free service it sacrificed however the options do not compare with most other services on the market in the new price range easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money kareo is similar to practicefusion except they now charge a few for the ehr if the company had made changes in the operating platform to keep it modern like other programs on the market it would be great not all programs have ipad apps otherwise its a waste of money and would recommend picking something different pros familiar with software and functions easy to use and maneuver webbased and compatible with mac ipad application available for tablet users cons rates are fairly comparable with other ehr systems however kareo does not often the functions that are available on most ehrs not compatible with all specialties support is hit and miss     jerome from revive life house specialty substance abuse number of employees  employees employees number  employees june  june  kareo is difficult to use for beahvioral health easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money pros very easy to learn how to use on your own other than that it is not the easiest program to use for behavioral health cons very slow and cumbersome and not userfriendly for counselors  cannot enter groups all at once having a preloaded listing of clients and enter a visit in and have it populate automatically in all their charts  no treatment planning option at all other programs have treatment plans that ties notes and counselors to specific treatment plans cannot update them electronically  even when you choose more than  clients per page you still have to scroll down window does not fit screen if you get out of it it defaults back to  clients slows down progress  you should be able to print all notes out for client at one time i have worked at both the state and federal level and while their systems were much more indepth they were more userfriendly and ease of navigation     colleen from mrowka physical therapy specialty physical therapy  rehab number of employees  employees employees number  employees june  june  i am a sole practitioner easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money for a small practice this is one of the ost cost effective programs i have seen pros progress note generates the billing professional reports professional looking statements can add timed codes for medicare patients so you can avoid a billing error can fax evaluation dirctly to md upom creation  cons cannot have two user windows open at once without paying additional money for  pts for example i would like to be able to document on my ipad while in a room with a patient and then compete the note on my pc in my main gym area i have to exit outthen sign back in on a different device taking  steps instead of  doesnt sound like much but adds up to a lot of time over the course of a day many of the features have additional rcurring fees schedule outcomes not all fields are customizable you can add smart text for frequently used phrases but this option is not available on every field for example cannot add smart text to the plan or to assessment have asked many times if could be added but it has never been put in update     olumuyiwa from pizzazz hospital specialty hospital number of employees  employees employees number  employees june  june  average customer rapport easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money nothin much pros customer reps are a bit cautious and reassuring cost effective cloud based more suitable for small business cons customer service seems professional but exhibit sort of deficiency in tackling some problems which arises with few inherent features     amy from adding solutions specialty mental  behavioral health number of employees  employees employees number  employees june  june  great software easy to use easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money pros this software is easy to use and works well for our small practice it has everything we need to ensure quality and continuity of care for our clients cons the billing portion of this software suite didnt quite fit our practices needs and we would also have liked a mobile app version of the calendar     amy from cnp specialty psychologytherapy number of employees  employees employees number  employees may  may  very frustrating experience easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money after spending about  hours learning kareo and starting to develop templates i threw in the towel and canceled it thank goodness i was on a free day trial period the straw that broke the camels back was not being able to schedule nonpatient appointments and being told my request would not be dealt with by the engineers in the near future they have their roadmap set for the next few months already and take customer input on a quarterly basis pros when i asked to speak to a manager i got someone who was professional nice and apologetic for some problems i ran into the success training coach was very friendly and genuinely seemed like he wanted to help and accommodate any request cons the sales rep did not communicate to the success training coach what i needed to have my ehr configured we wasted hours on the phone trying to figure it out had she just communicated my needs to him ahead of time he could have solved the issues behind the scenes instead of having me lose a few hours of valuable time after all of that when i started using the system i discovered you cannot book a nonpatient appointment the system does not allow you to schedule meetings or nonpatient related phone calls     sunny from umd care specialty urgent care number of employees  employees employees number  employees may  may  decent billing software for small scale offices easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money pros easy to use interface good customer service during initial setup costeffective cloudbased cons customer service takes too long to pick up the phone and are reading off a manual not very knowledgeable features are not very customizable     greg from strategy anesthesia specialty anesthesiology number of employees  employees employees number  employees may  may  kareo aware of a major issue involving easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money treating customers in an insulting and condescending manner is unacceptable when contacted first thing monday morning may st their phone system announcement was more aware of the issue then the support staff pros its an elusive idea you want positive reviews then provide the service your charging us for and fix all the issues and start implementing all the repeated requests for improvements to the system most years old cons everything involving technical support from long hold times with terrible hold technical support who are clueless of current or any other issues with this product     mary beth from core aba specialty applied behavior analysisautism number of employees  employees employees number  employees april  april  ar easier easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money great ar system but customer support and training is def lacking pros seeing eobs before they hit the mailbox electronic billing is easier and class flow has increased as claims paid quickly cons needs a manual feel like theres a lot of features i know nothing about and would like formal training     annie from cbt psychological associates specialty psychologytherapy number of employees  employees employees number  employees april  april  okayy easeofuse functionality product quality customer support value for money kareo is a great product for a small business and its very great with there support team they have several modules that can be added or taken away to tailor to your practice pros billing modules cons not  support  located in california so time difference     sarah from

recommend them they have a good sales pitch but my trust level was completely destroyed and i switched to another company pros it has a marketing solution cons it does not create an automatic

nice or positive to contribute cons kareo is outdated and difficult to navigate compared to other available software it lacks functionality and intuition completely incapable of anticipating the needs of its user the ability to sort through super bills is ridiculously inefficient i have many examples of poor software design that is making my life hell the soft ware has so many an unexpected error has occurred alerts that prevents me from entering the patient chart and no one on the support team ever knows how to fix it i was unable to view my patient charts for  days with no solution from program designers there is a significant lack of accountability for their shortcomings which needs to be addressed urgently i am getting further and further behind in my documentation because this error message prevents me from viewing notes at all i have been told x now that a supervisor will call me back no one ever does it was fixed very briefly last week but here i am again massive improvements to expand the functionality are needed kareo is not a big player in our market and likely never will be if big changes are not made immediate attempts to find some tools that will drive

like other programs on the market it would be great not all programs have ipad apps otherwise its a waste of money and would recommend picking something different pros familiar with software and

counselors to specific treatment plans cannot update them electronically  even when you choose more than  clients per page you still have to scroll down window does not fit screen if you get out of it

next few months already and take customer input on a quarterly basis pros when i asked to speak to a manager i got someone who was professional nice and apologetic for some problems i ran into the success training coach was very friendly and genuinely seemed like he wanted to help and accommodate any request cons the sales rep did not communicate to the success training coach what i needed to have my ehr configured we wasted hours on the phone trying to figure it out had she just communicated my needs to him ahead of time he could have solved the issues behind the scenes instead of having

not pull in appointment code  ending date of service using care for emr pulling up info  not enough info shows no place to make recommendations like when pulling up the list of encounters which insurance is it too many steps to find the patient balance why is it not on the first patient screen also copay have to add an extra step in to find copay for insurance unless the patient has a card difficult to figure out what needs to be fixed on denials no place to put the reason the patient is coming in that will cross over so an office visit for any reason we make a note and then have our

beatiful ehr templates for charting you can also create your own specified templates but the premade ones suffice along with that the scheduling in the ehr is easy to use and you can create a patient if they arent in the database and you need to schedule a new patient cons customer service is one of the worst providing customer service i have experienced dedicated members of managed billing enrollments and marketing dont even communicate efficiently they also have you do their job at times when they have the resources at hand to figure things out yourself youll spend more time trying to get the certified medical biller and coder to do their job than taking care of patients source capterra   wa from ohm number of employees  employees employees number  employees may  may  the process

paid from our limited resources for nothing for a couple of months even after canceling they are still trying to bill us i consider them to be insensitive to the needs of a startup and would not recommend them they have a good sales pitch but my trust level was completely destroyed and i switched to another company pros it has a marketing solution cons it does not create an automatic narrative attached to icd codes as you click on options advice to others startups with limited resources should not be pressured into buying any software until they know that other priorities are out

expensive for extremely poor work we could not wait to get away from this company and now theyre denying us access to our old notes we often receive requests from lawyers insurance companies other physicians for our patients notes but kareo will no longer allow us access to the old notes unless we pay its clear to me that this company is in trouble if they have to insist on payment to access old notes that the doctor documented on his patients we are now looking into litigation and we will sue for our records this company without question and most assuredly is destined for failure its inevitable again if youre thinking about using this service kareo for any of your medical office needs i implore you to look elsewhere this company knows nothing about medical billing scheduling and
