supporting production of neurotransmitters our cognitive support medinutritionals include key phospholipid building blocks for the formation of healthy new brain cells neuroone™ comprehensive multimodal support for cognitive performance supplying nutrition for neurogenesis cerebral circulation and antioxidant activity in the brain healthy focus memory clarity and mood promotes neurogenesis

patient one neuroone™ supplies advanced medinutritional support for focus memory and mood neuroone activates serotonin hta receptors promotes healthy cerebral blood flow supports neurotransmitter production provides antioxidant protection against brain oxidative stress and supplies vital building block nutrition for neurogenesis – the creation of new brain cells neuroone is an ideal formula for optimizing cognitive function whether supporting mental focus and attention span for students or promoting bright mood and addressing mild memory problems associated with aging key ingredients sharpps® phosphatidylserine sharpps® supplies high purity phosphatidylserine ps derived from soy through a patented process ps is a structural component of cells that is found in all biological membranes of plants animals and other forms of life the human body contains about g of phosphatidylserine about half of which is found in the brain  this orthomolecule is a raw material in neurogenesis the creation of new brain cells ps promotes brain cellular energy and catalyzes neurotransmitter production promoting communication between brain cells preclinical and clinical studies support improved cognitive function with oral administration of phosphatidylserine because neuronal cells do not readily regenerate it is important that these cells have a superior survival mechanism high levels of ps in neuronal membranes were shown to be important for neuronal survival by facilitating several important cellular processes maintaining ps levels in neuronal tissues has been associated with normal and efficient signal transduction processes efficient neuronal glucose consumption and other biological pathways that are crucial for normal and healthy cognitive and mental functions sharpgpc™ glycerophosphatidylcholine glycerophosphatidylcholine gpc is a naturally occurring phospholipid and essential brain nutrient that is a bioavailable source of choline and a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine it is found in abundant concentrations when we are born particularly in brain tissue as a normal part of the aging process levels in the cell decrease over time in the diet gpc is normally presented in low amounts in food such as milk eggs and meat neuroone supplies sharpgpc high purity soyderived phosphatidylcholine that boosts acetylcholine levels in the brain to optimize central neurotransmission promoting clear cognition and sharp memory it has also been studied for its support in head trauma recovery bacognize® bacopa monnieri the neurotransmitter serotonin is key for higherlevel cognitive function including working memory and measures of focus and mood brewed concoctions containing bacopa monnieri brahmi has long been a part of daily life for children and adults in india bacopa extracts are widely used in integrative medicine to assist with cognitive function however not all bacopa compounds are equally active and not all extracts are the same bacognize® extract is a proprietary concentrated clinically researched extract of bacopa monnieri which has undergone rigorous scientific validation clinical research indicates bacopa offers broad benefits for cognitive health linked to three major neurosupportive mechanisms neurotransmitter receptor binding activity antioxidant capacity and antiinflammatory activity standardized to  baccosides this extract of bacopa monnieri has shown potent activity at the site of human serotonin hta receptors and has been shown to promote aspects of cognitive performance memory and mood it may help address fuzzy thinking and forgetfulness ginkgo biloba  vinpocetine neurons are completely reliant on a continuous supply of oxygen and glucose which is delivered to them by the blood neurological tissue is especially vulnerable to oxidative stress because of its high demand for oxygen high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in neural membrane phospholipids and low antioxidant defenses both of these antioxidant botanicals are vasodilators that improve cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygenation supporting healthy brain energy and optimizing delivery of neuroone’s neuronutrient complex ginkgo also supports acetylcholine availability  botanical neuro complex with grapeseed transresveratrol quercetin ginger and perluxan® hops neuroone’s botanical neuro complex supplies dualaction nutritional support for key factors associated with cognitive decline it modulates brain inflammation and supplies abundant antioxidant activity to neutralize brain oxidative stress soy lecithin soy lecithin contains a mixture of phospholipids isolated from soybeans that are essential for every cell of the human body lecithin is an integral part of the cell membranes the protective sheaths surrounding the brain muscle and nerve cells and also plays a vital role in maintaining brain functions lecithin provides the phospholipid choline a precursor to acetylcholine an important neurotransmitter for normal brain functioning that is associated with improved memory various studies support the use of lecithin as an adjunctive therapy for cognitive
