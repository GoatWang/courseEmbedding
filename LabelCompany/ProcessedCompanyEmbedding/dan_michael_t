 abstract we analyze the role of discretionary joint fixed costs in audit production given such costs the investment decision and production of audit services must be analyzed over a client portfolio we model this problem and use monotone comparative statics milgrom and shannon  to show the implications of variations in clientspecific losses and the number of clients for the optimum level of fixed investment and audit assurance we develop four hypotheses concerning the relations between audit quality and  the magnitude of potential clientspecific losses  average client losses in a portfolio  the number of clients in a portfolio and  the variability of losses in a portfolio using discretionary accruals as the audit quality proxy we find evidence consistent with these hypotheses using pcaob inspection results and financial statement restatements as proxies for audit quality we find weaker evidence consistent with hypotheses   and  keywords audit services client portfolios production
