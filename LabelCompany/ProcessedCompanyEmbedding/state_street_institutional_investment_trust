in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance  during the most recent fiscal year the funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio principal investment strategies the fund uses a passive management strategy designed to track the performance of the russell small cap completeness index the “index” the index is a floatadjusted market capitalization index which measures the performance of the russell ® index companies excluding sp ® constituents the index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer of the extended broad market beyond the sp  exposure as of february   the market capitalization of the companies included in the index ranged from  million to  billion as of february   the index comprised  securities as of february   a significant portion of the index comprised companies in the financial health care and consumer discretionary sectors although this may change from time to time the fund is not managed according to traditional methods of “active” investment management which involve the buying and selling of securities based upon economic financial and market analysis and investment judgment instead the fund using a “passive” or “indexing” investment approach seeks to provide investment results that before expenses correspond generally to the total return of the index the fund generally intends to invest in all stocks comprising the index in approximate proportion to their weightings in the index however under various circumstances it may not be possible or practicable to purchase all stocks in those weightings in those circumstances the fund may purchase a sample of the stocks in the index in proportions expected by ssga funds management inc “ssga fm” or the “adviser” the investment adviser to the fund to match generally the performance of the index as a whole in addition from time to time stocks are added to or removed from the index the fund may sell securities that are represented in the index or purchase securities that are not yet represented in the index in anticipation of their removal from or addition to the index under normal market conditions the portfolio invests at least  of its net assets plus borrowings if any in stocks in the index the fund will provide shareholders with at least sixty  days notice prior to any change in this  investment policy the notional value of the funds investments in derivatives or other synthetic instruments that provide exposures comparable in the judgment of the adviser to investments in the index may be counted toward satisfaction of this  policy    in addition the fund may purchase or sell futures contracts on the index or options on those futures in lieu of investing directly in the stocks making up the index the fund might do so for example in order to increase its investment exposure pending investment of cash in the stocks comprising the index alternatively the fund might use futures or options on futures to reduce its investment exposure in situations where it intends to sell a portion of the stocks in its portfolio but the sale has not yet been completed the fund may also enter into other derivatives transactions including the use of options or swap transactions relating to the index or any securities comprising the index in lieu of investing directly in the stocks making up the index the fund may to the extent permitted by applicable law invest in shares of other mutual funds whose investment objectives and policies are similar to those of the fund including funds advised by the adviser the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing substantially all of its investable assets in the state street smallmid cap equity index portfolio a separate series of the state street institutional investment trust with an identical investment objective as the fund and that has substantially identical investment policies strategies and risks to the fund when the fund invests in this “masterfeeder” structure the funds only investments are shares of the portfolio and it participates in the investment returns achieved by the portfolio the index is sponsored by frank russell company the “index provider” which is not affiliated with the fund or the adviser the index provider determines the composition of the index relative weightings of the securities in the index and publishes information regarding the market value of the index there is no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective and you could lose money possibly your entire investment by investing in the fund principal risks you could lose money by investing in the fund an investment in the fund is subject to investment risks including possible loss of principal is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency the fund may not achieve its investment objective general risks associated with the funds and the portfolios investment policies and investment strategies are discussed below the fund is not intended to be a complete investment program but rather is intended for investment as part of a diversified investment portfolio investors should consult their own advisers as to the role of the fund in their overall investment programs in addition the fund is subject to the following risks consumer discretionary sector risk the success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of the overall global economy interest rates competition and consumer confidence success depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending also companies in the consumer discretionary sector may be subject to severe competition which may have an adverse impact on their respective profitability changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for and success of consumer products and services in the marketplace counterparty risk the fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties with which the fund enters into derivatives contracts repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and other transactions if a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations the fund may be unable to terminate or realize any gain on the investment or transaction or to recover collateral posted to the counterparty resulting in a loss to the fund if the fund holds collateral posted by its counterparty it may be delayed or prevented from realizing on the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding relating to the counterparty derivatives risk derivative transactions can create investment leverage and may have significant volatility it is possible that a derivative transaction will result in a much greater loss than the principal amount invested and the fund may not be able to close out a derivative transaction at a favorable time or price the counterparty to a derivatives contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments return the funds margin or otherwise honor its obligations a derivatives transaction may not behave in the manner anticipated by the adviser or may not have the effect on the fund anticipated by the adviser equity investing risk the market prices of equity securities owned by the fund may go up or down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably the value of a security may decline for a number of reasons that may directly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to general industry or market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular company in addition equity markets tend to move in cycles which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time financial sector risk financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation which may limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make the interest rates and fees they can charge the scope of their activities the prices they can charge and the amount of capital they must maintain profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased    competition in addition deterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a broad range of markets including us and international credit and interbank money markets generally thereby affecting a wide range of financial institutions and markets certain events in the financial sector may cause an unusually high degree of volatility in the financial markets both domestic and foreign and cause certain financial services companies to incur large losses securities of financial services companies may experience a dramatic decline in value when such companies experience substantial declines in the valuations of their assets take action to raise capital such as the issuance of debt or equity securities or cease operations credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated with investment activities can negatively impact the sector insurance companies may be subject to severe price competition adverse economic business or political developments could adversely affect financial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing activities directly or indirectly connected to the value of real estate health care sector risk companies in the health care sector are subject to extensive government regulation and their profitability can be significantly affected by restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses rising costs of medical products and services pricing pressure including price discounting limited product lines and an increased emphasis on the delivery of healthcare through outpatient services companies in the health care sector are heavily dependent on obtaining and defending patents which may be time consuming and costly and the expiration of patents may also adversely affect the profitability of these companies health care companies are also subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims in addition their products can become obsolete due to industry innovation changes in technologies or other market developments many new products in the health care sector require significant research and development and may be subject to regulatory approvals all of which may be time consuming and costly with no guarantee that any product will come to market index tracking risk while the adviser seeks to track the performance of the index ie achieve a high degree of correlation with the index the funds return may not match the return of the index the fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the index and incurs costs in buying and selling securities in addition the fund may not be fully invested at times generally as a result of cash flows into or out of the fund or reserves of cash held by the fund to meet redemptions the adviser may attempt to replicate the index return by investing in fewer than all of the securities in the index or in some securities not included in the index potentially increasing the risk of divergence between the funds return and that of the index large shareholder risk to the extent a large proportion of the shares of the portfolio are held by a small number of shareholders or a single shareholder including funds or accounts over which the adviser has investment discretion the portfolio is subject to the risk that these shareholders will purchase or redeem portfolio shares in large amounts rapidly or unexpectedly including as a result of an asset allocation decision made by the adviser these transactions could adversely affect the ability of the portfolio to conduct its investment program liquidity risk lack of a ready market or restrictions on resale may limit the ability of the fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or price or at all illiquid securities may trade at a discount from comparable more liquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value illiquidity of the funds holdings may limit the ability of the fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a timely basis in addition the fund due to limitations on investments in any illiquid securities andor the difficulty in purchasing and selling such investments may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain market or sector masterfeeder structure risk the fund pursues its objective by investing substantially all of its assets in another pooled investment vehicle a “master fund” the ability of the fund to meet its investment objective is directly related to the ability of the master fund to meet its investment objective the adviser serves as investment adviser to the master fund leading to potential conflicts of interest the fund will bear its pro rata portion of the expenses incurred by the master fund substantial redemptions by other investors in a master fund may affect the master funds investment program adversely and limit the ability of the master fund to achieve its objective passive strategyindex risk the fund is managed with a passive investment strategy attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities regardless of the current or projected performance of the index or of the actual securities comprising the index this differs from an activelymanaged fund which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index as a result the funds performance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment strategy the structure and composition of the index will affect the performance volatility and risk of the index and consequently the performance volatility and risk of the fund risk of investment in other pools if the fund invests in another pooled investment vehicle it is exposed to the risk that the other pool will not perform as expected and is exposed indirectly to all of the risks applicable to an investment in such other pool the investment policies of the other pool may not be the same as those of the fund as a result an investment in the other    pool may be subject to additional or different risks than those to which the fund is typically subject the fund bears its proportionate share of the fees and expenses of any pool in which it invests the adviser or an affiliate may serve as investment adviser to a pool in which the fund may invest leading to potential conflicts of interest it is possible that other clients of the adviser or its affiliates will purchase or sell interests in a pool sponsored or managed by the adviser or its affiliates at prices and at times more favorable than those at which the fund does so small and midcapitalization securities risk the securities of small and midcapitalization companies may be more volatile and may involve more risk than the securities of larger companies these companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources may lack the competitive strength of larger companies and may depend on a few key employees in addition these companies may have been recently organized and may have little or no track record of success the securities of smaller companies may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely held securities some securities of smaller issuers may be illiquid or may be restricted as to resale and their values may have significant volatility the fund may be unable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any time or at a favorable price in order to meet the funds obligations returns on investments in securities of small and midcapitalization companies could trail the returns on investments in securities of larger companies unconstrained sector risk the fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets within one or more economic sectors or industries which may change from time to time greater investment focus on one or more sectors or industries increases the potential for volatility and the risk that events negatively affecting such sectors or industries could reduce returns potentially causing the value of the funds shares to decrease perhaps significantly valuation risk some portfolio holdings potentially a large portion of the funds investment portfolio may be valued on the basis of factors other than market quotations this may occur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced liquidity there are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market quotations are not readily available the value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations including “fair valued” securities may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than if market quotations were used in addition there is no assurance that the fund could sell or close out a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time and it is possible that the fund would incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established by the fund at that time investors who purchase or redeem fund shares on days when the fund is holding fairvalued investments may receive fewer or more shares or lower or higher redemption proceeds than they would have received if the fund had not fairvalued the holdings or had used a different valuation methodology performance the bar chart and table below provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund by illustrating
