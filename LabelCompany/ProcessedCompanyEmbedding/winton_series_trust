view monthly performance report view client flyer view client quarterly fund snapshot all investments carry risk different investments carry different levels of risk depending on the investment strategy and the underlying assets generally the higher the potential return of an investment the greater the risk the risks of investing in this fund include market risk changes in the prices of futures positions held by the fund may result in loss of principal or large movements in the unit price of the fund within short or long periods of time global and local economic financial political technological and environmental factors can drive changes in the prices of futures positions it is not possible to predict the occurrence or magnitude of these and other potentially relevant factors different factors may affect the price of individual futures positions particular asset classes such as shares bonds interest rates currencies and commodities or futures positions generally at different times leverage risk arises when the fund takes on positions that are greater in size than its assets the fund will take leveraged positions with the aim of increasing returns which can also lead to increased losses leverage arises in the fund through taking both long and short futures positions which are larger in size than the net asset value of the fund while this process forms a key part of the investment strategy it may mean that gains and losses may be significantly greater than those in a fund that is not leveraged the fund employs significant leverage and this may result in a loss of some or all of the funds capital strategy model and research risk wintons investment approach is based on research into past data and the application of that research to the development of mathematical models that attempt to forecast returns risk correlation and transaction costs many of these models are trend following models that attempt to identify and exploit market trends mathematical models are representations of reality but they may be incomplete andor flawed and there is an inherent risk that any forecasts derived from them may be inaccurate particularly if the research or models are based on or incorporate inaccurate assumptions or data assumptions or data may be inaccurate from the outset or may become inaccurate as a result of many factors such as changes in market structure increased government intervention in markets or growth in assets managed in accordance with similar investment strategies in particular such factors may make winton’s trend following models less effective because they may lessen the prospect of identified trends occurring or continuing in the future as a result of the foregoing the investment system may not generate profitable trading signals and the fund may suffer a loss for a full description of the risks of investing in the fund you should read the product disclosure statement before deciding to invest
