the investment company act of  as amended as a diversified openend management investment company shares of the fund may only be purchased by insurance companies for the purpose of funding variable annuity or variable life insurance contracts the following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the fund in the preparation of financial statements davis value portfolio is a diversified professionally managed stockoriented fund a valuation of securities  portfolio securities listed on national securities exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation securities traded in the over the counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on that date are stated at the average of closing bid and asked prices securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors shortterm obligations are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value these valuation procedures are reviewed and subject to approval by the board of directors b master repurchase agreements  the fund along with other affiliated funds may transfer uninvested cash balances into one or more master repurchase agreement accounts these balances are invested in one or more repurchase agreements secured by us government securities securities pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements are held by a custodian bank until the agreements mature each agreement requires that the market value of the collateral be sufficient to cover payments of interest and principal however in the event of default by the other party to the agreement retention of the collateral may be subject to legal proceedings c currency translation  the market values of all assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the financial statements after translation to the us dollar based upon the mean between the bid and offered quotations of the currencies against us dollars on the date of valuation the cost basis of such assets and liabilities is determined based upon historical exchange rates income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect as accrued or incurred d foreign currency  the fund may enter into forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities against declines in market value relative to the us dollar forward currency contracts are markedtomarket daily and the change in market value is recorded by the fund as an unrealized gain or loss when the forward currency contract is closed the fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the forward currency contract at the time it was opened and value at the time it was closed investments in forward currency contracts may expose the fund to risks resulting from unanticipated movements in foreign currency exchange rates or failure of the counterparty to the agreement to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract reported net realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from the sales and maturities of investments sales of foreign currencies currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions the difference between the amounts of dividends interest and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the funds books and the us dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid net unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes in the value of assets and liabilities other than investments in securities at fiscal year end resulting from changes in the exchange rate the fund includes foreign currency gains and losses realized on the sale of investments together with market gains and losses on such investments in the statement of operations  pncsrsth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th davis value portfolio notes to financial statements  continued june   unaudited  note   summary of significant accounting policies  continued e federal income taxes  it is the funds policy to comply with the requirements of the internal revenue code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income including any net realized gains on investments not offset by loss carryovers to shareholders therefore no provision for federal income or excise tax is required at june   the fund had available for federal income tax purposes unused capital loss carryovers of  and  which expire in  and  respectively f use of estimates in financial statements  in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from these estimates g securities transactions and related investment income  securities transactions are accounted for on the trade date date the order to buy or sell is executed with realized gain or loss on the sale of securities being determined based upon identified cost dividend income is recorded on the exdividend date interest income which includes accretion of discount and amortization of premium is accrued as earned h dividends and distributions to shareholders  dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the exdividend date net investment income loss net realized gains losses and net unrealized appreciation depreciation of investments may differ for financial statement and tax purposes primarily because of the recognition of certain foreign currency gains losses as ordinary income loss for tax purposes and the tax deferral of losses on wash sale transactions the character of dividends and distributions made during the fiscal year from net investment income and net realized securities gains may differ from their ultimate characterization for federal income tax purposes also due to the timing of dividends and distributions the fiscal year in which amounts are distributed may differ from the fiscal year in which income or realized gain was recorded by the fund the fund adjusts the classification of distributions to shareholders to reflect the differences between financial statement amounts and distributions determined in accordance with income tax regulations  pncsrsth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th davis value portfolio notes to financial statements  continued june   unaudited  note   investment advisory fees advisory fees
