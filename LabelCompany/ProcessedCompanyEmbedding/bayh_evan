email address got it got it by stuart rothenberg by stuart rothenberg july   evan bayh wants back in the senate raising questions about why he left in the first place photo by spencer plattgetty images on tuesday my colleague at powerpost james hohmann opened his daily morning newsletter the daily  with this blistering critique of former indiana senator evan bayh who formally announced yesterday he is running for his old senate seat one of the many reasons that so many of his democratic colleagues did not like evan bayh during his tenure in the senate was his excessive caution the hyperambitious alwaysprivileged and evercalculating son of a senator long dreamed of becoming president and he represented a conservativeleaning state so he was perennially nervous about taking tough votes or courageous stands he often seemed to waffle and have his finger in the wind i’d agree bayh has always been cautious and he had his sights set on the white house for years but if ambition were disqualifying for those seeking high office we wouldn’t have any candidates or elected officials and i don’t regard caution as a terribly bad trait especially considering some of the boneheaded decisions elected officials make but bayh’s decision certainly caught me offguard as did florida sen marco rubio’s decision to jump into the florida senate race after earlier announcing he would not seek reelection and the indiana democrat’s announcement has made me reconsider my earlier view that bayh didn’t retire in  because he was afraid of losing to republican challenger dan coats himself a former senator who didn’t run for reelection because he was afraid he would lose to bayh now that conclusion is inescapable like everyone else i had heard rumors over the past few months that indiana and national democrats were again urging bayh to run for the senate so i checked with him a couple of times about his level of interest – or lack of interest – in possibly running for his old indiana seat given those conversations i was pretty sure i knew how he felt and what he thought about serving in the senate again he hated the idea unequivocally emphatically no ifs ands or buts i got the clear impression he had no interest returning to an institution crippled by political gridlock and no interest in returning to the partisan political wars which have become more bitter and nasty over the past two decades shades of rubio again but now at the last minute evan bayh suddenly has decided the senate needs him or the country can’t live without him so former rep baron hill and old bayh ally drops his senate bid — which had been underwhelming so far – to allow the indiana democratic party to fill the vacancy with bayh shades of rubio again except rubio made his decision before the florida primary and faces a wealthy primary opponent what did bayh say to explain his shift “with the challenges facing indiana and our country i can no longer sit on the sidelines and watch as partisan bickering grinds washington to a halt hoosier families deserve more and i’ve decided to run to take their cause to the us senate” said the year old st albanseducated former governor and senator in a press release formally announcing his decision ahh i see not really so bayh left the senate because of the partisanship bickering and gridlock and now he wants his old senate seat back because of – you guessed it – the partisanship bickering and gridlock sure i believe that and i believe in the tooth fairy too of course bayh’s decision to run surely was made easier by the fact that he has over  million in his campaign account and will be able to run less than a fourmonth race even if he doesn’t like to idea of having to spend a few months campaigning back in indiana it won’t be much of a burden but while bayh starts at least even in the race or probably with a slight advantage don’t put the hoosier state in the democratic column quite yet bayh who was first elected indiana secretary of state  years ago has not had a competitive race since his  gubernatorial contest when he defeated john mutz the state’s twoterm lieutenant governor  percent to  percent bayh was reelected governor by  points in  elected to the senate by  points in  and reelected to the senate by  points in  they were all laughers that were never competitive – unlike this year’s contest but bayh’s opponent this time is todd young a former marine who graduated from the united states naval academy and has an mba from the university of chicago and a law degree from the university of indiana he was elected to congress three times the first in  and won this year’s gop senate nomination by handily defeating fellow congressman marlin stutzman a tea party favorite on may rd young raised  million through the middle of april according to his preprimary fec report and he looked to be the clear favorite for november while bayh’s entry into the race changes things young won’t roll over against bayh and national republican strategists have more ammunition against bayh than they did during his past races his residence will be an issue when republicans note his various homes and argue his connection to indiana these days is well thin at best and they will surely paint the race as a choice between tomorrow and yesterday finally they are almost certain to stress the larger choice involved linking bayh to clinton obama and democratic control of the senate in  on one hand the senate could use a few more pragmatists like bayh and rubio who are willing to work across the aisle and believe a legislator’s job is to legislate on the other hand flipflopping the way bayh and rubio have done only encourages cynicism about politicians and their personal ambitions for evan bayh his decision to run this year like his  decision is not exactly a profile in courage powerpost powerpost false endofarticle true please provide a valid email address sign up you’re all set see all

republicans maintain control of the senate senatorelect todd young r defeated former sen evan bayh d entrepreneur and secretary of the hamilton county libertarian party lucy brenton l and james johnson writein in the general election to win retiring incumbent dan coats r senate seat on november   ballotpedia initially rated the race for indianas senate seat as safely republican but it became a battleground race when bayh entered the race young was expected to easily defeat former us rep baron hill d but hill exited the race on july   to give democrats a better chance at winning indiana with bayh as the partys nominee bayh a wellknown candidate whose family was active in indiana politics for decades became the frontrunner as soon as he entered the race but missteps caused his lead over young in the polls to narrow republicans accused bayh of abandoning indiana by citing reports that showed he was considered an inactive voter in august  by the indiana election division republicans also accused bayh of abandoning the state because he owned two multimilliondollar homes in washington dc where he spent most of his time while on the campaign trail bayh discussed his decision to return to politics and run for his old senate seat saying i think a lot of what you see going on at the national level is a primal scream at washington saying enough already youve got to change your ways business as usual isnt good enough anymore thats a sentiment i share business as usual isnt good enough anymore one of the reasons im running is to try to change that young tried to undercut bayh’s message by portraying him as a washington insider and positioning himself as someone who has always been loyal to the hoosier state during a campaign stop young said “what i’m hearing from people across the board is they are frustrated by their elected representatives going to washington dc and forgetting about indiana they believe special interests and washington lobbyists — like evan bayh — are a big part of the problem and they’re right” in his victory speech young said i learned in the marines sic to put people before politics tonight you proved the indiana senate seat

and get their product to market medicare and social security america has made a commitment to take care of our seniors for evan bayh it is unacceptable to compromise the promises that we’ve made to them by cutting historically important programs like medicare and social security as indiana’s next senator evan will champion social security and medicare fulfilling the pledge that we’ve made to those who came before us jobs small businesses are the engine of our economy and we need to focus our attention on advancing policies that help them grow and prosper … evan believes in encouraging the

capital for small business owners so that they can grow their organization and encourage longterm investments in new technologies and equipment evan’s plan will incentivize opportunities for research and development making hoosier workers more productive for evan when it comes to supporting hoosier businesses it doesn’t matter if an idea is a republican idea or a democratic idea what matters is that it’s a good idea national security as indiana’s senator evan bayh will make obliterating isis and eliminating the root causes of terrorism a top priority evan will fight for intensifying the airstrike campaign against isis promoting global partnership in the war against terror and expanding the network of our intelligence community at home it is essential that america bolster its domestic intelligence and make sure that first responders are fully equipped and trained to keep us safe our national security forces must have the resources necessary to root out lone wolves before they choose to act evan is committed to supporting america’s longtime ally israel by getting tough on iran in  evan sponsored tough new sanctions on iran and last year he broke with his own party to oppose the president’s nuclear deal education evan bayh knows that america can’t continue to ignore the rising costs of a college education america needs innovators and entrepreneurs to have big ideas and dream big dreams to keep america ahead during his time as governor evan created the st century scholars program it made college affordable and drove students to succeed the program had students commit to success in the eighth grade requiring a b average and a clean record indiana needs its brightest stars to shine and the st century scholars program encourages more stars to shine even brighter — more than  hoosier stars to date evan believes that the st century scholars program was one of his greatest achievements as governor as indiana’s next senator he’s committed to creating similar opportunities for students nationwide and making sure that no good student has to turn down college because they can’t afford it  ” —evan bayh’s campaign website httpevanbayhforindianacomissues  on

for the seat opened by sen dan coates’ rin retirement bayh was us senator from  until he decided not to seek reelection in  citing gridlock and partisanship in congress he had previously served as governor and was known for passing large tax cuts he most recently worked for a lobbying firm in washington dc where he has advised many groups including the us chamber of commerce and in march of this year before deciding to run for senate became cochair of the no labels group which calls itself a “national movement of democrats republicans and independent voters dedicated to a new politics of problem solving” on the issues coming from such a red state bayh arguably can only win as a moderate when he left congress he was ranked the most conservative democratic senator in the th congress voting with the party  of the time though he had voted with the party  in the th and  in the th while he is not strong on climate issues we believe he will be in the right place for key votes he is vocal in his disdain for the current campaign finance system and has the potential to be a champion on the issue his voting history on budget and tax issues is not great but we see an opportunity to push him here election update  bayh entered the race late in july of  but brought with him a campaign war chest of nearly m from before his  retirement shortly after he announced a poll showed him winning by double digits although the race has tightened due to outside spending by gop groups bayh is still expected to win thanks to his high name recognition and approval rating sen evan bayh joins

got it by ezra klein by ezra klein march   after two terms in the senate sen evan bayh dind announced that he was done with congress there are better ways to serve my fellow citizens bayh said i love working for the people of indiana i love helping our citizens make the most of their lives but i do not love congress spencer plattgetty images but he was a very interesting nearretiree when he decided not to seek reelection in  he published a precise and devastating broadside against the institution in which he and his father had served instead of merely condemning the bitter partisanship of the place he proposed to close the loopholes that had enabled polarization to metastasize in paralysis “filibusters should require  senators to  make a commitment to continually debate an issue in reality not just in theory” he wrote and “the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster should be reduced to  from ” strong stuff he then went after money in politics calling for “legislation to enhance disclosure requirements require corporate donors to appear in the political ads they finance and prohibit government contractors or bailout beneficiaries from spending money on political campaigns” not to mention “public matching funds for smaller contributions bayh had no record of leadership on any of these topics but in part for that reason it was particularly potent to hear him speaking out on them an acknowledged moderate who’d taken on these crusades wouldn’t have just been a good senator he’d have been a great one this new incarnation of evan bayh i wrote should stay in the senate where he could do some good but he didn’t want to stay in the senate he told me in subsequent interviews he waxed rhapsodic over his time teaching at indiana university’s graduate school of business “it was real it was tangible and it was making a difference every day” he said he wanted that feeling again he wanted to come home at night he told me and say “dear do you know what we got done today i’ve got this really bright kid in my class and do you know what he asked me and here’s what i told him and i think i saw a little epiphany moment go off in his mind” for a united states senator to explain his retirement by saying “i want to be engaged in an honorable line of work” was the single most persuasive and devastating critique i’d ever seen of the senate as an institution but bayh did not return to indiana to teach he did not as he said he was thinking of doing join a foundation rather he went to the massive law firm mcguire woods and who does mcguire woods work for “principal clients served from our washington office include national energy companies foreign countries international manufacturing companies trade associations and local and national businesses” reads the company’s web site he followed that up by signing on as a senior adviser to apollo management group a giant publicequity firm and finally this week he joined fox news as a contributor it’s as if he’s systematically ticking off every poison he identified in the body politic and rushing to dump more of it into the water supply the “corrosive system of campaign financing” that bayh considered such a threat he’s being paid by both mcguire woods and apollo global management to act as a corroding agent on their behalf the “strident partisanship” and “unyielding ideology” he complained was ruining the senate at fox news he’ll be right there on set while it gets cooked up his warning that “what is required from members of congress and the public alike is a new spirit of devotion to the national welfare beyond party or selfinterest” sounds in retrospect like a joke evan bayh doing performance art as evan bayh exactly which of these new positions would bayh say is against his selfinterest or in promotion of the general welfare i should say for the record that i got in touch with mcguire woods to give bayh an opportunity to comment or offer an alternative interpretation of his career decisions i didn’t hear from them but i got a call back from a pr person at fox news “i’m going to decline the interview for mr bayh” the flack said and i guess i’m not surprised it’s one thing to take the positions bayh took without much of a record on them it’s a whole other to try to sustain them when his paychecks are being signed by people who profit from the very forces he lamented in our last interview bayh complained of the poor opinion the public had of him and his colleagues “they look at us like we’re worse than usedcar salesmen” yes they do and this

through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip

think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in

american  politician born december     loading sometimes you have to make tough decisions to hold the line on spending evan bayh decisions tough you sometimes making progress a step at a time is better than no progress at all evan bayh time progress step america is stronger than ever we will forever remember those we lost on september   in honoring their memory we will remain true to our commitment to freedom and democracy evan bayh freedom memory commitment across the country military families are facing dire financial circumstances due to longer than expected tours of duties they are being penalized for their patriotism  no one should have to choose between doing right by their country and doing right by their families evan bayh patriotism financial doing chinas islandbuilding in the south china sea poses a threat to us national security interests in the region evan bayh sea security china to win the war on terror we must know who our friends are and where our enemies are hiding we cant continue fighting terrorism using the same foreign policy blueprints that were in place before september th evan bayh war friends know you now have sixyear campaigns for the senate  you never stop running its not uncommon for a member of the senate to have a fundraising breakfast a fundraising lunch and a fundraising dinner and then when the senate breaks for the week to go home more fundraisers and thats driven by the cost of campaigning evan bayh home week breakfast mothers  especially single mothers  are heroic in their efforts to raise our nations children but men must also take responsibility for their children and recognize the impact they have on their families wellbeing evan bayh children parenting men what is required from members of congress and the public alike is a new spirit of devotion to the national welfare beyond party or selfinterest evan bayh party beyond new the amount of us debt held by countries such as china and japan is at a historic high with foreign investors holding half of americas publicly held debt this dependence raises the specter that other nations will be able to influence our policies in ways antithetical to american interests evan bayh america american influence we must do all we can to help improve the deplorable human rights situation of the north korean people evan bayh help people human we should be proud of liberating the  million people in iraq and should remember that this is why it is important to stick it out to its successful conclusion evan bayh proud remember successful people come into public life for different reasons none of us are egochallenged i think or we probably wouldnt be doing what were doing so if anyone tells you that they dont like the sound of the applause and the ego gratification i dont think theyre being straight with you evan bayh life ego people my first meeting as a senator my first day they were already talking about the next election part of thats the permanent campaign part of thats a word ive been using more frequently tribal our politics has become tribal its us versus them evan bayh politics day meeting baseball may be our national pastime but the ageold tradition of taking a swing at congress is a sport with even deeper historical roots in the american experience since the founding of our country citizens from ben franklin to david letterman have made fun of their elected officials evan bayh experience baseball fun challenges of historic import threaten americas future action on the deficit economy energy health care and much more is imperative yet our legislative institutions fail to act congress must be reformed evan bayh health future action filibusters have proliferated because under current rules just one or two determined senators can stop the senate from functioning today the mere threat of a filibuster is enough to stop a vote senators are rarely asked to pull allnighters like jimmy stewart in mr smith goes to washington evan bayh today rules stop of course the genesis of a good portion of the gridlock in congress does not reside in congress itself ultimate reform will require each of us as voters and americans to take a long look in the mirror because in many ways our representatives in washington reflect the people who have sent them there evan bayh good mirror long as indianas governor i balanced eight budgets never raised taxes and left the largest surplus in state history it wasnt always easy cuts had to be made and some initiatives deferred occasionally i had to say no evan bayh history easy taxes i love working for the people of indiana i love helping our citizens make the most of their lives but i do not love congress evan bayh love people working ive had a growing conviction that congress is not operating as it should there is much too much partisanship and not enough progress evan bayh progress growing too much hoosiers are very independent evan bayh independent very what matters is moving forward and focusing on practical results for the american people evan bayh moving forward moving my father was on the judiciary committee all  years he had a good personal relationship with jim eastland they probably didnt agree on practically anything or very little from a public policy standpoint but they were willing to work through that to see what they could get done just because they knew each other and liked each other evan bayh work relationship father while romanticizing the senate of yore would be a mistake it was certainly better in my fathers time evan bayh time father better sometimes it takes leaving to gain some perspective i see that clearly every time i leave washington dc and return to indiana i see the bizarre bubble that seems to enclose the beltway and makes people forget what regular people care about evan bayh time leaving perspective share this page cite this page citation find on amazon evan bayh related authors
