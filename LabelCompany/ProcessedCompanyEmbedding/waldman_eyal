statements in light of new information or future events now ill turn the call over to eyal for his opening remarks eyal eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd thank you jeff good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us we are disappointed with the results of our first quarter  this is the second time in the last  years of being a public company in which we missed our guidance first quarter was  million in revenues a yearoveryear decline of  first quarter diluted nongaap eps was  declined  yearoveryear we generated  million in first quarter  operating cash flow and ended the quarter with  million in cash and investments our results reflect the impact of seasonal trends in highperformance computing delays in general availability of the nextgeneration x cpus to the market and technology transitions occurring across several key customers as a result our infiniband revenues were down sequentially below our expectation we believe infiniband revenues will see sequential growth in coming quarters driven by backlog and additional pipeline opportunities we do not see infiniband losing share in the market we anticipate strong demand for our edr product in  as customers continue to transition to higher network speeds as the need for higher bandwidth driven by data growth continues to accelerate for highperformance computing machine learning big data storage financial services and cloud deployment our recent competitive analysis conducted by a leading global oem comparing mellanoxs infiniband to intels omnipath demonstrated customers can achieve  to  higher application performance using mellanoxs infiniband versus omnipath the performance analysis was conducted at an enduser site across multiple applications covering several key commercial industries the analysis also highlighted the benefits customers achieve from the scalability and offload capabilities offered with infiniband a key differentiator versus omnipath allowing for  lower total cost of ownership from multiple applications we believe the competitive advantages of infiniband over omnipath will further widen with the introduction of our gigabit hdr solutions in  during the first quarter our ethernet revenues grew  yearoveryear and  sequentially ethernet revenues grew across all product lines customer interest and engagement regarding our   and gigabit ethernet solutions remain strong revenues from our   and gigabit ethernet solutions are now greater than revenues from  and gigabit ethernet solutions mellanox is the preferred network interface card deployed in global oem shipment of gigabit per second and above this is the first time that mellanox ethernet mix has been a preferred choice for oem servers our spectrum ethernet switch revenues grew in the first quarter we started shipping hundreds of spectrumbased switches to tier web  customers worldwide we see growing interest for spectrum across multiple markets and applications further deployment of spectrum is expected in the second half of the year and we believe that our spectrum switch revenues will accelerated through the remainder of  and offer a broad longterm growth opportunity to mellanox our linkx revenues grew sequentially and yearoveryear during the first quarter in march at the  optical fiber conference mellanox introduced a new line of gigabit per second silicon photonics and vcselbased transceivers these new transceivers double the bandwidth for hyperscale web  and cloud customers we believe linkx revenues for both infiniband and ethernet are wellpositioned for growth in  and beyond in the first quarter our network processor revenues attributable to the acquisition of ezchip in february of  grew sequentially and yearoveryear when taking into account the full first quarter of  results we see growth for network processors in  with np and np solutions continuing to represent the majority of the revenue now i will turn the call over to jacob for a review of our first quarter results and to discuss expectations for the second quarter of  jacob jacob shulman  mellanox technologies ltd thank you eyal good afternoon everyone we are disappointed with the first quarter  results our total revenues were  million down approximately  from  million in the first quarter of  the following are a few selected q  revenue metrics for you revenues from our ics represented  of first quarter revenues revenues from boards were  and switch system revenues accounted for  first quarter infiniband revenues were at  million our infiniband revenues declined  yearoveryear revenues from our infinibandbased products represented  of revenues in q  down from  of revenues in q  our edr gigabit per second infiniband products were up  yearoveryear and represented  of infiniband revenues quarterly ethernet revenues were  million up  yearoveryear and grew  sequentially ethernet revenues represented  of first quarter revenues revenues from our latest generation   and gigabit ethernet product increased by  sequentially we had two more than  customers in the first quarter they were hp and dell each with  of revenues our nongaap gross margins in the first quarter were  down  basis points from the fourth quarter of  major reconciling items from gaap to nongaap gross profit are sharebased compensation expenses of  and amortization of acquired intangibles of  million first quarter nongaap operating expenses increased by  million sequentially to  million and represented  of revenues compared with  million or  of revenues in the fourth quarter of  major reconciling items from gaap to nongaap operating expenses are sharebased compensation of  million amortization of acquired intangibles of  million and acquisitionrelated charges of  our nongaap research and development expenses in the first quarter were  million compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  representing a sequential increase of  the increase was primarily due to higher development and tapeout expenses as we continued to invest in our new products nongaap sales and marketing expenses were  million in the first quarter compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  representing a sequential increase of  in the first quarter our nongaap general and administrative expenses were  million compared to  million in the fourth quarter representing a sequential decrease of  the first quarter  nongaap operating income was  million and represented  of revenues compared with operating income of  million or  of revenues in the previous quarter interest expenses associated with the term debt during the first quarter were  million during the quarter we paid down an additional  million of the debt the outstanding debt principal amount was  million at quarterend the first quarter nongaap tax benefit was  the nongaap tax benefit excludes  million associated with utilization of deferred taxes on net operating losses in israel first quarter nongaap net income was  million or  per diluted share this compares to the first quarter of  nongaap net income of  million or  per diluted share cash provided by operating activities during the first quarter  was  million compared to  million in the first quarter of  our cash and investments at the end of the quarter were  million compared to  million at december   we currently expect our second quarter  nongaap results to be as follows quarterly revenues of  million to  million second quarter  nongaap gross margins of  to  we expect a sequential increase in nongaap operating expenses of  to  we estimate our second quarter sharebased compensation expense to be between  million and  million nongaap diluted share count in the second quarter is  million shares to  million shares ill turn it back to eyal now for a few closing comments eyal eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd thank you jacob while were disappointed with the first quarter results we believe revenues will see sequential growth in coming quarters we continued to see multiple design wins for our products in multiple platforms that we expect well ship later this year and in  these design wins include more than  storage platforms more than  artificial intelligence projects and multiple web  and cloud providers platforms worldwide were also seeing success in thirdparty software offerings on top of spectrum which validates mellanoxs commitment to open networking we expect revenues from spectrum utilizing thirdparty software to continue to grow in  we plan on introducing multiple new products including the bluefield systemonachip and our gigabit per second endtoend solutions to the market we believe these products will create growth opportunities for mellanox the increase in investment into this new product introductions has impacted our operating leverage during the first half of  we are proactively managing future expenses and with anticipated improvement in sequential revenue growth during  we believe leverage can return to our model in late  we remain confident that mellanox is wellpositioned to deliver the right product in the right place at the right time and now we will take questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from kevin cassidy with stifel please go ahead kevin e cassidy  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you for taking my question just to understand a little better of what changed from your guidance to the results in the infiniband revenue miss how much of that was related to an hpc deployment eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd we dont have the exact numbers but i think multiple percentages of miss was due to hpc deployment we had no large hpc deals in q and we do see large hpc deals in q and q coming in  kevin e cassidy  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay so the ones that you were expecting for q they are being pushed out so the actual revenue estimates for  should stay about the same eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd some of the projects were pushed out to q and q and thats why we kind of guided the growth and we gave a conservative guidance for q kevin e cassidy  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd thank you operator thank you our next question comes from joseph wolf with barclay please go ahead joseph wolf  barclays capital inc thank you a question just on the hpc market to start is the edr – can you give us the percentage of your hpc customers who are using edr at this point given the growth in that number or is the edr growth coming from noninfiniband endmarkets eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd no its coming from the hpc market mainly i mean most of the gigabit per second infiniband is hpc and artificial intelligence companies joseph wolf  barclays capital inc okay and then on the spending side is any of the spending side related to the currency or is just mainly for new product and should we expect the sequential increases to stay at this  to  each quarter for the rest of the year i know you dont want to give guidance on that but just in terms of the kinds of things being spent on or is some of this currency and unavoidable in any case on a reporting basis jacob shulman  mellanox technologies ltd yeah so the increase in rd investments in q was due to increasing development in tapeout cost the currency impact was very minimal going forward we expect to keep our operating expenses between flat to lowsingledigit growth sequentially quarteroverquarter joseph wolf  barclays capital inc okay and then just finally has the switch business gone through a  million a quarter run rate and as you look at that you mentioned eyal towards the end of your comments that the thirdparty opportunities were emerging can you just walk us through some of that how thats going whether thats going to be the biggest driver of growth and then also just sort of linked to that but not entirely you mentioned the oem but i thought you also made an announcement about odms just some of the partnerships youve got to boost the ethernet business going forward for the rest of the year eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd yeah so first we think that infiniband will also contribute to our growth in  during the quarters and in  as well so we do see infiniband or do expect infiniband to continue growing through  we just see people wait one of the x new processors introduction to the market is delayed and were seeing people on the hold part and waiting for the new process to be in the market to deploy hpc clusters and computers so thats why were seeing the pushout joseph wolf  barclays capital inc okay thank you eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd on the spectrum and thirdparty software tens of percentages of our revenue related to spectrum comes from platforms we ship with thirdparty software on top of it and we expect to continue seeing this we expect to see more oems and odms adopt our spectrumbased platforms and ship them in asia in the us and in europe in the coming quarters joseph wolf  barclays capital inc yeah thanks eyal eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd thank you operator thank you our next question comes from srini nandury with summit redstone please go ahead srini nandury  summit redstone partners llc all right thank you for taking my question in your press release you mentioned that there were several technology transitions happening at your oem customers as well as some end customers so eyal can you please explain what youre referring to in that eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd yeah first theres bandwidth transitions that are happening in some cases youre seeing consolidations in the market of some of our customers those are the things that were experiencing in this transition quarter srini nandury  summit redstone partners llc i see i see okay in terms of one of the things thats kind of stuck me was that infiniband was down so much and have you lost any deals during the quarter to intel omnipath and can you talk about the competition in general with intel are they getting aggressive and how are they competing with you guys in the market right now eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd so no we dont think were losing market share to intel with omnipath were actually seeing more people being disappointed with omnipath interconnect and some are actually reconsidering their decisions intel is continuing to be aggressive in terms of pushing omnipath into the market with their pricing strategy and convincing customers to join omnipath but we dont think theyre successful in turning or taking more market share from us srini nandury  summit redstone partners llc okay in terms of your cpu delays which you mentioned in the press release as well what are the expectations for the cpus and when did you guys get to know that the cpus were getting delayed and why didnt you guys actually preannounce if you knew that youre going to miss the numbers eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd well first we cant we are under nda in terms of how to – announcement is scheduled for the x cpu and then in terms of the announcement were looking at benchmark industry practices for regulatory parameters and we didnt think that theres a need to preannounce srini nandury  summit redstone partners llc all right thank you gentlemen eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd thank you operator thank you our next question comes from harlan sur with jpmorgan please go ahead harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question when you talk about the delay in cpu transitions obviously i assume youre talking about purleyskylake cpu launch i thought that this was always planned to be targeted for kind of middle of this year so this shouldnt have been new news to your customers or was there some expectation that there would have been some availability of purley and skylake processors in q eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd again we have information under nda but the expectation – there are delays in the new x cpu deployments in the market harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc so as it relates to your view that infiniband will start to grow sequentially starting in q is that under the assumption that there is going to be availability of purley and skylake cpus starting in q eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd its under the assumption of deployments that we already have in our backlog for q harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then eyal do you expect growth in your infiniband business for full  because if you do i mean that would imply at least  sequential growth for your infiniband business every single quarter for the remainder of this year so do you expect full growth for infiniband for full year and confidence level about kind of strong doubledigit sequential growth june quarter september quarter december quarter eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd so we dont have enough visibility into the full year we do expect a definite sequential growth for infiniband in the coming quarters and like i said we didnt see any large deal in q and we are seeing multiple large deals in q and q that already are in our backlog but we dont have enough visibility to give you guidance for the full  we do expect to grow  to  like we said and as we have more visibility well guide when we can harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then on the ethernet side obviously good to see the crossover   gigabit versus gigabit so i guess maybe the nearterm question is do you expect continued growth in the ethernet nic card business in q and for the remainder of this year is that primarily going to be   gig eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd yes we expect to continuously grow with our ethernet nic as people transition more into the   and gigabit and we expect to continue to take market share on the nic side harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc and then my final question on the ethernet nic side outside of you guys i mean are you seeing any other competitors in the market at this point eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd were seeing other companies announce product availability of   and gigabit nics industry analysts estimate that mellanox has more than  market share for those nics like we said its the first time were the preferred vendors by tier  oems and tier  oems for the gigabit and above i just returned from asia where i was last week and were getting very good traction compared to other nic vendors that they are trying in terms of our ethernet nic solution so first we have  and we continue to expect to maintain the lions share of the   and gigabit ethernet nic market in the market harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd thank you operator our next question comes from andrew nowinski with piper jaffray please go ahead andrew james nowinski  piper jaffray  co all right thanks maybe just a clarification first you talked about having leverage returning late in  are you saying that you expect yearoveryear revenue growth in q to exceed yearoveryear growth in opex jacob shulman  mellanox technologies ltd can you repeat the question andrew andrew james nowinski  piper jaffray  co yeah i just want a clarification on terms of what you referred to as seeing leverage return late in the model in  are you expecting the yearoveryear revenue growth in q to exceed the yearoveryear growth in opex eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd yes and also we dont have good visibility into q so its in our model but andrew james nowinski  piper jaffray  co i guess im just trying to understand what you guys said at the end of prepared remarks in terms of having leverage return what are you referring to jacob shulman  mellanox technologies ltd yes we expect our revenue growth to exceed the expense growth yearoveryear andrew james nowinski  piper jaffray  co okay and then dell wasnt a  customer at all over the last two years can you just give us an update on the opportunity at dell and do you think thats sustainable going forward or is that just a onequarter thing here eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd no dont forget that there was a emcdell merger that closed so its a combination of two of our large customers into one andrew james nowinski  piper jaffray  co all right so going forward do you think theyll stay a  customer eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd we hope so andrew james nowinski  piper jaffray  co okay thanks guys eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mark kelleher with da davidson please go ahead mark kelleher  d a davidson  co great thanks for taking the question most have been asked and answered but just a couple of followups on the ethernet side youve talked in the past about two cloud oems that had adopted and were going to ship and two more that were in evaluation can you give us an update on those eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd yeah in asia were making good strides in adoption of the spectrum by several hyperscale data center guys with spectrum in the us were in the process of having two hyperscale customers adopt spectrum into their data centers mark kelleher  d a davidson  co okay and how are you doing selling the switch not just the chip but the full system is that getting traction eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd yeah i think were selling more spectrum systems than spectrum silicon into the market mark kelleher  d a davidson  co okay okay thats all i have thanks eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd thank you operator thank you well go next to alex kurtz with pacific crest please go ahead alex kurtz  pacific crest securities yeah thanks guys for taking a couple of questions here so eyal just to clarify on that last question on the two domestic spectrum deployments theyre taking the switches or the silicon eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd theyre taking the systems and not only that we are having good traction with a number of oems they will adopt also our systems and take them to market in  so on top of the web  and cloud hyperscale guys we have oems that we believe will adopt spectrum systems and ship them as theirs alex kurtz  pacific crest securities okay and just more clarification on purleyskylake i think most folks really were expecting general availability until maybe q and so i think were just trying to understand exactly what happened in q and from what i hear it sounds like people are just putting projects on hold until they get the benchmarks back in the specs and try to understand when they want to make the purchase or was there some actual products that were delayed in q from your processor partners eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd we were expecting to have a number of those to be deployed in q and some of them pushed out to q and we believe that some of them were due to waiting for the nextgeneration technology alex kurtz  pacific crest securities okay all right thank you eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd thank you operator thank you well go next to james kisner with jefferies please go ahead james kisner  jefferies llc hi thanks for taking the questions so just first i dont know this is asked sorry if it was but youve mentioned in the press release technology transitions at several oems is that the ethernet transition or is there something else happening eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd its the ethernet transition and then some consolidation in some of our customer base so those are kind of the main two transitions were seeing james kisner  jefferies llc okay that helps so you mentioned in the release also you expected to grow this year when we were talking about healthy doubledigit i mean could you give us a little more than just – do you expect to grow i mean is it lowsingle digits midsingle digits anything you can say there knowing that you dont have a lot of visibility eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd yeah we continue to see growth in  compared to  but we dont have enough visibility to give you a more accurate number for now james kisner  jefferies llc okay so its interesting because dram and nand have been scapegoats i think in the server business recently and  held today so im wondering it seems like you guys arent really blaming that are you seeing any kind of impact from dram or nand or is that just not a problem eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd no were not seeing impact from that james kisner  jefferies llc okay and just finally here if you can give us a little more on the transceiver business i think you talked about some numbers like tens of thousands a quarter i think and hyperscale demand seems to be ramping pretty strongly but just kind of wondering how robust that ramp is in this quarter and in q with that expectation and at some point should we start to see some margin pressure on that for instance potentially this year thanks eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd so were actually seeing – again shipping tens of thousands of transceivers to multiple customers gross margins stays healthy from the way we see it from our perspective we expect to continue to have healthy gross margins with the transceivers were coming with some new revisions of those transceivers so we expect maybe even to grow volume there and we continue to expect to grow our linkx business in  james kisner  jefferies llc great thank you very much eyal d waldman  mellanox technologies ltd thank you operator it appears we have no further questions at this time ill turn the floor back over to eyal waldman for any
