united states x oil fund the “fund” a series of the uscf funds trust is a fund that issues shares that trade on nyse arca equities inc “nyse” the investment objective of the fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value “nav” to reflect three times x the daily change in percentage terms of the price of a specified shortterm futures contract on light sweet crude oil called the “benchmark oil futures contract” the fund seeks a return that is  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for a single day the fund should not be expected to provide  of the cumulative return for the benchmark oil futures contract for periods greater than a day   the fund pays its sponsor united states commodity funds llc “uscf” a limited liability company a management fee and incurs certain other costs the address of both uscf and the fund is  harrison street suite  oakland ca  the telephone number for both uscf and the fund is  in order for a hypothetical investment in shares to breakeven over the next  months assuming a selling price of  the investment would have to generate  •   return or   •   the fund is an exchange traded fund this means that most investors who decide to buy or sell shares of the fund place their trade orders through their brokers and may incur customary brokerage commissions and charges shares of the fund trade on nyse under the ticker symbol “  •  ” and are bought and sold throughout the trading day at bid and ask prices like other publicly traded securities shares will trade on nyse after they are initially purchased by “authorized participants” institutional firms that purchase shares in blocks of  shares called “baskets” through the fund’s marketing agent • the “marketing agent” the initial price per share will be  the initial price per basket will be  and • is the initial authorized participant thereafter the price of a basket will be equal to the nav of  shares on the day that the order to purchase the basket is accepted by the marketing agent the nav per share will be calculated by taking the current market value of the fund’s total assets after close of nyse subtracting any liabilities and dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares factors that may affect the market value of the fund and thereby the price per share include but are not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil regulatory changes and regulatory fees in the energy sector please see below for additional information the offering of the fund’s shares will be a “best efforts” offering which means that neither the marketing agent nor any authorized participant is required to purchase a specific number or dollar amount of shares uscf will pay the marketing agent  •  aggregate compensation paid to the marketing agent and any affiliate of uscf for distributionrelated services in connection with this offering of shares will not exceed ten percent  of the gross proceeds of the offering   the fund is not appropriate for all investors and presents many different risks than other types of funds including risks associated with the use of leverage the fund is intended to be a daily trading tool for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks the fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the benchmark oil futures contract additionally the fund is designed to achieve its stated investment objective on a daily basis but its performance over different periods of time can differ significantly from its stated daily objective the fund is riskier than securities that have intermediate or longterm investment objectives and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold shares of the fund for a period other than one day the return of the fund for a period longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day compounded over the period and usually will differ from the  of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract for the same period daily compounding of the fund’s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longerterm performance during periods of high volatility volatility may be at least as important to the fund’s return for a period as the return of the benchmark oil futures contract accordingly the fund should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily compounding leveraged long investment results investors should actively and frequently monitor their investments in the fund even intraday it is possible that you will suffer significant losses in the fund even if the longterm performance of the benchmark oil futures contract is positive         investors who buy or sell shares during the day from their broker may do so at a premium or discount relative to the market value of the underlying benchmark oil futures contracts in which the fund invests due to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares investing in the fund involves risks similar to those involved with leveraged exposure to the benchmark oil futures contracts and other significant risks see “ risk factors involved with an investment in the fund ” beginning on page  the offering of the fund’s shares is registered with the securities and exchange commission “sec” in accordance with the securities act of  the “ act” the offering is intended to be a continuous offering and is not expected to terminate until all of the registered shares

of funds including risks associated with the effects of leveraged investing an investor should only consider an investment in the fund if he or she understands the consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results the fund seeks to return before fees and expenses a multiple x of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract for a single day not for any other period the return of the fund for a period longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day compounded over the period and usually will differ from the fund’s multiple times the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for the same period daily compounding of the fund’s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longerterm performance during periods of high volatility volatility may be at least as important to the fund’s return for a period as the return of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the benchmark oil futures contract for example the return of the fund for a single day should be approximately three times as volatile as the return of a fund for a single day with an objective of matching the same benchmark oil futures contract shareholders who invest in the funds should actively manage and monitor their investments as frequently as daily    the trust and the fund   the uscf funds trust the “trust” is a delaware statutory trust formed on march   the trust is a series trust formed pursuant to the delaware statutory trust act each series a “fund” and collectively the “funds” the united states x oil fund the “fund” formed on  ·   is a series of the trust the fund is a commodity pool that continuously issues common shares of beneficial interest that may be purchased and sold on nyse arca equities inc stock exchange “nyse” the trust and the fund operate pursuant to the trust’s declaration of trust and trust agreement the “trust agreement” dated as of march   wilmington trust company a delaware trust company is the delaware trustee of the trust the trust and the fund are managed and controlled by uscf uscf is a limited liability company formed in delaware on may   that is registered as a commodity pool operator “cpo” with the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” and is a member of the national futures association “nfa”  the fund’s investment objective and strategy   the investment objective of the fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value “nav” to reflect three times x the daily change in percentage terms of the price of a specified shortterm futures contract on light sweet crude oil called the “benchmark oil futures contract” less the fund’s expenses to achieve this objective uscf endeavors to have the notional value of the fund’s aggregate exposure to the benchmark oil futures contract at the close of each trading day approximately equal to the  of the fund’s nav the fund seeks a return that is  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for a single day and does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day    the pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that the return of the fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for a period of longer than a full trading day because the aggregate return of the fund is the product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns    what is the “benchmark oil futures contract”   the benchmark oil futures contract is the futures contract on light sweet crude oil as traded on the new york mercantile exchange the “nymex” that is the near month contract to expire except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire              the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in futures contracts for light sweet crude oil other types of crude oil dieselheating oil gasoline natural gas and other petroleumbased fuels that are traded on the nymex ice futures exchange or other us and foreign exchanges collectively “oil futures contracts” and to a lesser extent in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions other oilrelated investments such as cashsettled options on oil futures contracts forward contracts for oil cleared swap contracts and nonexchange traded “overthecounter” or “otc” transactions that are based on the price of oil other petroleumbased fuels oil futures contracts and indices based on the foregoing collectively “other oilrelated investments” market conditions that uscf currently anticipates could cause the fund to invest in other oilrelated investments include those allowing the fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing for convenience and unless otherwise specified oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments collectively are referred to as “oil interests” in this prospectus the fund seeks to invest in a combination of oil interests such that the daily changes in its nav measured in percentage terms less the fund’s expenses will track three times x the daily changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract also measured in percentage terms as a specific benchmark uscf endeavors to place the fund’s trades in oil interests and otherwise manage the fund’s investments so that the difference between “a” and “b” will be plusminus  percent  of “b” where     •   a is the average daily percentage change in the fund’s per share nav for any period of thirty  successive valuation days ie  any nyse trading day as of which the fund calculates its per share nav less the fund’s expenses and     •   b is three times the average daily percentage change in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract over the same period uscf believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause daily changes in the fund’s share price on nyse on a percentage basis to closely track the daily changes in the fund’s per share nav on a percentage basis the fund will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day  the pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that the return of the fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for a period of longer than a full trading day because the aggregate return of the fund is the product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns during periods of market volatility the volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract may affect the fund’s return as much as or more than the return of the benchmark oil futures contract further the return for investors that invest for periods less than a full trading day or for a period different than a trading day will not be the product of the return of the fund’s stated investment objective and the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract for the full trading day additionally investors should be aware that the fund’s investment objective is not for its nav or market price of shares to equal in dollar terms the spot price of light sweet crude oil natural market forces called contango and backwardation can impact the total return on an investment in the fund’s shares relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and in the future it is likely that the relationship between the market price of the fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation it is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil which could be substantial  principal investment risks of an investment in the fund   an investment in the fund involves a degree of risk some of the risks you may face are summarized below a more extensive discussion of these risks appears beginning on page  investment risk   investors may choose to use the fund as a means of investing indirectly in crude oil there are significant risks and hazards inherent in the crude oil industry that may cause the price of crude oil to widely fluctuate correlation risk   to the extent that investors use the fund as a means of indirectly investing in crude oil there is the risk that the daily changes in the price of the fund’s shares on the nyse on a percentage basis will not closely track the daily changes in the spot price of light sweet crude oil on a percentage basis this could happen if the price of shares traded on the nyse does not correlate closely with the value of the fund’s nav the changes in the fund’s nav do not correlate closely with the changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract or the changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract do not closely correlate with the changes in the cash or spot price of crude oil this is a risk because if these correlations do not exist then investors may not be able to use the fund as a costeffective way to indirectly invest in crude oil or as a hedge against the risk of loss in crude oilrelated transactions   the price relationship between the near month contract to expire and the next month contract to expire that compose the benchmark oil futures contract will vary and may impact both the total return over time of the fund’s nav as well as the degree to which its total return tracks other crude oil price indices’ total returns in cases in which the near month contract’s price is lower than the next month contract’s price a situation known as “contango” in the futures markets then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration in cases in which the near month contract’s price is higher than the next month contract’s price a situation known as “backwardation” in the futures markets then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration              compounding risk   the fund has a singleday investment objective because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time the return of the fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period which will very likely differ from  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract over the same period the fund may lose money if the benchmark oil futures contract performance is flat over time and as a result of daily rebalancing the volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract and the effects of compounding it is even possible that the fund will lose money over time while the level of the benchmark oil futures contract increases   the fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently the fund is not intended to be used by and is not appropriate for investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios   tax risk   the fund is organized and operated as a delaware statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of its trust agreement and applicable state law but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited partnership and therefore has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual funds overthecounter “otc” contract risk   the fund may also invest in negotiated “otc” contracts which are not as liquid as exchangetraded futures contracts otc contracts expose the fund to the risk that the fund’s counterparty may not be able to satisfy its obligations to the fund other risks   the fund pays fees and expenses that are incurred regardless of whether it is profitable unlike mutual funds commodity pools or other investment pools that manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains and distribute such income and gains to their investors the fund generally does not distribute cash to limited partners or other shareholders you should not invest in the fund if you will need cash distributions from the fund to pay taxes on your share of income and gains of the fund if any or for any other reason the fund has no operating history so there is no performance history to serve as a basis for you to evaluate an investment in the fund you will have no rights to participate in the management of the fund and will have to rely on the duties and judgment of uscf to manage the fund the fund is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving uscf the marketing agent various commodity futures brokers and authorized participants uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund uscf’s personnel are directors officers or employees of other entities that may compete with the fund for their services including other commodity pools funds that uscf manages these funds are referred to in this prospectus as the “related public funds” and are identified in the glossary uscf could have a conflict between its responsibilities to the fund and to those other entities as a result of these and other relationships parties involved with the fund have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interest of the fund and the shareholders               the fund’s fees and expenses   this table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund you should note that you may pay brokerage fees on purchases and sales of the fund’s shares which are not reflected in the table authorized participants will pay applicable creation and redemption fees see “creation and redemption of shares creation and redemption transaction fee ” page    annual fund operating expenses expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment       fees and expenses   management fee             •    brokerage fees            •    total annual fund operating expenses           •       the fund is contractually obligated to pay uscf a management fee based on daily net assets and paid monthly of  —  average daily net assets are calculated daily by taking the average of the total net assets of the fund over the calendar year ie  the sum of daily total net assets divided by the number of calendar days in the year on days when markets are closed the total net assets are the total net assets from the last day when the market was open               risk factors involved with an investment in the fund you should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision you should also refer to the other information included in this prospectus as well as information found in our periodic reports which includes the trust’s and the fund’s financial statements and related notes  risks related to leveraged investments due to the compounding of daily returns the fund’s returns over periods longer than a single day will likely differ in amount and possibly even direction from the fund multiple times the benchmark return for the period   the investment objective of the fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its per share nav to reflect three times x the daily change in percentage terms of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund seeks investment results for a single day only as measured from nav calculation time to nav calculation time and not for any other period the return of the fund for a period longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day compounded over the period and usually will differ from three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for the same period the fund could lose money over time regardless of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract including as a result of daily rebalancing the benchmark oil futures contract’s volatility and compounding longer holding periods higher volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract and greater leverage each affect the impact of compounding on the fund’s returns daily compounding of the fund’s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longerterm performance during periods of high volatility volatility may be at least as important to the fund’s return for a period as the return of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the benchmark oil futures contract for example the return for a single day should be approximately three times as volatile for a single day as the return of a fund with an objective of matching the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund is not appropriate for all investors and present different risks than other funds the fund uses leverage and is riskier than similarly benchmarked exchangetraded funds that do not use leverage an investor should only consider an investment in the fund if he or she understands the consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results for a single day daily objective leveraged funds if used properly and in conjunction with the investor’s view on the future direction and volatility of the markets can be useful tools for investors who want to manage their exposure to various markets and market segments and who are willing to monitor andor periodically rebalance their portfolios shareholders who invest in the funds should actively manage and monitor their investments as frequently as daily in general during periods of higher volatility for the benchmark oil futures contract compounding will cause the fund’s results for periods longer than a single day to be less than three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract this effect becomes more pronounced as volatility increases conversely in periods of lower volatility for the benchmark oil futures contract particularly when combined with higher returns for the benchmark oil futures contract the fund’s returns over longer periods can be higher than three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract actual results for a particular period before fees and expenses are also dependent on the magnitude of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract in addition to the volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract intraday priceperformance risk the fund is typically rebalanced at or about the time of its nav calculation as such the intraday position of the fund will generally be different from the fund’s stated daily investment objective ie x when shares are bought intraday the performance of the fund’s shares until the fund’s next nav calculation will generally be greater than or less than the fund’s stated daily multiple the use of leveraged positions could result in the total loss of an investor’s investment the fund utilizes leverage in seeking to achieve its investment objective and will lose more money in market environments adverse to its respective daily investment objectives than funds that do not employ leverage the use of leveraged positions could result in the total loss of an investor’s investment for example because the investment objective of the fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its per share nav to reflect three times x the daily change in percentage terms of the benchmark oil futures contract a singleday movement in the benchmark oil futures contract approaching  at any point in the day could result in the total loss or almost total loss of an investor’s investment if that movement is contrary to the investment objective of the fund even if the benchmark oil futures contract subsequently moves in an opposite direction eliminating all or a portion of the movement this would be the case with downward singleday or intraday movements in the benchmark oil futures contract even if the benchmark oil futures contract maintains a level greater than zero at all times             investment risk   the nav of the fund’s shares relates directly to the value of the benchmark oil futures contracts and other assets held by the fund and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in the fund’s shares past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results all or substantially all of an investment in the fund could be lost the net assets of the fund consist primarily of investments in oil futures contracts and to a lesser extent in other oilrelated investments the nav of the fund’s shares relates directly to the value of these assets less liabilities including accrued but unpaid expenses which in turn relates to the price of light sweet crude oil in the marketplace crude oil prices depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil economic conditions impacting crude oil the demand for crude oil correlates closely with general economic growth rates the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on crude oil prices other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for crude oil sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also may adversely impact the demand for crude oil other crude oil demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for crude oil and therefore its price include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns which affect the demand for crude oil associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as toward alternative fueled vehicles other crude oil supplyrelated factors crude oil prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce crude oil prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of crude oil world oil supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by member countries to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries “opec” production quotas and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the petroleum industry to find produce and refine oil and to manufacture petrochemicals which in turn may affect the supply of and demand for oil other factors impacting the crude oil market the supply of and demand for crude oil may also be impacted by changes in interest rates inflation and other local or regional market conditions as well as by the development of alternative energy sources price volatility may possibly cause the total loss of your investment futures contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes consequently you could lose all or substantially all of your investment in the fund  correlation risk investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of crude oil will have an efficient hedge only if the price investors pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of crude oil investing in the fund’s shares for hedging purposes involves the following risks     •   the market price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be significantly less or more than nav     •   daily percentage changes in nav may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes on a leveraged basis in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract     •   daily percentage changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of light sweet crude oil            further in order to achieve a high degree of correlation with the benchmark oil futures contract the fund seeks to rebalance its portfolios daily to keep exposure consistent with its investment objectives being materially under or overexposed to the benchmark oil futures contract may prevent the fund from achieving a high degree of correlation with the benchmark oil futures contract market disruptions or closures large amounts of assets into or out of the fund regulatory restrictions or extreme market volatility will adversely affect the fund’s ability to adjust exposure to requisite levels the target amount of portfolio exposure is impacted dynamically by the benchmark oil futures contract’s movements during each day because of this it is unlikely that the fund will be perfectly exposed ie x at the end of each day and the likelihood of being materially under or overexposed is higher on days when the benchmark levels are volatile near the close of the trading day in addition unlike other funds that do not rebalance their portfolios as frequently the fund may be subject to increased trading costs associated with daily portfolio rebalancing in order to maintain appropriate exposure to the underlying benchmarks such costs include commissions paid to the fcms and may vary by fcm the market price at which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly less or more than nav the fund’s nav per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in the market value of the fund’s portfolio investments the public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may be different from the nav of the shares price differences may relate primarily to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to but not identical to the same forces influencing the prices of the light sweet crude oil and the benchmark oil futures contract at any point in time uscf expects that exploitation of certain arbitrage opportunities by authorized participants and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track nav per share closely over time but there can be no assurance of that the nav of the fund’s shares may also be influenced by nonconcurrent trading hours between the nyse arca and the various futures exchanges on which crude oil is traded while the shares trade on the nyse arca from  am to  pm eastern time the trading hours for the futures exchanges on which light sweet crude oil trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time for example while the shares trade on the nyse arca until  pm eastern time liquidity in the global light sweet crude market will be reduced after the close of the nymex at  pm eastern time as a result during periods when the nyse arca is open and the futures exchanges on which light sweet crude oil is traded are closed trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen and therefore increase the difference between the price of the shares and the nav of the shares daily percentage changes in the fund’s nav may not correlate with daily percentage changes on a leveraged basis in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract it is possible that the daily percentage changes in the fund’s nav per share may not closely correlate on a leveraged basis to daily percentage changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract noncorrelation may be attributable to disruptions in the market for light sweet crude oil the imposition of position or accountability limits by regulators or exchanges or other extraordinary circumstances as the fund approaches or reaches position limits with respect to the benchmark oil futures contract and other oil futures contracts or in view of market conditions the fund may begin investing in other oilrelated investments in addition the fund is not able to replicate exactly the changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract because the total return generated by the fund is reduced by expenses and transaction costs including those incurred in connection with the fund’s trading activities and increased by interest income from the fund’s holdings of treasuries defined below tracking the benchmark oil futures contract requires trading of the fund’s portfolio with a view to tracking the benchmark oil futures contract over time and is dependent upon the skills of uscf and its trading principals among other factors daily percentage changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of light sweet crude oil the correlation between changes in prices of the benchmark oil futures contract and the spot price of crude oil may at times be only approximate the degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative oil market supply of and demand for oil futures contracts including the benchmark oil futures contract and other oilrelated investments and technical influences in oil futures trading            natural forces in the oil futures market known as “backwardation” and “contango” may increase the fund’s tracking error andor negatively impact total return the design of the fund’s benchmark oil futures contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration when over a four day period it transitions to the next month contract to expire as its benchmark contract and keeps that contract as its benchmark until it becomes the near month contract and close to expiration in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts a situation described as “backwardation” in the futures market then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration conversely in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts a situation described as “contango” in the futures market then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration when compared to total return of other price indices such as the spot price of crude oil the impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return of the fund’s per share nav to vary significantly moreover absent the impact of rising or falling oil prices a prolonged period of contango could have a significant negative impact on the fund’s per share nav and total return and investors could lose part or all of their investment see “additional information about the fund its investment objective and investments” for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and backwardation accountability levels position limits and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error which could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the price of the benchmark oil futures contract designated contract markets such as the nymex and ice futures have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control other than as a hedge which an investment by the fund is not may hold own or control these levels and position limits apply to the futures contracts that the fund invests in to meet its investment objective in addition to accountability levels and position limits the nymex and ice futures also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts the daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement price once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit the cftc has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in  physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture energy and metals markets and rules addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control the position limit rules the position limit rules as proposed would apply to the futures contracts that the fund invests in to meet its investment objective the position limit rules would among other things identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month individual month and all months combined create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions impose responsibilities on dcms and sefs to establish position limits or in some cases position accountability rules and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues otc dcms sefs as well as nonus located platforms the cftc’s first attempt at finalizing the position limit rules in  was successfully challenged by market participants in  and since then the cftc has reproposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times until such time as the position limit rules are adopted the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the position limit rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives collectively “referenced contracts” under that system the cftc enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products eg corn wheat and soy while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products eg oil and natural gas as a result the fund may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits finally subject to certain narrow exceptions the position limit rules require the aggregation for purposes of the position limits of all positions in the  referenced contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates regardless of whether such position existed on us futures exchanges nonus futures exchanges in cleared swaps or in otc swaps under the cftc’s existing position limits requirements and the position limit rules a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a  percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding at this time it is unclear how the position limit rules may affect the fund but the effect may be substantial and adverse by way of example the position limit rules may negatively impact the ability of the fund to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit uscf’s ability to sell additional creation baskets of the fund            all of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the fund’s shares and the price of the benchmark oil futures contract this may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use the fund as a way to hedge against crude oilrelated losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil the fund has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments if the fund encounters accountability levels position limits or price fluctuation limits for oil futures contracts on the nymex or ice futures it may then if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements purchase oil futures contracts on other exchanges that trade listed crude oil futures or enter into swaps or other transactions to meet its investment objective in addition if the fund exceeds accountability levels on either the nymex or ice futures and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the fund’s shares and the price of the benchmark oil futures contract    tax risk   an investor’s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions if any on its shares   cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of uscf uscf does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to shares investors will be required to pay us federal income tax and in some cases state local or foreign income tax on their allocable share of the fund’s taxable income without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions therefore the tax liability of an investor with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash or value of property if any distributed   an investor’s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its shares   due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by the fund in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors an investor’s allocable share of the fund’s income gain deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its shares for a taxable year this difference could be temporary or permanent and if permanent could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income items of income gain deduction loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated and for taxable periods beginning after december   the fund could be liable for us federal income tax if the us internal revenue service “irs” does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by the fund in allocating those items with potential adverse consequences for an investor   the us tax rules pertaining to entities taxed as partnerships are complex and their application to large publicly traded entities such as the fund is in many respects uncertain the fund applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income gains deductions losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects shareholders’ economic gains and losses these assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the internal revenue code the “code” and applicable treasury regulations however and it is possible that the irs will successfully challenge the fund’s allocation methods and require the fund to reallocate items of income gain deduction loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors if this occurs investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest   in addition for periods beginning after december   the fund may be liable for us federal income tax on any “imputed understatement” of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an irs audit the amount of the imputed understatement generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or gains to any investor and decreases in allocations of items of deduction loss or credit to any investor without any offset for any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or gain to any investor or increases in allocations of items of deduction loss or credit to any investor if the fund is required to pay any us federal income taxes on any imputed understatement the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of the fund and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the shares under certain circumstances the fund may be eligible to make an election to cause the investors to take into account the amount of any imputed understatement including any interest and penalties the ability of a publicly traded partnership such as the fund to make this election is uncertain if the election is made the fund would be required to provide investors who owned beneficial interests in the shares in the year to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement setting forth their proportionate shares of the adjustment “adjusted ks” the investors would be required to take the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the adjusted ks are issued the resulting tax liability on an investor of taking the adjustment into account in the year in which the adjusted k is issued may be less favorable to the investor than if the adjustment were taken into account in the reviewed year            the fund could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes which may substantially reduce the value of the shares   the trust on behalf of the fund has received an opinion of counsel that under current us federal income tax laws the fund will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes provided that i at least  percent of the fund’s annual gross income consists of “qualifying income” as defined in the code ii the trust and the fund is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and iii the trust and the fund does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes although uscf anticipates that the fund will satisfy the “qualifying income” requirement for all of its taxable years that result cannot be assured the fund has not requested and nor will the fund request any ruling from the irs with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the irs were to successfully assert that the fund is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year rather than passing through its income gains losses and deductions proportionately to shareholders the fund would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates in addition although the fund currently does not intend to make any distributions with respect to the shares any distributions would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income to the extent of the fund’s current or accumulated earnings and profits subject to holding period and other requirements any such dividend would be a qualifying dividend subject to us federal income tax at the lower maximum tax rates applicable to longterm capital gains taxation of the trust and the fund as a corporation could materially reduce the aftertax return on an investment in shares and could substantially reduce the value of the shares the fund is organized and operated as a delaware statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of its trust agreement and applicable state law but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited partnership and therefore has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual funds   the fund is organized and operated as a delaware statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of its trust agreement and applicable state law but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited partnership and therefore has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual funds no us federal income tax is paid by the fund on its income instead the fund will furnish shareholders each year with tax information on irs schedule k form  and each us shareholder is required to report on its us federal income tax return its allocable share of the income gain loss and deduction of the fund this must be reported without regard to the amount if any of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from the fund during the taxable year a shareholder therefore may be allocated income or gain by the fund but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting from the allocation or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability in addition to federal income taxes shareholders may be subject to other taxes such as state and local income taxes unincorporated business taxes business franchise taxes and estate inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which the fund does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in the fund it is each shareholder’s responsibility to file the appropriate us federal state local and foreign tax returns   if the fund is required to withhold tax with respect to any nonus shareholders the cost of such withholding may be borne by all shareholders under certain circumstances the fund may be required to pay withholding tax with respect to allocations to nonus shareholders although the trust agreement provides that any such withholding will be treated as being distributed to the nonus shareholder the fund may not be able to cause the economic cost of such withholding to be borne by the nonus shareholder on whose behalf such amounts were withheld since the fund does not intend to make any distributions under such circumstances the economic cost of the withholding may be borne by all shareholders not just the shareholders on whose behalf such amounts were withheld this could have a material impact on the value of the shares    otc contract risk   currently otc transactions are subject to changing regulation   a portion of the fund’s assets may be used to trade otc contracts such as forward contracts options swaps or spot contracts otc contracts are typically contracts traded on a principaltoprincipal noncleared basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions the markets for otc contracts rely upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the cftc on participants in the futures markets while certain regulations adopted over the past several years are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the otc market the current regulation of the otc contracts could expose the fund in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants as a result of such regulations if the trust on behalf of the fund enters into or has entered into certain interest rate and credit default swaps such swaps will be required to be centrally cleared determinations on other types of swaps are expected in the future and when finalized could require the fund to centrally clear certain otc instruments presently entered into and settled on a bilateral basis            the fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to otc contracts entered into by the trust on behalf of the fund or held by special purpose or structured vehicles   the fund faces the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to the otc contracts unlike in futures contracts the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions as a result there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions a counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to the fund in which case the fund could suffer significant losses on these contracts if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties the fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding the trust on behalf of the fund may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances valuing otc derivatives may be less certain than actively traded financial instruments   in general valuing otc derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such otc derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources in addition while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating otc contracts they typically are not contractually obligated to do so particularly if they are not a party to the transaction as a result it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding otc derivatives transaction    compounding risk the fund has a singleday investment objective and the fund’s performance for periods greater than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period which is likely to be either better or worse than the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract times the stated multiple in the fund’s investment objective before accounting for fees and fund expenses compounding affects all investments but it has a more significant effect on an a leveraged fund particularly during periods of higher benchmark oil futures contract volatility compounding will cause results for periods longer than a single day to vary from three times x of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract this effect becomes more pronounced as volatility increases fund performance for periods greater than a single day will be affected by the following factors i benchmark oil futures contract volatility ii benchmark oil futures contract performance iii period of time iv financing rates associated with exposure and v other fund expenses the fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently the fund is not intended to be used by and is not appropriate for investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios  other risks nyse may halt trading in the fund’s shares which would adversely impact an investor’s ability to sell shares the fund’s shares are listed for trading on nyse under the market symbol “ • ” trading in shares may be halted due to market conditions or in light nyse rules and procedures for reasons that in the view of nyse make trading in shares inadvisable in addition trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline additionally there can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of the fund’s shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged the lack of an active trading market for the fund shares may result in losses on an investor’s investment in the fund at the time the investor sells the shares although the fund’s shares are listed and traded on nyse there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will be maintained if an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active trading market for them exists the price the investor receives upon sale of the shares assuming they were able to be sold likely would be lower than if an active market existed            certain of the fund’s investments could be illiquid which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time   futures positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price it is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market a market disruption such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market for its currency its crude oil production or exports or another major export can also make it difficult to liquidate a position because both oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments may be illiquid the fund’s oil interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated the large size of the positions that the fund may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to do so otc contracts that are not subject to clearing may be even less marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an exchange do not have uniform terms and conditions and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support such as collateral and in general they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty these conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely impact the fund’s ability to realize the full value of such contracts in addition even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk sudden changes in the value of otc transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party’s exposure on the transaction in such situations the fund is not actively managed and tracks the benchmark oil futures contract during periods in which the price of the benchmark oil futures contract is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising the fund is not actively managed by conventional methods accordingly if the fund’s investments in oil interests are declining in value the fund will not close out such positions except in connection with paying the proceeds to an authorized participant upon the redemption of a basket or closing out futures positions in connection with the monthly change in the benchmark oil futures contract uscf will seek to cause the nav of the fund’s shares to track the benchmark oil futures contract during periods in which its price is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect the fund the futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes regulations and margin requirements in addition the cftc and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including for example the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading regulation of commodity interest transactions in the united states is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action considerable regulatory attention has been focused on nontraditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the united states in addition various national governments outside of the united states have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general the effect of any future regulatory change on the fund is impossible to predict but it could be substantial and adverse an investment in the fund may provide little or no diversification benefits thus in a declining market the fund may have no gains to offset losses from other investments and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in the fund while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes historically oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments have generally been noncorrelated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds noncorrelation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions on the one hand and stocks or bonds on the other hand however there can be no assurance that such noncorrelation will continue during future periods if contrary to historic patterns the fund’s performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in the fund’s shares in such a case the fund may have no gains to offset losses from other investments and investors may suffer losses on their investment in the fund at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments            variables such as drought floods weather embargoes tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on crude oil prices and crude oillinked instruments including oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments than on traditional securities these additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject the fund’s investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities noncorrelation should not be confused with negative correlation where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other there is no historical evidence that the spot price of crude oil and prices of other financial assets such as stocks and bonds are negatively correlated in the absence of negative correlation the fund cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market or vice versa trading in international markets could expose the fund to credit and regulatory risk  the fund invests primarily in oil futures contracts a significant portion of which are traded on united states exchanges including the nymex however a portion of the fund’s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the united states some nonus markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their us counterparts trading on such nonus markets or exchanges presents risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their us counterparts including potentially different or diminished investor protections in trading contracts denominated in currencies other than us dollars the fund is subject to the risk of adverse exchangerate movements between the dollar and the functional currencies of such contracts additionally trading on nonus exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls expropriation increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability an adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets uscf is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage the fund and other funds   uscf was formed to be the sponsor and manager of investment vehicles such as the fund and has been managing such investment vehicles since april  the chief executive officer and president of uscf manage and direct the daytoday activities and affairs of the fund the sixth amended and restated limited liability company agreement of uscf the “llc agreement” provides limited authority to the nonmanagement directors and any director of uscf may be removed by uscf’s parent company which is a closelyheld private company where the majority of shares has historically been voted by one person   uscf’s board of directors currently consists of four management directors each of whom are shareholders of uscf’s parent wainwright holdings inc “wainwright” and three nonmanagement directors each of whom are considered independent for purposes of applicable exchange and sec rules under uscf’s llc agreement the nonmanagement directors have only such authority as the management directors expressly confer upon them which means that the nonmanagement directors may have less authority to control the actions of the management directors than is typically the case with the independent members of a company’s board of directors in addition any director may be removed by written consent of wainwright which is the sole member of uscf wainwright is a privately held company in which the majority of shares are held by or on behalf of nicholas d gerber and his immediate family members the “gerber family” historically shares of wainwright have been voted by and on behalf of the gerber family by nicholas d gerber and it is anticipated that such trend will continue in the future accordingly although uscf is governed by the uscf board of directors which consists of both management directors and nonmanagement directors pursuant to the llc agreement it is possible for mr gerber to exercise his control of wainwright to effect the removal of any director including the nonmanagement directors which comprise the audit committee and to replace that director with another director having control in one person could have a negative impact on uscf and the fund including their regulatory obligations there is a risk that the fund will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such the fund may not earn any profit   the fund is contractually obligated to pay a management fee to uscf fees to brokers subject to a cap and certain expenses regardless of whether the fund’s activities are profitable accordingly the fund must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit            regulation of the commodity interests markets is extensive and constantly changing future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect the fund   the futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes regulations and margin requirements in addition the cftc and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions

considerable regulatory attention has been focused on nontraditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the united states in addition various national governments outside of the united states have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the commodities markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general the effect of any future regulatory change on the fund is impossible to predict but it could be substantial and adverse the trust is not a registered investment company so shareholders do not have the protections of the  act   the trust is not an investment company subject to the  act accordingly investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute which for example requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager   the fund has no operating history so there is no performance history to serve as a basis for you to evaluate an investment in the fund   the fund is new and has no operating history therefore you do not have the benefit of reviewing the past performance of the fund as a basis to evaluate an investment in the fund the sponsor’s current experience involves managing the related public funds the sponsor’s results with the related public funds may not be directly applicable to the fund since the fund has a different investment objective than the related public funds the fund and uscf may have conflicts of interest which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders   the fund is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving uscf various commodity futures brokers the marketing agent and any authorized participants uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund these persons are directors officers or employees of other entities that may compete with the fund for their services they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to those other entities as a result of these and other relationships parties involved with the fund have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of the fund and the shareholders uscf has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest consequently investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably although uscf attempts to monitor these conflicts it is extremely difficult if not impossible for uscf to ensure that these conflicts do not in fact result in adverse consequences to the shareholders the fund may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to its futures commission merchant “fcm” including but not limited to conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients or purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the fcm uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund and could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to the related public funds   the fund and uscf may have inherent conflicts to the extent uscf attempts to maintain the fund’s asset size in order to preserve its fee income and this may not always be consistent with the fund’s objective of having the value of its shares’ nav track on a leveraged basis changes in the value of the benchmark oil futures contracts uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund for example uscf’s directors officers and employees act in such capacity for other entities including the related public funds that may compete with the fund for their services accordingly they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to other entities uscf has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of the fund this authority to manage the investments and operations of the fund may allow uscf to act in a way that furthers its own interests in conflict with the best interests of investors shareholders have very limited voting rights which will limit the ability to influence matters such as amending the trust agreement changing the fund’s basic investment objective dissolving the fund or selling or distributing the fund’s assets            the fund and rex may have conflicts of interest which may permit rex to favor its own interests to the detriment of fund shareholders rex may have conflicts of interest which may permit it to favor its own interests to the detriment of shareholders rex’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund or to rex mlpshares llc these persons are directors officers or employees of other entities that may compete with the fund for their services they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to those other entities as a result of these and other relationships parties involved with rex may have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of the fund and the shareholders uscf has not established any formal procedure to resolve rex conflicts of interest consequently investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably although uscf attempts to monitor these conflicts it is extremely difficult if not impossible for uscf to ensure that these conflicts do not in fact result in adverse consequences to the fund’s shareholders rex’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund and could have a conflict between their responsibilities to other entities rex’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund rather rex’s directors officers and employees act in various capacities for other entities some of which may now or in the future compete with the fund for their services accordingly rex’s officers directors and employees could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to other entities uscf has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of the fund it has delegated certain marketing functions with respect to the fund to rex rex may act in a way that furthers its own interests in conflict with the best interests of investors   shareholders have only very limited voting rights and have the power to replace uscf only under specific circumstances shareholders do not participate in the management of the fund and do not control uscf so they do not have any influence over basic matters that affect the fund   shareholders have very limited voting rights with respect to the fund’s affairs and have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation including for example the right to bring “oppression” or “derivative” actions shareholders may elect a replacement sponsor only if uscf resigns voluntarily or loses its charter shareholders are not permitted to participate in the management or control of the fund or the conduct of its business shareholders must therefore rely upon the duties and judgment of uscf to manage the fund’s affairs for example the dissolution or resignation of uscf would cause the fund to terminate unless within  days of the event shareholders holding shares representing at least   of the outstanding shares of the fund elect to continue the trust and appoint a successor sponsor in addition uscf may terminate the fund if it determines that the fund’s aggregate net assets in relation to its operating expenses make the continued operation of the fund unreasonable or imprudent however no level of losses will require uscf to terminate the fund the fund’s termination would result in the liquidation of its assets and the distribution of the proceeds thereof first to creditors and then to the shareholders in accordance with their positive book capital account balances after giving effect to all contributions distributions and allocations for all periods and the fund could incur losses in liquidating its assets in connection with a termination the fund could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor’s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor’s investment portfolio   the fund could terminate at any time regardless of whether that the fund has incurred losses subject to the terms of the trust agreement in particular unforeseen circumstances including the bankruptcy dissolution or removal of uscf as the sponsor of the trust could cause the fund to terminate unless a successor is appointed in accordance with the trust agreement however no level of losses will require uscf to terminate the fund the fund’s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor’s investment termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor’s investment portfolio an unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on the fund’s nav   if a substantial number of requests for redemption of redemption baskets are received by the fund during a relatively short period of time the fund may not be able to satisfy the requests from the fund assets not committed to trading as a consequence it could be necessary to liquidate positions in the fund’s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation            the fund does not expect to make cash distributions   the fund does not intend to make any cash distributions and intends to reinvest any realized gains in additional oil interests rather than distributing cash to shareholders therefore unlike mutual funds commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors the fund generally does not expect to distribute cash to shareholders an investor should not invest in the fund if the investor will need cash distributions from the fund to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of the fund if any or for any other reason nonetheless although the fund does not intend to make cash distributions the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution eg at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in oil interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax if this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made   proposed money market reform   currently the fund may invest in money market funds as well as treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less as an investment for assets not used for margin or collateral in the futures contracts on july   the sec adopted final rules governing the structure and operation of money market funds in a release adopting amendments to rule a under the  act the new rules will require institutional prime money market funds to price their shares using marketbased values instead of the amortized cost method  ie  to use a “floating nav” in addition all money market funds will be able and in certain cases will be required to impose liquidity fees and temporarily suspend redemptions during periods of market stress subject to certain board findings the sec also revised certain diversification provisions of rule a as well as provisions relating to stress testing compliance with these requirements is not currently required accordingly it is unclear at this time what impact of money market reform would have on the fund’s ability to hedge risk however the imposition of a floating nav could cause the fund to limit remaining assets solely in treasuries and cash the failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker or the fund’s custodian could result in a substantial loss of the fund’s assets and could impair the fund in its ability to execute trades   under cftc regulations a clearing broker maintains customers’ assets in a bulk segregated account if a clearing broker fails to do so or even if the customers’ funds are segregated by the clearing broker but the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a substantial deficit in a customer account the clearing broker’s other customers may be subject to risk of a substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing broker’s bankruptcy in that event the clearing broker’s customers such as the fund are entitled to recover even in respect of property specifically traceable to them only a proportional share of all property available for distribution to all of that clearing broker’s customers the bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in the loss of the fund’s assets posted with the clearing broker the fund may also be subject to the risk of the failure of or delay in performance by any exchanges and markets and their clearing organizations if any on which commodity interest contracts are traded in addition to the extent the fund’s clearing broker is required to post the fund’s assets as margin to a clearinghouse the margin will be maintained in an omnibus account containing the margin of all the clearing broker’s customers if the fund’s clearing broker defaults to a clearinghouse because of a default by one of the clearing broker’s other customers or otherwise then the clearinghouse can look to all of the margin in the omnibus account including margin posted by the fund and any other nondefaulting customers of the clearing broker to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker from time to time clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business a clearing broker’s involvement in costly or timeconsuming legal proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from the clearing broker’s trading operations which could impair the clearing broker’s ability to successfully execute and clear the fund’s trades in addition the majority of the fund’s assets are held in treasuries cash andor cash equivalents with  •  the “custodian” the insolvency of the custodian could result in a loss of the fund’s assets held by the custodian which at any given time could comprise a substantial portion of the fund’s total assets the liability of uscf and the trustee are limited under the trust agreement and the value of the shares will be adversely affected if the fund is required to indemnify the trustee or uscf   under the trust agreement the trustee and uscf are not liable and have the right to be indemnified for any liability or expense incurred absent gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the trustee or uscf or breach by uscf of the trust agreement as the case may be as a result uscf may require the assets of the fund to be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered by it or by the trustee any sale of that kind would reduce the nav of the fund and the value of its shares            although the shares of the fund are limited liability investments certain circumstances such as bankruptcy or indemnification of the fund by a shareholder will increase the shareholder’s liability   the shares of the fund are limited liability investments shareholders may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits recognized on their investment however shareholders could be required as a matter of bankruptcy law to return to the estate of the fund any distribution they received at a time when the fund was in fact insolvent or in violation of its trust agreement in addition a number of states do not have “statutory trust” statutes such as the delaware statutes under which the trust has been formed in the state of delaware it is possible that a court in such state could hold that due to the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary in such jurisdiction the shareholders although entitled under delaware law to the same limitation on personal liability as stockholders in a private corporation for profit organized under the laws of the state of delaware are not so entitled in such state finally in the event the trust or the fund is made a party to any claim dispute demand or litigation or otherwise incurs any liability or expense as a result of or in connection with any shareholder’s or assignee’s obligations or liabilities unrelated to the business of the trust or the fund as applicable such shareholder or assignees cumulatively is required under the trust agreement to indemnify the trust or the fund as applicable for all such liability and expense incurred including attorneys’ and accountants’ fees investors cannot be assured of rex’s continued services and discontinuance may be detrimental to the fund   investors cannot be assured that rex will be willing or able to continue to service the fund for any length of time if rex discontinues its activities on behalf of the fund the fund may be adversely affected   the fund is a series of the trust and as a result a court could potentially conclude that the assets and liabilities of the fund are not segregated from those of another series of the trust thereby potentially exposing assets in the fund to the liabilities of another series of the trust   the fund is a series of a delaware statutory trust and not itself a separate legal entity the delaware statutory trust act provides that if certain provisions are included in the formation and governing documents of a statutory trust organized in series and if separate and distinct records are maintained for any series and the assets associated with that series are held in separate and distinct records and are accounted for in such separate and distinct records separately from the other assets of the statutory trust or any series thereof then the debts liabilities obligations and expenses incurred by a particular series are enforceable against the assets of such series only and not against the assets of the statutory trust generally or any other series thereof conversely none of the debts liabilities obligations and expenses incurred with respect to any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series uscf is not aware of any court case that has interpreted this interseries limitation on liability or provided any guidance as to what is required for compliance uscf intends to maintain separate and distinct records for the fund and account for the fund separately from any other series of the trust but it is possible a court could conclude that the methods used do not satisfy the delaware statutory trust act which would potentially expose assets in one series to the liabilities of another series of the trust uscf and the trustee are not obligated to prosecute any action suit or other proceeding in respect of the fund property   neither uscf nor the trustee is obligated to although each may in its respective discretion prosecute any action suit or other proceeding in respect of the fund property the trust agreement does not confer upon shareholders the right to prosecute any such action suit or other proceeding third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that uscf has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights which may result in significant costs and diverted attention   it is possible that third parties might utilize the fund’s intellectual property or technology including the use of its business methods trademarks and trading program software without permission uscf has a patent for the fund’s business method and has registered its trademarks the fund does not currently have any proprietary software however if it obtains proprietary software in the future any unauthorized use of the fund’s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage the fund may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents trademarks proprietary software and other technology also third parties may independently develop business methods trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of uscf or claim that uscf has violated their intellectual property rights including their copyrights trademark rights trade names trade secrets and patent rights as a result uscf may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets determine the validity and scope of other parties’ proprietary rights defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties’ rights or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid any litigation of this type even if uscf is successful and regardless of the merits may result in significant costs divert its resources from the fund or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements            due to the increased use of technologies intentional and unintentional cyberattacks pose operational and information security risks   with the increased use of technologies such as the internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions the fund is susceptible to operational and information security risks in general cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events cyberattacks include but are not limited to gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as causing denialofservice attacks on websites cyber security failures or breaches of the fund’s clearing broker or third party service provider including but not limited to index providers the administrator and transfer agent the custodian have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations potentially resulting in financial losses the inability of fund shareholders to transact business violations of applicable privacy and other laws regulatory fines penalties reputational damage reimbursement or other compensation costs andor additional compliance costs in addition substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future the fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result while the fund has established business continuity plans there are inherent limitations in such plans    additional information about the fund its investment objective and investments the fund is a series of the trust the trust operates pursuant to the terms of the declaration of trust and trust agreement dated as of march   “trust agreement” which grants full management control of the fund to uscf the trust agreement is posted on the fund’s website at  •   the fund maintains its main business office at  harrison street suite  oakland california  the net assets of the fund consist primarily of investments in the oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments market conditions that uscf currently anticipates could cause the fund to invest in other oilrelated investments include those allowing the fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing the fund invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in futures contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in shortterm obligations of the united states of two years or less “treasuries” cash and cash equivalents the daily holdings of the fund are available on the fund’s website at  •   the fund invests in oil interests to the fullest extent possible without being unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in oil interests in pursuing this objective the primary focus of uscf is the investment in futures contracts and the management of the fund’s investments in treasuries cash andor cash equivalents for margining purposes and as collateral the fund seeks to invest in a combination of oil interests such that the daily changes in its nav measured in percentage terms will track three times x the daily changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract also measured in percentage terms as a specific benchmark uscf endeavors to place the fund’s trades in oil interests and otherwise manage the fund’s investments so that the difference between “a” and “b” will be plusminus  percent  of “b” where     •   a is the average daily percentage change in the fund’s per share nav for any period of thirty  successive valuation days ie  any nyse trading day as of which the fund calculates its per share nav and     •   b is three times the average daily percentage change in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract over the same period    uscf believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily change in the fund’s share price on the nyse exchange on a percentage basis to closely track the daily changes in the fund’s per share nav on a percentage basis uscf further believes that the daily changes in the fund’s nav in percentage terms will track three times x the daily changes in percentage terms in the benchmark oil futures contract less the fund’s expenses the fund will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day  the pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that the return of the fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for such longer period because the aggregate return of the fund is the product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns during periods of market volatility the volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract may affect the fund’s return as much as or more than the return of the benchmark oil futures contract further the return for investors that invest for periods less than a full trading day or for a period different than a trading day will not be the product of the return of the fund’s stated investment objective and the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract for the full trading day additionally investors should be aware that the fund’s investment objective is not for its nav or market price of shares to equal in dollar terms the spot price of light sweet crude oil natural market forces called contango and backwardation can impact the total return on an investment in the fund’s shares relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and in the future it is likely that the relationship between the market price of the fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation it is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil which could be substantial              the fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently the fund is not intended to be used by and is not appropriate for investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios    the fund’s “neutral” investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell the fund’s shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in crude oil in a costeffective manner andor to permit participants in the oil or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their crude oilrelated transactions accordingly depending on the investment objective of an individual investor the risks generally associated with investing in crude oil andor the risks involved in hedging may exist in addition an investment in the fund involves the risk that the daily changes in the price of the fund’s shares in percentage terms will not accurately track the daily changes in the benchmark oil futures contract on a leveraged basis in percentage terms and that daily changes in the benchmark oil futures contract in percentage terms will not closely correlate with daily changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil in percentage terms  impact of contango and backwardation on total returns natural market forces called contango and backwardation can impact the total return on an investment in the fund’s shares relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and in the future it is likely that the relationship between the market price of the fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation it is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil which could be substantial several factors determine the total return from investing in a futures contract position one factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near month futures contracts and “rolling” those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current near month contract and the next month contract for example if the price of the near month contract is higher than the next month contract a situation referred to as “backwardation” in the futures market then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to rise in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration conversely if the price of a near month contract is lower than the next month contract a situation referred to as “contango” in the futures market then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to decline in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration as an example assume that the price of crude oil for immediate delivery the “spot” price was  per barrel and the value of a position in the near month futures contract was also  over time the price of the barrel of crude oil will fluctuate based on a number of market factors including demand for oil relative to its supply the value of the near month contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors if investors seek to maintain their position in a near month contract and not take delivery of the oil every month they must sell their current near month contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month contract if the futures market is in backwardation eg when the price of crude oil futures contracts that expire later than the near month contract are lower than the near month contract’s price the investor would be buying a next month contract for a lower price than the current near month contract using the  per barrel price above to represent the front month price the price of the next month contract could be  per barrel that is  cheaper than the front month contract hypothetically and assuming no other changes to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship between the spot price the near month contract and the next month contract and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash andor cash equivalents the value of the  next month contract would rise as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of  in this example the value of an investment in the second month contract would tend to rise faster than the spot price of crude oil or fall slower as a result it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of crude oil to have risen  after some period of time while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract would have risen  assuming backwardation is large enough or enough time has elapsed similarly the spot price of crude oil could have fallen  while the value of an investment in the futures contract could have fallen only  over time if backwardation remained constant the difference would continue to increase            if the futures market is in contango the investor would be buying a next month contract for a higher price than the current near month contract using again the  per barrel price above to represent the front month price the price of the next month contract could be  per barrel that is  more expensive than the front month contract hypothetically and assuming no other changes to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship between the spot price the near month contract and the next month contract and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash andor cash equivalents the value of the next month contract would fall as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of  in this example it would mean that the value of an investment in the second month would tend to rise slower than the spot price of crude oil or fall faster as a result it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of crude oil to have risen  after some period of time while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract will have risen only  assuming contango is large enough or enough time has elapsed similarly the spot price of crude oil could have fallen  while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract could have fallen  over time if contango remained constant the difference would continue to increase historically the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation with backwardation being in place roughly as often as contango since oil futures trading started in  following the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter of  the crude oil market moved into contango and remained in contango for a period of several years during parts of  the level of contango was unusually steep as a combination of slack us and global demand for crude oil and issues involving the physical transportation and storage of crude oil at cushing oklahoma the primary pricing point for oil traded in the us led to unusually high inventories of crude oil since then a combination of improved transportation and storage capacity along with growing demand for crude oil globally has moderated the inventory buildup and lead to reduced levels of contango by  the crude oil futures market was primarily in a state of contango during the year ended december   periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact the fund’s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share nav track on a leveraged basis the daily percentage changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to proportionally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both the fund’s shares and the benchmark oil futures contract it is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future it is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods  trading methodology in managing the fund’s assets uscf does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders uscf instead employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a creation basket is sold uscf purchases oil interests such as the benchmark oil futures contract that have an aggregate market value that approximates three times x the amount of treasuries andor cash received upon the issuance of the creation basket as of the nav calculation time each trading day the fund will also seek to position its portfolio so that its exposure to the benchmark oil futures contract is consistent with its investment objective to provide investment results that correspond before fees and expenses to three times x the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract the specific oil futures contracts purchased depend on various factors including a judgment by uscf as to the appropriate diversification of the fund’s investments in futures contracts with respect to the month of expiration and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts while uscf has made significant investments in nymex oil futures contracts for various reasons including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market position limits or other regulatory requirements limiting the fund’s holdings and market conditions it may invest in oil futures contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in other oilrelated investments to the extent that the fund invests in other oilrelated investments it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the benchmark oil futures contract including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria and then to a lesser extent it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts instruments and noncleared swaps such as swaps in the overthecounter market or commonly referred to as the “otc market” if the fund is required by law or regulation or by one of its regulators including a futures exchange to reduce its position in the benchmark oil futures contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in other oilrelated investments a substantial portion of the fund’s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in other oilrelated investments that are intended to replicate the return on the benchmark oil futures contract as the fund’s assets reach higher levels it is more likely to exceed position limits accountability levels or other regulatory limits and as a result it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in other oilrelated investments at such higher levels in addition market conditions that uscf currently anticipates could cause the fund to invest in other oilrelated investments include those allowing the fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing see “risk factors involved with an investment in the fund” for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on the fund’s ability to invest in otc transactions and cleared swaps            uscf may not be able to fully invest the fund’s assets in benchmark oil futures contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to three times x the fund’s nav for example as standardized contracts the benchmark oil futures contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity and the fund’s nav and the proceeds from the sale of a creation basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts as a result in such circumstances the fund may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the benchmark oil futures contract through the use of other oilrelated investments such as otc contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund anticipates that to the extent it invests in oil futures contracts other than contracts on light sweet crude oil such as futures contracts for dieselheating oil natural gas and other petroleumbased fuels and other oilrelated investments it will enter into various nonexchangetraded derivative contracts to hedge the shortterm price movements of such oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments against the current benchmark oil futures contract uscf does not anticipate letting the fund’s oil futures contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity instead uscf will close existing positions eg  when it changes the benchmark oil futures contracts or other oilrelated investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new oil futures contracts or other oilrelated investments positions may also be closed out to meet orders for redemption baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested the benchmark oil futures contract is changed from the near month contract to the next month contract over a fourday period each month the benchmark oil futures contract changes starting at the end of the day on the date two weeks prior to expiration of the near month contract for that month during the first three days of the period the applicable value of the benchmark oil futures contract is based on a combination of the near month contract and the next month contract as follows  day  consists of  of the then near month contract’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract divided by  of the near month contract’s prior day’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract  day  consists of  of the then near month contract’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract divided by  of the near month contract’s prior day’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract and  day  consists of  of the then near month contract’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract divided by  of the near month contract’s prior day’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract on day  the benchmark oil futures contract is the next month contract to expire at that time and that contract remains the benchmark oil futures contract until the beginning of the following month’s change in the benchmark oil futures contract over a fourday period on each day during the fourday period uscf anticipates it will “roll” the fund’s positions in oil interests by closing or selling a percentage of the fund’s positions in oil interests and reinvesting the proceeds from closing those positions in new oil interests that reflect the change in the benchmark oil futures contract the anticipated dates that the monthly fourday roll period will commence are posted on the fund’s website at  •  and are subject to change without notice by remaining invested as fully as possible in oil futures contracts or other oilrelated investments uscf believes that the daily changes in percentage terms of the fund’s nav will continue to closely track on a leveraged basis the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract uscf believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price of the shares traded on the nyse arca closely tracking the nav of the fund additionally oil futures contracts traded on the nymex have closely tracked the spot price of light sweet crude oil based on these expected interrelationships uscf believes that the changes in the price of the fund’s shares as traded on the nyse arca have closely tracked and will continue to closely track on a daily basis the changes in the spot price of light sweet crude oil on a percentage basis  what are the trading policies of the fund   investment objectives the fund seeks on a daily basis to provide investment results that correspond before fees and expenses to three times x the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund does not seek to achieve its stated objective over a period greater than a single day because the fund seeks investment results for a single day only as measured from the time the fund calculates its nav to the time of the fund’s next nav calculation and on a leveraged basis the fund is different from most exchangetraded funds              as of the nav calculation time each trading day the fund will seek to position its portfolio so that its exposure to the benchmark oil futures contract is consistent with its investment objective the impact of a benchmark oil futures contract’s movements during the day will affect whether the fund’s portfolio needs to be rebalanced for example the fund’s long exposure will need to be increased on days when the benchmark oil futures contract rises and decreased on days the benchmark oil futures contract falls daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time means that the return of the fund for a period longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period which will very likely differ from three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for the period the fund may lose money if the benchmark oil futures contract’s performance is flat over time and it is possible for a fund to lose money over time regardless of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract as a result of daily rebalancing the benchmark oil futures contract’s volatility and compounding there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective or avoid substantial losses the fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than a single day because mathematical compounding prevents the fund from achieving such results results for the fund over periods of time greater than a single day should not be expected to be a simple multiple x of the period return of the benchmark oil futures contract and will likely differ significantly from such the fund may lose money if the benchmark oil futures contract’s performance is flat over time and it is possible for the fund to lose money over time regardless of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract as a result of daily rebalancing the benchmark oil futures contract’s volatility and compounding daily compounding of the fund’s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longerterm performance during periods of high volatility volatility may be at least as important to the fund’s return for a period as the return of the benchmark oil futures contract liquidity   the fund invests only in oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments that in the opinion of uscf are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in other oilrelated investments that in the opinion of uscf may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of the fund spot commodities   while the crude oil futures contracts traded can be physically settled the fund does not intend to take or make physical delivery the fund may from time to time trade in other oilrelated investments including contracts based on the spot price of crude oil leverage   uscf endeavors to have the aggregate market value of its obligations under its oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments equal to three times x the value of the fund’s treasuries cash and cash equivalents whether held by the fund or posted as margin or other collateral at the close of each trading day as measured at the time the fund calculates its nav commodity pools’ trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract’s or other commodity interest’s entire market value borrowings   borrowings are not expected to be used by the fund unless the fund is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery if the fund trades in cash commodities or for shortterm needs created by unexpected redemptions otc derivatives including spreads and straddles   in addition to oil futures contracts there are also a number of listed options on the oil futures contracts on the principal futures exchanges these contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the crude oil market consequently the fund may purchase options on crude oil futures contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective            in addition to the oil futures contracts and options on the oil futures contracts there also exists an active nonexchangetraded market in derivatives tied to crude oil these derivatives transactions also known as otc contracts are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts unlike most of the exchangetraded oil futures contracts or exchangetraded options on the oil futures contracts each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party ie  the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract to reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts the fund will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the master agreement published by the international swaps and derivatives association inc “isda” that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty uscf assesses or reviews as appropriate the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an otc contract pursuant to guidelines approved by uscf’s board the fund may enter into certain transactions where an otc component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract an “exchange for related position” or “efrp transaction” in the most common type of efrp transaction entered into by the fund the otc component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of the fund shares these efrp transactions may expose the fund to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the otc component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract generally the counterparty risk from the efrp transaction will exist only on the day of execution the fund may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking on a leveraged basis the price of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset but with different delivery months the fund does not anticipate engaging in trading in futures contracts listed on a foreign exchange forward contracts or options on such contracts but it may do so as outlined in the fund’s listing exemptive order or as permitted under current regulations pyramiding   uscf has not employed and will not employ the technique commonly known as pyramiding in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest  the fund’s operations    uscf and its
