qsehra would work for your company download our new ebook small business employee benefits and hr blog taking advantage of a qualifying life event under a qsehra read more caitlin bronson july   at  pm   tweet     one of the biggest advantages of working for a company that offers a qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangement qsehra is the opportunity to get reimbursed for your individual insurance premiums you don’t need an insurance policy to participate in the qsehra—or to be reimbursed for other eligible medical expenses—but having one is helpful besides the obvious advantages of being insured having major medical coverage—or minimum essential coverage mec—entitles you to taxfree reimbursement of all qsehraeligible expenses while it’s possible to get mec in other ways through a spouse’s group insurance policy for example many qsehra participants gain qualifying coverage through an individual insurance policy if you don’t already have an individual insurance policy you’ll need to purchase one and attest to that purchase to start getting taxfree reimbursement of your premium payments and other medical expenses unfortunately simply becoming eligible for a qsehra doesn’t entitle you to a special enrollment period sep if your company implements a qsehra outside of the open enrollment period you’ll need a qualifying life event to purchase an individual insurance policy in this post we’ll go over qualifying life events how to verify them through your local exchange and how to use that policy to access taxfree reimbursement through the qsehra

senate bill preserves much of the house’s work while making some key changes that could influence the federal budget and the legislation’s overall chances of passage for small businesses the national discussion on health care policy has brought much uncertainty any changes will have a big impact on the realm of employee benefits health care reform• aca• ahca• bcra• republican health care bill how the ahca affects small business and individual taxation read more caitlin bronson june   at  am   tweet     much has been said about the passage of the american health care act ahca by the house of representatives in may the republicansponsored legislation is the first successful attempt to repeal and replace the affordable care act aca and though it faces considerable scrutiny in the senate it signals a desire among many for significant change in us health care policy while the congressional budget office cbo score on the ahca discusses the impact of the legislation on the federal budget the bill’s tax impact on individuals and small businesses—as well as those who advise them—has gone largely unexamined because the ahca is a budget reconciliation bill legislation that focuses solely on budgetary concerns it contains many provisions that affect the tax status of these groups it also raises several questions on irs reporting requirements going forward fsa• hsa• aca• qsehra• ahca• taxation should i still offer the qsehra when group insurance is cheaper than individual read more caitlin bronson june   at  am   tweet     one of the chief benefits of offering a personalized benefits solution like the qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangement qsehra or small business hra is its potential to save small businesses money because the qsehra allows businesses to set their own budget on a peremployee basis business owners can control costs – and because individual insurance is almost always cheaper than group policies small businesses often cover their employees’ entire premium while cutting expenses but not all individual markets are the same while covering an employee under a group policy is more expensive for most small businesses there are several parts of the country where the individual market has deteriorated to the point that an individual policy is actually more costly in these situations does it still make sense to offer personalized benefits instead of a traditional group policy in this post we’ll explore how to determine whether the group or individual market is more favorable when to explore options outside of group and how to determine if a qsehra is the best fit even if it’s more expensive individual health insurance• hra• group health• qsehra• small business hra how the qsehra works for me read more
