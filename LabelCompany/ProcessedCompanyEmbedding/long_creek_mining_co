gold rush of  soon after the placer gold discoveries farther east at idaho springs breckenridge was founded to serve the miners working rich placer gold deposits discovered along the blue river placer gold mining was soon joined by hard rock mining as prospectors followed the gold to its source veins in the mountains gold in some upper gravel benches north of the blue river was recovered by hydraulic mining gold production decreased in the late s but revived in  by gold dredging operations along the blue river and swan river the breckenridge mining district is credited with production of about one million troy ounces of goldcreede was the last silver boom town in colorado in the s the first silver discovery was made at the alpha mine in  but the silver could not be extracted at a profit from the complex ores the great “boom days” started with the discovery of rich minerals in willow creek canyon in  the town leapt from a population of  in  to more than  people in december  the creede mines operated continuously from  until the original townsite of creede was located on east willow creek just above its junction with west willow creek below creede were stringtown jimtown and amethyst the willow creek site was soon renamed creede after nicholas c creede who discovered the holy moses mine soon the entire town area from east willow to amethyst was called creedethe town leapt from a population of  in  to more than  people in december  the creede mines operated continuously from  until  creede’s boom lasted until  when the silver panic hit all of the silver mining towns in colorado the price of silver plummeted and most of the silver mines were closed creede never became a ghost town although the boom was over and its population declined after  creede stayed alive by relying increasingly on lead and zinc in the oresat an elevation of  feet and just below timberline for many years cripple creeks high valley was considered no more important than a cattle pasture many prospectors avoided the area after the mount pisgah hoax a mini gold rush caused by salting adding gold to worthless rockon october   however robert miller bob womack discovered a rich ore and the last great colorado gold rush was on thousands of prospectors flocked to the region and before long winfield scott stratton located the famous independence lode one of the largest gold strikes in history in three years the population increased from  to  by  though  worth of gold ore was dug from cripple creek womack himself would die penniless on august  during the next  years gold production exploded and the town grew rapidly by  over  people resided in and around cripple creek the district boasted an estimated  saloons plus dance halls theaters hotels restaurants shops and an extensive redlight district there were  assay offices  lawyers  brokerage houses and  newspapers including one serving its many black residents almost  mines pulled millions of dollars worth of gold from the ground annually production peaked in  with over  ounces of gold produced the town managed this growth despite two major fires in  that left most of the town in ashesgold production declined after  and a consolidation of mining properties began by the early ’s gold production was down to  ounces per year declining production and improved mining efficiency reduced demand for miners and the businesses that served them the last mine closed in  and the town dwindled relying on a modest summer tourist industrygold in the telluride area was first discovered in  john fallon made the first claim in marshal basin above telluride in  and early settlement of telluride followed the town itself was founded in  tellurides mines were rich in zinc lead copper silver and goldtelluride developed slowly because of its isolated location in  otto mears opened a toll road which allowed wagons to reach telluride this increased the number of people in telluride but it was still expensive to get goldrich ore out of the valley in  the railroad reached town which brought in more mines and brought out more oretelluride’s most famous historic mines are the tomboy pandora smugglerunion nellie and sheridan mines beginning in  the hardrock mining operations in the red mountain and telluride mining districts began a lengthy consolidation under the idarado mining company presently a division of newmont mining the consolidation ended in  with idarado’s acquisition of the telluride mines idarado kept the underground workings and mill operations open at telluride’s pandora hardrock mine until coal mining in colorado dates back to  when a pair of men began mining a coal deposit between the gold rush settlements of denver and boulder although the discovery of coal did not cause boom cycles as did gold and silver the early coal mining industry did established the conditions for violent confrontations between miners and mine owners the usual issues were wages hours and working conditions but miners were also concerned about issues of fairness and company control over their personal lives early coal mining in colorado was extremely dangerous and the state had one of the highest death rates in the nation during the three decades from  to  more than  men died in colorados coal mines coal miners also resented having to pay for safety work such as timbering the mines and they were sometimes paid in scrip that had value only in the company store with the cost of goods set by the companyerie colorado claims the first mining labor union in colorado which was the knights of labor local no established in  the knights of labor opposed the creation of the national federation of miners and mine laborers during the s the first strike was called in  by the knights of labor then in  a regional miners organization was formed called the coal miners federation of northern colorado the united mine workers umw were defeated by company spies in a strike in the southern field in the umw called another strike in colorados northern coal fields north of denver in  the strike was inconclusive but prompted a  percent wage increase for ten thousand colorado miners the unions real target in colorado was the larger southern field a statewide strike called in september  resulted in the ludlow massacre  neutralized by the dispatch of federal troops after ten days of skirmishes provoked by the massacre the umw essentially suspended most activities in colorado for more than a decade meanwhile the organization grew stronger in the eastthe united mine workers were defeated during the  strike in colorado and focused their attention elsewhere in  colorado coal miners again laid down their tools this time under the banner of the industrial workers of the world iww colorado fuel and iron a major conglomerate of steel mills in pueblo and coal mines around the region opposed the strike the company once again hired spies to infiltrate the unionthe – strike is best remembered for the columbine mine massacre this strike also led directly to rocky mountain fuel companys decision to unionize the workforce and president josephine roche announced that she would recognize any union affiliated with the american federation of labor in announcing this policy president roche avoided recognizing the radical iww which had successfully shut down  of the states  coal mines thus in  the united mine workers was awarded its first contract in colorado in  legislation enabled unionization throughout colorados coal fieldscolorado is the seventh largest coalproducing state in the country in  colorado mines produced  million tons of coal and employed  miners most colorado coal is used for electric power generation eleven coal mines operate in colorado including eight underground mines in delta garfield gunnison la plata rio blanco and routt counties and three surface mines in moffat and montrose counties all active coal mines are on the western slope although the new elk coal mine in las animas county is being permitted to reopenparticipants in the pikes peak gold rush from  to  were called fiftyniners and many of the new arrivals settled in the denver area gold in paying quantities was also discovered in the central city area in  silver was discovered in leadville resulting in the colorado silver boom on may   during the pikes peak gold rush john h gregory found a

gregorys gulch the narrow ravine where georgia prospector john h gregory first discovered lode gold in the western part of kansas territory in  within months thousands of wouldbe miners poured into the gulch hoping for more big strikes like gregorys a few found bonanzas many found paying claims but the great majority either moved elsewhere to try their luck or proclaiming the whole pikes peak

area quickly became virtually deserted as thousands headed for the new gold fields over mosquito passthe rich silverlead ores which later were to give this region a worldwide reputation were

continued to produced gold and silver ore until the sin the s clinton acquired a number of mining operations in the vicinity including the profitable iron mask noted for its numerous caverns with crystal formations clinton developed the area as a town and improved the mining operations with higher capitalization the town which clinton developed in order to keep miners at the site was initially named for him he donated the land for its initial schoolhouse and built its first boarding house the denver and rio grande railroad reached the mining camp of belden at the base of the cliff in  by  it had a population of approximately  as well as a newspaper called the gilman enterpriseas they reached the deeper sulfide ores the miners found that the ore contained so much zinc that the smelters

something in short supply elsewhere in the gulch black hawk quickly became the milling center for the gold ore mined throughout what became known as gilpin county first by ore wagon and later by train tons of precious rock were sent to black hawk for various processes designed to extract the maximum amount of gold from the quartz ores gold mining in the central city district decreased rapidly

during the pikes peak gold rush by george and david griffith two prospectors from kentucky it was named georgetown in honor of the older of the two brothers although founded during the gold rush the town grew rapidly following the discovery of silver on september   by james huff at a site approximately  miles up the canyon in the argentine pass area in the following years hundreds of mines were dug in the mountains surrounding the town and the town quickly grew into a center for prospectors and mine workers in the surrounding mountains located in the valley floor the town itself was not a mining camp but a center of commerce and entertainment for miners in the surrounding mountainsgeorgetown was incorporated on january   a few months later it wrested the county seat from nearby idaho springs which is a much larger community today georgetown is the only colorado municipality that still operates under a charter from the territory of colorado the building of the narrow gauge colorado central railroad up the canyon from golden in the s further increased the central position of the town although most of the railroad was later removed a portion remained between the georgetown and silver plume and is operated today as a tourist railroad called the georgetown loop the town experienced its greatest growth and prosperity during the colorado silver boom of the s when it rivaled leadville to the west as the mining capital of colorado at one time before the collapse of the silver boom in  the town population exceeded  and a movement arose briefly among local citizens to move the state capital there from denvermendota mine silver plume co silver plume clear creek co covirginius mine  mt sneffels sneffels cosilver plume was named for the silver plume mine which was named

productive silvermining district production expanded due to the passage of the sherman silver purchase act of  which doubled the governments purchase of silver by  aspen had banks a hospital two theaters an opera house and electric lights economic collapse came with the panic of  when president cleveland called a special session of congress and repealed the shernman silver purchase act within

curie laboratory in paris although no more than a trace of radium was present in the ore newly discovered medical applications had made radium worth  per milligram making the radium in the carnotite ore worth much more than the vanadium or uraniumonce carnotite was known to contain radium prospectors rushed to the colorado plateau of southwest colorado and adjacent southeast utah and found carnotitebearing sandstones of the jurassic morrison formation in mesa montrose and san miguel counties in colorado the carnotite was at first shipped to europe for processing but by  the standard
