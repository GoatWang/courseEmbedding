longterm investment designed for retirement purposes you invest money in professionally managed investment portfolios where it accumulates taxdeferred investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s units when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original investment when you retire your investment can be used to generate a stream of regular income payments that are guaranteed for as long as you live in addition variable annuities may provide a guaranteed death benefit for your beneficiaries it is important to remember that annuity contracts contain exclusions limitations reductions of benefits and terms for keeping them in force why does the company behind the annuity matter when the time comes for you to use the benefits that are offered by a variable annuity it is important to remember that all guarantees including the optional benefits are backed by the claimspaying ability of the issuing insurance company and do not
