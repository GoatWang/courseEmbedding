to a transaction namely the buyer and the seller you can learn more about our firm at wwwpeterscocom the general types of conflicts of interest which can arise are conflicts of interest between you and us conflicts of interest between you and our other clients and conflicts of interest between us and our related and associated companies as an investment dealer we are a financial intermediary as is the common practice in the brokerage industry sometimes we may be the party on the other side of the transaction referred to as a “principal” trade where we own the security we sell to you on other occasions we simply facilitate a transaction between you as our client and a third party on the other side of the transaction through an “agency” trade where we have no ownership interest in the security traded in still other cases we advise an issuer of securities on how to best raise funds by selling securities while contemporaneously recommending that our clients buy those same securities management of conflicts of interest in general we deal with and manage relevant conflicts as follows avoidance this includes avoiding conflicts that are prohibited by law as well as conflicts that cannot effectively be addressed control we manage acceptable conflicts through means such as physically separating different business functions and restricting the internal exchange of information disclosure by providing you with information about conflicts you are able to assess independently their significance when evaluating our recommendations and any actions we take our goal is to address conflicts in a fair equitable and transparent manner consistent with the best interest of our clients we will try to avoid conflict where possible and in all other cases either disclose the conflict or manage it through internal controls and review processes conflicts deemed too significant to be addressed through controls or disclosures must be avoided disclosures will be made in a timely meaningful and prominent manner the following information is intended to assist you in understanding and assessing material potential and actual conflicts of interest including how we address them this is an overview of a complex subject despite that we believe the simplest control is the most effective – your continued satisfaction and patronage if you ever have any questions or concerns

and extensive securities regulatory rules and regulations many of which are directed at protecting client and investor interests including dealing with conflicts of interest we suggest that you refer
