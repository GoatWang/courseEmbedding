like high boiling solvents for plastics that do not evaporate the global usage of phthalate plasticizers is  billion pounds per year at a value exceeding  billion phthalate plasticizers have come under great scrutiny recently due to their toxicity and persistence in the environment for instance the plasticizer bisethylhexyl phthalate poses a risk to human development and fertility and has been found to be a carcinogen and a toxin to reproductive systems thus there is a need for new plasticizers that do not pose these problems and are environmentally benignacetone is one of the most widely produced and used chemicals it is used extensively in the plastics industry sixtysix percent of acetone is used to make methyl methacrylate and bisphenola seventeen percent of acetone is used as a zero voc solvent for coatings the remainder is used to produce other chemicals such as methyl isobutyl ketone and cyanohydrins the plasticizer industry would pose a significant gain for acetone producers if acetone could be used as a feedstock to manufacture plasticizers that would replace or augment the present use of phthalate plasticizerssummarythis summary is provided to introduce a

embodiments as plasticizers and additives to plasticpolymer materials or as additives for personal care products such as perfume and shampoo compositions and products that include the molecules are also disclosed the molecules are generally manufacturable from acetone one of the most widely produced chemicals in the world the invented plasticizers are primarily esters of a cyclic form of acetone that is in the family of carbohydrates and as such have very low toxicity the result is an environmentally benign biodegradable family of plasticizers that do not encompass the detrimental features carcinogenic reproductive and developmental toxins of phthalate plasticizers being a derivative of acetone the plasticizers furthermore constitute a cost effective approach to the elimination of the problems associated with phthalate plasticizersacetone is one of the top produced industrial chemicals in terms of tonnage us production capacity for acetone reached  thousand metric tons  million pounds in  demand for acetone in the us alone was  thousand metric tons  million pounds fortytwo percent of the acetone produced is used in the manufacture of methyl methacrylate and twentyfour percent is used in the manufacture of bisphenola acetone is extensively used as a solvent as it does not harm the atmosphere and as such is a zero voc volatile organic content solvent that can be engaged without penalty acetone is extremely low in toxicity and is a natural product of the human bodys metabolism the invention utilizes derivatives of acetone called hydroxyacetone acetol and dihydroxyacetone hydroxyacetone acetol and dihydroxyacetone can be dimerized to form high boiling cyclic compounds fig  plasticizers can be produced from hydroxyacetone dihydroxyacetone or their dimersdihydroxyacetone is widely used in the food and fragrances industry the compound is used in everything from candy to spices to impart flavor sweetness and smell dihydroxyacetone is used at a concentration of  ppm in hard candy and up to  ppm in various spices the ld oral rat for dihydroxyacetone dimer is in excess of sixty thousand mgkg thus the acute toxicity of dihydroxyacetone and its dimer is extremely low the acetone derivatives are not known to act as carcinogens mutagens reproductive or developmental toxins in fact hydroxyacetone and its dimer are the most simple from of ketose and as such belong to the carbohydrate family the inventors believe that the use of these acetone derivatives as plasticizers in polymers and coatings has never been disclosed however the high boiling point ° c and other physical properties of the compounds along with the low toxicity noncarcinogenicity and cost effectiveness compounds are an attractive alternative to the existing toxic phthalate plasticizershowever there are particular properties that a plasticizer must have to increase the flexibility and durability of plastics these properties arethe enthalpy of mixing δh of the plasticizer into the polymer is exothermic for increased stabilitythe gibbs free energy δg of mixing the plasticizer into the polymer is spontaneousthe plasticizer should have a high solubility in the plastic being plasticizedthe plasticizer should have very low vapor pressure to prevent evaporation out of the polymerthe plasticizer should have very low solubility in any solvent that the end product be exposed to prevent leeching of the plasticizer andthe plasticizer should be sufficiently large to spread the polymer chains apart to increase the free volume of the plasticthe provided plasticizers meet these criteriapolymers of like structure are usually not soluble in each other for example polyethylene and polypropylene are not soluble in each other and phase separate the reason for phase separation is that the enthalpy of mixing is small as there is very little thermodynamic interaction between the chains for this reason polymer alloys are rarethere needs to be enthalpy of mixing for the plasticizerpolymer combination for the system to be stable and not phase separate in the case of polymers such as polyvinyl chloride which is a common polymer that is combined with a plasticizer the provided plasticizers are completely compatible because the ester linkagechloride interaction leads to an exothermic heat of mixing and therefore to a stable combination fig  in fig  the thermodynamic interactions between phthalate and pvc and acetonederived plasticizer and pvc are diagrammatically illustrated the carbonyl of the plasticizer and the pvc chloride interact with each other the acetone derivatives can be formulated to have more ester moieties per compound so as to increase thermodynamic interaction and improve plasticizer abilitythe acetone dimer plasticizers also have sufficient size to allow for free motion of the polymer chains and for a sufficiently high boiling point as to minimize evaporation lastly there can be up to four ester moieties on the acetone dimer plasticizers which greatly increase the thermodynamic interaction between polymer host and plasticizer the increased interaction decreases the chance of the plasticizer being leached outa variety of structural forms of the dihydroxyacetone dimer can be made into useful materials utilized as additives for plastic materials and personal care products the hydroxyl moieties of the dihydroxyacetone dimer can be made into nonlimiting examples including esters ethers and urethanes the  hydroxy methyl moieties of the dihydroxyacetone dimer can be oxidized to carboxylic acid moieties these carboxylic moieties can produce structural forms of the dihydroxyacetone dimer that nonlimiting examples include esters amides thioesters phosphorous containing esters ethers and the like any of these structural forms of the invention can be utilized as additives to plastics plasticizers additives to personal care productsin one aspect a plasticizer is provided comprising a

for a particular application accordingly the provided compounds can be integrated into the polymer matrix as a plasticizer to soften the polymer matrix this allows for easier processing and less rigid and brittle polymer material to form into a productarticles may also be formed that incorporate the provided compounds exemplary articles include a wire tubing tile paint a bottle a panel a communication device a computing device a wind a vehicle a structural unit cloth fabric carpet and a foamsynthesis of the plasticizersin representative embodiments the invention is made by the formation of an ester ether urethane linkage silane or thioester between dihydroxyacetone hydroxyacetone or their dimers and an organic speciesstandard chemical synthetic techniques known to those of skill in the art are used to synthesize the plasticizersa typical synthesis begins with hydroxyacetone if a monohydroxyacetone is used the hydroxy group is reacted to form the desired ether ester etc “arms” extending from the site of the hydroxy group similarly if a dihydroxyacetone is used either two identical arms are formed at each hydroxy site or one site can be protected while the other is reacted with a first moiety to provide a first arm the second hydroxy site is then deprotected or otherwise manipulated to attach a moiety to form a second arm if the hydroxyacetone is dimerized as in figs  and  additional hydroxy sites are available for attachment of arm moietiesthere are a variety of ways to make dihydroxyacetone using acetone the acetone is reacted with chlorine to produce dichloroacetone which is then hydrolyzed to dihydroxyacetone dihydoxyacetone is also naturally produced in biological processes using selective oxidation of glycerol using either or both enzymatic or inorganic catalysts can produce dihydroxyacetone using catalysts and polymer supports dihydroxyacetone can be produced from formaldehyde once dihydroxyacetone is produced it naturally cyclizes much in the same way the glucose naturally forms the pyranose structurethe “arm” moieties that attach to the hydroxyacetone at a hydroxy site can be any functionality known to form a bond with a hydroxy moiety these arms are typically functionalized with a chloride or acid eg a carboxylic acida number of representative synthetic schemes are illustrated in fig  which illustrates reaction sequences to form the bisisovalerate ester of hydroxyacetone dimer and dihydroxyacetone dimer from the acetone dimers and isovaleric anhydride and the tetraisovalerate ester from dihydroxyacetone dimer this structure type of plasticizer with relatively small ester moieties would be the most common type of plasticizer employedif an acid is used to coordinate an arm to the hydroxyacetone the acid is selected from a carboxylic acid fatty acid phosphoric acid ester phosphinic acid thiocarboxylic acid silicone silane or urethane with an isocyanate thus there is a choice of acid to use to produce the plasticizer it is logical to use naturally occurring carboxylic acids or derivatives of carboxylic acids to create an environmentally benign plasticizer aromatic acids such as benzoic acid would not be a preferred acid to create an environmentally benign plasticizer thus acids from natural sources such as plants are ideal fruits such as bananas apples or pears and saponification of fats and triglycerides are prime sources for naturally occurring organic carboxylic acidstable  lists several naturally occurring carboxylic acids their toxicity data and where they occur naturally there are other sources of these acids other than agriculture for instance isovaleric acid can be obtained as the triglyceride from animal fats usually the carboxylic acid is in the form of an ester isovaleric acid is found in apples as the ester ethyl isovalerate esters with hydroxyacetone and dihydroxyacetone and their dimers can be formed with any of the acids shown but isovaleric acid will be used as an example since it is very low in toxicity benign to the environment and is inexpensivetable various carboxylic acids their structure and sourcesldratldrat

anhydrous hydroxyacetone dihydroxyacetone or the dimer of hydroxyacetone or the dimer of dihydroxyacetone the acetone derivatives are allowed to dissolve into the isovaleric chloride solution the solution was allowed to warm to room temperature overnight to form the monoisovalerate ester of hydroxyacetone or the bisisovalerate ester of dihydroxyacetone or the dimers four equivalents of isovaleric chloride were used to one equivalent of anhydrous dihydroxyacetone dimer to create the tetraester the compounds were purified by first washing with a dilute bicarbonate solution and then chromatographed on a silica column using  acetone in hexanes yields were close to quantitative nmr of dihydroxyacetone diisovalerate ester is shown in fig etherester combination ethers may also be used in the formation of plasticizers from hydroxyacetone the ether moiety is used to cap the hydroxy moieties while the esters cap the methyl alcohol moieties ethers are typically more hydrolytically stable and hydrolyze only under very acidic conditions alcohols such as ethanol or isopropanol can be reacted with hydroxyacetone or dihydroxyacetone or their dimers to form plasticizers suitable for organic coatings based upon acrylics styrenics vinyl acetate and many moreusing peg sulfonates and other water soluble or water solubilizing moieties a series of supersurfactants can be formed supersurfactants based upon dimers of hydroxyacetone dimer or dihydroxyacetone have several environmental and toxicity advantages over naphthalene based supersurfactants and have a cost advantage over polycarboxylate ethers supersurfactants are often employed in concrete as a way to limit the amount of water used the strength of concrete is an inverse function of water thus limiting the amount of water used makes for stronger concrete however limiting the amount of water leads to the slurry being very difficult to flow and work with supersurfactants allow for better flow properties and make the concrete easier to work with when water is limitedaccordingly in certain aspects and embodiments the plasticizers are used as supersurfactants in concrete eg as an additive to concrete to enhance strengthsynthesis of diisopropoxydihydroxyacetone dimer bis isovalerate ester figs  dihydroxyacetone dimer  g and ptoluenesulfonic acid  mg were combined in a twoheck flask and placed under dry
