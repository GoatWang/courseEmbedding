to building it our assessment of a company’s prospects and value relies on a variety of both quantitative and qualitative factors we look for great companies whose business model we can understand and whose future earnings we believe we can reasonably estimate  our high conviction results in concentrated portfolios of distinctive companies whose brand value diversified holdings proven management and strong financial profile set them apart as leaders importantly we balance our fundamental analyses with a view toward longterm global trends and secular themes seeking companies where we believe demand for their products and services is likely to grow based on positive demographic trends and increasing economic development risk management goes handinhand with portfolio construction  conventional wisdom equates risk with monthly or even daily volatility of prices of securities we on the other hand regard risk as the likelihood of permanent loss of capital viewed in that light we are focused on inherent value of our holdings not on the daily fluctuations of their prices by investing only in publicly traded securities we further manage risk by maintaining highly liquid portfolios consistent application of our investment philosophy enables clients to properly evaluate the efficacy of our investment strategy to achieve their objectives our philosophy prudent investing centers on preserving and growing wealth for generations as such we invest in companies who think likewise the philosophy governing our approach to investing is straightforward we want to own superior companies with good management at reasonable prices and remain owners as long as all three criteria are met as such our research is aimed at defining and assessing each of these aspects what are superior economics reasonable prices and good management and which companies possess them while our philosophy is simple and understandable successful implementation is anything but not only does it require dispassionate analysis and research in assessing each potential investment but and perhaps more importantly it requires patience discipline and courage we are proud of the quality of our research and analysis but we believe that the real differentiator for uas lies in our independent thinking and discipline in acting on wellreasoned convictions — going against the prevailing trend takes a particular temperament and courage honed by a disciplined process our offering our primary service is management of equity portfolios in separately managed accounts smas for individuals groups
