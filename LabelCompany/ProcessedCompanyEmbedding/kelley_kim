insider finance politics strategy life sports video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × walmarts made in usa push has become incredibly complicated james b kelleher reuters jun    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print file picture shelves being stack with merchandiser at a walmart stores inc company distribution center in bentonville thomson reuters reuters  when walmart pledged last year to buy an extra  billion in usmade goods over the next decade it appeared to be just what was needed to help move americas putative manufacturing renaissance from rhetoric to reality but suppliers trying to reshore production as part of the initiative by the worlds largest retailer are running into practical problems as they try to restart longidled corners of us manufacturing companies that make the leap have to grapple with a host of challenges including a shallow pool of component suppliers an inexperienced workforce and other shortcomings that developed during the countrys long industrial decline a lot of the tribal knowledge and skill sets are gone because the humans who used to do that work have either retired or died says h kim kelley the ceo of hampton products international a privately held maker of locks lighting and other household hardware the foothill ranch californiabased company began selling products made in asia to walmart in the s and is now supplying it with some usmade products trying to rebuild that manufacturing capability while making products that meet walmarts standards can require companies to “start from scratch” kelley says cindi marsiglio the walmart vice president overseeing the us sourcing push says the retailer and its existing suppliers have  active reshoring projects in various stages of development for all too many she says finding usmade component parts has emerged as a vexing problem hampton which also makes tow straps tiedowns and bungee cords for the automotive market had a hard time locating a us maker of lightweight but strong polyester yarn marsiglio says other suppliers complain of difficulty finding small motors as well as plastic injection molding equipment and computerized cutandsew tools the issue is so widespread that walmart is making it the focus of a twoday summit it is hosting in august in denver at a similar summit held in orlando last year walmart focused on connecting suppliers with economic development officers from states hoping to lure the new factories the retailer says it is especially interested in having factory owners with excess capacity attend the august event  even those that arent interested in supplying walmart directly the hope is that they can become contract manufacturers to walmart suppliers looking to produce in the united states on july  it is also inviting hundreds of potential vendors to an open call to pitch usmade products to the retailer in bentonville arkansas where it is based shut plants walmarts critics say the company bears some responsibility for the diminished capability of us manufacturers for years its relentless insistence that suppliers cut costs prompted companies to shut domestic plants and shift production to lowwage countries now the retailer is asking companies to come back home  though they need little prompting the forces pulling production back to the united states are powerful and real and include lower domestic energy prices increasingly competitive wage rates the benefits of greater automation and a renewed appreciation for the value of being able to respond quickly to shifting us customer demands still starting up a manufacturing operation is a complex undertaking especially for vendors like hampton and redman  associates an arkansasbased toymaker last year redman sold  million batterypowered rideon toys such as large toy cars in the united states  every one of them made in chinese contract plants by  the privately held company plans to be producing about  of those toys each year out of a brandnew companyowned and run plant in the us mel redman the companys ceo and chairman says the transition has required the company to reverse engineer everything its chinese contractors were doing  an exercise that wasnt easy given his executive teams background in retail “we didn’t know much about manufacturing – we didn’t know anything about it really” he says shipping costs walmart declines to say how many products it has introduced as a result of the monthold made in usa initiative but the company says consumers can now buy everything from usmade flatscreen tvs light bulbs and towels and curtains in its stores and on its website the flatscreen tvs made in winnsboro south carolina by element electronics may be the campaign’s biggest surprise to date founded in  element had until this year made all its tvs in asia  but it was unable to get them on walmarts shelves because there was nothing that differentiated them from rivals products says ceo mike oshaughnessy “so we began to think about what we could do differently well one of the things we could do differently is to make our tvs at home” he says element built a small test plant in michigan that began producing flatscreen tvs shortly before walmart announced the made in usa push in january  the announcement prompted the company to fasttrack its expansion today element’s squarefoot plant in south carolina has six assembly lines making  and inch tvs that are now available in all of walmarts more than  us stores the switch has led to significant savings in ocean freight charges and customs duties on finished goods  though like so many companies involved in the initiative element has had difficulty finding domestic suppliers we import the vast majority of our parts says oshaughnessy longer term the more success we have procuring our parts domestically the better off we expect to be  although walmart has given itself  years to meet its  billion goal marsiglio says the retailer hopes to meet the target ahead of schedule she says the point of the open call next month is to simplify a product pitching process that can challenge even longtime suppliers but while the door is open the bar is high and walmart will require any applicants to open their financial books as part of the screening process given walmart’s reputation as a tough negotiator with suppliers the disclosure of sensitive financial information to the retailer requires a leap of faith but elements oshaughnessy said his company had no misgivings about opening its books walmart needs to know it can rely on its vendors he said “what does it cost to produce product what does it cost to move product every one of the variables that make up the cost of the product we shared with walmart” he says editing by david greising and martin
