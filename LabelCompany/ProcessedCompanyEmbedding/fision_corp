infrastructure david talbot dundee capital markets  scintillometer results from another nine holes at fission uranium corps triple r deposit were reported  drill results from both areas demonstrate wide zones highgrade cores and shallow uranium mineralization assays pending the results from the re zone appear particularly important  the main takeaway here is that multiple stacked zones provide for added exploration potential  due to the expectation that rocks may get more structurally complex moving westward small step outs are a good way to grow this zone critical mass is desired

either side of the triple r resource along strike as well as testing other exploration targets within its exploration portfolio the gold report interview with paul renken  fission uranium corp and nexgen energy are finding more mineralization in the same trend theyre essentially adjoining companies and because of the grades in that trend both nexgen and fissions properties are going to be highgrade mines theyre willing at these current low uranium prices to find additional pounds and not push toward production its probably the right way for those companies to add value  recent drill results show mineralized extensions to the southwest and northeast on the rw zone theyre essentially continuations on the same trend that contains patterson lake south fission will continue to add pounds there neither of those areas is included in the current resource so the company will end up getting some kind resource boost from both extensions at a future date  the fissiondenison mines deal

gold report interview with rick rule  fission uranium corp fcutsx did something highly unusualit created value it made what appears to be a worldclass uranium discovery the market was looking for nearterm share price performance and didnt properly appreciate the value but a chinese investor who understood that the current malaise in uranium prices cant continue and was looking for security of supply came in at a substantial premium to market and provided the company with sufficient working capital to move the project forward there are a whole bunch of instructive lessons here first of all that the market in very good times or very bad times is a bad arbiter of value in very good markets investors overvalue reserves resources narratives and potential and in very bad markets they undervalue the very same thing the second lesson is that the time frames investors in particular speculators limit themselves to are farcical it will take probably five years for the southwestern part of the athabasca basin to deliver enough certainty with regard to the npv of those resources that they could be appropriately valued but investors have trauma holding stock over a long weekend their expectations of value are unrealistic the chinese investor by contrast understood that the malaise in uranium prices is temporary because it knows how much uranium it is going to need it realizes that

court approved plan of arrangement denison mines shareholders were in strong support while a majority but not twothirds of fission shareholders voted in favor prior to the proxy deadline on oct   fission now returns to its position as a leading explorer with the largest undeveloped resource in the athabasca basin wayne hewgill mackie research capital  fission uranium corp announced the initial assay results from the  summer drilling program on its owned patterson lake south project  highlights from the drilling on line e in the e zone included an interval m grading  uo starting at a depth of m the interval included a highgrade interval of m grading  uo  the company also announced promising results from regional drilling on the forest lake and patterson lake corridors heiko ihle rodman  renshaw  on september   fission uranium corp announced the final results from its  summer drill program we highlight that the m hole drilling program at patterson lake south pls boasts a  mineralization hit rate  we continue to remain optimistic that pls hosts strong exploration potential and look forward to the release of winter drilling results particularly those at rw brent cook exploration insights  on thursday fission uranium corp released the results of a pea for its triple r uranium deposit  the study indicated triple r could be developed into a robust deposit aftertax npv b internal rate of return  assuming  uranium david sadowski raymond james  fission uranium corp announced highlight results from a maiden pea at its flagship owned patterson lake south uranium project in northern saskatchewan parameters are broadly inline with our estimates outlining a robust very low opex standalone mine using open pit and underground extraction that would rank triple r as the fourth largest producer globally we urge investors to build positions on significant share price weakness in fission rob chang cantor fitzgerald  fission uranium corp has announced a nicompliant pea on the wholly owned triple r uranium deposit  the pea demonstrates the viability and profitability of the project we are upgrading our recommendation to buy nik rasskazovskiy salman partners  yesterday fission uranium corp released positive results of a pea prepared by rpa inc on fissions triple r uranium deposit at its owned patterson lake south property in the athabasca basin in saskatchewan  with the average operating costs of uslb uo over the life of mine triple r can potentially become one of the lowestcost uranium producers in the world heiko ihle rodman  renshaw  fission uranium corp announced the release of a pea for the triple r deposit at its wholly owned patterson lake south project the much anticipated pea outlines a robust openpit and underground operation producing a total of  mlb uranium over an initial  year mine life  the current pea only considers the mining of ore in zones re and re which we believe leaves room for enhanced economics through the potential inclusion of additional zones in the future mine plan for pls as a whole kristen moran uranium investing news  fission uranium corp released the results of a preliminary economic assessment pea for the triple r deposit  an aftertax net present value of cab an aftertax internal rate of return of  aftertax net cash flow of cab  and an estimated aftertax payback period of  years  the study excludes the recently discovered rw zone as it is still in early stages of drill definition  the pea points to operating costs of lb over the life of the mine which would make triple r potentially one of the lowestcost uranium projects in the world mick carew haywood securities  fission uranium corp announced summary results of its maiden nicompliant preliminary economic assessment pea for its owned triple r uranium deposit part of the companys patterson lake south pls project  based on a resource estimate of  mlb uo grading  in the indicated category and  mlb uo grading  in the inferred category  the pea outlines a combined openpit and underground operation  we see fission as a major player in unlocking the full potential of this revived region with triple r standing as a prototype for future projects in the region heiko ihle rodman  renshaw  on sept  fission uranium corp announced additional drill results from its summer drill program at its whollyowned patterson lake south pls property  increasing the width of the rw zone by m to the east and an additional m to the west in our opinion the shallow highgrade mineralization that the company has begun to uncover at rw has similar characteristics to highgrade sections of the triple r deposit given this we expect further successful drill results from rw to ultimately increase the size of the overall resource base for pls rob chang cantor fitzgerald  fission uranium corp announced drill scintillometer results from an additional ten holes as part of the m hole summer drill program at the patterson lake south pls property all ten holes reported uranium mineralization of which five are to be considered high grade  expanding the footprint of the rw zone once again  the overall onstrike mineralized trend at pls now stands at km an increase from km previously the energy report interview with mick carew  the southern margin of the athabasca basin has become the new hot spot for uranium discoveries in the last three to four years through the discovery of fission uranium corps triple r followed by nexgens arrow  fission has accumulated significant lease holdings surrounding its project  fission has released an inferred resource of  million pounds its a significant resource the results that fission has released of late are aiming to extend the r zone and are very good results read more  gwen preston resource maven  fission uranium corps pls project is home to  mlb uo at similar grades to nexgen energy ltds rook project and fission was just valued at m in a merger deal with denison mines rob chang cantor fitzgerald  fission uranium corp has announced drill results from an additional  holes as part of the m hole summer drill program at the patterson lake south property  all  drill holes reported uranium mineralization of which  are to be considered with highgrade radioactive mineralization measuring over  cps the results of todays announced drilling has expanded the footprint of the rw zone michael allison seeking alpha  denison mines corp and fission uranium corp have entered into a definitive agreement whereby the two companies will combine into one entity  arguably the best portfolio of strategic uranium assets in the athabasca basin  a  interest in the wheeler river project saskatchewan currently denisons flagship project  and interests in a number of other highpotential projects in this region  should the denison and fission merger go through the combination will create a company with a land package of over  ha as well as a significant ni  defined mineral resource base jeb handwerger gold stock trades  i am a shareholder of fission uranium corp and believe the merger with denison mines corp could benefit the entire athabasca basin mergers and acquisitions are the name of the game in uranium  the combined larger entities could attract strategic and institutional investors which could open the capital markets to improved exploration and development budgets in this bear market companies need to consolidate in order to cut costs and attract major institutional interest denison with fission will have the best portfolio of highgrade advanced uranium assets in the basin plus free cash flow from denisons tollmilling agreements and management fees with uranium participation corp brien lundin gold newsletter jefferson financial  fission uranium corp stole the headlines recently by announcing its intent to merge with denison mines corp  the combination would be powerful and attractive  the merger with denison  produces not only a very attractive target for the remaining potential suitors but also a viable competitor if they dont act so the announcement of this merger could itself precipitate a counteroffer  the worst case at this point is a merger with a great company in denison  all in all not a bad position to be in experts following this company tyron breytenbach analyst – cormark securities rob chang senior analyst and head of metals  mining –
