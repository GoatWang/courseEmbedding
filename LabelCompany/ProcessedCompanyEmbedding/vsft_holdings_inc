install memory into my desktop computer q how do i install memory into laptop computer usb flash drives faqs q why cant i have access to the advertised capacity of the usb flash drive a your usb drive will have a smaller true capacity versus the advertised or marketing capacity due to the historical definitions of gb and mb as well as memory management and partition accounting information utilizing some of the true capacity of your usb drive this discrepancy does not only apply to flash drives but standard hard drives as well memory management utilizes about kb out of every mb the larger the card the larger the amount reserved the following table shows the advertised capacity vs the average true capacity advertised capacity average true capacity mb mb mb mb mb mb mb mb gb mb gb gb gb gb gb gb gb gb gb gb marketing or advertised capacity vs true capacity information provided by wikipediaorg it is important to note that hard drive manufacturers often use metric definition of the prefixes giga and mega however nearly all operating system utilities report capacities using binary definitions for the prefixes this is largely historical since when storage capacities started to exceed thousands of bytes there were no standard binary prefixes the iec only standardized binary prefixes in  so   bytes was called a kilobyte because  is close enough to the metric prefix kilo which is defined as  or  this trend became habit and continued to be applied to the prefixes  mega giga and even tera obviously the discrepancy becomes much more noticeable in reported capacities in the multiple gigabyte range and users will often notice that the volume capacity reported by their os is significantly less than that advertised by the hard drive manufacturer for example a drive advertised as  gb can be expected to store close to  x  or  billion bytes this uses the proper si definition of giga  and cannot be considered as incorrect since utilities provided by the operating system probably define a gigabyte as  or  bytes the reported capacity of the drive will be closer to  gb actually gib a difference of well over ten gigabytes for this very reason many utilities that report capacity have begun to use the aforementioned iec standard binary prefixes eg kib mib gib since their definitions are not ambiguous another side point is that many people mistakenly attribute the discrepancy in reported and advertised capacities to reserved space used for file system and partition accounting information however for large several gib file systems this data rarely occupies more than several mib and therefore cannot possibly account for the apparent loss of tens of gbs q how do i format the usb flash drive a to format the usb flash drive use the following steps for your
