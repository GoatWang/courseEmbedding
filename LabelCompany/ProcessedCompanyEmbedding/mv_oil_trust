about mv oil mvo the forensic accountant research analyst oil  gas energylinkedinmv oil trust nysemvo as its name suggests is an oilheavy oil and gas trust that was created to acquire and hold a term net profits interest in approximately  producing oil and gas wells in the states of kansas and colorado sourcemvo q  p mvo has recently developed a cult following and its share price has taken a wild ride spiking as high as  in july before dropping off  in the second half of this year while mvos robust distribution and price momentum attract my attention as a possible value play a deeper review reveals a big warning sign the term of mvos net profits interest is likely to end in  with this termination in mind i applied an engineeringstyle model to forecast mvos future distributions based on individualized forecasts of production prices and expenses and the results suggest that investors should show extreme caution if considering mvo at current prices this article discusses the assumptions and results of the model a general model used to value trusts an oil and gas trust is a type of commodity investment in which investors receive periodic royalty payments from the sale of oil and gas from a set of underlying properties for investors the value of a trust is the net present value or npv of its future royalty payments although each trust has a unique process for determining its distribution most resemble the generalized model shown below the total distribution for a period is the gross revenues from the sale of oil and gas less productionrelated expenses incurred by the proprietor times the share of income owned by the trust less the trusts own administrative expenses of course the devil is in its details future distributions are subject to uncertainties in well production sales prices and expenses as well as unforeseen events in addition well proprietors and trust administrators may use various accounting and contractual techniques to manipulate net income and indirectly their distributions see tricks that inflate the value of oil and gas trusts while these techniques are legal and often spelled out in a trusts sec filings they can mislead investors i recommend that all trust investors become very familiar with these techniques the rest of this article discusses my assumptions regarding forecast revenues expenses and other underlying circumstances for mvo mvo key model assumptions and considerations total well production will exhibit a gradual sustained decline as of dec   mvos net profits interest applied to just over  net producing wells that are operated by mv partners llc a joint venture between vess oil corporation and murfin drilling company inc since the inception of the trust in  the number of producing wells has remained nearly unchanged and total well production has exhibited a consistent annual decline of around year which is better than most trusts that i have reviewed moving forward production may increase or decrease based on natural production declines and mv partners decisions to shutinreopen old wells or add new ones regardless of these decisions mvo is likely to dissolve on june   at which point the net profits interest will revert to mv partners additional notes on dissolution provided below the model considers three possible forecasts of future production each of which assumes a different decline rate but with little or no change to the number of producing wells the middle forecast assumes that total production will decline at the current rate of  while the best and worst cases assume  and  respectively historical and future forecast production is shown in the following chart production will continue to be sold at a discount to wti futures over the past year mvos production has been sold at prices that have averaged boe less than the wti closing endofmonth spot price the model assumes that future production will be sold at the values given by nymex wtilight sweet crude futures adjusted for this spread these prices are shown in the following chart proprietor and trust expenses will hold steady over time mv partners deducts a single quarterly charge from trust revenues that includes development and production costs taxes and various service fees paid to vess and murfin although mv does not provide a consistent detailed breakout of these costs some such as production and taxes may decrease over time while others such as the service fees are likely to increase the model assumes that the future aggregate cost will be the rolling average of the preceding  quarters mvo trust management also deducts a single charge related to trust management expenses this charge varies from a high of k q  to a low of  q  averages k and exhibits no discernible trend to increase or decrease over time the model assumes that this charge will continue as the historical average until the trust terminates the chart below shows total historical and forecast revenues and expenses attributable to the trust mvo will terminate on june   with  residual value at first glance some readers may find this assumption to be the most controversial in this analysis however the language is pretty clear on the issue so id suggest that those who wish to object first consider what is written in mvos trust documents i dont like it either but that doesnt make it untrue per mvos  annual report the net profits interest entitles the trust to receive  of the net proceeds attributable to mv partners interest from the sale of production from the underlying properties the net profits interest will terminate emphasis added on the later to occur of  june   or  the time when  mmboe have been produced from the underlying properties and sold and the trust will soon thereafter wind up its affairs and terminate source mvos  q k dated  page  while i am not a lawyer and do not have any training in contract law or interpretation the language above seems to pretty clearly spell out the conditions under which the trust will terminate noting these conditions and given total well production to date current production rates and forecast production declines the model anticipates that total production will exceed  mboe some time during  which would result in the trust terminating on june   the  termination of mvo is further supported by the  annual report the paragraph cited immediately above continues… based on the reserve report produced in february  by cawley gillespie  associates inc cga an engineering firm hired by mvo cga estimated that the trust would terminate june   based on the calculation that  mmboe would have been produced from the underlying properties and sold… prior to this date as mvos net profits interest also terminates its residual value will be limited to just the petty cash that the trust has in its account effectively  the only way for the trusts net profits interest and value to extend after june   would be if well production were to experience significant production declines which would lower not raise the value of a share of mvo today mvo overvalued by  shown below are the npv of future distributions for the best middle and worst cases and for various rates of return as calculated by the model on  model results support a  valuation as the table suggests mvos fair valuation which assumes the middle case and an  roi is between  and  per share the current market price  as i write this overvalues mvo by  even considering reasonable upside potential the model yields a value of no greater than  or  less than todays market price the difference between mvos current marketbased value and that suggested by the analysis is greater than that of any other trust that i have reviewed this fact alone suggests that the analysis of mvo should be viewed with an especially critical eye however when considered in context the results are reasonable mvos reserve estimates support a  valuation mvos last reserve report dated december  estimates the npv of future production attributable to the trust as m or share since that report mvo has released share in distributions resulting in a remaining valuation between  and share for various reasons i believe that the reserve report overstates expected value regardless the markets value is still significantly higher the reserve report is available as an appendix to the  q k for full disclosure it is worth noting that cga estimates that the dec  npv might be as high as share if mv partners fully develop the underlying properties which they have not done thats still  in distributions ago and  under todays market price current market prices would be appropriate for a perpetual trust to test the sensitivity of the model to alternate assumptions i removed the assumption that mvo will terminate in  and reran the model in this way the trust is assumed to be perpetual the resulting valuation for mvo is roughly share which is consistent with the current market price this suggests that the current market valuation may not have considered the termination of mvo in its valuation mvo distributions will gradually reduce until termination over time the fair value of mvo will decrease as distributions are made the following chart illustrates the forecast of future distributions and the future fair share valuation as shown mvos distribution is forecast to decrease over time however the decline is slow the distribution will still be qtr in  this distribution stream would make mvo a good candidate if the trust were perpetual mvos value is very unfavorable as compared to other trusts mvo is the seventh trust that has been evaluated by the model others include enduro royalty trust nysendro forecast as of  eca marcellus trust i nyseect forecast as of  hugoton royalty trust nysehgt forecast as of  pacific coast oil trust nyseroyt forecast as of  sandridge mississippian trust i nysesdt forecast as of  sandridge permian trust nyseper forecast as of  the table below shows a ranking of trusts based on the difference between the model npv and the market price at the time of evaluation for mvo the difference is  which ranks it seventh given the results of the model mvos own reserve reports and the comparison to other trust analyses i would suggest that investors exercise extreme caution with mvo disclosure i am long per ect i wrote
