et share by donscott  white oak wogsx  s oelschlager on big caps by don scott cbs marketwatch last update new york cbsmw  one of the countrys top money managers believes three of the most attractive large cap stocks you could buy as the year draws to a close are compaq computers cpq cpq  morgan stanley dean witter mwd mwd  and bankamerica bac bac   jim oelschlager has built a first class track record running the white oak growth fund wogsx wogsx  out of akron ohio yeartodate the noload fund is up  percent versus the s  p s return of  percent and better yet over the last five years the fund is up an annualized  percent compared to the s  p s  percent the fund is concentrated holding just  names white oak has a turnover rate of just  percent and requires a minimum investment of  oelschlager says he starts from a topdown perspective identifying the broad areas of the economy he feels are most attractive these days its technology finanical services and health care as represented by the pharmaceutical companies were certainly not a closetindexer we think were in a continued environment of low inflation and low interest rates and huge technology gains that are leading to productivity gains that are putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates says oelschlager who is quick to point out that in the technology area you have unique products and pricing ability he says its key to find companies that are growing well and where the valuations are reasonable he laughs when you ask him what constitutes a reasonable valuation unfortunately theres no magic formula that will give you the answer you have to take a lot of factors into consideration the obvious are the growth rate and the multiple but then you have to tweak it a little bit based on what you think the company is going to trade for some companies sell at a premium multiple and with other companies theyre always selling at a bit of a discount okay then so is there a checklist he runs down when he looks for companies to buy no this is more of an art form than a science we dont have any formulas or black boxes we think its a common sense business and we dont have any nobel laureates in our firm either if anybody gets nominated theyre fired top ten holdings of white oak growth fund  cisco systems csco csco   intel corp intc intc   applied materials amat amat   ascend

blood in the streets take applied materials amat amat   for instance which came under a lot of pressure with the slowdown in the building of fabricating plants for the semiconductor business but oelschlager says the chip market is starting to pick up applied materials is an example of a stock that just got trashed about a year ago in last years fourth quarter they cut the stock in half in the fourth quarter and they gave us a chance to add to the stock and were still in it he says amats numbers are starting to come in betterand theyre just starting to come out of the contraction compaq has been very strong in the pc market and theyve recently had a lot of competition from dell dell dell  he notes and compaqs market share in the latest set of data i saw seems to be picking up so the momentum seems to be moving in compaqs favor after getting beaten up a little bit by dell oelschlager also is very strong on morgan stanley dean witter they took the stock i think from about  down to about  which is a pretty significant correction yes they lost some money overseas and yes they had some trading losses but its not the end of the world and morgan stanley dean witter is going to be a major force going forward and a third favorite is bankamerica which came under heavy selling pressure after announcing big losses related to the banks investment in a hedge fund so they took the stock out and shot it he says the loss was huge and hard to understand from a bank but we think its probably been overdone in the marketplace he says bankamerica is going to be a huge force as consolidation continues among the banks oelschalger thinks  will be another good year for the market because technology will continue to drive productivity gains that will in his view continue to drive interest rates down a year ago he was looking for the year treasury bond to trade at  percent and people thought i was nuts he thinks  will see the long bond go to  percent which will cause good multiple expansion and probably a surprisingly good stock market but be careful he says with his tongue firmly in his cheek im always an optimist more from marketwatch more coverage all the companies in jeff
