reviews david shrigley brain activity regular price £ default title  £ gbp quantity add to cart descriptiondetailsreviews irreverent mischievous funny and charming the daily telegraph bestknown for his wry and witty drawings british artist david shrigley describes his work as ‘somewhere between handwriting and drawing’ and furthermore ‘not the kind of drawing where you’re trying to get their eyes in the right place’ well known for his cartoons this catalogue to the hayward gallerys  exhibition extends well beyond shrigleys deadpan drawing to include photography sculpture neon signs animation painting printmaking publishing and music  the book features an interview by writer dave eggers essays by martin herbert and cliff lauson and an original piece of prose contributed by artist jonathan monk the book also features a new inch picture disc featuring exclusive recorded original spoken word material created specifically for the book  author cliff lausson curator hayward gallery hardcover  pages date published january  language english isbn  product dimensions  x  x  cm this is a wonderful show shrigleys works are silly scrappy hilarious often macabre but more often than not they possess a profundity and wisdom many artists crave  the evening standard irreverent mischievous funny and charming  the daily telegraph not quite satire not quite comedy the mood of the drawings swerves between irony melancholy and a certain ruefulness  london review of books ‘i wanted to call it “fancy rooms filled with crap”’ muses david shrigley at the opening of his latest exhibition at the hayward gallery ‘but they said no’ however the show’s eventual title brain activity is rather apt as it opens a window on to the artist’s methods of working  design curial loading loading david
