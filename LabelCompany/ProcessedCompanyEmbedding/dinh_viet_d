as an assistant attorney general of the united states from  to  under the presidency of george w bush born in saigon in the former south vietnam he was the chief architect of the usa patriot act and is a former member of the board of directors of news corporation wikipedia i think that one of the primary roles of an attorney and certainly we try to teach it here to our students is that you counsel compliance with the law the lawyer more than simply being a mouthpiece for the client and advocating at whatever cost the clients interest is also an officer of the court in questions that appear before the court  share i think an ethical lawyer would absolutely refuse if he or she had knowledge that this is the purpose for which her work would be used that is to conceal a fraudulent scheme from federal regulators  share the reforms proposed by the patent reform act of  are precisely the type of congressional action needed the act will remove obstacles to growth and restore balance to the patent system  share like its senate counterpart hr  is the product of years of bipartisan collaboration and now by passing s  the us senate has a similar opportunity to restore our patent regime to its rightful position of protecting inventors property rights and spurring innovation these are values that all americans should rally behind  share i think that the question is very clearcut not only as a matter of ethics but also as a matter of law that a lawyer should not be aiding and abetting in a fraudulent scheme and part of that aiding and abetting would be to draw up subsequent documents in order to conceal the true nature of the scheme from federal investigators  share advertisement viet d dinh quotes quote of the day popular on our blog  buddha quotes to help

dinh cite this page about about us privacy terms viet d dinh quotes vietnamese  public servant born february     loading i think that the question is very clearcut not only as a matter of ethics but also as a matter of law that a lawyer should not be aiding and abetting in a fraudulent scheme and part of that aiding and abetting would be to draw up subsequent documents in order to conceal the true nature of the scheme from federal investigators viet d dinh nature ethics law the underfunded and overextended united states patent and trademark office does not have the resources to adequately evaluate the burgeoning number of applications and too many lowquality patents are being issued as a result viet d dinh office resources number the reforms proposed by the patent reform act of  are precisely the type of congressional action needed the act will remove obstacles to growth and restore balance to the patent system viet d dinh growth balance action like its senate counterpart hr  is the product of years of bipartisan collaboration and now by passing s  the us senate has a similar opportunity to restore our patent regime to its rightful position of protecting inventors property rights and spurring innovation these are values that all americans should rally behind viet d dinh innovation opportunity i think that one of the primary roles of an attorney and certainly we try to teach it here to our students is that you counsel compliance with the law the lawyer more than simply being a mouthpiece for the client and advocating at whatever cost the clients interest is also an officer of the court in questions that appear before the court viet d dinh law lawyer questions i think an ethical lawyer would absolutely refuse if he or she had knowledge that this is the purpose for which her work would be used that is to conceal a fraudulent scheme from federal regulators viet d dinh work knowledge purpose related authors elizabeth warren clara barton j edgar hoover
