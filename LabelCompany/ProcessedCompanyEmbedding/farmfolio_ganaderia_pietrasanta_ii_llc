cattle operation by implementing the voisin intensive rotational grazing system since implementing the system gp has become one of the country’s leaders in pastured beef production per hectare while the national average is  heads of cattle per hectare the voisin system originally developed by the french produces five to six heads of cattle per hectare with daily weight gains of  grams of grass

organic production with an additional   ha under development maracuya yellow passionfruit vines bear throughout the year at gp but peak periods are between august to december and march to may at the later time the fruits are somewhat smaller with less juice in monteria passion fruits mature from june through january with heaviest crops in july and august and october and november ripe fruits fall to the ground and will roll in between mounded rows in order to not attract flies or ants fruits are collected daily to avoid spoilage from soil organisms fruits are collected in lugs or boxes not in bags to prevent “sweating” if not sent immediately to processing plants the fruits should be spread out on wire racks where there will be good air circulation many factors influence the yield of passionfruit vines in general yields of commercial plantations range from  to  lbs per acre at gp with hand pollination  acres  ha will yield  tons of fruit on the average a bushel of passion fruits at gp weighs  lbs  kg yields   lbs  kg of pulp from which is obtained  gal  liters–that is  lbs  kg of juice and  lbs  kg of seeds with some strains the juice yield is much higher helping returns to
