  bloomberg barclays us aggregate bond index        as of  updated quarterly click here for detailed performance disclosures  investment objective the goal of tcw securitized opportunities is to significantly outperform the barclays capital us aggregate bond index over a full market cycle the strategy seeks to generate high returns historically similar to the equity market but with lower volatility over the long term tcw believes that the management team’s application of its extensive experience and committed research will add value to the investment process and enable this strategy to take advantage of market mispricings as well as periods of market illiquidity and dislocation philosophy  central to the tcw securitized opportunities investment philosophy is the belief that even in “normal” times the securitized markets present valuation complexities that when combined with traditional fixed income valuation factors give rise to pricing inefficiencies that can be exploited by informed investors negative investor psychology supplydemand imbalances the lack of analytical resources the lack of extensive experience required to understand the nuances or a combination of such factors work to create a barrier to entry in this market and result in opportunities for investors with the experience and resources to selectively invest  by virtue of our constant involvement in the securitized products market tcw believes it is well positioned to exploit the inefficiencies available in this complex sector  performance returns as of   annualized performance updated quarterly
