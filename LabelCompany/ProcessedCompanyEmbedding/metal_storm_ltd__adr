ticker symbol  mtsx      chairmans review   in this review last year i spoke of the ever increasing opportunities opening to metal storm across the international arena over the past  months highly prospective opportunities have been identified and more importantly appropriate strategies have been developed to ensure outcomes to the company and its shareholders will be maximised   metal storms overriding goal is now to generate regular and sustainable early revenue streams from the most prospective of these opportunities the board and senior management some time ago identified that the most effective strategy to achieve this goal is to participate in an everwidening range of government funded research and development rd programs of foremost interest are situations where the company can conduct rd development via funding which has been directly allocated under these programs significantly our progress in this area over the past  months has been positive and the company commenced  with clear signs that additional revenue flow on from our expanding base of rd programs will materialise as the year progresses   besides unlocking immediate income securing additional rd programs particularly in the us holds the strategic advantage of placing our technology squarely at the forefront of major defence development programs it also positions the company on the radar screens of the leading international defence technology companies which are invariably involved with such programs over the past year metal storm has successfully augmented the range and extent of our existing rd program commitments through securing a number of new funding arrangements these arrangements which open avenues for new applications of our technology included four small business innovation research sbir grants from the us department of defense dod   the sbir program typifies the type of funding programs the company will be vigorously pursuing for the foreseeable future the sbir program will remain a high priority for metal storm over the coming  months based on the fact that four of the five applications involving metal storm technology to date have been successful it is worth reinforcing that our progress as a company and the future financial returns to our shareholders will be linked to the us defence sector and in particular the forging of ever closer strategic ties with the us dod the business opportunities open to breakthrough technology companies such as metal storm are clearly highlighted by the us  billion annual budget allocated by the dod for defence research development test and evaluation and procurement   importantly our us office which has now been operating for two years is proving an increasingly valuable resource in leveraging new opportunities in this critical dod market the capability of our us operations was further bolstered in  with the appointment of mr russell zink as senior vice presidentbusiness development us the addition of lt general daniel christman president of the kimsey foundation to the board and the welcome return of general wayne downing as a director the board recognises that current us dod budgets for research development and procurement remain understandably skewed in favour of us national companies to ensure all future potential revenue opportunities in this market are maximised the company is investigating the transition of its us subsidiary into a fully domiciled us entity shareholders will be kept abreast of any developments in this regard over coming months   in a further strategic development designed to accelerate our progress with us rd programs in march this year the company announced the promotion of cco chuck vehlow as metal storms new ceo chuck has extensive defence industry experience in taking rd projects through to successful completion of procurement contracts in leading negotiations of technology licence agreements and mergers and aquisitions his commercial experience with major us defence companies makes him well suited to lead the company forward   significantly this key appointment now enables metal storms founder mike odwyer to focus his efforts solely on the critical areas of innovation and product development under his new executive position of directorscientific innovation in this capacity mike will be free to harness his considerable talents with the aim of moving our product into defence industry markets and providing key technical support for our us rd program initiatives   further reflecting the companys increased focus on activities in the us and in recognition of us corporate    governance best practice two of metal storms longstanding directors brett heading and peter pursey resigned from the board in march  both have made an invaluable contribution to the companys development and on behalf of the board and shareholders i thank them for their unswerving support of the company and its strategic objectives peter pursey will continue to provide an important role for metal storm in an executive position   sincere thanks are also extended to our valued staff both in australia and the us while we have increased the calibre and capacity of our senior management resources the volume of our programs and other development work has substantially expanded our staff work energetically in furthering the companys progress and their efforts should be applauded by all those with a vested stake in metal storm   my fellow directors also deserve thanks for their unqualified commitment and for their selfless contributions of time energy and wisdom as mentioned previously it is uncommon for a company of metal storms size to have a board of such stature and experience and this is a resource which will undoubtedly help drive our future success particularly in the allimportant us market   to shareholders our sincere thanks for your continued support and loyalty metal storm is your company and i along with our management and fellow directors remain committed to ensuring your investment and faith will be rewarded   s    a dmiral w illiam o wens admiral william owens us navy retired chairman        ceos review   the significant developments of the company  s technology over the last  months are now leading to metal storm implementing supporting strategies that enhance the company  s business in both australia and the united states to realise the value of these developments metal storm is pursuing a number of mutually supporting strategies which will allow shareholders to measure our success these strategies include        the transition of metal storm inc our us subsidiary into a us structure that allows it to pursue and capture rd revenue directly for metal storm        securing a much greater number of funded department of defence rd programs increasing revenue flows to metal storm and which produce application specific product        securing additional collaborative and commercial industry agreements with key defence companies globally        acquiring a small usbased defence company with the engineering electronics and related skills to support the companys rd and growth strategies        transition maturing programs to commercial products        reshaping the companys board and management in line with these strategies        the board is committed to advancing these strategies and may need to modify or adapt them in response to any changes identified in the defence environment   to provide perspective on metal storms achievements this year it is important to understand the nature of the defence industry which is somewhat different to many other industry sectors in terms of how technology and weapons are developed and brought into service ideas that a weapon system can be developed one year and on the operational front line the next year are misplaced two key areas differentiate the defence industry firstly there is one primary customer the department of defence secondly the approach to getting products into markets is a pull strategy not a broader push strategy which characterises many other industries pull means that defence identifies its ongoing weapon needs and then provides funded programs to ensure products are tailored to meet those specific needs companies are then pulled towards winning the contract to meet that need by comparison in many other industries once a product meets regulatory standards it can be pushed into as many markets as possible   metal storm has made exceptional progress for a small australian company competing from a standing start in the international defence industry metal storm is the only asx listed australian defence weapons company and there is no specialist defence analysis undertaken in the australian investment market in the us the metal storm inc office opened in  adding the appropriate level of defence experienced executive staff in management and business development in  since that time the demand being placed on the company to respond to government defence agency programs has been unprecedented   the achievements of the us office during this short period in terms of business development proposals dod contacts exposure to metal storm technology sbir proposals submitted and contracts won have been significant for a company the size of metal storm competing in the very significant us defence industry sector   focus on us defence markets   benefits of independent us structure   it has become increasingly apparent particularly over the past  months that there is an emerging opportunity in the us defence environment for metal storm to financially gain from the boost in funding for new generation defence rd projects as part of this revenue enhancing strategy the company is examining ways to transition its us subsidiary metal storm inc to maximise the return value to metal    storm shareholders importantly such a move would allow metal storm inc to contract directly with us government and defence agencies in accordance with us dod requirements this would significantly widen the net of rd funding open to metal storm consolidate greater congressional support for our technology and enhance our prospects for major longterm commercial arrangements revenues derived in this manner would open income streams for metal storm to use in addition to shareholder funds as the company moves to become cash positive   value of rd path in us   the nature of product development in the defence industry is linked directly to funded rd programs in simple terms these programs are determined by defence identifying what weapons products it needs to maintain cutting edge capabilities for its soldiers into the future having selected the capabilities required the dod fund rd programs to ensure the capabilities are developed and supplied to the defence force in the us alone the  budget allocated purely for defence research development test and evaluation and procurement is us billion   metal storm is far better positioned in  than at any time since the companys inception to achieve revenues from its unique ballistic technology revenues and investor returns are the measure of the companys path to success importantly the base to secure ongoing revenue streams has been put in place over the last  months   while licence agreements remain a priority objective for metal storm it is the rd programs that produce short term revenues and product that is ultimately the subject of license agreements therefore it is vital that the company compete in the rd program process government funded rd programs are an overriding priority for metal storm at this stage of the companys development as they provide        an immediate revenue stream from rd programs for metal storm        opportunities for close and highly productive collaboration with major established defence companies through formalised teaming agreements as well as expanding commercial and government agreements and pursuing further opportunities        an end conceptdemonstrator product for marketing        ultimate contract production agreements following successful product marketing and        capitalise on the benefits which an appropriate merger and acquisition opportunity provides   revenue streams   success in winning rd funding places metal storm technology into mainstream defence development programs metal storm technology has already seen the company successful in four of the five small business innovation research sbir programs applied for and expect that this success will lead to more sbir programs and even greater government funding and related product   metal storms success to date in the rd area has been very good the company currently has seven active programs all of which are in different stages of development   funded programs being developed in    the seven rd programs in which metal storm is currently involved are as follows        the area denial weapon system adws program with the defence science and technology organisation dsto will mature in  demonstrations of this mm pod system will follow and metal storm has already commenced developing the adws marketing plan the adws weapon system will compete as an alternative to conventional land mines and has a wide range of additional applications including vehicle self defence and high value asset protection        the advanced individual combat weapon aicw program with the dsto this program which includes tenix as a consortium member is progressing well and is expected to mature next year the weapon will combine a standard mm barrel with an electronically fired metal storm mm barrel which will have the capability to rapidly fire a range of mm munitions           the national institute of justice smartgun program this program is currently being undertaken with the us department of justice to develop a handgun which operates only for the authorised user this program takes metal storms vle handgun and will provide indepth analysis into the design use manufacturing processes and cost elements of delivering a productionsafe firearm for the law enforcement community of the us and potentially other friendly police and military forces internationally        the frill neck lizard interception technology sbir program with the us missile defense agency and stratcom international llc this program is designed to use stratcoms stratospheric airship platforms with metal storms technology to improve kill vehicle reliability by enlarging its destructive volume        the stratospheric missile intercept launch system sbir program with the us missile defense agency and stratcom international llc this program combines the stratcom strategic airships wide area detection and tracking capability with metal storm electronic ballistics        the us army sbir program with schappell automation corporation this program provides for a lethal and less than lethal metal storm weapon pod system the weapon can be hand held or mounted on a robot vehicle and has added value for use in peace keeping homeland defence and antiterrorism operations        the us navy sbir program with schappell automation corporation this program provides for a weapon system for use on navy vessels for close in threats and to provide local security for berthed ships   value of sbirs   metal storm technology has led to the successful award of four out of five sbir grants applied for in  sbir grants are funded in phases and provide approximately  in the first phase over a six month period followed by up to m for phase ii development metal storm is moving to capture greater revenue for the company from these rd programs in addition metal storm will be competing for a much larger number of sbirs in    transformational weapon systems   a common thread through many of these programs is an intentional movement from conventional mechanical systems through to next generation defence systems which are small fast inexpensive numerous and networkcentric metal storm technology is by its very nature a natural fit with this transformation as it can be simply and effectively integrated with future military networked weapon systems metal storm provides a lightweight modular variable calibre weapon solution that fits with the mix n match weapon systems being sought for the future   metal storms own build program       adding value   metal storm is not just reliant on securing defence programs to ensure its success the company is proactive in this area concurrent with seeking dod rd programs and other revenue related agreements the company is building a number of weapon systems to complement the development work being undertaken in existing programs the build program will ensure metal storm has the required demonstrator weapon systems to compete for dod programs which form part of the us defence budget the weapons will also be used to accelerate the pace and direction of several current rd programs   the key company builds include        the mm multi barrel pod  metal storm is being asked to demonstrate its mm weapon system to meet specific dod needs this build allows metal storm to tailor fire and demonstrate a weapon system that meets a defined dod need with a view to gaining revenue through key us funded defence programs this particular build provides options for mm mm or mm projectiles to be combined so as to extend the options for the applications of this multi calibre capability        the repeatable access denial weapon system   rads will be built and fired this year to fill an identified naval defence requirement metal storm has      signed a teaming agreement with curtiss wrightvista controls to participate in this program curtiss wrightvista controls is a very prominent us defence company who has joined with metal storm to supply the weapon mount and electronics so that a complete integrated weapon system can be fired and demonstrated to key defence customers in         metal storm nd generation ammunition  in october  the company announced the success of a new firing system which reduces external barrel wiring and leads eliminates barrel ports and external primers yet retains the infinitely variable rate of fire and multiple barrel capabilities that so clearly define metal storm technology this new firing system is a significant advance of the companys ballistics and will be further developed as a key element of the companys build program in    the builds of these important demonstration systems result from metal storm identifying them as having potential application in the area of homeland security force transformation and future combat systems   metal storm  technical data firings and product development   metal storm has built and fired over  weapon prototypes of various calibres ranging from mm to mm which indicates the scale and depth of the technology the company has also developed and expanded its technical and scientific data base which continues to grow at a rapid pace the companys intellectual property has also grown in line with these technological developments the independent research and development on the technology undertaken by metal storm from its own resources has so far resulted in  issued national patents and  patent applications in different countries and regions   in the last  months metal storm has continued to refine its understanding of what armed forces are seeking as capability for their next generation of weapons the two way dialogue which has been conducted with defence who are the real end users of weapon systems has enabled the company to explain first hand the capabilities that can be achieved with metal storm technology in turn metal storm can now more confidently focus the development of its technology to closely fit with future defence requirements   the outcome of this dialogue is that metal storm has identified a number of product development paths for the companys technology to take advantage of these product opportunities the company is independently completing the development firing and demonstration of weapon systems which we expect can meet future defence needs these independent product development efforts are additional to the very important work currently being conducted under existing government rd agreements and programs and expand the developing range of products which can springboard from our technology   technology development agreements        dsto research agreement  mm mm and  calibre high pressure development was conducted under this agreement with dsto in australia        nico pyrotechnics  metal storm has an agreement with nico relating to the commercial development of munitions from the adws program        saic research agreement  this agreement has been signed for a further three years and is now a nonexclusive agreement which allows metal storm to independently pursue other rd opportunities        stratcom teaming agreement  this agreement is designed to lead to the development and production of specific ballistic products that can be integrated into stratcoms stratospheric airship two approved and funded sbir programs are already being worked under this agreement        schappell automation corporation sac this agreement is to develop approved and funded sbir programs with the us army and navy   major defence relationship  curtisswright corporation      metal storm is teaming with the usbased vista controls inc a subsidiary of curtisswright corporation to research develop construct and demonstrate a repeatable access denial system rads based on metal storms technology vista controls brings substantial expertise to this program through its marketleading experience in designing and producing world class fire control subsystems and related software the companys products have been utilised in numerous key us defence programs   the rads system is intended to be used as a new revolutionary very closein defence mechanism which offers protection against small lethal rapidly moving hostile threats either on land or at sea   the agreement which was formalised in early  will see the team working on completing a fully integrated rads prototype for demonstration to defence agencies with a view to achieving production contracts it is envisaged the demonstrations to various agencies will occur by the end of    the rads demonstrator will incorporate metal storms new generation firing system with vistas stabilised weapons platform acquisition sensor integrating software and fully integrated user console   technical support working group tswg and counter terrorism the environment in the united states for the last year regarding the tswg and its efforts to combat terrorism have been time consuming and most of the program efforts have been put on hold by the us government   while over  proposals were received by the tswg in response to the us governments request for help after the  attacks to date only a handful of proposals have actually been funded we understand the process of getting responses back to those who presented tswg and counter terrorism submissions is still in progress   metal storm remains committed to providing the best uses of its unique and revolutionary technology for applications particularly suited to homeland security we will continue to pursue other important rd opportunities with a variety of us government services different agencies and major defence companies in the us   capital additions in september  metal storm raised an additional  in working capital through a private placement to institutional and private investors   the private placement comprised the issue of  ordinary shares at  cents per share investors in the placement were also granted  options to acquire an identical number of ordinary shares at an exercise price of  cents per share between  september  and  september    in addition existing shareholders were issued with a bonus option on a

to continue as a going concern      in order to meet metal storms objectives to develop manufacture and market commercial products effectively we will require additional funding until such time that product sales are of sufficient volume to generate positive cash flows from operations this has taken longer and has cost more than originally anticipated based on the expected levels of operating expenditures in order to continue its operations metal storm will require additional sources of capital as of june   metal storm had approximately a million in cash without a capital injection metal storm will exhaust its resources at the end of july there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital to continue our operations if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to obtain sufficient financing to continue to fund our current operations we will be required to significantly reduce or cease operations altogether accordingly there exists a substantial doubt about metal storms ability to continue as a going concern      furthermore as discussed below we raised a million in september  through the issuance of convertible notes that mature in september  we do not believe that we will have sufficient financing to pay the holders of the convertible notes at maturity in september  in midjune  we sent a proposal to holders of the convertible notes noteholders to be voted on at a special meeting on july   that if approved would      extend the maturity date of the convertible notes until september   and        grant noteholders the option to exchange their convertible notes which are unsecured for the same principal amount of secured convertible notes      the secured notes would have the benefit of a fixed and floating charge over the assets of the company but they would not bear interest the noteholders who elect to hold the secured notes will also receive five  options for each seven  secured notes that they hold these options have an exercise price of a and expire on  september       under the convertible note trust deed trust deed entered into with anz executors  trustee company limited trustee on july   which governs the convertible notes an affirmative vote of  of the holders of the outstanding convertible notes is required to effect an amendment extending the maturity date accordingly the aforementioned proposal to noteholders requires an affirmative  vote the proposal was formulated upon discussions with harmony investment fund limited harmony the largest holder of our convertible notes as of june   harmony held approximately  of the outstanding convertible notes and they have indicated that they will vote in favour of the proposal there can be no assurance however that we will obtain the necessary number of votes from our noteholders to approve the proposal and extend the maturity date      in addition to the required affirmative vote of  of the holders of the convertible notes discussed above the australian securities exchange the asx on which our ordinary shares are listed has determined that a vote of the shareholders of metal storm is also required in order to effect an extension of the maturity date of the convertible notes a shareholder meeting will also be held on july   to seek their approval for among other items the extension of the convertible notes and the issuance of the options to noteholders who elect to hold the secured notes each matter is put to the shareholders for consideration as a separate resolution a vote of greater than  of holders of ordinary securities is required to pass each resolution there can be no assurance that a majority of our shareholders will approve the resolution extending the maturity date of the convertible notes the approval of the noteholders to the extension of the maturity date is conditioned upon shareholders also approving the extension or a subsequent determination by the asx that shareholder approval is not necessary if we fail to obtain shareholder approval and the asx does not subsequently determine that shareholder approval is unnecessary our efforts to extend the maturity of the existing convertible notes will fail and we will require outside funding to repay our obligations under the convertible notes at maturity as the principal amount of the convertible notes greatly exceeds our current cash reserves it is highly unlikely that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to pay the convertible notes on their existing maturity date and  accordingly substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern  table of contents      in addition to seeking finance for our current operations and pursuing an extension of the maturity date for our convertible notes we recently pursued a small injection of capital from our current shareholders in australia and new zealand through a share purchase plan the spp as part of an overall restructuring of our finances the spp opened on june  closed july  and subscriptions for approximately a million of shares were received the settlement of the spp however is conditioned on an affirmative vote by the holders of our convertible notes and holders of our ordinary shares to extend the maturity date and there can be no assurance that the maturity date of the convertible notes will be extended      even if we are able to extend the maturity date of the convertible notes and successfully consummate the capital raising of a million through the spp we will still require financing in the future to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital to continue our operations if we do not have reasonable grounds to believe that we will be successful in our efforts to obtain sufficient financing to continue to fund our operations we will be required to appoint an administrator      overall if we are unable to effect any of the parts of our restructuring plan there would be substantial doubt as to whether metal storm would continue as a going concern and therefore whether metal storm would realize the value of its assets and extinguish its liabilities in the normal course of business and at the amounts in the financial statements no adjustments have been made to the financial statements relating to the recoverability and classification of the assets carrying amounts or classification of liabilities that might be necessary should metal storm not continue as a going concern we may be required to redeem convertible notes before maturity which redemption could cause us to become insolvent      in september  we raised a million under a rights offer of unsecured convertible notes rights offer in australia and new zealand the convertible notes mature in september  at which time metal storm must repay the face value of any convertible notes unless a noteholder has elected to convert them into ordinary shares in connection with the rights offer metal storm entered into the trust deed on the occurrence of a default event under the trust deed metal storm must if required by the trustee redeem all convertible notes outstanding by payment of the face value of the convertible note together with all accrued but unpaid interest      in the event of early redemption of the convertible notes metal storm would have to raise funds to meet such obligations it is likely that it will not be able to do so in a timely manner or at all in which case metal storm could become insolvent we may need additional capital and may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms if at all      metal storm will likely require additional capital by the third quarter of  to fund product development programs andor to pay our convertible note debt in addition we may seek to exploit business opportunities that will require us to raise additional capital from equity or debt sources in particular developing and commercializing new technology and products to develop our business could require a significant commitment of additional resources that could in turn require us to obtain additional funding we may also require further funds to pursue regulatory clearances prosecute and defend our intellectual property rights develop marketing capabilities and fund operating expenses      our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors including market conditions and our operating performance these factors may render the timing amount terms and conditions of additional financing unattractive for us the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in dilution to our existing stockholders additional debt could result in increased expenses and could result in further covenants that would restrict our operations we cannot be certain that we will be able to raise any required funding or capital on favorable terms or at all if we do not have reasonable grounds to believe that we will be successful in our efforts to obtain sufficient financing to continue to fund our operations we will be required to appoint an administrator      we have incurred operating losses in each year since our inception we had net losses of a million a million and a million for the years ended december    and  respectively we expect to incur additional operating losses over the next few years our profitability is dependent on our ability alone or with others to complete the successful product engineering of our technology obtain any required regulatory clearances and commercialize our products we cannot be certain if or when we will achieve profitability or positive cash flow we are in the product engineering phase and do not yet have any product for sale based on our core technology      most of our technology requires further research development testing and possibly regulatory approval prior to any commercial sales metal storm does not currently derive any revenue from the commercial sale of any applications of our technology we cannot be sure of the extent to which the technology or any products we develop will be able to penetrate the potential markets for defense or commercial applications or gain market acceptance  table of contents we cannot be certain of market acceptance of our technology or the rate of any market acceptance      we plan to develop our technology for use in a range of military law enforcement counterterrorism and commercial applications it is not yet known whether our technology will be accepted in the market for any of these applications or the rate of any market acceptance the degree of market acceptance will depend on a number of factors including the receipt and timing of any regulatory approvals the establishment and demonstration of the need safety efficacy and costeffectiveness of our technology and products and our technologys advantages over existing technologies it is not yet known whether we will be able to fully develop or commercialize our technology and products even if they perform successfully in research and evaluation trials we are dependent on retaining key personnel      there is competition among defense development companies for qualified technical employees and retaining and attracting qualified individuals is critical to our success the responsibility of overseeing day to day management and the strategic management of metal storm is concentrated amongst a small number of key people the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon metal storm as we may not be able to recruit replacements for the key personnel within a short timeframe any catastrophic event involving our technology could adversely affect metal storms reputation      any catastrophic accident involving the testing of our technology or the use of products that are developed utilizing our technology could severely damage metal storms reputation marketing ability and results of operations we work on research and development programs      some of our technology applications progress in collaboration with us and australian government defense research and development program support we have obtained such support from both the us and australian governments we have entered into agreements with the departments of defense of these countries that provide conditions to the funding of research and development grants for example generally we are required to achieve certain milestones with respect to the development of our technology prior to receiving payment under the agreements in addition we have granted exclusive licensing rights under certain agreements and we are also in some circumstances required to repay money received under the agreements further although the australian programs provided for funding contributions by consortium members we have received no direct funds from these programs if metal storm is unable to continue existing research and development programs or to enter into new research and development programs if there is a decrease of available funding in respect of such programs or if the us or australian governments choose to exercise powers available to them under export control regulations to control the export of metal storm technology or products developed from it this could have a material adverse affect on us there are some limitations relating to our technology      in its usual configuration the metal storm technology stacks a number of projectiles in each barrel and a quantity of propellant or gunpowder is located in a space that separates the projectiles as a result barrels may be longer and therefore heavier to hold the additional propellant that may be required to support our technology for these reasons the development risk of our technology increases as the operating pressure of the system increases furthermore unlike conventional gun systems which are mechanical in operation our technology is reliant on a  electronic fire control system electronic systems may be adversely affected by electromagnetic interference failure to design the electronics systems to minimize susceptibility to natural or manmade electromagnetic interference may result in unplanned and potentially catastrophic failure of our technology the extent to which these factors will affect the development of and the practical applications of our technology is uncertain we may not have adequate protection for our intellectual property      we principally rely upon patents trade secret copyright and contract law to protect our proprietary technology we cannot be certain that any protective measures we have taken will be adequate to protect our proprietary technology many of the laws of foreign countries treat the protection of proprietary rights differently from and may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do laws in australia the united states and patent cooperation treaty countries in addition the laws of many countries including australia and the united states provide governments with the ability to control or restrict the use of defense technologies      patent matters involve complex legal and factual questions accordingly we cannot predict the availability and breadth of claims sought in relation to patents statutory differences in patentable subject matter may limit the protection we can obtain for some of our inventions or prevent us from obtaining patent protection which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  table of contents      additionally the enforceability of a patent is dependent on a number of factors which may vary between jurisdictions these factors may include the novelty of the invention the requirement that the invention not be obvious in light of prior art including prior use or publication of the invention the utility of the invention and the extent to which the patent clearly describes the best method of working the invention      while we have obtained and continue to seek patent protection for our technology we cannot be certain that      any of the pending or future patent applications filed by us or on our behalf will be approved        we will develop any additional proprietary products or processes that are patentable or        third parties will not independently develop similar products or processes duplicate any of the products or processes we have or are developing relating to our technology or design around the patents we own with competitive advantages      furthermore we cannot be certain that patents held by third parties will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology or that third parties will not challenge or seek to narrow invalidate or circumvent any of our issued pending or future patents protecting our proprietary technology from infringement by others may affect our business      we may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights this could result in substantial costs to us and divert efforts from our business we may have to participate in opposition proceedings before the australian patent office or a foreign patent office or in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention of patent applications filed by competitors any such litigation interference or opposition proceeding regardless of the outcome could be expensive and time consuming and adverse determinations in any such proceedings could prevent us from developing manufacturing or commercializing our technology or products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations      in addition to patent protection we rely on unpatented trade secrets knowhow and proprietary technological innovation and expertise which are protected in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees advisers and consultants we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our unpatented proprietary intellectual property will not otherwise become known or independently discovered by competitors we also cannot be certain that relevant inventions will not be developed by persons not bound by such agreements we may be subject to patent infringement claims from our competitors and other third parties      our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to avoid infringing on patents issued to others although we are not aware of any action or threatened action alleging patent infringement or improper use of proprietary information by us if we have to defend any such claims we could incur substantial costs and our management resources could be diverted this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations      if we were found to be infringing any third party patents we could be required to pay damages alter our products or processes obtain licenses or cease certain activities we cannot be certain that if we required licenses for patents held by third parties that they would be made available on terms acceptable to us if at all to the extent that we required such licenses for the development of our technology and we were unable to obtain them we could be foreclosed from the development manufacture or commercialization of technology or products requiring such licenses or encounter delays in product introductions while attempting to design around such patents this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the australian and us governments may take action on patent applications and patents      under the provisions of the patents act  commonwealth of australia patents act the commonwealth of australia has the right to exploit or authorize others in writing to exploit an invention for the services of the commonwealth of australia at any time after a patent application has been made the remuneration and terms for exploitation are determined by agreement between the person entitled to the benefit of the patent application or the persons nominee and the commonwealth of australia if there is no agreement the determination is made by a prescribed court      under the provisions of the patents act a patent or a patent application may also be acquired by the commonwealth of australia in that instance all rights in the patent or the patent application vest in the commonwealth of australia compensation must be paid in an amount to be agreed between the person entitled to be compensated and the commonwealth of australia if there is no agreement the amount of compensation is determined by a prescribed court as such an acquisition clearly involves an acquisition of property the terms of that acquisition must be just within the meaning of the australian constitution  table of contents      the patents act also allows the commissioner of patents on the direction of the relevant minister of the commonwealth of australia to prohibit or restrict the publication of information about the subject matter of a patent application while any such order is in force the complete specification of the application is not open to public inspection acceptance must not be notified and a patent must not subsequently be granted as a result if the commonwealth of australia were to take action on one or more of our patents under the patents act we may not be able to exclusively commercially exploit such patents in the way we currently intend additionally the compensation we receive in connection with such actions may be significantly less than what we would receive if we were to retain full rights to the patent      under the us patent act the us government may use an invention described in and covered by a us patent without license of the owner where this occurs the owners only remedy is an action against the us government for the recovery of reasonable and entire compensation for the use and manufacture of the invention      under the us patent act if one of the authorized offices of various government agencies identified under the act holds the opinion that publication or disclosure of an invention described in a patent application would be detrimental to the national security the commissioner of patents being so notified shall order that the invention be kept secret and also withhold the publication of the application or the grant of a patent for such period as the national interest requires the owner of an application that has been placed under a secrecy order shall have the right to appeal from the order to the secretary of commerce an applicant whose patent is withheld shall have the right to apply for compensation for the damage caused by the order of secrecy      it is also possible that countries other than australia or the united states could take action that may impact upon our patents and patent applications any actions on our patents by the governments of australia the united states or other countries could affect our ability to protect our technology and our ability to effectively commercialize our technology this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are obligated to perform some construction contracts at a fixed price which could turn out to be less than our costs      we perform systems integration work for third parties under contracts several of our construction contracts are bid on a fixed price basis as such there is inherent risk that our actual costs to perform the contracted job could exceed the agreed upon fixed price which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there are potential adverse effects from competition and technological changes      the defense industry market is highly competitive and can be subject to significant technological change large wellestablished defense companies are engaged in research and development and have considerably greater resources than metal storm to develop applications for defense technology we cannot be certain that our competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which we are developing or which would render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive much of the research being conducted on defense technology is funded principally by government agencies in the united states we compete with such other companies for government resources allocated to such research and development projects there are existing defense companies that may have target markets similar to if not the same as ours such companies may be developing their own technology and products which may ultimately compete with ours this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition      the defense industry market is characterized by changing technology evolving industry standards introductions and enhancements and changing customer demands these market characteristics are exacerbated by the nature of the defense industry accordingly metal storms success may depend on our ability to adapt to changing technologies our ability to adapt our technology to evolving industry standards and to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our technology in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive product offerings if we fail to adapt to such changes and evolution this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition      there are existing companies that may have target markets similar to if not the same as ours such companies may be developing their own technology and products which may ultimately compete with ours our technology may be perceived by our competitors as threatening existing markets and therefore may be resisted as a result we cannot be certain that we will be successful in commercializing our technology or that we will be able to penetrate the potential markets for our products there may be reductions or changes in military expenditures      we anticipate that our primary customers will be the us and australian governments the agencies of the us and australian governments departments of defense the us department of justice and the global defense industry our markets may be limited by us and australian government requirements pertaining to foreign markets we also cannot predict future levels of defense spending with certainty and declines in military expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition the impact of possible  table of contents declines in the level of defense procurement on our results of operations and financial condition will depend upon the timing and size of the changes and our ability to mitigate their impact with new business business consolidations or cost reductions the loss or significant curtailment of a material program in which we participate could have a material adverse affect on our future results of operations and financial condition we are subject to government regulation      we are developing products for sale in the defense and law enforcement industries which are subject to extensive regulation this regulation may adversely affect our business for example products incorporating our technology are required to undergo rigorous testing as well as extensive regulatory approval processes these processes take significant time and require us to expend substantial resources delays in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the development and commercialization of our technology and products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations      we will need to obtain operating licenses and permits such licenses and permits may be difficult to obtain and retain depending on government policies customs changes in political leadership and other factors we cannot assure you that we will continue to be in compliance with any such licenses or permits or any other governmental requirements if we fail to comply with any such licenses or permits or any other governmental requirements it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations      products to be manufactured using our technology may also be subject to government regulation including regulations governing use specification manufacture handling disposal packaging labeling transport and importexport in australia the united states and in each of the countries into which such products are intended to be exported see item b information on metal storm  business overviewregulation for a discussion of government regulations that we are subject to in australia and the united states      compliance with government regulation requires us to allocate resources to monitoring compliance training security of goods reporting and reviewing legislative and other changes to ensure we are complying with the relevant regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate failure to comply with government regulations could result in our inability to sell our products in those jurisdictions there are risks inherent in us government contracts      we expect that a significant portion of our sales will be associated with contracts and programs for the us government in which there are significant inherent risks including risks particular to the defense industry the primary risks relate to      contract termination      any contracts we may enter into with the us government may be subject to termination by it either for its convenience or in the event of a default by us as the contractor termination for convenience provisions may only provide for the recovery by us of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination termination for default provisions may render us liable for excess costs incurred by the us government in procuring undelivered items from another source      loss of appropriations      us government contracts are usually conditional upon the continuing availability of us congressional appropriations congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may take more than one year consequently at the outset of a major program the contract is usually partially funded and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as appropriations are made by congress for future fiscal years in addition most us government contracts are subject to modification in the event of changes in funding any failure by congress to appropriate additional funds to any program in which we participate or any contract modification as a result of funding changes could materially delay or terminate such program and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition      procurement and other related laws and regulations      if we enter into contracts with the us government we may be subject to extensive and complex us government procurement laws and regulations these laws and regulations provide for ongoing us government audits and reviews of contract procurement performance and administration failure to comply even inadvertently with these laws and regulations and with laws governing the export of munitions and other controlled products and commodities and any significant violations of any other us federal law could subject us to potential contract termination civil and criminal penalties and under certain circumstances suspension and debarment from future us government contracts  table of contents for a specified period of time any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition      protection of proprietary technology      if we enter into us government contracts and in particular contracts that involve modification or development of our technology or products we may face a risk that the us government would seek to assert farreaching rights to our inventions and technology such assertions could compromise our competitive position      changes and adjustments      the us government often directs changes in contract work particularly in the case of products under development recovery of additional costs and profit attributable to the changed work may require a protracted effort that could adversely affect our cash flow      competitive bidding and domestic preferences      we may need to obtain military contracts through either competitive bidding or solesourced procurement we cannot be certain that we will be successful in having our bids accepted or if accepted that awarded contracts will be profitable we may be disadvantaged in competing for contracts by laws and regulations that give preference to firms that offer products manufactured in the united states or to small or minorityowned businesses we may also be disadvantaged by regulations limiting the access of nonus citizens to classified information of the us government or the use or storage of such information at facilities outside the united states we have organized metal storm inc our us subsidiary as a us owned small business as defined by applicable us department of defense requirements which allows metal storm inc to contract directly with us government and defense agencies in accordance with us department of defense requirements our other us subsidiary metal storm usa limited is  owned by us and was formed to contract with both us government agencies as well as nongovernment defense contractors      additionally inherent in either procurement process is the risk that if a bid is submitted and a contract is subsequently awarded actual performance costs may exceed the projected costs upon which the submitted bid or contract price was based to the extent that actual costs exceed the projected costs on which bids or contract prices were based our potential profitability could be materially adversely affected we may have product liability exposure in the future      the testing marketing and sale of our technology may result in products that are used in situations that may result in serious permanent bodily injury or even death to those involved a person injured in connection with the use of our products may bring legal action against us to recover damages on the basis of claims including personal injury wrongful death negligent design dangerous product or inadequate warning we may also be subject to lawsuits involving allegations of misuse of our products if successful personal injury misuse and other claims could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition there can be no assurance that adequate or necessary insurance coverage will be available or will be obtained to limit our product liability exposure we may be dependent on third party manufacturers suppliers and teaming partners      we currently do not have any manufacturing capabilities in the future we may be required to enter into contracting arrangements with third party manufacturers in order to manufacture our products for largescale laterstage testing if we need to use a third party to manufacture all or a portion of our products we cannot be certain that we will be able to enter into satisfactory arrangements with such contract manufacturers if at any time we are unable to maintain or expand as necessary or contract for manufacturing on acceptable terms our manufacturing capabilities and our ability to conduct tests with our products will be adversely affected resulting in delays in submissions for regulatory approvals      we may also need to develop manufacturing resources enter into collaborative arrangements with other parties who have established manufacturing capabilities or have third parties manufacture our products on a contractual basis we cannot be certain that we will have access on acceptable terms to the extensive additional financing qualified personnel and relevant technologies that would be required in order for us to scaleup production and develop effective commercial manufacturing processes and technologies or that we will be able to enter into collaborative or contractual arrangements on acceptable terms with parties that will meet our requirements in respect of quality quantity and time lines  table of contents      in addition we may be dependent upon suppliers of parts for our projectile launching systems and teaming partners with whose weapons platforms our systems may be integrated any failure in delivery or performance by these third parties could cause a delay in the development or commercialization of our systems our share price has

the research design development and integration of projectile launching systems utilizing our electronically initiated  stacked projectile technology for use in the defense homeland security law enforcement and industrial markets strategy      we are focused on developing and qualifying two mm calibre weapons systems plus one mm calibre weapons system that together could offer substantial differentiated benefits to military and law enforcement users      in addition we pursue contracts with military customers and major defense contractors where our unique stacked projectile launching technology and component weapon systems can be applied for specific enduser requirements and where these contracts may open up opportunities for metal storm weapon sales      over the past year we have seen a significant increase in us military interest in lesslethal weapons technology giving the soldier the option to respond to a threat with lethal or lesslethal force when placed in complex urban conflict or peacekeeping missions may reduce civilian casualties our multibarrel stacked round weapons can provide instantly selectable lethal or lesslethal munitions giving a clear advantage to metal storm in this emerging market      we have entered into a number of strategic partnerships with major companies including singapore technologies kinetics stk irobot electro optic systems and defence technologies inc where partners provide capabilities such as manufacturing complementary technology or access to markets in areas where metal storm is not currently active      in particular we signed a joint collaboration agreement with stk with the specific objective being to collaborate in the design development testing qualification manufacture of prototypes and demonstration weapons and munitions as well as the commercial production and marketing of munitions and selected metal storm ballistic weapons this agreement provides us with a wellqualified partner to bring our weapons and munitions though the remaining stages to product sale and delivery      to help us achieve these goals we have populated metal storm with highly qualified professional staff with specific skills and experience in required areas built a strong team of engineers and scientists to focus on the accelerated development of potential products and increased our business development activities in key us defense and homeland security markets and selected international markets       engineering      we have maintained and improved our engineering organization during  a primary goal was to transition the team from concept research and development team to adopt the disciplines of product design testing and qualification suitable for military standard production weapons development this included the enhancement of existing engineering processes configuration and change control as well as the adoption of more rigorous quality control on manufactured items to ensure the validity of test results against design specification      the metal storm engineering team has benefited from enhanced access to stk ballistics engineers safety and certification specialists manufacturing facilities and firing ranges through the stk joint collaboration agreement extensive design testing and firing was performed throughout  both in australia and singapore with the aim of bringing the mm high explosive ammunition and gl to a qualified standard appropriate for military trials while improving the cost of manufacture in addition we made major advances in systems safety analysis and procedures to ensure that material potential risk on any aspect of the weapon system was discovered documented and actions taken to bring the risk to an acceptable level prior to qualification tests being carried out      in parallel with this our us based engineering team continued to advance the maul firestorm and lesslethal munitions development in harmony with its us military contract obligations particular highlights were the successful provision of firestorm and  table of contents a range of lesslethal munitions to the us marines for testing and progress on an enhanced maul design for a development contract with the office of naval research a number of additional test firings were carried out in  including a public demonstration of the maul proof gun at the ndia show in dallas texas and a shot volley of live chemical payload rounds from firestorm at a target range of  metres       business development      our business development strategy continues to be focused on winning commercial contracts for the supply and integration of weapons systems that employ metal storm technology the majority of business development effort is in the united states where there is a substantial defense research and development industry however opportunities are being sought in the middle east asia and europe      where possible we seek contracts where we can leverage our technology developments in the mm and mm arena we have expanded our market scope to include law enforcement and homeland security agencies in particular for the maul and the lesslethal applications of firestorm we expect to see demand for mm systems for lightweight accessory weapons for ground troops and law enforcement personnel and as armament for small robotic air and land vehicles      in  we engaged eh group a business development and marketing consultancy specialising in us defense markets eh group has actively pursued potential weapons programs and has enhanced our presence with the us military and other defense contractors      during  we broadened our us and international exposure through conferences and trade shows including the singapore airshow eurosatory ndia us national guard show us modern day marine show the association of the us army ausa exposition with the first weapons nearing qualification shaping the global market is an important step in the sales process      as a key element of our business development strategy we conduct live fire trials and demonstrations to showcase the technical and operational capabilities of our technology and prototype products these trials also serve an engineering purpose providing essential performance data for design enhancement typically we aim to conduct these demonstrations for a select audience of members of the military and defense industry through the demonstrations and with feedback from the audience members we are made aware of additional requirements dictated by the projected enduser environment we are also able to better assess logistical requirements for increased reliability and supportability and means to minimize production costs       technology      metal storms core technology is an electronically initiated stacked projectile launching system that removes the mechanisms and shortens the time normally required to fire projectiles by conventional means the core technology has been demonstrated in launching systems ranging from mm to mm and from low velocity to high velocity and can theoretically be applied to much wider range of calibres however we have focused our design and development efforts on a low velocity mm launching system and incorporated upgraded versions of the system into our gl firestorm and redback weapon systems      the upgraded version of the low velocity mm grenade launching system has the potential to be used in multibarrel arrays retrofitted alongside conventional mm weapons this provides a hybrid weapon system with multiple munition types utilizing the existing mount targeting and aiming system of the conventional weapon it also offers the user a considerable increase in the firepower and versatility of their existing weapon stations at comparatively low cost      in relation to the stacked projectile nature of the launching system the only parts that move in metal storms technology are the projectiles contained within the barrels multiple projectiles are stacked one behind the other in the barrel and the technology allows each projectile to be fired sequentially from the barrel by electronic initiation of the propellant load each projectile has its own propellant load so that the leading projectile can be reliably fired without causing unplanned blowby ignition of the following projectiles and without collapse of the projectile column in the barrel metal storms fully loaded barrel tubes are essentially serviceable weapons without the need for a traditional ammunition feed or ejection system breech opening or any other moving parts these barrels can be effectively grouped in multiple configurations to meet a diversity of applications      metal storms technology is ideally suited to the new generation of network centric weapons that are designed to fully integrate with todays digitally controlled battlefield importantly metal stormenabled systems are capable of local or remote operation through computerized fire control systems  table of contents      our technology has the following features and benefits      electronically programmable rates of fire from single shots to ultrarapid rates        no moving parts resulting in increased reliability and availability because there is less maintenance required and decreased possibility of malfunction        increased firepower to weight ratio resulting in a lighter weapon system with greater firepower compared to conventional systems        modular pods that could operate as a complete weapons system in one container        digital electronic operation        ideally suited to mounting on robotic and remotely operated platforms        the potential of grouping multiple calibres and multiple lethalities in one gun system allowing the user to vary the use to a specific situation and        numerous hybrid configurations and special forces applications       joint collaboration agreement with singapore technologies kinetics      in february  metal storm entered into a joint collaboration agreement with stk to take our gl and mm ammunition to the manufacturing stage under the terms of the agreement metal storm and stk have agreed to collaborate in the design development testing qualification manufacture of prototypes and demonstration weapons and munitions as well as the commercial production and marketing of munitions and selected metal storm ballistic weapons that only use those munitions stk is contributing funds toward completing the demonstration and trial gl weapons and munitions the agreement is expected to result in munitions that are compatible with all of metal storms mm weapons and would allow metal storm to expand its operationallyready munitions to additional types the agreement terminates in december       in addition to development and manufacture stk may market distribute and support other metal storm weapons and munitions      in september  metal storm entered into an exclusive teaming agreement with stk for the development testing manufacture and marketing of munitions to be used in conjunction with metal storm projects the agreement terminates in december  unless terminated earlier by joint agreement of the parties or upon a default by one party the agreement provides that intellectual property that is developed solely by one party under the agreement will be owned solely by that party intellectual property that is developed through the collaboration of both parties will be owned solely or jointly by metal storm except for technology relating to the internal workings of the warheads which will be owned by stk each party is responsible for its own development costs under the agreement this teaming agreement is now incorporated under the joint collaboration agreement       internal product development      we are actively developing andor is in the process of certifying the following products      gl  semiautomatic three shot mm modular underbarrel grenade launcher        firestorm  four barrel  shot mm remotely operated weapon system        maul  semi automatic mm  gauge multishot accessory underbarrel launcher and        a range of mm and mm lethal and lesslethal ammunition      in conjunction with electro optic systems limited eos we have also developed redback a fast four barrel shot mm remotely operated weapons system the redback system is particularly suited to convoy protection and is designed to be capable of defending against rocketpropelled grenade rpg attacks during  metal storm performed only limited development on redback as most of metal storms initial development goals had been reached and eos target acquisition and tracking components were being developed by eos however technology developed for redback has also been incorporated into firestorm it is expected that further work on redback will be done once a specific customer is identified and contracted whereupon the product would be tailored to suit particular customer needs       gl      the gl was developed to overcome many of the deficiencies of existing mm shoulder fired grenade launchers most current mm underslung grenade launchers are single shot multishot grenade launchers are heavy bulky and in practice do not permit the soldier to also carry an assault rifle      single shot mm grenade launchers have several significant and obvious operational drawbacks in a firefight the mm grenade is a powerful weapon it has a psychological as well as physical impact on the enemy however often one shot is not enough and after the first round is fired the enemy can reposition while the soldier is reloading being able to keep eyeontarget and deliver a second and third round immediately onto a mobile enemy substantially increases the effectiveness of the weapon and potentially alters the outcome of the firefight  table of contents      the gl is a semiautomatic three shot underslung grenade launcher that can be fitted to a soldiers assault weapon it carries less than one pound additional weight penalty over a single shot m grenade launcher while providing three times the firepower before reloading this cannot be achieved using conventional weapons technology as the mechanical autoreload system would add many additional pounds and increase the size to the point where an underslung weapon would be impractical for the soldier on the battlefield      development of the gl has been underway for over two years key achievements during  included      successfully firing the weapon with stacked rounds while attached to an m assault rifle        successfully firing stacks of high explosive rounds        successful firing of hundreds of rounds of inert safearm and explosive test ammunition and        successful systems safety and certification review of the design process by nova defence an independent defense company      in february  after extensive development and testing as a part of the joint collaboration agreement with stk the gl achieved certification for safe manfiring using mm ammunition with nonexplosive warheads qualification for manfiring using mm high explosive ammunition will follow once the ammunition itself completes qualification a more ruggedised version of the gl is currently undergoing the final stages of development as part of a spiral development process once completed the enhanced gl will undertake the environmental and operational testing required to qualify it for military trials       redback      the redback weapons system is a multibarreled pod that is designed to detect a target slew into position and be fired at extremely high speeds the system includes detection acquisition and tracking electronics that are ultimately aimed at protecting vehicles from incoming rocketpropelled grenade attacks unlike other antirpg systems redback could be used as a conventional weapon for engaging conventional targets      redback is being developed in a consortium with eos which will supply the gimbal mount and acquisition and tracking electronics and st kinetics which will provide the ammunition the weapon components are being funded and developed by metal storm       firestorm      firestorm is a lightweight multibarrel mm remotely operated weapons system which metal storm is currently developing to fulfil multiple roles in urban conflict peacekeeping convoy and asset protection and civil crowd control environments by taking full advantage of metal storm developments in both lethal and lesslethal munitions firestorm could provide a greater flexibility for military forces law enforcement and security personnel      the separation of a weapon from its crew is an increasing characteristic of military operations whether mounted on the top of a vehicle on the corner of a building or boundary fence or on a robotic platform it is more difficult and dangerous for people to physically attend to a remote weapon during an engagement a jammed weapon can be a lethal liability      firestorm can be deployed on ground robots placed on vantage points for fixed asset and perimeter protection mounted on lightweight vehicles and used in both lethal and lesslethal operations firestorm guns have no moving parts in the firing sequence eliminating the potential for mechanical reload jamming the barrels can be hermetically sealed yet still be available for immediate remote firing as needed these together with the ability to select the ammunition type remotely at the time of firing reduce the likelihood of exposing personnel to potentially lethal enemy fire giving a potential competitive advantage to firestorm in this market      another distinguishing characteristic of firestorm is its instantaneous firepower firestorm can deliver up to  high explosive grenades instantaneously onto the same target multiplying the target damage potential of the weapon      while firestorm is currently configured as a four barrel  shot system its major components are modular and could be reconfigured for other purposes with for example more barrels greater ammunition loads and even a combination of mm and mm calibres within the one weapon system      specific firestorm development has been in progress for  months building on the foundation of earlier four barrel weapons systems development including redback key achievements during  included      addition of laser ranging        addition of day visible sights        enhanced fire control systems  table of contents      addition of laser dazzler nonlethal response capability and        testing performed by us navy and us marine corps      in september  metal storm inc provided firestorm to the us marines for test firing by their personnel under a contract with the marine corps systems command lesslethal chemical payload rounds and frangible nose blunt impact chemical dispersion rounds were fired during the test during  metal storm inc expects to bid for further lesslethal programs within the us military using the firestorm weapons system       maul       the maul is an extremely lightweight  gauge accessory shotgun designed to fulfil a range of combat and law enforcement roles including door breaching lethal and nonlethal response and specialty payload delivery minimal size and weight are hallmarks of the maul maul tm is currently the lightest smallest automatic fire underbarrel shotgun in the world       gauge mm shotguns are in widespread use throughout the military law enforcement and other government agencies shotguns offer greater versatility than conventional assault weapons and are used to meet a range of special requirements including door breaching short range operations and engagements with lesslethal ammunition this versatility is set to extend as new ammunition types become available      a major issue with  gauge deployment is that it usually requires personnel to carry a separate additional weapon or sacrifice their primary weapon attempts to create shotgun attachments for assault rifles have been constrained by the weight and bulk of the required magazine and mechanical reload system metal storm has identified this as a unique opportunity for its technology hence the development of the maul      the maul incorporates unique metal storm stacked round technology eliminating the need for mechanical parts to reload the weapon between each shot its profile is slim consisting primarily of a cartridgebarrel tube plus a trigger and small battery housing it eliminates the bulky bolt action receiver and extended magazine of legacy systems and requires no manual action between shots      the maul was first conceived under a contract with the us marines warfighting laboratory a proof gun and  munitions were delivered to the us marines in may  the gun was successfully demonstrated at a public firing at the national defense industrial association ndia show in dallas texas in the same month in june  the office of naval research awarded a us contract to metal storm inc to continue the development of the maul and demonstrate a fully operational unit on an m rifle by may  the demonstration occurred as scheduled in may  and the project is expected to meet the delivery date       systems for unmanned vehicles      metal storm weapon systems are well suited to robotic vehicle applications as they are lightweight with all projectiles prestacked in the barrel additionally with the lack of mechanical parts associated with conventional reload systems the weapons are expected to be reliable and suitable for telerobotic applications      metal storm has already demonstrated such systems including a series of live fire demonstrations that were held at the us armys range facility at picatinny arsenal in new jersey in march  the demonstrations consisted of multiple live firings of a purposebuilt version of the metal storm mm weapon system mounted on a talon unmanned ground vehicle produced by foster miller      we have also worked with dragonfly pictures inc a us designermanufacturer of unmanned helicopters to weaponize a version of its dpx vertical take off and landing unmanned aerial vehicle demonstrations of this system were held in september       in october  metal storm entered into a memorandum of understanding with irobot a worldwide leader in the supply of military robots the firestorm weapon has been integrated with the irobot warrior robot this was successfully demonstrated to both the us army and us navy proving its ability to deliver mm lesslethal and lethal rounds from a remote robotic platform      metal storm continues to pursue opportunities for the application of its technology to unmanned robotic platforms       ammunition  table of contents      a number of ammunition natures for metal storm mm and mm systems have been under development            mm lethal ammunition      the low velocity mm lethal round program storm progressed well throughout  and work on the certification of test practice rounds for manfiring is now complete limited qualification testing for high explosive rounds is planned to commence in  the storm program is designed for full integration of the ammunition with the gl and firestorm weapon systems and on completion will allow us to demonstrate the enhanced capability of  rounds of high explosive warheads being man fired from a gl            mm lesslethal ammunition      substantial work has been carried out in  on a number of lesslethal ammunition types the challenge with lesslethal projectiles is to keep weight down to maintain a less than lethal outcome while also incorporating the additional metal storm ignition and propellant systems within the projectile itself three main types of lesslethal mm ammunition have been developed and are under test blunt impact sponge rounds were successfully test fired at the beginning of  frangible nose blunt impact chemical dispersion rounds have also been adapted for metal storm launchers these rounds combine single target blunt impact with an area dispersion of an irritant or marker dye finally a chemical payload round was adapted for delivering tear gas or other payloads in stacked munition metal storm launchers the latter two round types were delivered as ammunition with firestorm for the marine corps systems command market research demonstration and all have been successfully demonstrated at other test firings through the second half of             mm  gauge ammunition      ammunition development for the maul is essential for the commercial success of the weapon metal storm developed and tested munitions technology to launch stacked frag  door breaching grenades from the maul in the first half of  additional mm maul munitions developed during  include solid projectile and blunt impact less lethal rounds several other projectile natures are currently being evaluated for adaption to the maul       fireworks      metal storm holds a number of patents relating to the formation of aerial images the fireworks research is intended to add value to this intellectual property initial development has demonstrated the ability to launch spinstabilize and light the fuse of fireworks projectiles in a stacked configuration there are currently no specific fireworks products under development       handgun      after thorough analyses of the state of our handgun technology the challenges of obtaining certification likely production and marketing costs the state of competition and market sensitivities and the time and funds required to successfully generate a product it is clear that the handgun in either its basic or smartgun form should not be our primary focus for internal investment at this time       external development programs      in addition to our internal product development programs we seek external funding from military and government agencies to develop products in collaboration with other parties       us navy sbir contract  metal storm active protection system      this contract was for the development of a remotely controlled active protection system for mounting on various types of unmanned ground vehicles it was funded through a phase ii small business innovation research sbir contract sponsored by the us navys space

competition      until we commercialize a product using our technology we continue to compete for technology research and development funding available through various areas that are administered by the us department of defense and other government agencies including for example under the sbir program      the commercial success of products that we develop will depend in part on competing products large wellestablished defense companies and other entities with collaborative arrangements with the government are also engaged in research and development and may have considerably greater

statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs in addition to historical information the following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates intentions expectations and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements see item d key information  risk factors and other forwardlooking statements in this annual report for a discussion of some but not all factors that could cause or contribute to such differences a operating results overview      we are a defense technology company that is involved in the research development and commercialization of projectile launching systems that utilize electronically fired stacked projectile technology in  we worked on several contracts with the us military and various private companies      in order to meet metal storms objectives to develop manufacture and market commercial products effectively we may require further funding until such time that product sales are of sufficient volume to generate positive cash flows from operations this has taken longer and has cost more than originally anticipated based on the expected levels of operating expenditures in order to continue its operations past mid metal storm will require additional sources of capital while metal storm has previously been successful in raising additional capital there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital to continue our operations if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to obtain sufficient financing to continue to fund our current operations we will be required to significantly reduce or cease operations altogether      we intend to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development as we transition our technology from proof of concept to product implementation most of our funding for our external development programs has come from capital raisings in australia we have also received revenue from grants and contracts under various government programs we fund our internal product development through our accumulated funds  table of contents      we have incurred net losses since our inception we recognized a net loss of a million a million and a million in the years ended december    and  respectively our accumulated losses from inception in  to december   are a million we expect to incur increasing losses in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in the research and development of our patented electronically initiated stacked projectile technology prior to entering into commercialization phase we expect that losses will fluctuate from period to period and that such fluctuations may be substantial as a result of among other things the results of our research and development programs the number of future prototypes we produce and test and potential design changes required as a result of testing we are approaching the latter stage of product development and do not expect any significant revenue from product sales until at least the second half of  while there has been significant interest in our proofofconcept demonstrations we cannot give assurance that we will manufacture or sell our products successfully or ever achieve or sustain profitability      refer to item d risk factors for further information on metal storms capital requirements and substantial doubt over our ability to continue as a going concern where we derive our revenue      in  and  our principal sources of revenue were construction contracts and interest income critical accounting policies      our discussion and analysis of our operating and financial review and prospects are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue assets liabilities and expenses we reevaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions      we believe the following are our critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements refer to footnote  on page f of this annual report for further information       revenue recognition      revenue is recognized and measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to metal storm and the revenue can be reliably measured the following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognized       sale of goods      revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably risks and rewards of ownership are considered passed to the buyer at the time of delivery of the goods to and acceptance by the customer and collectability of the selling price is reasonably assured       rendering of services      revenue is recognized when key milestones or deliverables specified within each agreement are achieved and accepted by all parties to the agreement no performance obligation with respect to the milestone or deliverables remains the arrangement fee is fixed and collectibility is reasonably assured for most of our contract service revenue arrangements revenue is recognized upon delivery of a report summarizing the findings of specified research activities requested by our customers for those contracts requiring acceptance of the delivery of our report by our customers we recognize revenue upon receipt of written acceptance or payment in lieu of written acceptance       construction contracts      construction revenue and expenses are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method unless the outcome of the contract cannot be reliably estimated where it is probable that a loss will arise from a construction contract the excess of total expected contract costs over total expected contract revenue is recognized as an expense immediately  table of contents      for fixed price contracts the stage of completion is measured by reference to labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of estimated total labor hours for each contract revenue from costplus contracts is recognized by reference to the recoverable costs incurred during the reporting period plus the percentage of fees earned      the percentage of fees earned is measured by the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs of the contract where the outcome of a contract cannot be reliably estimated contract costs are recognized as an expense as incurred and where it is probable that the costs will be recovered revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred       sharebased payment transactions      we provide benefits to employees including directors of metal storm in the form of sharebased payment transactions whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equitysettled transactions we currently provide these benefits through i shares and options issued to executives and employees as part of a remuneration package issued in accordance with the power contained in our constitution and ii the employee share option plan esop      the cost of these equitysettled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted the fair value is determined using a blackscholes model in valuing equitysettled transactions no account is taken of any performance conditions other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of metal storm limited market conditions the cost of equitysettled transactions is recognized together with a corresponding increase in equity over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date      the cumulative expense recognized for equitysettled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects i the extent to which the vesting period has expired and ii the number of awards that in the opinion of the directors of metal storm will ultimately vest this opinion is formed based on the best available information at balance date no adjustment is made for the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the determination of fair value at grant date comparison of annual results of operations        compared with        revenue revenue decreased by a from a in  to a in  due to reduced fees earned from construction contracts carried out by our us office and lower interest income of  as a result of lower average cash balances and lower interest rates      contract revenue was generated from seven contracts during  most of which were awarded prior to  but completed during the year       expenses total expenses decreased a  from a in  to a in  significant movements in expenses were      in  we had a fair value movement gain of a on the embedded derivative that reflects the movement in the fair value of the conversion option embedded in the convertible notes issued in  in  we had a fair value gain of a        foreign exchange differences changed from a loss of a in  to a gain of a in  this is due to the movement in the us dollars to australian dollars exchange rate over the year compared to the corresponding movement in the prior year        finance expenses increased a in  finance expenses primarily relate to the convertible notes that we issued in september  this increase predominately relates to the accretion expense on the convertible notes issued in  which were a in  and a in  the accretion expense is calculated using the effective interest rate method which increases the relative dollar value of the expense over time        impairment expense increased a in  this expense is related to the impairment of floating rate notes where the fair value decreased from a to a       net loss as a result of the foregoing our net loss increased from approximately a million in  to a million in  due to our continuing losses no income tax expense has been recognized  table of contents        compared with        revenue revenue increased by a from a in  to a in  due to higher fees earned from construction contracts carried out by our us office and higher interest income which increased by a to a as a result of higher average cash balances      contract revenue was generated from six contracts during  in addition we completed a longterm contract with starchase llc valued at us million while some revenue relating to this contract had been recognized in  no revenue was recognized in  because the terms of the contract provided for the delay of payment until        expenses total expenses decreased a million  from a million in  to a million in  significant movements in expenses were      employee expenses decreased a  from a in  to a in  due to a reduction in share based payments termination payments and staff restructuring        research and development expenses increased a  due to the increased costs of test firings associated with the performance milestones of the trust deed        professional fees decreased a  primarily due to a non recurring expense in  of a associated with a proposed capital raising that was terminated in         in  we had a fair value movement gain of a on the embedded derivative that reflects the movement in the fair value of the conversion option embedded in the convertible notes issued in  in  we had a fair value loss of a        finance expenses increased a in  finance expenses primarily relate to the convertible notes that we issued in september  accordingly interest and accretion expenses for  reflect the period from september to december whereas finance expenses in  reflect the full year       net loss as a result of the foregoing our net loss decreased from approximately a million in  to a million in  due to our continuing losses no income tax expense has been recognized effects of currency fluctuations      our functional currency and reporting currency is the australian dollar      in accordance with ifrs costs not denominated in australian dollars are remeasured in australian dollars when recorded at the prevailing exchange rates for the purposes of our financial statements consequently fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the australian dollar and us dollar currencies will affect our results of operations an increase in the value of a particular currency relative to the australian dollar will increase the australian dollar reporting value for transactions in that particular currency and a decrease in the value of that currency relative to the australian dollar will decrease the australian dollar reporting value for those transactions      the effect of foreign currency translation is reflected in our financial statements in the statements of changes in shareholders equity and is reported as accumulated translation reserve at december   the impact of the foreign currency translation was an accumulated reserve of a compared to accumulated reserve balance of a at december   the fluctuations are caused by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the australian dollar and the us dollar we have not entered into any hedging arrangements to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations b liquidity and capital resources       overview      we have incurred substantial losses since the formation of metal storm and anticipate incurring substantial additional losses over at least the next few years as we continue our research and development activities and conduct further trials of our technology our operations have been financed primarily from capital contributions by investors

notes to existing shareholders in australia and new zealand at the rate of one convertible note for every  existing ordinary shares held to raise gross proceeds of a million on september   under the rights offer the rights offer was made concurrently with the offer of one new share option for every two convertible notes allotted which resulted in  listed options being granted in addition  million options were granted to harmony or its nominees in consideration for a short term working capital facility of a million which was never drawn on by metal storm a further  million options were issued to harmony as payment for harmonys commitment to subunderwrite the rights offer up to a million      convertible notes bear interest at the rate of  per annum on the face value of a per convertible note over the term interest is payable quarterly in arrears the term of the convertible notes is three years from the date of issue unless converted into ordinary shares the maturity date of the convertible notes is september   at which time metal storm must repay the face value of a per convertible note to the noteholders unless noteholders have elected to convert some or all of their convertible notes into ordinary shares at a conversion price which is the lesser of a or  of the volume weighted average price of metal storms ordinary shares during the  business days immediately preceding the conversion date noteholders can elect to convert some or all of their convertible notes into ordinary shares at the beginning of each quarter at the maturity date and at certain other

renew the leases or purchase the assets at the completion of the lease term these finance leases are secured through a bank guarantee deposit these leases have since been paid out in full      in

     we expect that operating expenses will continue to be the principal use of our cash resources available cash resources are expected to provide us with sufficient capital to fund our operations through q  we will need to raise additional sources of funding before then and may seek it through equity or debt financings the sale of additional equity or convertible debt could result in dilution to our shareholders additional debt would result in additional expenses and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations      our convertible notes mature in september  we are in discussions with our largest holder of our convertible notes harmony investment fund limited to formulate a proposal to put to the holders of our convertible notes to extend the maturity date of the convertible notes this proposal would require various consents and approvals including existing noteholders and potentially shareholder approval there can be no assurance that the maturity of the existing convertible notes will be extended in addition we are seeking to raise additional capital      as of june   metal storm had approximately a million in cash without a capital injection metal

requirements with the australian securities exchange listing rules providing generally for prior shareholder approval in numerous circumstances including i issuance of equity securities exceeding  of

retroactive      in this section a us holder means a beneficial owner of adss or ordinary shares that is for us federal income tax purposes      an individual who is a citizen or resident of the united states for us federal income tax purposes        a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or any state thereof or the district of columbia        an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source or        a trust the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a court in the united states and for which one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions      if a partnership holds adss or ordinary shares the us federal income tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership partners of partnerships that will hold adss or ordinary shares should consult their tax advisors       you should consult your tax advisor with respect to the us federal as well as state local and nonus tax consequences to you of an investment in adss or ordinary shares       ownership of adss in general      a beneficial owner of adss will be treated as the beneficial owner of the ordinary shares represented by such adss for us federal income tax purposes accordingly no gain or loss will be recognized by a us holder upon the exchange of adss for the ordinary shares represented by such adss a us holders tax basis in an ads generally will equal the cost of such ads to such us holder a us holders tax basis in the ordinary shares received upon an exchange of adss for ordinary shares will be the same as its tax basis in the surrendered adss and the holding period for ordinary shares received will include the period during which the holder held such adss       dividends      subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below us holders will include as dividend income gross amount of any distributions of cash or property without deduction for any withholding tax other than certain pro rata distributions of ordinary shares with respect to adss or ordinary shares to the extent the distributions are made from our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes a us holder will include the dividend income at the time of receipt which for a holder of adss generally will be the date of receipt by the depositary to the extent if any that the amount of any distribution by us exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits as so determined it will be treated first as a taxfree return of the us holders tax basis in the adss or ordinary shares and thereafter as capital gain dividends paid by us will not be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction generally allowed to us corporate shareholders      for taxable years beginning before january   certain dividends received by an individual us holder as well as certain trusts and estates from a qualified foreign corporation are eligible for preferential rates of taxation we believe that we are a qualified foreign corporation with respect to our ordinary shares because we should be eligible for benefits under the double taxation convention between australia and the united states the us treasury department has announced its intention to promulgate rules pursuant to which us holders of the ordinary shares or adss and intermediaries through whom such ordinary shares or adss are held will be permitted to rely on certifications from issuers to establish that dividends are treated as qualified dividends because such rules have not yet been issued it is not clear whether we will be in a position to comply with them a qualified foreign corporation generally does not include any foreign corporation that is a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or for the preceding taxable year because we likely were a passive foreign investment company for  as discussed below we do not expect to be a qualified foreign corporation for  even if we are a passive foreign investment company for  if we are a qualified foreign corporation with respect to adss or ordinary shares then dividends with respect to such shares generally would be eligible for the preferential tax rates except to the  table of contents extent that the individual  holds the relevant share of stock for  days or less during the day period beginning  days before the exdividend date or in the case of certain preferred stock  days or less during the day period beginning  days before the exdividend date as measured under section c of the code  is under an obligation whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property or  elects to treat the dividend as investment income for purposes of determining the amount of deductible investment interest under section db of the code further if an individual receives with respect to any share of stock an extraordinary dividend within the meaning of section c of the code eligible for the preferential tax rates any loss on a subsequent sale of the stock is treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of the extraordinary dividend      includible distributions paid in australian dollars including any australian withholding taxes will be included in the gross income of a us holder in a us dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt regardless of whether the australian dollars are converted into us dollars at that time if australian dollars are converted into us dollars on the date of receipt a us holder generally should not be required to recognize any foreign exchange gain or loss      if australian dollars so received are not converted into us dollars on the date of receipt the us holder will have a basis in the australian dollars equal to their us dollar value on the date of receipt any gain or loss on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the australian dollars generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to such us holder and generally such gain or loss will be income or loss from sources within the united states for foreign tax credit limitation purposes      dividends received by a us holder with respect to adss or ordinary shares will be treated as foreign source income which may be relevant in calculating the holders foreign tax credit limitation the limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income for these purposes dividends will be categorized as passive category income or in certain cases as general category income      subject to certain complex limitations a us holder generally will be entitled to a credit against its us federal income tax liability or a deduction in computing its us federal taxable income in respect of any australian taxes withheld by us a us holder who elects a deduction for australian taxes withheld by us must do so with respect to all foreign taxes paid or accrued in such taxable year      you should consult your tax advisor as to the consequences of australian withholding taxes and the availability of a foreign tax credit or deduction see australian tax considerationstaxation of dividends       sale or exchange of adss or ordinary shares      subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below a us holder generally will recognize gain or loss on a disposition including a sale exchange or redemption of adss or ordinary shares equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition and the us holders tax basis in the adss or ordinary shares this gain or loss will generally be longterm capital gain or loss if the us holder has held the adss or ordinary shares for more than one year and otherwise will be shortterm capital gain or loss longterm capital gains of individuals are eligible for preferential rates of taxation which have been reduced for longterm capital gains recognized on or after may   and before january   shortterm capital gains are taxed at the rates applicable to ordinary income which for gains recognized on or after may   and before january   are higher than the rates applicable to dividends for foreign tax credit limitation purposes gain or loss recognized upon a disposition generally will be treated as from sources within the united states the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations for us federal income tax purposes      you should consult your tax advisor regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit or deduction in respect of any australian tax imposed on a sale or other disposition of adss or ordinary shares see australian tax considerations  tax on sales or other dispositions of shares       passive foreign investment company status      the code provides special antideferral rules regarding certain distributions received by us shareholders with respect to and sales and other dispositions including pledges of shares of stock of a passive foreign investment company pfic a foreign corporation will be treated as a pfic for any taxable year if  or more of its gross income for the taxable year is passive income or the average percentage of its assets generally by value that produce or are held for the production of passive income is at least  passive income for this purpose generally includes among other things dividends interest rents royalties and gains from commodities and securities transactions in determining whether a foreign corporation is a pfic a prorata portion of the income and assets of each corporation in which it owns at least a  interest by value is taken into account  table of contents      we believe that we were a pfic for us federal income tax purposes in       and  but not in  and  metal storm could be a pfic again in       as noted above dividends received by an individual from a qualified foreign corporation are eligible for preferential rates of taxation a qualified foreign corporation generally does not include any foreign corporation that is a pfic for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or for the preceding taxable year      a us shareholder that holds stock in a foreign corporation during any taxable year in which the corporation qualifies as a pfic is subject to tax under the excess distribution rules unless the shareholder elects to treat the pfic as a qualified electing fund qef or makes a marktomarket election each as discussed below an excess distribution is a distribution with respect to pfic stock that exceeds  of the average of such distributions over the preceding threeyear period or if shorter the shareholders holding period for its shares excess distributions are allocated ratably to each day of the us shareholders holding period amounts allocated to the current taxable year and any years before the corporation was a pfic are currently included in gross income as ordinary income amounts allocated to other taxable years are taxed at the highest ordinary income tax rates in effect for those years and the tax for each such prior year is subject to an interest charge at the rate applicable to income tax deficiencies in addition the entire amount of any gain that a us shareholder realizes upon a sale or other disposition of shares in a pfic is considered an excess distribution subject to tax and interest as described above a us shareholder that acquires shares in a pfic from a decedent generally will not receive a steppedup fair market value tax basis in such shares but instead will receive a tax basis equal to the decedents basis if lower if a corporation is a pfic for any taxable year during which a us shareholder holds shares in the corporation then the corporation generally will continue to be treated as a pfic with respect to the shareholders shares even if the corporation no longer satisfies either the passive income or passive assets test described above unless the us shareholder terminates this deemed pfic status by electing to recognize gain which will be taxed under the excess distribution rules as if such shares had been sold on the last day of the last taxable year for which the corporation was a pfic      the excess distribution rules may be avoided if a us shareholder makes a qef election effective beginning with the first taxable year in the shareholders holding period in which the corporation is a pfic a us shareholder that makes a qef election is required to include in income its pro rata share of the pfics ordinary earnings and net capital gain as ordinary income and longterm capital gain respectively subject to a separate election to defer payment of taxes which deferral is subject to an interest charge a us shareholder whose qef election is effective after the first taxable year during the shareholders holding period in which the corporation is a pfic an unpedigreed qef election will continue to be subject to the excess distribution rules for years beginning with such first taxable year and prior to the year in which the qef election first becomes effective unless the shareholder elects to recognize as an excess distribution any gain that the shareholder would have recognized if the shares were sold on the first day of the first taxable year for which the qef election is effective although an option to acquire pfic stock generally is treated as pfic stock for purposes of the excess distribution rules a qef election with respect to a shareholders shares will not apply to the shareholders options if a shareholder that owns pfic shares subject to a qef election acquires additional shares pursuant to the exercise of an option the additional shares will be subject to the qef election but the election may be an unpedigreed qef election with respect to those shares      in general a us shareholder makes a qef election by attaching a completed internal revenue service irs form  to a timely filed taking into account extensions us federal income tax return for the year beginning with which the qef election is to be effective a us shareholder of a pfic must file an irs form  annually regardless of whether or not it makes a qef election in certain circumstances a us shareholder may be able to make a retroactive qef election in order for a us shareholder to make a valid qef election the corporation must annually provide or make available to the shareholder certain information a qef election can be revoked only with the consent of the irs metal storm does not provide to us holders the information required to make a valid qef election and makes no undertaking to provide such information in the future      as an alternative to making a qef election a us shareholder may make a marktomarket election with respect to its pfic shares if the shares meet certain minimum trading requirements a us shareholder that makes a marktomarket election will be required to include in income each year an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares that the shareholder owns as of the close of the taxable year over the shareholders adjusted tax basis in the shares the us shareholder will be entitled to a deduction for the excess if any of the shareholders adjusted tax basis in the shares over the fair market value of the shares as of the close of the taxable year provided however that the deduction will be limited to the extent of any net marktomarket gains with respect to the shares included by the us shareholder under the election for prior taxable years the us shareholders basis in the shares will be adjusted to reflect the amounts included or deducted pursuant to the election amounts included in income pursuant to a marktomarket election as well as gain on the sale or exchange of the shares will be treated as ordinary income the deductible portion of any marktomarket loss as well as loss on a sale or exchange of shares to the extent that the amount of such loss does not exceed net marktomarket gains previously included in income will be treated as ordinary loss  table of contents      the marktomarket election applies to the taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years unless the shares cease to meet applicable trading requirements or the irs consents to its revocation the excess distribution rules generally do not apply to a us shareholder for tax years for which a marktomarket election is in effect however if a us shareholder makes a marktomarket election for pfic stock after the beginning of the shareholders holding period for the stock a coordination rule applies to ensure that the shareholder does not avoid the tax and interest charge with respect to amounts attributable to periods before the election      a marktomarket election is available to a us holder only if the shares are considered marketable for these purposes shares will be considered marketable if they are regularly traded on certain us stock exchanges or certain nonus stock exchanges for these purposes shares will be considered regularly traded during any calendar year during which they are traded other than in negligible quantities on at least  days during each calendar quarter any trades that have as their principal purpose meeting these requirements will be disregarded it is not clear whether our adss or ordinary shares will meet the minimum trading requirements necessary to permit a us holder to make a marktomarket election with respect to them       us holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the effect on them of the pfic rules and the desirability of making and the availability of either a qef election or a marktomarket election with respect to our adss or ordinary shares metal storm provides no advice on your taxation matters the above should not be taken as advice by the reader of this document backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements      us backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements generally apply to payments to noncorporate holders of adss or ordinary shares information reporting will apply to payments of dividends on and to proceeds from the disposition of adss or ordinary shares by a paying agent within the united states to a us holder other than an exempt recipient including a corporation and certain other persons that when required demonstrate their exempt status a paying agent within the united states will be required to withhold at the applicable statutory rate currently  in respect of any payments of dividends on and the proceeds from the disposition of adss or ordinary shares within the united states to a us holder other than an exempt recipient if the holder fails to furnish its correct taxpayer identification number or otherwise fails to comply with applicable backup withholding requirements us holders who are required to establish their exempt status generally must provide irs form w request for taxpayer identification number and certification      backup withholding is not an additional tax amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a us holders us federal income tax liability a us holder may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service in a timely manner and furnishing any required information       the discussion above is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax considerations applicable to an investment in adss or ordinary shares you should consult with your tax advisor concerning the tax consequences to you in your particular situation       australian tax considerations      in this section we discuss the material australian tax considerations related to the acquisition ownership and disposal by the absolute beneficial owners of adss which are evidenced by adrs or ordinary shares this discussion is based upon existing australian tax law as of the date of this annual report which is subject to change possibly retrospectively this discussion does not address all aspects of australian income tax law which may be important to particular investors in light of their individual investment circumstances such as adss or shares held by investors subject to special tax rules for example financial institutions insurance companies or tax exempt organizations in addition this summary does not discuss any foreign or state tax considerations other than stamp duty prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the australian and foreign income and other tax considerations of the purchase ownership and disposition of the adss or shares this summary is based upon the premise that the holder is not an australian tax resident       nature of adrs for australian taxation purposes      adss held by a us holder will be treated for australian taxation purposes as held under a bare trust for such holder consequently the underlying ordinary shares will be regarded as owned by the ads holder for australian income tax and capital gains tax purposes dividends paid on the underlying ordinary shares will also be treated as dividends paid to the ads holder as the person beneficially entitled to those dividends therefore in the following analysis we discuss the tax consequences to nonaustralian resident holders of ordinary shares which for australian taxation purposes will be the same as to us holders of adss  table of contents       taxation of dividends      australia operates a dividend imputation system under which dividends may be declared to be franked to the extent of tax paid on company profits fully franked dividends are not subject to dividend withholding tax dividends payable by metal storm to nonaustralian resident shareholders will be subject to dividend withholding tax to the extent the dividends are unfranked dividend withholding tax will be imposed at  unless a shareholder is a resident of a country with which australia has a double taxation agreement under the provisions of the current double taxation convention between australia and the united states the australian tax withheld on unfranked dividends paid by us to which a resident of the united states is beneficially entitled is limited to  unless the shares are effectively connected to a permanent establishment or fixed base in australia through which the shareholder carries on business or provides independent personal services respectively      if a company that is a nonaustralian resident shareholder owns a  or more interest the australian tax withheld on dividends paid by us to which a resident of the united states is beneficially entitled is limited to        tax on sales or other dispositions of sharescapital gains tax      nonaustralian resident shareholders will not be subject to australian capital gains tax on the gain made on a sale or other disposal of our shares unless they together with associates hold  or more of our issued capital at any time during the five years before the disposal of the shares there are proposed changes to the current legislation which would exempt holdings of  or more of issued capital from australian capital gains tax at the present time it is uncertain when these proposed changes might take effect      currently a nonaustralian resident shareholder who owns a  or more interest would be subject to australian capital gains tax to the same extent as australian resident shareholders the australian taxation office maintains the view that australian capital gains tax is not limited by the double taxation convention between the united states and australia australian capital gains tax applies to net capital gains at a taxpayers marginal tax rate but for certain shareholders a discount of the capital gain may apply if the shares have been held for  months or more for individuals this discount is  net capital gains are calculated after reduction for capital losses which may only be offset against capital gains       tax on sales or other dispositions of sharesshareholders holding shares on revenue account      some nonaustralian resident shareholders may hold shares on revenue rather than on capital account for example share traders these shareholders may have the gains made on the sale or other disposal of the shares included in their assessable income under the ordinary income provisions of the income tax law if the gains are sourced in australia      nonaustralian resident shareholders assessable under these ordinary income provisions in respect of gains made on shares held on revenue account would be assessed for such gains at the australian tax rates for nonaustralian residents which start at a marginal rate of  some relief from australian income tax may be available to such nonaustralian resident shareholders under the double taxation convention between the united states and australia for example because the shareholder does not have a permanent establishment in australia      to the extent an amount would be included in a nonaustralian resident shareholders assessable income under both the capital gains tax provisions and the ordinary income provisions the capital gain amount would generally be reduced so that the shareholder would not be subject to double tax on any part of the income gain or capital gain       dual residency      if a shareholder were a resident of both australia and the united states under those countries domestic taxation laws that shareholder may be subject to tax as an australian resident if however the shareholder is determined to be a us resident for the purposes of the double taxation convention between the united states and australia the australian tax would be subject to limitation by the double taxation convention shareholders should obtain specialist taxation advice in these circumstances       stamp duty      a transfer of shares through trading on the australian securities exchange whether by australian residents or foreign residents is not subject to queensland stamp duty  table of contents       australian death duty      australia does not have estate or death duties no capital gains tax liability is realized upon the inheritance of a deceased persons shares the disposal of inherited shares by beneficiaries may however give rise to a capital gains tax liability       goods and services tax      the issue or transfer of shares will not incur australian goods and services tax f dividends

shareholders equity while transaction gains and losses have been reflected as components of income and loss transaction gains and losses could be material depending upon changes in the exchange rate relationships between the australian dollar and the us dollar see item a operating and financial review and prospects  operating resultseffects of currency fluctuations above for a detailed
