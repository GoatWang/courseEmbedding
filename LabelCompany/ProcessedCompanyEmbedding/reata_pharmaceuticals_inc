commercializing product candidates to address rare and lifethreatening diseases with few or no approved therapies by targeting molecular pathways that regulate cellular metabolism and inflammation  our lead product candidates bardoxolone methyl and omaveloxolone are members of a class of small molecules that target an important transcription factor called nrf to restore mitochondrial function reduce oxidative stress and resolve inflammation bardoxolone methyl in pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension due to interstitial lung disease bardoxolone methyl is currently being studied in a phase  trial known as catalyst for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease ctdpah as well as a phase  trial known as lariat for the treatment of pah and pulmonary hypertension due to interstitial lung disease phild in october  the first patient was enrolled in catalyst an international randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled phase  trial examining the safety tolerability and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in patients with ctdpah when added to standardofcare vasodilator therapy  the primary endpoint is the change from baseline in minute walk distance mwd relative to placebo at week   secondary endpoints include time to first clinical improvement as measured by improvement in world health organizationnew york heart association functional class increase from baseline in mwd by at least  or decrease from baseline in creatine kinase as a surrogate biomarker for muscle injury and inflammation by at least   the trial will enroll between  and  patients  data from catalyst are expected to be available during the first half of  because bardoxolone methyl was active in patients with ctdpah a fibrotic disease in earlier lariat cohorts we believe that bardoxolone methyl may be effective in phild patients  we are currently enrolling patients with phild caused by sarcoidosis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ctd and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia in the lariat trial in four separate groups in cohort   data have not been presented from cohort   we anticipate that data from phild patients in lariat will be available in the second half of  bardoxolone methyl in chronic kidney disease caused by alport syndrome bardoxolone methyl is also currently being studied in a single pivotal phase  trial known as cardinal for the treatment of chronic kidney disease ckd caused by alport syndrome  alport syndrome is a rare and serious hereditary disease with no currently approved therapies  reata has initiated the phase  portion of cardinal and enrolled the first patient in march   we have designed the trial in collaboration with international key opinion leaders the alport syndrome foundation and based on guidance from the fda  the phase  portion of the trial is openlabel and will test bardoxolone methyl in approximately  patients with a primary endpoint of egfr change at  weeks  these patients will be followed for two years with additional egfr measurements including at weeks  and  on drug and  and  after withdrawal of drug for four weeks  patients in the phase  portion of the trial will not be included in the phase  portion of the trial we have designed the phase  portion of the trial to support registration and the primary endpoint will be egfr change as compared to placebo at  weeks  the egfr change at one year will be measured after  weeks while the patient is on treatment and after withdrawal of drug for four weeks retained egfr  after withdrawal patients will be restarted on study drug with their original treatment assignments and will continue on study drug for a second year  the egfr change at two years will be measured also after  weeks while the patient is on treatment and after withdrawal of drug for four weeks retained egfr  if the trial is successful the year one retained egfr data could support accelerated approval under subpart h of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fdc act and the year two retained egfr data could support full approval under the fdc act  reata expects to have phase  data in the second half of  and to have the phase  one year withdrawal data in the first half of  omaveloxolone in rare neuromuscular diseases and immunooncology during the quarter reata advanced the clinical development of omaveloxolone a close analog of bardoxolone methyl that has improved bloodbrain barrier penetration  the company believes that it may benefit patients with various types of neuromuscular diseases because impaired mitochondrial function and chronic inflammation have been shown to be key features of many of these diseases  the company is initially targeting two rare and serious genetic diseases friedreich’s ataxia fa and mitochondrial myopathies mm  both trials are designed in two parts with the first part being doseranging and the second part designed to provide additional efficacy and safety data with the potential to be used to support registration we are evaluating omaveloxolone in patients with fa in the moxie trial  moxie is being conducted at sites in the united states europe and australia and we have recently finished enrollment in part one of the trial  part one enrolled  patients and focuses on the evaluation of safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone doses ranging from  mg to  mg  data for multiple endpoints are being collected with the part one primary efficacy endpoint being the change in peak work as measured by exercise testing on a recumbent bicycle  the key secondary endpoint in part one is a functional assessment based on the modified friedreich’s ataxia rating scale  data from moxie part one are expected in midyear  we are evaluating omaveloxolone in patients with mm in the motor trial  part one of the trial focuses on the evaluation of safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone doses ranging from  mg to  mg  data for multiple endpoints are being collected with the primary efficacy endpoint being the change in peak work as measured by exercise testing on a recumbent bicycle  the key secondary endpoint is the change from baseline in patients’ mwd  data from motor part one are expected in the second half of  the company is also conducting an openlabel phase b trial known as reveal to evaluate the safety pharmacodynamics and efficacy of omaveloxolone in combination with existing immunotherapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  the company is using omaveloxolone in combination with checkpoint inhibitors to restore an immune response against the tumor in the presence of so called myeloid derived suppressor cells mdscs  mdscs mask the tumor from the immune system by the production of mitochondrial ros  through this approach reata hopes to significantly increase the proportion of patients who respond to immunotherapy  data from reveal are expected during the second half of  about reata pharmaceuticals inc reata is a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company that develops novel therapeutics for patients with serious or lifethreatening diseases by targeting molecular pathways involved in the regulation of cellular metabolism and inflammation
