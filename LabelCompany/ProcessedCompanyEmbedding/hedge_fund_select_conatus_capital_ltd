sachs plays catchup with hedge fund offeringkatya wachtel and lauren tara lacapra min reada goldman sachs sign is seen on the floor of the new york stock exchange april  brendan mcdermidnew york reuters  goldman sachs group is taking a page from its wall street competitors in bringing a new hedge fund product to market the firm has begun offering its wealthiest customers the opportunity to invest in about a halfdozen hedge funds according to regulatory filings including wellknown names like brevan howard and jana partners without having to go to the funds themselves which require much higher minimum investments the new offering called hedge fund select is similar to products that other big brokers like morgan stanley citigroup inc and bank of america corps merrill lynch division have offered for many years but the model is new to goldman which has historically preferred to market its own hedge fund products or steer customers into a socalled fundoffunds that spreads money between an array of portfolios over the years some clients of goldman have complained that the firms own hedge funds have performed poorly while its outside hedge fund offerings were not as robust as those at other wall street firms with the new arrangement goldman clients who have  million or more with the investment bank can invest in the funds on the hedge fund select platform according to a person familiar with the product there is a minimum  investment in any single fund and goldman will earn a  percent fee on the money invested with any particular fund a big name hedge fund typically requires an investor to put in at least  million a bank that boasts a hedge fund platform can reduce the minimum investment needed because it pools all its customers money together into a single portfolio and wall street hedge fund platforms sometimes offer shorter redemption periods than the underlying funds so far  funds have been incorporated for hedge fund select which goldman began rolling out this summer regulatory filings with the us securities and exchange commission show that goldman has begun raising money for five funds and a person familiar with the situation said the firm may offer its customers as many as a dozen hedge funds to choose from goldman spokeswoman andrea raphael declined to comment goldman has been making subtle changes to its  billion asset management division for the past couple of years in an effort to boost profits as fees have declined and some of its own funds have struggled to produce big gains goldman sachs asset management gsam underwent a management overhaul last year and shuttered its global alpha fund after the quantitative fund lost more than  billion from its  peak the new hedge fund offering is being rolled out at a time when the hedge fund industry has lost its swagger as the smartest investors on wall street through the end of august hedge funds gained around  percent lagging well behind total returns of  percent in the benchmark sp  index according to credit suisse the effort by goldman appears to be getting off to a slow start an sec filing reveals that a hedge fund select portfolio that invests in a brevan howard fund had raised just  as of august and a hedge fund select portfolio that invests in an eminence partners fund had raised  million other managers on the hedge fund select platform that have already raised capital include bocage global resources a commodityfocused fund run by former caxton associates trader kurt billick and new yorkbased select equity group which specializes in trading stocks corsair capital and brigade capital management have also registered an entity with the gsam entity according to a filing with the sec the hedge funds goldman is offering to its customers either declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment the new hedge fund offering is consistent with the terms of the volcker rule which allows wall street firms to offer hedge funds but limits the amount of firm capital that can be invested in those funds reporting by katya wachtel and lauren lacapra editing by matthew goldstein jennifer ablan and tim dobbyn

how kensico capital increased aum  performance june   by shawn israilov share tweet share  share hedge fund trends hedge funds four major hedge fund trends from q  stan altshuller chief research officer each quarter after fs release we dig through the data to analyze the most recent trends in hedge funds read this post to learn more every quarter a few weeks after the f release we publish the top hedge fund trends gleaned from crunching filings data this time we’ll do something a bit different in addition to distilling the major developing themes from f data we’ll look at some general anecdotal a feared word at novus trends of the industry and add a bit of our own perspective let’s jump in headlines unfairly negative towards hedge funds the first trend we’ll talk about is that the negative news on the industry is reaching a feverish pitch if buffett’s advice to be greedy when others are fearful is any guide it should be a great time to consider adding to hedge funds most headlines are focused on the negative—fees performance excessive compensation and a few select pensions stepping away from the space it requires little effort to point out the industry’s obvious challenges and bad news sells better than laborious analysis now even hedge fund managers are issuing warnings about their own industry but few pundits are actually willing to dive deep under the hype and really assess the situation take for instance the fees of the hedge fund industry typically hedge funds charge a portion of the money they make performance fee and a smaller portion of the total money investors entrust them management fees to pay operational expenses the most common argument is that fees are too high but there is no such thing we live in a free economy with efficient markets and if fees were truly “too high” investors would redeem from their managers and elect to not pay any fees outright reinvesting the balance into nofee stocks and bonds no one’s holding them captive—there’s a product offering and there are buyers for the product at agreedupon terms barring fraud which is extremely rare everyone knows the risks going into the agreement this is not to say that there are no problems with the embattled  and  structure the issue in my view is a fundamental misalignment of interests between the manager and investor for smaller managers the performance fee is the more meaningful part of compensation and that can encourage excessive risk taking for larger managers the management fee swells to an amount where they’re disincentivized to take on large risk and perhaps unintentionally switch to asset gathering mode the goldilocks area where interest in growing and preserving capital are aligned is tiny and fleeting the solution to the industry’s dilemma is not straight forward but negotiations on fees need to be less hostile more informed and two sided versus investors simply demanding lower fees furthermore investor efforts are better placed in finding managers that will deliver higher future returns than in fee negotiations with lessskilled managers too much investor attention is spent on the  and  and not enough on the  and  speaking of which yet another criticism found commonly in the media is that of poor performance here we agree on some accounts but the argument has to be based on alpha not simply underperformance to us equities which is usually the case in a bull market they are hedge funds after all they run with lower exposure to the markets so bull market underperformance is fully expected even if the sp  is used as a benchmark performance is not so bad when viewed over a longer term more on this later also there are many examples of hedge funds doing exceedingly well as the dispersion between good and poor performers is widening the negative sentiment trend is unlikely to stop soon since many of the points harped on in the news are rooted in real issues that don’t have clear solutions but simply attacking the industry misses an important point there is a lot of value and opportunity in hedge funds and it takes some effort to effectively measure it we are privy to the inner workings of hundreds of hedge fund managers and are optimistic towards the future continuing in this vein let’s take a closer look at performance performance viewed over the long term will surprise you let’s talk about the  and  for the next trend postfees hedge funds indeed fared very poorly since the recession when compared to the us large caps as measured by the sp  here is the performance of the hfri equity hedge index against the sp  total return for march st  through end of april  long short equity funds underperformed the market by a wide margin albeit with lower volatility but who cares about volatility right well the same indices viewed over a longer period from  tell a different story now long short funds annualized in line with the market but with lower volatility and higher sharpe ratio and yes this is after all fees alpha is indeed under assault the media is right on at least one thing—it’s hard to ignore the trend of declining hf alpha for our third trend we’ll look at declining liquidity as it relates to sliding alpha through our work with thousands of manager portfolios we’ve learned that the majority of managers do generate consistent alpha through skill unfortunately all managers have areas of alpha drain in the investment process call these bad habits—the things to be acknowledged and avoided—since they account for a continuous drag on manager returns there are many ways managers leak alpha and we describe the five most common ones here lately however there has been a new foe crowding has been taking evergrowing chunks out of returns especially during derisking cycles and poor liquidity is a primary ingredient in crowding in our recent article “the liquidity deception”  we explore the indsutry’s failure to correctly figure crowding into liquidity measures allowing real liquidity to decline sharply in the next chart we compare two measures seldom thought of together the first in blue is the hfri equity hedge active premium annualzied to the sp  the second line in orange is the day liquidity of our own hfu comprised of  hf managers to be fair it’s not an “apples to apples” comparison since the liquidity metric is point in time and the rolling active premium has a lag built in still the general trend is telling managers divided into two camps evolve  double down after meeting with hundreds of hedge funds i can generalize them to two camps and they’re not divided by performance regardless of whether they’re up or down in the last  months some managers truly believe that what got them here will be enough to succeed in the future the “double down” managers are not really interested in selfanalysis since they believe that time is better spent on researching investment ideas even if they’re down massively they tend to buy more at cheaper prices and instead of looking critically at their investment process they isolate themselves in their comfort zones the “evolve” managers are constantly looking to improve—even if they’ve been investing for  years and are up comfortably for the year they believe that what got them here will not get them there in the future and look for new ways to evolve and even shock their current research processes they tend to question losing positions critically being brutally honest with themselves when their process can be improved of course for a portfolio intelligence company our clients are a biased set of managers all from the evolve camp those are the managers we want to partner with as we grow and thrive alongside them the best and worst hedge fund stocks q  as we pointed out in our previous report  was an extremely difficult year for hedge funds  didn’t start much better with the novus hedge fund universe falling through the end of february a stellar march where the hfu gained bps might indicate some green shoots nonetheless as our report shows  has all the indicators of another difficult year for funds with a mediocre history of stock

share hedge fund trends hedge funds the rise of quantitative hedge funds stan altshuller chief research officer in lieu of our normal top trends list we write to close out each quarter this time well focus on the biggest trend in  quant funds this past march machines once again demonstrated their superiority as google’s deepmind ai battered the reigning human world champion at go making it the latest classical board game to fall to machine dominance as the first selfdriving cars hit the streets and wall street adapts to roboadvisors a comparable divide grows among hedge funds quantitative strategies also known as “black box” for the mystery surrounding their algorithms have been growing in absolute and relative terms they’ve also recently been outperforming human counterparts attracting even more investor dollars market values controlled by machinebased algorithmic hedge fund strategies quants have more than tripled since  quants have also grown relative to their hedge fund peers they now control over  of total long market value for all hedge funds where it was only  in  that’s why in lieu of our normal list of trends wrapping up the most recent quarter we’ve dedicated the entire piece to this one distinct trend given the recent performance of these strategies relative to fundamental investors this trend is likely to continue even fundamentally driven managers are taking a new quantitative look at things funds are investing heavily in technology and risk management tools adding a “quant” element to augment their existing investment process these quantitative methods help with timing sizing and risk management our own clients use indepth novus analytics to squeeze out more and more alpha—despite shrinking opportunities—by optimizing their processes a word of caution maybe a word of caution is in order before we go full quant while we don’t know what might happen if selfdriving cars malfunction we do have a precedent for stocks when algorithms converge on sell signals this happened to quants in —a relative asset peak for the strategy as can be seen in the charts above in august of that year all quant models seemed to go haywire executing sell orders at the same time some believe the quants predicted the  crisis albeit a bit early the hectic two weeks of selling wreaked havoc even on unsuspecting fundamental managers who just happened to overlap the quants today quants have surpassed  peaks in assets and—even more importantly—daily volumes traded if another august  event occurs it’s critical for investors to know which stocks will feel a technical down thrust—at quants’ current numbers and trading levels  will seem like a cakewalk thankfully we’ve analyzed this possibility using something we call overlap analysis we took thirteen of the world’s most prominent quant funds renaissance citadel aqr and two sigma to name a few and calculated the overlap of their portfolios from public holdings while we do not know the workings of the black box algorithms we can see the results of their trading just like other asset managers the quants are required to file public disclosure forms – we tapped them to run this analysis it’s important to keep in mind the sheer size of these portfolios as well as the extraordinary position counts for each many of these funds hold more stocks than the russell  it turns out that quants are often attracted to the same stocks as the overlap values are high the above matrix shows a set of overlapping position values of for each manager pair a value of  for aqr and citadel denotes that after considering all the stocks that both managers are invested in and tallying up the minimum position sizes for each overlapping pair you get  as the sum looking at these portfolio positions we see a lot of similarity and a preference for liquid securities also quants never hold large positions a  position is large for a quant fund some of the most popular positons for our group of quants are below negative values indicate put option exposure from public holdings of course most valuable for hedge fund managers is to run overlap of their own portfolio against the quants when coupling concepts such as your own position sizing and liquidity things get interesting and you may get the urge to buy some put options on otherwise innocuous names what goes up must come down and
