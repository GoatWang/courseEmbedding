today  comments click here to readwrite comments topics location strategy how mobile and locationbased advertising are reinventing outofhome posted by gerard vicente on mar    am tweet at first glance it might be hard to see the link between outofhome ooh advertising and mobile one is static while the others always moving one has been around for hundreds of years while the other is a modern invention when you think about it though these two marketing channels have a lot in common both leverage location to reach the right audience whether an ad takes the form of a billboard on a busy commuter highway or appears on a treadmill at the gym ooh advertisers target consumers based on where they go and when while mobile campaigns rely on foot traffic intelligence and location data to do the same in a way outofhome is the original locationbased ad and that makes mobile the perfect match for ooh campaigns outofhome is top of mind for brands in  ooh was the only traditional media category other than tv to see an increase in ad spending according to emarketer as the new york times reported last fall billboard companies are not only surviving — theyre flourishing with ad spending rising for  quarters straight the ongoing growth of ooh media is impossible to ignore active lifestyle marketing company zoom media now reaches consumers in  health clubs with digital signage in  markets across the us while captivates lobby and elevator ads reach upwards of  million business professionals each month why the boom marketers recognize the value of this form of locationbased advertising and the impact it stands to have on brand awareness and reach and thats creating what mediapost has referred to as an ooh advertising renaissance unlike the campaigns of old though ooh is now has a powerful ally mobile why pairing ooh and mobile is a marketing must for a long time mobile was perceived as a newfangled approach to marketing and the stuff of early adopters not so anymore as we move from early to late majority adoption brands can no longer overlook the importance of this technology and where it fits into their overall marketing plan emarketer recently reported that mobile will represent  percent of digital ad spending in the us by the year  compared with  percent for desktop while spending on mobile ads is expected to grow by more than  percent this year evolving consumer behavior plays a big part in the mobile and ooh marketing explosion as the times points out consumers are spending more time out of the house partly because of an increase in travel and commuting and also because smartphones keep them connected when they are away from home or work the more time consumers spend with their mobile devices out in the world the more theyre exposed to both mobile and ooh ads and the greater the marketing opportunity becomes so how can brands maximize these highly compatible channels with mobile marketing and locationbased ads in particular were able to understand who a customer is where theyve been and what theyre likely to do next marketers can even influence this last event by leveraging foot traffic trends to deliver a more personalized and relevant ad experience imagine the potential of these ads when paired with ooh we already use mobile to determine which locations are a good fit for our target audience — fast food chains for example can select which customers to target based on a combination of their proximity to a store location and the interests and needs demonstrated by their previous behavior but ooh advertisers can also use mobile to inform them on the value of potential advertising locations by determining whether there are enough fast food visitors in the vicinity to justify a billboard according to the outdoor advertising association of american oaaa with the help of smartphones…ooh can intercept consumers who are near or at the point of purchase like no other ad medium mobile also has the ability to provide insight into other aspects of ooh strategy like where potential customers are coming from and how your ad placements influence their purchasing decisions when you know that a large volume of visitors around your billboard are say from affluent neighborhoods youre better able to create messaging that will resonate with them mobile and your presence at key moments of intent the modern consumer can be described in two ways onthego and connected amazingly cisco reports that by the year  more people worldwide will have a mobile phone than a bank account running water or a landline as a result consumers will rely more and more on their mobile devices using them to navigate their world as well as fill it with what they need just consider last years cyber monday activities in  american spent  million shopping on their smartphones and mobiles share of cyber monday shopping is growing with each passing year all of this makes mobile a valuable marketing tool for measuring purchasing behavior and intent related to ooh campaigns and the key to unlocking the mindset of the consumers crosschannel marketers hope to reach remember what consumers tell brands and what they actually do isnt always consistent that makes foot traffic data vital to following their movements in order to better meet their needs outofhome advertising may be thriving but marketers are only just beginning to explore the role that mobile can play in creating more effective and efficient campaigns together ooh and mobile are capable of taking locationbased advertising to a whole new level  comments click here to readwrite comments topics location mobile location drives marketers’ shift from demographic to contextual insights posted by julie fairclough on mar    pm tweet recent global events have proved how hard it is to predict outcomes consider president trump and closer to home brexit heck consider english football club underdog leicester city winning the premier league last year all events were against the odds in all cases any expert relying on data to predict the outcome would have anticipated incorrectly why because people aren’t always willing to tell you everything the decisions people make and the actions people take differ on their situation and mindset from day to day  which leaves marketers in a bit of a conundrum how do you create valuable experiences that account for and align well with unpredictable consumer behaviour how do you measure and understand consumer habits what is the value of demographic targeting in a world where intent is influenced on context we sought to answer some of these questions in our new report conducted in partnership with exchangewire “digital reimagined context and predictability” and asked  digital marketing professionals to consider these points key learnings what we uncovered was the use of location and contextual data was on the rise whilst ad requests containing location data rose by  last year our survey revealed that  consider demographic segments to be of “limited use” or “no use” with  of those who used contextual targeting doing so in order to break away from demographic stereotypes we also found that  of respondents believe contextual and location targeting will boost relevance of their ads and  believe it’s main use is to drive footfall to physical locations this is because location is one of the highest indicators of behavioural intent my current situation where i have been previously and what is in close proximity to me is more likely to determine what i find interesting and what i go onto buy than anything else this is why  of respondents said realtime campaign activation is one of the main performance benefits they’ve seen from investing in contextual targeting second only to campaign efficiency  so what does this mean are we experiencing the demise of demographics quite frankly no that’s a massive overexaggeration but as consumer behaviour gets harder to predict new technology is making it easier than ever before for brands to obtain a wider understanding of their audience people have never fallen into straightforward demographics and now we can build campaigns based on real behaviours and audience context location highlights intent as a visit to a store or specific place is often a larger commitment to purchasing compared to an online search or social share and opens prime opportunities for brands to target audiences in the right moment based on where they are and the situation they are in with consumer behaviour more erratic than ever the idea of spending months crafting overarching targeting for media campaigns is starting to seem outdated therefore more efficient campaign planning and realtime activation are vital if marketers are to be as effective as possible in times of flux click here to download our report “digital reimagined context and predictability”  comments click here to readwrite comments topics research mobile your guide to designing mobile ads posted by unsun lee on mar    pm tweet mobile ad spending in the us will more than double by the year  according to marketing advisory firm biakelsey at the same time spending on locationtargeted ads is expected to grow from about  billion to more than  billion theres no doubt that brands are ready to go all in with mobile but is their mobile creative up to the task even after years of experimentation many marketers struggle to get their mobile display ads just right the rules are different when youre designing for a mobile screen for starters theres no large canvas to help you make your ads jump off the page mobile requires that marketers consider everything from viewability to spacing and navigation users attention spans are also plummeting as noted by venturebeat couple that with the fact that mobile behavior can be dramatically different from desktop with mobile users multitasking juggling numerous devices and researching products on the move and youve got a tricky proposition while designing effective mobile display banners is a unique process recent data can help us master it here are three creative insights to help you design with the end user as priority lighter means faster as reported by adweek new research from google and video technology company teads shows that mobile video ads created using googles amp accelerated mobile pages can significantly outperform traditional mobile ads the faster ads were found to boost clickthrough rates by  percent this suggests that consumers have a more favorable outlook on ads that dont interfere with their mobile experience but marketers have the cards stacked against them publishers always ensure their own content loads before the ads do — a smart tactic for increasing unique users and page views but a big challenge for brands left with mere seconds to get their ads loaded on the page busy mobile users dont have the time or patience to wait for an ad to load so when youre designing for the mobile device make your file sizes as small as possible and always aim for proper ad serving keep copy short how much ad copy is too much this question has confounded digital advertisers for years but we now know that when it comes to mobile less is more xads creative insights report from  revealed that mobile banners featuring copy comprised of fewer than  words received a  percent lift in clickthrough rate so when you create your banner ad copy keep your message short and to the point put all the attention on your offer and cut unnecessary copy consumers should be able to glance at your ad and immediately get the gist and eliminating your ads background noise can help make your message crystal clear animate to engage with mobile ads likely to run on multiple different sites and apps it doesnt make sense to design for each publishing environment instead create ads that catch users attention on any publisher against intended content one way to do this is with animation according to xads creative insights adding gif animation — even if its subtle — to mobile creative can improve clickthrough rates by  percent the addition of animation will make users more likely to engage with your ad while simultaneously differentiating your mobile creative from publisher content keep in mind gif animation isnt an excuse to add more copy in fact it requires an especially thoughtful approach every frame should be able to stand alone and feature your logo call to action etc since you never know which frame a user will see while browsing after all studies have shown that consumers can spend less than  milliseconds looking at a mobile ad when armed with mobile creative best practices marketers can ensure their mobile investment pays off be sure to subscribe to our blog

posted by jessica meyers on mar    am tweet last year gartner reported that wearable technology needs to be more useful with wearable abandonment rates hovering around  percent the research company stressed the importance of creating more compelling value propositions emarketer echoed similar sentiments when revising its previous growth estimates for wearable device usage according to one of its analysts without a clear use case for smart watches—which have more features than fitness trackers but significant overlap with smartphone functionality—the more sophisticated expensive wearable devices have not caught on as quickly the wearables market may be leveling off but that hasnt changed the fact that this technology could be a game changer for brands those who are embracing it are doing exactly what gartner and emarketer are recommending and making wearable tech more useful and functional for users commuters in the uk can now use their apple watches to find the nearest bus stop and plan their bus trips and android wear smartwatch owners who are hungry for a slice can count on the pizza navigator app to point them to the nearest pizza place you can bet location technology will play a big part in wearables moving forward too lets take a closer look at the wearable tech opportunity and the role that locationaware messaging could play within it omnipresence wearables go where their users do and that makes this technology incredibly important to marketers consumers already recognize the value of geographicallyrelevant offerings pew research center has reported that  percent of us smartphone owners use location services on their devices and that number is on the rise were likely to see marketers maximize wearables in similar ways to mobilebased advertising when brands are always on hand to deliver locationspecific messages that are useful to consumers—like maps to nearby retailers and information about current instore product offers—they can create lasting and meaningful customer relationships experience wearable devices like virtual reality headsets are already being used to create immersive brand experiences and many of these take place onsite at festivals and instores in sweden for example mcdonalds transformed limited edition happy meal boxes into virtual reality viewers that allowed children to play a vr game in order to participate in this exclusive experience though consumers first had to visit a select mcdonalds restaurant imagine the locationaware activation possibilities it wont be long before brands are leveraging vr to deliver locationspecific ads or offers associated with their immersive video experiences interest in virtual and augmented reality is increasing with consumer and media insights company nielsen reporting nearly a quarter of americans  to  expect to use or buy vr technology this year the ability to combine location targeting with wearable technology to deliver entertaining and purposeful brand experiences is one that marketers arent going to ignore innovation if theres one more aspect of wearables that marketers can really capitalize on its the technologys capacity for innovation in the near future industries like hospitality and travel will begin to experiment with wearable technologys unique functions including haptics and vibrations marketers may soon be notifying consumers of locationspecific retail offers in their area and nearby points of interest by vibrating their smartwatch wearable tech is evolving and maturing with every passing day keep an eye on the unique opportunities that grow right along with it  comments click here to readwrite comments topics location industry insights foot traffic actions speak louder than words for resolutioners posted by jessica meyers on mar    pm tweet on january st millions of consumers resolve that theyll turn a new leaf kick their sugary vices and return to the gym according to statistic brain research institute nearly  percent of americans also claim to keep good on their resolutions at least through the first month but xads foot traffic data reveals that consumer effort in keeping those resolutions declines after the third week in both the us and uk consumers it seems are a little less than truthful about maintaining their resolutions this is just one of the many findings from xads foot traffic analysis of consumers habits around resolutions while insightful it presents a bigger question to marketers do people actually do what they say theyre going to do foot traffic data can help us gain a deeper understanding into this question revealing that sometimes the answer is simply no below are three additional insights gleaned from xads foot traffic data exposing new secrets around consumers and their habits its hard to resist guilty pleasures  especially for our friends across the pond us consumers stay on target with their resolutions at least a week longer than uk consumers but by the second week of january uk consumers give into qsrs more so than their us counterparts and start to drop off from virtuous actions like eating healthy and going to the gym us consumers are also  percent more driven than average to make virtuous changes within their lives during the third week of january however their behavior shifts shortly after that by the last week in january us enthusiasm for a healthier lifestyle begins to drop off by nearly  percent of visits to healthcentric stores versus visits to fast food and liquor stores — just in time for the end of dry january and the lead up to super bowl by february  resolutions dropped an additional  percent theres something about the northeast if a consumer lives in the northeastern part of the us theyre much more hardcore about sticking to their goals in a study about centenarians from the boston university school of medicine the northeastern states have the highest number of us citizens living over  years none of the centenarians or supercentenarians  or more years old were obese or had a habit of smoking whats more is that these centenarians were wideranging in socioeconomic status ethnicity and diet—though very few were eating hamburgers regularly or drinking alcoholic or sugary beverages the midwest and the south have similar habits consumers in the middle of the country and southern states have similar lifestyles according to their foot traffic patterns in nearly every week from middecember to the end of january consumers in the midwest and south had roughly the same ratio of virtues to vices from week to week within a few degrees by contrast the northeast and the west which were both healthier than the midwest and southern states had a much larger differences between them so what does this mean for marketers by the third week of january its time for gyms or health food stores to start reincentivizing consumers to keep making healthy choices by offering new perks andor sending positive campaign messages to keep up the spirit the same can be said for qsr or retail marketers of liquor stores and supermarkets who might be able to win people back consumers during this same time frame marketers should also be aware of regionspecific habits and vices—its likely that the same marketing in the midwestern states wont appeal to the northeast  comments click here to readwrite comments topics location seasonal just released foot traffic report indicates early  qsr trends posted by luke katz on feb    am tweet while foot traffic data has been known to uncover realworld consumer insights most dont realize how frequently it can align with actual brand performance and business trends—providing marketers with a deeper understanding into shopping behavior and future business success this is just one of the findings from xads just released qsr foot traffic report which compares quick service restaurant qsr foot traffic from q to q  lets take a look at four of the qsr brands that experienced shifts in visitation this quarter and what our data tells us about recent and upcoming business events exploring new territory chickfila topping the list is chickfila which saw a  percent increase in foot traffic in q of last year in line with what business insider reported in october chickfila has been generating more perrestaurant revenue than any other us qsr chain analysts chalk this up to recent expansions into the midwest and northeast including high profile locations in new york city and the introduction of healthy new menu items such as grain bowls if chickfila continues along this same path the uptick in its foot traffic could be here to stay king of meats arbys arbys is another fastfood brand that did relatively well in q with an increase in foot traffic of nearly  percent what accounts for the change arbys had a meaty year that put it several percentage points above the overall qsr industry in samestore sales growth qsr web notes that plans for more than  new locations multiple new menu items and a big improvement in qsr diner satisfaction all account for its recent foot traffic patterns the comeback kid chipotle chipotle mexican grills q  percent foot traffic increase was another step in the right direction for the brand that has been slowly increasing throughout the year as noted by xad earlier in the year a report from reuters suggests that decembers jump in sales was the high point of a disappointing quarter but the chain is anticipating growth in  the company plans to improve its customer service unveil new menu items including dessert and launch new digital ordering technology — all of which could boost foot traffic once more and help chipotle leave its problems in the past embracing the future mcdonalds although its usually a strong player mcdonalds didnt fare as well as usual in q interest in the chains recently expanded all day breakfast menu is according to crains chicago business waning and domestic samestore sales dropped  percent last quarter while this shift is reflected in our data which showed a simultaneous  percent decrease in foot traffic dont count mcdonalds out of the game as noted by crains while the brand is behind many of its competitors on the technology front — a fact that could be affecting its foot traffic as well — mcdonalds is currently preparing to expand its experience of the future concept by introducing table service and selfserve ordering kiosks in all of its us stores want more qsr insights and customer trends download the xad qsr foot traffic trends report
