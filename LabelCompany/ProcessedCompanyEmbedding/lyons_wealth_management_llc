valuebased investment philosophy targeting companies with highperforming capital investments that can help sustain longterm price appreciation we seek companies that exhibit strong balance sheets cash flow and internal returns and that we perceive to be undervalued our process combines quantitative modeling with fundamental research beginning with a ranking model to identify a target set of stocks as the basis for further analysis after thorough evaluation we select those companies with the highest relative combination of performance and value for investment in the portfolio the managers employ a diligent risk management process both at the security and portfolio levels we apply individual sell discipline to exit positions that no longer represent a value to the portfolio or otherwise dont meet our criteria based on the firms proprietary risk gauge we may take temporary defensive positions in cash treasuries or other shortterm instruments during periods of heightened equity market risk such allocations may comprise all or a portion of the portfolio’s assets and are intended to mitigate the risk of outsize losses inherent in large market declines   learn more   home about us
