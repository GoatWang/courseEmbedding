price retail and institutional prime and municipal money market funds retail prime and retail municipal money market mutual funds have policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit all beneficial owners to natural persons ie individual investors these funds may continue to seek to maintain a stable  net asset value nav but are subject to potential liquidity fees and redemption gates ie the fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors institutional prime and institutional municipal money market mutual funds are funds that do not qualify as retail funds—ie they may be held by institutional investors these funds are subject to potential liquidity fees and redemption gates and will price and transact at a floating nav meaning that the nav will be priced to  decimal places eg  and will experience fluctuations from time to time government money market mutual funds including us treasury funds are available to both retail and institutional investors and are not subject to potential liquidity fees redemption gates or a floating nav investors who might consider money market funds money market funds may be appropriate for customers who have an investment goal with a short time horizon have a low tolerance for volatility or are looking to diversify with a more conservative investment need the investment to be extremely liquid while the returns on money market funds are generally not as high as those of other types of fixed income funds such as bond funds they do seek to provide stability and can therefore play an important role in your portfolio investors can use money market funds in a few ways to offset the typically greater volatility of bond and equity investments as shortduration investments for assets that may be needed in the near term such as an emergency fund as a holding place for assets while waiting for other investment opportunities to arise such as in the core position for your brokerage account evaluating a money market fund a money market fund is a type of fixed income mutual fund with very stringent maturity credit quality diversification and liquidity requirements intended to help it achieve its goals of principal preservation and daily access for investors customers should determine when picking a money market fund that its characteristics align with their investment objectives and strategy the objective for many money market funds is typically to provide current income consistent with principal preservation us treasury and government money market funds potentially can offer a lower credit risk and return profile than prime money market funds municipal money market funds may be appropriate for nonretirement accounts that are not already taxshielded advantages of money market funds stability money market mutual funds are considered to be one of the least volatile types of mutual fund investments liquidity it’s easy to settle your brokerage account trades in other investments or retrieve funds from a money market mutual fund—generally assets are available by the next business day security the funds are required by federal regulations to invest in shortmaturity lowrisk investments making them less prone to market fluctuations than many other types of investments short duration because the duration of money market mutual funds is so short—at maximum a few months—they are typically subject to less interest rate risk than longermaturing bond fund investments diversification money market mutual funds tend to hold many different securities with limited exposure outside us treasury funds to any single issuer potential tax advantages some money market funds invest in securities whose interest payments are typically exempt from federal and in some cases state income taxes these funds can be a potential source of stable taxefficient income risks of money market funds credit risk unlike typical bank certificates of deposit cds or savings accounts money market mutual funds are not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic although money market mutual funds invest in highquality securities and seek to preserve the value of your investment there is the risk that you could lose money and there is no guarantee that you will receive  per share when you redeem your shares inflation risk because of the safety and shortterm nature of the underlying investments money market mutual fund returns tend to be lower than those of more volatile investments such as typical stock and bond mutual funds creating the risk that the rate of return may not keep pace with inflation prime money market funds foreign exposure entities located in foreign countries can be affected by adverse political regulatory market or economic developments in those countries financial services exposure changes in government regulations interest rates and economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the financial services sector including the price of their securities or their ability to meet their payment obligations all prime and municipal money market funds liquidity risk the fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds price risk because the share price of the fund will fluctuate when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them frequently asked questions why can yields on money market mutual funds be very low money market mutual funds own a welldiversified pool of high quality shortdated interestpaying securities and pass along the income earned on those securities after fees to the funds’ shareholders when the yields on the securities in which money market mutual funds invest are quite low the yields that the funds are passing along to their shareholders are also quite low the interest rate policy of the federal reserve the fed is a key driver for money market rates how short is “short term” for the securities in which money market mutual funds can invest the rules that govern money market mutual funds permit the funds to buy only securities that mature in  days or less at least  of the fund’s total assets must be invested in weekly liquid assets which can consist of cash direct obligations of the us government such as us treasury bills certain other us government agency debt that is issued at a discount and matures within  days or less or securities that will mature or are payable within  business days for taxable funds at least  of the fund’s total assets must be invested in daily liquid assets which can consist of cash direct obligations of the us government or securities that will mature or are payable within one business day the remaining investments can be in longerterm issues provided the overall weighted average maturity of the fund is  days or less why doesn’t the government offer insurance on money market mutual funds the us government does not offer insurance on any type of mutual fund money market mutual funds like bond and stock

money market mutual fund regulatory developments  chairmans message chairmans message april   view as pdf dear shareholder us money markets posted modest gains for the year ending april   amid a challenging lowyielding backdrop lingering concerns about the pace of global economic growth were countered by the markets renewed optimism for the us economy that followed the november presidential election as well as expectations for higher policy rates in  a rising dollar and worries about the chinese economy kept shortterm bond yields rangebound in the early months of the period despite expectations for the continuation of a policy ratehike cycle money market volatility increased following the release of the federal open market committees statement in september which suggested that policy interest rates would stay low for longer and resulted in shortterm rates reaching year lows market rates then began to rise gradually leading up to the us election culminating in the us federal reserves quarterpoint rate increase in december many market participants viewed the incoming administrations policy agenda as potentially inflationary which reinforced expectations for multiple policy rate hikes in  industrywide money market reform implemented by midoctober  further contributed to the lateyear rise in shortterm rates owing to a large amount of money moving out of prime funds and into government funds causing issuers reliant on funding from prime funds to pay higher rates to secure that funding the regulations require institutional prime general purpose and institutional municipal money market mutual funds – those primarily held by institutional investors rather than individuals – to price and transact at a floating net asset value nav or price per share instead of at the stable  nav that previously had applied to such shareholder transactions in addition the rules allow institutional and retail prime and municipal funds during periods of extraordinary market stress to temporarily charge liquidity fees payable to the funds upon redemption or to temporarily halt redemptions by applying redemption gates despite these regulatory changes its important to note that all of fidelitys us treasury and government money market funds are permitted to continue to transact at a stable  nav and are not subject to fees or gates looking ahead the governments borrowing limit – the debt ceiling – is expected to be reached by the end of september  provided that congress decides to raise the ceiling we expect shortterm markets to remain calm however if the debt limit is not increased experience from recent years suggests to us that the us treasurys cash balance regulated by law would have to decrease dramatically thus curtailing the issuance of treasury bills and putting downward pressure on rates as part of our regular portfolio management practices we believe we are wellprepared for a range of potential outcomes regardless of market conditions we will continue to manage all of fidelitys money market funds as we always have – with the goal of providing security and safety for shareholders investments sincerely abigail p johnson chairman of the board
