been received from an independent third party omeca for purposes of determining the patents value at that time dephasium ltd had already established a web site for its operations in europe which can

business operations the companys business strategy has changed to seeking potential merger candidates and we are now considered a shell as defined by the sec the companys auditors have issued a going concern opinion in our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   this means that our auditors believe there is doubt that the company can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless it obtains additional capital to pay its bills this is because the company has not generated any revenues and no revenues are currently anticipated accordingly we must raise cash from sources such as investments by others in the company and through possible transactions with strategic or joint venture partners we do not plan to use any capital raised for the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and the accompanying notes

inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including limited capital resources and cost increases in services operating expenses general and administrative expenses for the three
