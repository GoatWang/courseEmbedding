ewaste may be defined as discarded computers office electronic equipment entertainment device electronics mobile phones television sets and refrigerators this includes used electronics which are destined for reuse resale salvage recycling or disposal others are reusables working and repairable electronics and secondary scrap copper steel plastic etc to be commodities and reserve the term waste for residue or material which is dumped by the buyer rather than recycled including residue from reuse and recycling operations because loads of surplus electronics are frequently commingled good recyclable and nonrecyclable several public policy advocates apply the term ewaste broadly to all surplus electronics cathode ray tubes crts are considered one of the hardest types to recycle crts have relatively high concentration of lead and phosphors not to be confused with phosphorus both of which are necessary for the display the united states environmental protection agency epa includes discarded crt monitors in its category of hazardous household waste but considers crts that have been set aside for testing to be commodities if they are not discarded speculatively accumulated or left unprotected from weather and other damage the eu and its member states operate a system via the european waste catalogue ewc a european council directive which is interpreted into member state law in the uk this is in the form of the list of wastes directive however the list and ewc gives broad definition ewc code    of hazardous electronic wastes requiring waste operators to employ the hazardous waste regulations annex a annex b for refined definition constituent materials in the waste also require assessment via the combination of annex ii and annex iii again allowing operators to further determine whether a waste is hazardous debate continues over the distinction between commodity and waste electronics definitions some exporters are accused of deliberately leaving difficulttorecycle obsolete or nonrepairable equipment mixed in loads of working equipment though this may also come through ignorance or to avoid more costly treatment processes protectionists may broaden the definition of waste electronics in order to protect domestic markets from working secondary equipment the high value of the computer recycling subset of electronic waste working and reusable laptops desktops and components like ram can help pay the cost of transportation for a larger number of worthless pieces than can be achieved with display devices which have less or negative scrap value in a  report ghana ewaste country assessment found that of  tons of electronics imported to ghana  were brand new and  were used of the used product the study concluded that  was not reused and was scrapped or discarded this contrasts with published but uncredited claims that  of the imports into ghana were being burned in primitive conditions amount of electronic waste worldwideedit a fragment of discarded circuit board rapid changes in technology changes in media tapes software mp falling prices and planned obsolescence have resulted in a fastgrowing surplus of electronic waste around the globe technical solutions are available but in most cases a legal framework a collection logistics and other services need to be implemented before a technical solution can be applied display units crt lcd led monitors processors cpu gpu or apu chips memory dram or sram and audio components have different useful lives processors are most frequently outdated by software no longer being optimized and are more likely to become ewaste while display units are most often replaced while working without repair attempts due to changes in wealthy nation appetites for new display technology this problem could potentially be solved with modular smartphones or phonebloks these types of phones are more durable and have the technology to change certain parts of the phone making them more environmentally friendly being able to simply replace the part of the phone that is broken will reduce ewaste an estimated  million tons of ewaste are produced each year the usa discards  million computers each year and  million phones are disposed of in europe each year the environmental protection agency estimates that only – of ewaste is recycled the rest of these electronics go directly into landfills and incinerators in  the united nations estimated the amount of worldwide electronic waste discarded each year to be  million metric tons according to a report by unep titled recycling – from ewaste to resources the amount of ewaste being produced – including mobile phones and computers – could rise by as much as  percent over the next decade in some countries such as india the united states is the world leader in producing electronic waste tossing away about  million tons each year china already produces about  million tons  estimate domestically second only to the united states and despite having banned ewaste imports china remains a major ewaste dumping ground for developed countries society today revolves around technology and by the constant need for the newest and most hightech products we are contributing to mass amount of ewaste since the invention of the iphone cell phones have become the top source of ewaste products because they are not made to last more than two years electrical waste contains hazardous but also valuable and scarce materials up to  elements can be found in complex electronics as of  apple has sold over  million idevices ipod iphone ipad cell phone companies make cell phones that are not made to last so that the consumer will purchase new phones companies give these products such short life spans because they know that the consumer will want a new product and will buy it if they make it in the united states an estimated  of heavy metals in landfills comes from discarded electronics while there is agreement that the number of discarded electronic devices is increasing there is considerable disagreement about the relative risk compared to automobile scrap for example and strong disagreement whether curtailing trade in used electronics will improve conditions or make them worse according to an article in motherboard attempts to restrict the trade have driven reputable companies out of the supply chain with unintended consequences global trade issuesedit see also global waste trade and electronic waste by country electronic waste is often exported to developing countries volt d c aa aaa aaaa a volt cr and lr cells are all recyclable in most countries the ewaste centre of agbogbloshie ghana where electronic waste is burnt and disassembled with no safety or environmental considerations one theory is that increased regulation of electronic waste and concern over the environmental harm in nature economies creates an economic disincentive to remove residues prior to export critics of trade in used electronics maintain that it is still too easy for brokers calling themselves recyclers to export unscreened electronic waste to developing countries such as china india and parts of africa thus avoiding the expense of removing items like bad cathode ray tubes the processing of which is expensive and difficult the developing countries have become toxic dump yards of ewaste proponents of international trade point to the success of fair trade programs in other industries where cooperation has led to creation of sustainable jobs and can bring affordable technology in countries where repair and reuse rates are higher defenders of the tradewho in used electronics say that extraction of metals from virgin mining has been shifted to developing countries recycling of copper silver gold and other materials from discarded electronic devices is considered better for the environment than mining they also state that repair and reuse of computers and televisions has become a lost art in wealthier nations and that refurbishing has traditionally been a path to development south korea taiwan and southern china all excelled in finding retained value in used goods and in some cases have set up billiondollar industries in refurbishing used ink cartridges singleuse cameras and working crts refurbishing has traditionally been a threat to established manufacturing and simple protectionism explains some criticism of the trade works like the waste makers by vance packard explain some of the criticism of exports of working product for example the ban on import of tested working pentium  laptops to china or the bans on export of used surplus working electronics by japan opponents of surplus electronics exports argue that lower environmental and labor standards cheap labor and the relatively high value of recovered raw materials leads to a transfer of pollutiongenerating activities such as smelting of copper wire in china malaysia india kenya and various african countries electronic waste is being sent to these countries for processing sometimes illegally many surplus laptops are routed to developing nations as dumping grounds for ewaste because the united states has not ratified the basel convention or its ban amendment and has few domestic federal laws forbidding the export of toxic waste the basel action network estimates that about  of the electronic waste directed to recycling in the us does not get recycled there at all but is put on container ships and sent to countries such as china this figure is disputed as an exaggeration by the epa the institute of scrap recycling industries and the world reuse repair and recycling association independent research by arizona state university showed that – of imported used computers did not have a higher value than the best value of the constituent materials they contained and that the official trade in endoflife computers is thus driven by reuse as opposed to recycling tradeedit proponents of the trade say growth of internet access is a stronger correlation to trade than poverty haiti is poor and closer to the port of new york than southeast asia but far more electronic waste is exported from new york to asia than to haiti thousands of men women and children are employed in reuse refurbishing repair and remanufacturing unsustainable industries in decline in developed countries denying developing nations access to used electronics may deny them sustainable employment affordable products and internet access or force them to deal with even less scrupulous suppliers in a series of seven articles for the atlantic shanghaibased reporter adam minter describes many of these computer repair and scrap separation activities as objectively sustainable opponents of the trade argue that developing countries utilize methods that are more harmful and more wasteful an expedient and prevalent method is simply to toss equipment onto an open fire in order to melt plastics and to burn away nonvaluable metals this releases carcinogens and neurotoxins into the air contributing to an acrid lingering smog these noxious fumes include dioxins and furans bonfire refuse can be disposed of quickly into drainage ditches or waterways feeding the ocean or local water supplies in june  a container of electronic waste destined from the port of oakland in the us to sanshui district in mainland china was intercepted in hong kong by greenpeace concern over exports of electronic waste were raised in press reports in india ghana côte divoire and nigeria guiyuedit main article electronic waste in china guiyu in the shantou region of china is a massive electronic waste processing community it is often referred to as the ewaste capital of the world traditionally guiyu was an agricultural community however in the mids it transformed into an ewaste recycling center involving over  of the local households and an additional  migrant workers thousands of individual workshops employ laborers to snip cables pry chips from circuit boards grind plastic computer cases into particles and dip circuit boards in acid baths to dissolve the precious metals others work to strip insulation from all wiring in an attempt to salvage tiny amounts of copper wire uncontrolled burning disassembly and disposal has led to a number of environmental problems such as groundwater contamination atmospheric pollution and water pollution either by immediate discharge or from surface runoff especially near coastal areas as well as health problems including occupational safety and health effects among those directly and indirectly involved due to the methods of processing the waste a number of studies have been conducted to measure a number of chemicals associated with informal ewaste recycling in the populations one study enrolled children from guiyu and a control site  km away to measure blood lead levels blls the average bll in guiyu was  ugdl compared to  ugdl in the control site in the united states the cdc has set a reference level for blood lead at  ugdl high levels of lead in young children can impact iq and the development of the central nervous system the highest concentrations of lead were found in the children of parents whose workshop dealt with circuit boards and the lowest was among those who recycled plastic six of the many villages in guiyu specialize in circuitboard disassembly seven in plastics and metals reprocessing and two in wire and cable disassembly greenpeace an environmental group sampled dust soil river sediment and groundwater in guiyu they found very high levels of toxic heavy metals and organic contaminants in both places lai yun a campaigner for the group found over  poisonous metals such as lead mercury and cadmium guiyu is only one example of digital dumps but similar places can be found across the world in nigeria ghana and india with amounts of ewaste growing rapidly each year urgent solutions are required while the waste continues to flow into digital dumps like guiyu there are measures that can help reduce the flow of ewaste a suggested preventative step involves the major electronics firms removing the worst chemicals in their products in order to make them safer and easier to recycle other informal ewaste recycling sitesedit a pile of discarded tvs and computer monitors guiyu is likely one of the oldest and largest informal ewaste recycling sites in the world however there are many sites worldwide including india ghana nigeria and the philippines most research involving informal ewaste recycling has been done in guiyu but there are a handful of studies that describe exposure levels in ewaste workers the community and the environmentcitation needed bangalore located in southern india is often referred as the silicon valley of india and has a growing informal ewaste recycling sector hair samples were collected from workers at an ewaste recycling facility and an ewaste recycling slum community in bangalore levels of v cr mn mo sn tl and pb were significantly higher in the workers at the ewaste recycling facility compared to the ewaste workers in the slum community however co ag cd and hg levels were significantly higher in the slum community workers compared to the facility workers a study in ghana found higher levels of urinary pahmetabolites in ewaste workers compared to unexposed controls they also found a greater frequency of complaints of cough chest pain and vertigo from those exposed to emissions from the ewaste recycling processes environmental impactedit old keyboards and one mouse the processes of dismantling and disposing of electronic waste in developing countries led to a number of environmental impacts as illustrated in the graphic liquid and atmospheric releases end up in bodies of water groundwater soil and air and therefore in land and sea animals – both domesticated and wild in crops eaten by both animals and human and in drinking water one study of environmental effects in guiyu china found the following airborne dioxins – one type found at  times levels previously measured levels of carcinogens in duck ponds and rice paddies exceeded international standards for agricultural areas and cadmium copper nickel and lead levels in rice paddies were above international standards heavy metals found in road

a potential security threat to individuals and exporting countries hard drives that are not properly erased before the computer is disposed of can be reopened exposing sensitive information credit card numbers private financial data account information and records of online transactions can be accessed by most willing individuals organized criminals in ghana commonly search the drives for information to use in local scams electronic files about government contracts have been discovered on hard drives found in agbogbloshie multimilliondollar agreements from united states security institutions such as the defense intelligence agency dia the transportation security administration and homeland security have all resurfaced in agbogbloshie ewaste managementedit recyclingedit computer monitors are typically packed into low stacks on wooden pallets for recycling and then shrinkwrapped see also computer recycling audiovisual components televisions vcrs stereo equipment mobile phones other handheld devices and computer components contain valuable elements and substances suitable for reclamation including lead copper and gold recyclingedit one of the major challenges is recycling the printed circuit boards from the electronic wastes the circuit boards contain such precious metals as gold silver platinum etc and such base metals as copper iron aluminum etc one way ewaste is processed is by melting circuit boards burning cable sheathing to recover copper wire and open pit acid leaching for separating metals of value conventional method employed is mechanical shredding and separation but the recycling efficiency is low alternative methods such as cryogenic decomposition have been studied for printed circuit board recycling and some other methods are still under investigation properly disposing of or reusing electronics can help prevent health problems reduce greenhousegas emissions and create jobs reuse and refurbishing offer a more environmentally friendly and socially conscious alternative to downcycling processescitation needed consumer awareness effortsedit the us environmental protection agency encourages electronic recyclers to become certified by demonstrating to an accredited independent third party auditor that they meet specific standards to safely recycle and manage electronics this should work so as to ensure the highest environmental standards are being maintained two certifications for electronic recyclers currently exist and are endorsed by the epa customers are encouraged to choose certified electronics recyclers responsible electronics recycling reduces environmental and human health impacts increases the use of reusable and refurbished equipment and reduces energy use while conserving limited resources the two epaendorsed certification programs are responsible recyclers practices r and estewards certified companies ensure they are meeting strict environmental standards which maximize reuse and recycling minimize exposure to human health or the environment ensure safe management of materials and require destruction of all data used on electronics certified electronics recyclers have demonstrated through audits and other means that they continually meet specific high environmental standards and safely manage used electronics once certified the recycler is held to the particular standard by continual oversight by the independent accredited certifying body a certification board accredits and oversees certifying bodies to ensure that they meet specific responsibilities and are competent to audit and provide certification some us retailers offer opportunities for consumer recycling of discarded electronic devices in the us the consumer electronics association cea urges consumers to dispose properly of endoflife electronics through its recycling locator at wwwgreenergadgetsorg this list only includes manufacturer and retailer programs that use the strictest standards and thirdparty certified recycling locations to provide consumers assurance that their products will be recycled safely and responsibly cea research has found that  percent of consumers know where to take their endoflife electronics and the electronics industry would very much like to see that level of awareness increase consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers sponsor or operate more than  recycling locations nationwide and have vowed to recycle one billion pounds annually by  a sharp increase from  million pounds industry recycled in  the sustainable materials management electronic challenge was created by the united states environmental protection agency epa participants of the challenge are manufacturers of electronics and electronic retailers these companies collect endoflife eol electronics at various locations and send them to a certified thirdparty recycler program participants are then able publicly promote and report  responsible recycling for their companies the electronics takeback coalition is a campaign aimed at protecting human health and limiting environmental effects where electronics are being produced used and discarded the etbc aims to place responsibility for disposal of technology products on electronic manufacturers and brand owners primarily through community promotions and legal enforcement initiatives it provides recommendations for consumer recycling and a list of recyclers judged environmentally responsible the certified electronics recycler program for electronic recyclers is a comprehensive integrated management system standard that incorporates key operational and continual improvement elements for quality environmental and health and safety qehs performance the grassroots silicon valley toxics coalition focuses on promoting human health and addresses environmental justice problems resulting from toxins in technologies the world reuse repair and recycling association wraorg is an organization dedicated to improving the quality of exported electronics encouraging better recycling standards in importing countries and improving practices through fair trade principles take back my tv is a project of the electronics takeback coalition and grades television manufacturers to find out which are responsible and which are not the ewaste association of south africa ewasa has been instrumental in building a network of ewaste recyclers and refurbishers in the country it continues to drive the sustainable environmentally sound management of all ewaste in south africa ecycling central is a website from the electronic industry alliance which allows you to search for electronic recycling programs in your state it lists different recyclers by state to find reuse recycle or find donation programs across the country ewasteguideinfo is a switzerlandbased website dedicated to improving the ewaste situation in developing and transitioning countries the site contains news events case studies and more step solving the ewaste problem this website of step an initiative founded by various un organizations to develop strategies to solve the ewaste problem follows its activities and programs processing techniquesedit recycling the lead from batteries in many developed countries electronic waste processing usually first involves dismantling the equipment into various parts metal frames power supplies circuit boards plastics often by hand but increasingly by automated shredding equipment a typical example is the nadin electronic waste processing plant in novi iskar bulgaria—the largest facility of its kind in eastern europe the advantages of this process are the humans ability to recognize and save working and repairable parts including chips transistors ram etc the disadvantage is that the labor is cheapest in countries with the lowest health and safety standards in an alternative bulk system a hopper conveys material for shredding into an unsophisticated mechanical separator with screening and granulating machines to separate constituent metal and plastic fractions which are sold to smelters or plastics recyclers such recycling machinery is enclosed and employs a dust collection system some of the emissions are caught by scrubbers and screens magnets eddy currents and trommel screens are employed to separate glass plastic and ferrous and nonferrous metals which can then be further separated at a smelter leaded glass from crts is reused in car batteries ammunition and lead wheel weights or sold to foundries as a fluxing agent in processing raw lead ore copper gold palladium silver and tin are valuable metals sold to smelters for recycling hazardous smoke and gases are captured contained and treated to mitigate environmental threat these methods allow for safe reclamation of all valuable computer construction materials hewlettpackard product recycling solutions manager renee st denis describes its process as we move them through giant shredders about  feet tall and it shreds everything into pieces about the size of a quarter once your disk drive is shredded into pieces about this big its hard to get the data off an ideal electronic waste recycling plant combines dismantling for component recovery with increased costeffective processing of bulk electronic waste reuse is an alternative option to recycling because it extends the lifespan of a device devices still need eventual recycling but by allowing others to purchase used electronics recycling can be postponed and value gained from device use benefits of recyclingedit recycling raw materials from endoflife electronics is the most effective solution to the growing ewaste problem most electronic devices contain a variety of materials including metals that can be recovered for future uses by dismantling and providing reuse possibilities intact natural resources are conserved and air and water pollution caused by hazardous disposal is avoided additionally recycling reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the manufacturing of new products another benefit of recycling ewaste is that many of the materials can be recycled and reused again materials that can be recycled include ferrous ironbased and nonferrous metals glass and various types of plastic “nonferrous metals mainly aluminum and copper can all be resmelted and remanufactured ferrous metals such as steel and iron can be also be reused due to the recent surge in popularity in d printing certain d printers have been designed fdm variety to produce waste that can be easily recycled which decreases the amount of harmful pollutants in the atmosphere the excess plastic from these printers that comes out as a byproduct can also be reused to create new d printed creations benefits of recycling are extended when responsible recycling methods are used in the us responsible recycling aims to minimize the dangers to human health and the environment that disposed and dismantled electronics can create responsible recycling ensures best management practices of the electronics being recycled worker health and safety and consideration for the environment locally and abroad in europe metals that are recycled are returned to companies of origin at a reduced cost through a committed recycling system manufacturers in japan have been pushed to make their products more sustainable since many companies were responsible for the recycling of their own products this imposed responsibility on manufacturers requiring many to redesign their infrastructure as a result manufacturers in japan have the added option to sell the recycled metals electronic waste substancesedit several sizes of button and coin cell with  v batteries as a size comparison they are all recycled in many countries since they contain lead mercury and cadmium some computer components can be reused in assembling new computer products while others are reduced to metals that can be reused in applications as varied as construction flatware and jewelry substances found in large quantities include epoxy resins fiberglass pcbs pvc polyvinyl chlorides thermosetting plastics lead tin copper

marine and aviation environments and nickelcadmium batteries the most common form of cadmium is found in nickelcadmium rechargeable batteries these batteries tend to contain between  and  cadmium the sale of nickelcadmium batteries has been banned in the european union except for medical use when not properly recycled it can leach into the soil harming microorganisms and disrupting the soil ecosystem exposure is caused by proximity to hazardous waste sites and factories and workers in the metal refining industry the inhalation of cadmium can cause severe damage to the lungs and is also known to cause kidney damage cadmium is also associated with deficits in cognition learning behavior and neuromotor skills in children hexavalent chromium used in metal coatings to protect from corrosion a known carcinogen after occupational inhalation exposure there is also evidence of cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of some chemicals which have been shown to inhibit cell proliferation

refrigerators this includes used electronics which are destined for reuse resale salvage recycling or disposal others are reusables working and repairable electronics and secondary scrap copper steel plastic etc to be commodities and reserve the term waste for residue or material which is dumped by the buyer rather than recycled including residue from reuse and recycling operations because loads of surplus electronics are frequently commingled good recyclable and nonrecyclable several public policy advocates apply the term ewaste broadly to all surplus electronics cathode ray tubes crts are considered one of the hardest types to recycle crts have relatively high concentration of lead and phosphors not to be confused with phosphorus both of which are necessary for the display the united states environmental protection agency epa includes discarded crt monitors in its category of hazardous household waste but considers crts that have been set aside for testing to be commodities if they are not discarded speculatively accumulated or left unprotected from weather and other damage the eu and its member states operate a system via the european waste catalogue ewc a european council directive which is interpreted into member state law in the uk this is in the form of the list of wastes directive however the list and ewc gives broad definition ewc code    of hazardous electronic wastes requiring waste operators to employ the hazardous waste regulations annex a annex b for refined definition constituent materials in the waste also require assessment via the combination of annex ii and annex iii again allowing operators to further determine whether a waste is hazardous debate continues over the distinction between commodity and waste electronics definitions some exporters are accused of deliberately leaving difficulttorecycle obsolete or nonrepairable equipment mixed in loads of working equipment though this may also come through ignorance or to avoid more costly treatment processes protectionists may broaden the definition of waste electronics in order to protect domestic markets from working secondary equipment the high value of the computer recycling subset of electronic waste working and reusable laptops desktops and components like ram can help pay the cost of transportation for a larger number of worthless pieces than can be achieved with display devices which have less or negative scrap value in a  report ghana ewaste country assessment found that of  tons of electronics imported to ghana  were brand new and  were used of the used product the study concluded that  was not reused and was scrapped or discarded this contrasts with published but uncredited claims that  of the imports into ghana were being burned in primitive conditions amount of electronic waste worldwideedit a fragment of discarded circuit board rapid changes in technology changes in media tapes software mp falling prices and planned obsolescence have resulted in a fastgrowing surplus of electronic waste around the globe technical solutions are available but in most cases a legal framework a collection logistics and other services need to be implemented before a technical solution can be applied display units crt lcd led monitors processors cpu gpu or apu chips memory dram or sram and audio components have different useful lives processors are most frequently outdated by software no longer being optimized and are more likely to become ewaste while display units are most often replaced while working without repair attempts due to changes in wealthy nation appetites for new display technology this problem could potentially be solved with modular smartphones or phonebloks these types of phones are more durable and have the technology to change certain parts of the phone making them more environmentally friendly being able to simply replace the part of the phone that is broken will reduce ewaste an estimated  million tons of ewaste are produced each year the usa discards  million computers each year and  million phones are disposed of in europe each year the environmental protection agency estimates that only – of ewaste is recycled the rest of these electronics go directly into landfills and incinerators in  the united nations estimated the amount of worldwide electronic waste discarded each year to be  million metric tons according to a report by unep titled recycling – from ewaste to resources the amount of ewaste being produced – including mobile phones and computers – could rise by as much as  percent over the next decade in some countries such as india the united states is the world leader in producing electronic waste tossing away about  million tons each year china already produces about  million tons  estimate domestically second only to the united states and despite having banned ewaste imports china remains a major ewaste dumping ground for developed countries society today revolves around technology and by the constant need for the newest and most hightech products we are contributing to mass amount of ewaste since the invention of the iphone cell phones have become the top source of ewaste products because they are not made to last more than two years electrical waste contains hazardous but also valuable and scarce materials up to  elements can be found in complex electronics as of  apple has sold over  million idevices ipod iphone ipad cell phone companies make cell phones that are not made to last so that the consumer will purchase new phones companies give these products such short life spans because they know that the consumer will want a new product and will buy it if they make it in the united states an estimated  of heavy metals in landfills comes from discarded electronics while there is agreement that the number of discarded electronic devices is increasing there is considerable disagreement about the relative risk compared to automobile scrap for example and strong disagreement whether curtailing trade in used electronics will improve conditions or make them worse according to an article in motherboard attempts to restrict the trade have driven reputable companies out of the supply chain with unintended consequences global trade issuesedit see also global waste trade and electronic waste by country electronic waste is often exported to developing countries volt d c aa aaa aaaa a volt cr and lr cells are all recyclable in most countries the ewaste centre of agbogbloshie ghana where electronic waste is burnt and disassembled with no safety or environmental considerations one theory is that increased regulation of electronic waste and concern over the environmental harm in nature economies creates an economic disincentive to remove residues prior to export critics of trade in used electronics maintain that it is still too easy for brokers calling themselves recyclers to export unscreened electronic waste to developing countries such as china india and parts of africa thus avoiding the expense of removing items like bad cathode ray tubes the processing of which is expensive and difficult the developing countries have become toxic dump yards of ewaste proponents of international trade point to the success of fair trade programs in other industries where cooperation has led to creation of sustainable jobs and can bring affordable technology in countries where repair and reuse rates are higher defenders of the tradewho in used electronics say that extraction of metals from virgin mining has been shifted to developing countries recycling of copper silver gold and other materials from discarded electronic devices is considered better for the environment than mining they also state that repair and reuse of computers and televisions has become a lost art in wealthier nations and that refurbishing has traditionally been a path to development south korea taiwan and southern china all excelled in finding retained value in used goods and in some cases have set up billiondollar industries in refurbishing used ink cartridges singleuse cameras and working crts refurbishing has traditionally been a threat to established manufacturing and simple protectionism explains some criticism of the trade works like the waste makers by vance packard explain some of the criticism of exports of working product for example the ban on import of tested working pentium  laptops to china or the bans on export of used surplus working electronics by japan opponents of surplus electronics exports argue that lower environmental and labor standards cheap labor and the relatively high value of recovered raw materials leads to a transfer of pollutiongenerating activities such as smelting of copper wire in china malaysia india kenya and various african countries electronic waste is being sent to these countries for processing sometimes illegally many surplus laptops are routed to developing nations as dumping grounds for ewaste because the united states has not ratified the basel convention or its ban amendment and has few domestic federal laws forbidding the export of toxic waste the basel action network estimates that about  of the electronic waste directed to recycling in the us does not get recycled there at all but is put on container ships and sent to countries such as china this figure is disputed as an exaggeration by the epa the institute of scrap recycling industries and the world reuse repair and recycling association independent research by arizona state university showed that – of imported used computers did not have a higher value than the best value of the constituent materials they contained and that the official trade in endoflife computers is thus driven by reuse as opposed to recycling tradeedit proponents of the trade say growth of internet access is a stronger correlation to trade than poverty haiti is poor and closer to the port of new york than southeast asia but far more electronic waste is exported from new york to asia than to haiti thousands of men women and children are employed in reuse refurbishing repair and remanufacturing unsustainable industries in decline in developed countries denying developing nations access to used electronics may deny them sustainable employment affordable products and internet access or force them to deal with even less scrupulous suppliers in a series of seven articles for the atlantic shanghaibased reporter adam minter describes many of these computer repair and scrap separation activities as objectively sustainable opponents of the trade argue that developing countries utilize methods that are more harmful and more wasteful an expedient and prevalent method is simply to toss equipment onto an open fire in order to melt plastics and to burn away nonvaluable metals this releases carcinogens and neurotoxins into the air contributing to an acrid lingering smog these noxious fumes include dioxins and furans bonfire refuse can be disposed of quickly into drainage ditches or waterways feeding the ocean or local water supplies in june  a container of electronic waste destined from the port of oakland in the us to sanshui district in mainland china was intercepted in hong kong by greenpeace concern over exports of electronic waste were raised in press reports in india ghana côte divoire and nigeria guiyuedit main article electronic waste in china guiyu in the shantou region of china is a massive electronic waste processing community it is often referred to as the ewaste capital of the world traditionally guiyu was an agricultural community however in the mids it transformed into an ewaste recycling center involving over  of the local households and an additional  migrant workers thousands of individual workshops employ laborers to snip cables pry chips from circuit boards grind plastic computer cases into particles and dip circuit boards in acid baths to dissolve the precious metals others work to strip insulation from all wiring in an attempt to salvage tiny amounts of copper wire uncontrolled burning disassembly and disposal has led to a number of environmental problems such as groundwater contamination atmospheric pollution and water pollution either by immediate discharge or from surface runoff especially near coastal areas as well as health problems including occupational safety and health effects among those directly and indirectly involved due to the methods of processing the waste a number of studies have been conducted to measure a number of chemicals associated with informal ewaste recycling in the populations one study enrolled children from guiyu and a control site  km away to measure blood lead levels blls the average bll in guiyu was  ugdl compared to  ugdl in the control site in the united states the cdc has set a reference level for blood lead at  ugdl high levels of lead in young children can impact iq and the development of the central nervous system the highest concentrations of lead were found in the children of parents whose workshop dealt with circuit boards and the lowest was among those who recycled plastic six of the many villages in guiyu specialize in circuitboard disassembly seven in plastics and metals reprocessing and two in wire and cable disassembly greenpeace an environmental group sampled dust soil river sediment and groundwater in guiyu they found very high levels of toxic heavy metals and organic contaminants in both places lai yun a campaigner for the group found over  poisonous metals such as lead mercury and cadmium guiyu is only one example of digital dumps but similar places can be found across the world in nigeria ghana and india with amounts of ewaste growing rapidly each year urgent solutions are required while the waste continues to flow into digital dumps like guiyu there are measures that can help reduce the flow of ewaste a suggested preventative step involves the major electronics firms removing the worst chemicals in their products in order to make them safer and easier to recycle other informal ewaste recycling sitesedit a pile of discarded tvs and computer monitors guiyu is likely one of the oldest and largest informal ewaste recycling sites in the world however there are many sites worldwide including india ghana nigeria and the philippines most research involving informal ewaste recycling has been done in guiyu but there are a handful of studies that describe exposure levels in ewaste workers the community and the environmentcitation needed bangalore located in southern india is often referred as the silicon valley of india and has a growing informal ewaste recycling sector hair samples were collected from workers at an ewaste recycling facility and an ewaste recycling slum community in bangalore levels of v cr mn mo sn tl and pb were significantly higher in the workers at the ewaste recycling facility compared to the ewaste workers in the slum community however co ag cd and hg levels were significantly higher in the slum community workers compared to the facility workers a study in ghana found higher levels of urinary pahmetabolites in ewaste workers compared to unexposed controls they also found a greater frequency of complaints of cough chest pain and vertigo from those exposed to emissions from the ewaste recycling processes environmental impactedit old keyboards and one mouse the processes of dismantling and disposing of electronic waste in developing countries led to a number of environmental impacts as illustrated in the graphic liquid and atmospheric releases end up in bodies of water groundwater soil and air and therefore in land and sea animals – both domesticated and wild in crops eaten by both animals and human and in drinking water one study of environmental effects in guiyu china found the following airborne dioxins – one type found at  times

agbogbloshie multimilliondollar agreements from united states security institutions such as the defense intelligence agency dia the transportation security administration and homeland security have all resurfaced in agbogbloshie ewaste managementedit recyclingedit computer monitors are typically packed into low stacks on wooden pallets for recycling and then shrinkwrapped see also computer recycling audiovisual components televisions vcrs stereo equipment mobile phones other handheld devices and computer components contain valuable elements and substances suitable for reclamation including lead copper and gold recyclingedit one of the major challenges is recycling the printed circuit boards from the electronic wastes the circuit boards contain such precious metals as gold silver platinum etc and such base metals as copper iron aluminum etc one way ewaste is processed is by melting circuit boards burning cable sheathing to recover copper wire and open pit acid leaching for separating metals of value conventional method employed is mechanical shredding and separation but the recycling efficiency is low alternative methods such as cryogenic decomposition have been studied for printed circuit board recycling and some other methods are still under investigation properly disposing of or reusing electronics can help prevent health problems reduce greenhousegas emissions and create jobs reuse and refurbishing offer a more environmentally friendly and socially conscious alternative to downcycling processescitation needed consumer awareness effortsedit the us environmental protection agency encourages electronic recyclers to become certified by demonstrating to an accredited independent third party auditor that they meet specific standards to safely recycle and manage electronics this should work so as to ensure the highest environmental standards are being maintained two certifications for electronic recyclers currently exist and are endorsed by the epa customers are encouraged to choose certified electronics recyclers responsible electronics recycling reduces environmental and human health impacts increases the use of reusable and refurbished equipment and reduces energy use while conserving limited resources the two epaendorsed certification programs are responsible recyclers practices r and estewards certified companies ensure they are meeting strict environmental standards which maximize reuse and recycling minimize exposure to human health or the environment ensure safe management of materials and require destruction of all data used on electronics certified electronics recyclers have demonstrated through audits and other means that they continually meet specific high environmental standards and safely manage used electronics once certified the recycler is held to the particular standard by continual oversight by the independent accredited certifying body a certification board accredits and oversees certifying bodies to ensure that they meet specific responsibilities and are competent to audit and provide certification some us retailers offer opportunities for consumer recycling of discarded electronic devices in the us the consumer electronics association cea urges consumers to dispose properly of endoflife electronics through its recycling locator at wwwgreenergadgetsorg this list only includes manufacturer and retailer programs that use the strictest standards and thirdparty certified recycling locations to provide consumers assurance that their products will be recycled safely and responsibly cea research has found that  percent of consumers know where to take their endoflife electronics and the electronics industry would very much like to see that level of awareness increase consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers sponsor or operate more than  recycling locations nationwide and have vowed to recycle one billion pounds annually by  a sharp increase from  million pounds industry recycled in  the sustainable materials management electronic challenge was created by the united states environmental protection agency epa participants of the challenge are manufacturers of electronics and electronic retailers these companies collect endoflife eol electronics at various locations and send them to a certified thirdparty recycler program participants are then able publicly promote and report  responsible recycling for their companies the electronics takeback coalition is a campaign aimed at protecting human health and limiting environmental effects where electronics are being produced used and discarded the etbc aims to place responsibility for disposal of technology products on electronic manufacturers and brand owners primarily through community promotions and legal enforcement initiatives it provides recommendations for consumer recycling and a list of recyclers judged environmentally responsible the certified electronics recycler program for electronic recyclers is a comprehensive integrated management system standard that incorporates key operational and continual improvement elements for quality environmental and health and safety qehs performance the grassroots silicon valley toxics coalition focuses on promoting human health and addresses environmental justice problems resulting from toxins in technologies the world reuse repair and recycling association wraorg is an organization dedicated to improving the quality of exported electronics encouraging better recycling standards in importing countries and improving practices through fair trade principles take back my tv is a project of the electronics takeback coalition and grades television manufacturers to find out which are responsible and which are not the ewaste association of south africa ewasa has been instrumental in building a network of ewaste recyclers and refurbishers in the country it continues to drive the sustainable environmentally sound management of all ewaste in south africa ecycling central is a website from the electronic industry alliance which allows you to search for electronic recycling programs in your state it lists different recyclers by state to find reuse recycle or find donation programs across the country ewasteguideinfo is a switzerlandbased website dedicated to improving the ewaste situation in developing and transitioning countries the site contains news events case studies and more step solving the ewaste problem this website of step an initiative founded by various un organizations to develop strategies to solve the ewaste problem follows its activities and programs processing techniquesedit recycling the lead from batteries in many developed countries electronic waste processing usually first involves dismantling the equipment into various parts metal frames power supplies circuit boards plastics often by hand but increasingly by automated shredding equipment a typical example is the nadin electronic waste processing plant in novi iskar bulgaria—the largest facility of its kind in eastern europe the advantages of this process are the humans ability to recognize and save working and repairable parts including chips transistors ram etc the disadvantage is that the labor is cheapest in countries with the lowest health and safety standards in an alternative bulk system a hopper conveys material for shredding into an unsophisticated mechanical separator with screening and granulating machines to separate constituent metal and plastic fractions which are sold to smelters or plastics recyclers such recycling machinery is enclosed and employs a dust collection system some of the emissions are caught by scrubbers and screens magnets eddy currents and trommel screens are employed to separate glass plastic and ferrous and nonferrous metals which can then be further separated at a smelter leaded glass from crts is reused in car batteries ammunition and lead wheel weights or sold to foundries as a fluxing agent in processing raw lead ore copper gold palladium silver and tin are valuable metals sold to smelters for recycling hazardous smoke and gases are captured contained and treated to mitigate environmental threat these methods allow for safe reclamation of all valuable computer construction materials hewlettpackard product recycling solutions manager renee st denis describes its process as we move them through giant shredders about  feet tall and it shreds everything into pieces about the size of a quarter once your disk drive is shredded into pieces about this big its hard to get the data off an ideal electronic waste recycling plant combines dismantling for component recovery with increased costeffective processing of bulk electronic waste reuse is an alternative option to recycling because it extends the lifespan of a device devices still need eventual recycling but by allowing others to purchase used electronics recycling can be postponed and value gained from device use benefits of recyclingedit recycling raw materials from endoflife electronics is the most effective solution to the growing ewaste problem most electronic devices contain a variety of materials including metals that can be recovered for future uses by dismantling and providing reuse possibilities intact natural resources are conserved and air and water pollution caused by hazardous disposal is avoided additionally recycling reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the manufacturing of new products another benefit of recycling ewaste is that many of the materials can be recycled and reused again materials that can be recycled include ferrous ironbased and nonferrous metals glass and various types of plastic “nonferrous metals mainly aluminum and copper can all be resmelted and remanufactured ferrous metals such as steel and iron can be also be reused due to the recent surge in popularity in d printing certain d printers have been designed fdm variety to produce waste that can be easily recycled which decreases the amount of harmful pollutants in the atmosphere the excess plastic from these printers that comes out as a byproduct can also be reused to create new d printed creations benefits of recycling are extended when responsible recycling methods are used in the us responsible recycling aims to minimize the dangers to human health and the environment that disposed and dismantled electronics can create responsible recycling ensures best management practices of the electronics being recycled worker health and safety and consideration for the environment locally and abroad in europe metals that are recycled are returned to companies of origin at a reduced cost through a committed recycling system manufacturers in japan have been pushed to make their products more sustainable since many companies were responsible for the recycling of their own products this imposed responsibility on manufacturers requiring many to redesign their infrastructure as a result manufacturers in japan have the added option to sell the recycled metals electronic waste substancesedit several sizes of button and coin cell with  v batteries as a size comparison they are all recycled in many countries since they contain lead mercury and cadmium some computer components can be reused in assembling new computer products while others are reduced to metals that can be reused in applications as varied as construction flatware and jewelry substances found in large quantities include epoxy resins fiberglass pcbs pvc polyvinyl chlorides thermosetting plastics lead tin copper silicon beryllium carbon iron and aluminium elements found in small amounts include cadmium mercury and thallium elements found in trace amounts include americium antimony arsenic barium bismuth boron cobalt europium gallium germanium gold indium lithium manganese nickel niobium palladium platinum rhodium ruthenium

been discarded by their original users while there is no generally accepted definition of electronic waste in most cases electronic waste consists of electronic products that were used for data processing telecommunications or entertainment in private households and businesses that are now considered obsolete broken or irreparable despite its common classification as a waste disposed electronics are a considerable category of secondary resource due to their significant suitability for direct reuse for example many fully functional computers and components are discarded during upgrades refurbishing and material recycling of its constituent raw materials listed below re conceptualization of electronic waste as a resource thus preempts its potentially hazardous qualities electronic waste processing systems have matured in recent years following increased regulatory public and commercial scrutiny and a commensurate increase in entrepreneurial interest part of this evolution has involved greater diversion of electronic waste from energy intensive downcycling processes eg conventional recycling where equipment is reverted to a raw material form this diversion is achieved through reuse and refurbishing the environmental and social benefits of reuse are several diminished demand for new products and their commensurate requirement for virgin raw materials with their own environmental externalities not factored into the cost of the raw materials and larger quantities of pure water and electricity for associated manufacturing less packaging per unit availability of technology to wider swaths of society due to greater affordability of products and diminished use of landfills some states in the us developed policies banning crts from landfills some ewaste processing is carried out within the us the processing may be dismantling into metals plastics and circuit boards or shredding of whole appliances from  the state of california introduced a electronic waste recycling fee on all new monitors and televisions sold to cover the cost of recycling  the amount of the fee depends on the size of the monitor canada has also begun to take responsibility for electronics recycling for example in california was added to the cost of purchasing new televisions computers and computer components in british columbia the new legislation made recycling mandatory for all of those products the world is set to generate  million metric tons of electronic waste e waste this year enough to fill a line of trucks stretching halfway around the world e waste is rising three times faster than other forms of waste waste management inc which has several facilities around the country dedicated to the de manufacturing of collected endoflife electronic equipment likewise believes that price can not be a factor in cities decisions about how to handle their collected materials particularly at this point in the development of the ewaste market ewaste is consumer and business electronic equipment that is near or at the end of its useful life certain components of electronic products contain materials that render them hazardous and include heavy metals such as lead cadmium mercury and arsenic many of these elements are extremely valuable such as gold and platinum while the majority of them are nonrenewable general ewaste

crts have relatively high concentration of lead and phosphors not to be confused with phosphorus both of which are necessary for the display the united states environmental protection agency epa includes discarded crt monitors in its category of hazardous household waste but considers crts that have been set aside for testing to be commodities if they are not discarded speculatively accumulated or left unprotected from weather and other damage the eu and its member states operate a system via the european waste catalogue ewc a european council directive which is interpreted into member state law in the uk this is in the form of the list of wastes directive however the list and ewc gives broad definition ewc code    of hazardous electronic wastes requiring waste operators to employ the hazardous waste regulations annex a annex b for refined definition constituent materials in the waste also require assessment via the combination of annex ii and annex iii again allowing operators to further determine whether a waste is hazardous debate continues over the distinction between commodity and waste electronics definitions some exporters are accused of deliberately leaving difficulttorecycle obsolete or nonrepairable equipment mixed in loads of working equipment though this may also come through ignorance or to avoid more costly treatment processes protectionists may broaden the definition of waste electronics in order to protect domestic markets from working secondary equipment the high value of the computer recycling subset of electronic waste working and reusable laptops desktops and components like ram can help pay the cost of transportation for a larger number of worthless pieces than can be achieved with display devices which have less or negative scrap value in a  report ghana ewaste country assessment found that of  tons of electronics imported to ghana  were brand new and  were used of the used product the study concluded that  was not reused and was scrapped or discarded this contrasts with published but uncredited claims that  of the imports into ghana were being burned in primitive conditions amount of electronic waste worldwideedit a fragment of discarded circuit board rapid changes in technology changes in media tapes software mp falling prices and planned obsolescence have resulted in a fastgrowing surplus of electronic waste around the globe technical solutions are available but in most cases a legal framework a collection logistics and other services need to be implemented before a technical solution can be applied display units crt lcd led monitors processors cpu gpu or apu chips memory dram or sram and audio components have different useful lives processors are most frequently outdated by software no longer being optimized and are more likely to become ewaste while display units are most often replaced while working without repair attempts due to changes in wealthy nation appetites for new display technology this problem could potentially be solved with modular smartphones or phonebloks these types of phones are more durable and have the technology to change certain parts of the phone making them more environmentally friendly being able to simply replace the part of the phone that is broken will reduce ewaste an estimated  million tons of ewaste are produced each year the usa discards  million computers each year and  million phones are disposed of in europe each year the environmental protection agency estimates that only – of ewaste is recycled the rest of these electronics go directly into landfills and incinerators in  the united nations estimated the amount of worldwide electronic waste discarded each year to be  million metric tons according to a report by unep titled recycling – from ewaste to resources the amount of ewaste being produced – including mobile phones and computers – could rise by as much as  percent over the next decade in some countries such as india the united states is the world leader in producing electronic waste tossing away about  million tons each year china already produces about  million tons  estimate domestically second only to the united states and despite having banned ewaste imports china remains a major ewaste dumping ground for developed countries society today revolves around technology and by the constant need for the newest and most hightech products we are contributing to mass amount of ewaste since the invention of the iphone cell phones have become the top source of ewaste products because they are not made to last more than two years electrical waste contains hazardous but also valuable and scarce materials up to  elements can be found in complex electronics as of  apple has sold over  million idevices ipod iphone ipad cell phone companies make cell phones that are not made to last so that the consumer will purchase new phones companies give these products such short life spans because they know that the consumer will want a new product and will buy it if they make it in the united states an estimated  of heavy metals in landfills comes from discarded electronics while there is agreement that the number of discarded electronic devices is increasing there is considerable disagreement about the relative risk compared to automobile scrap for example and strong disagreement whether curtailing trade in used electronics will improve conditions or make them worse according to an article in motherboard attempts to restrict the trade have driven reputable companies out of the supply chain with unintended consequences global trade issuesedit see also global waste trade and electronic waste by country electronic waste is often exported to developing countries volt d c aa aaa aaaa a volt cr and lr cells are all recyclable in most countries the ewaste centre of agbogbloshie ghana where electronic waste is burnt and disassembled with no safety or environmental considerations one theory is that increased regulation of electronic waste and concern over the environmental harm in nature economies creates an economic disincentive to remove residues prior to export critics of trade in used electronics maintain that it is still too easy for brokers calling themselves recyclers to export unscreened electronic waste to developing countries such as china india and parts of africa thus avoiding the expense of removing items like bad cathode ray tubes the processing of which is expensive and difficult the developing countries have become toxic dump yards of ewaste proponents of international trade point to the success of fair trade programs in other industries where cooperation has led to creation of sustainable jobs and can bring affordable technology in countries where repair and reuse rates are higher defenders of the tradewho in used electronics say that extraction of metals from virgin mining has been shifted to developing countries recycling of copper silver gold and other materials from discarded electronic devices is considered better for the environment than mining they also state that repair and reuse of computers and televisions has become a lost art in wealthier nations and that refurbishing has traditionally been a path to development south korea taiwan and southern china all excelled in finding retained value in used goods and in some cases have set up billiondollar industries in refurbishing used ink cartridges singleuse cameras and working crts refurbishing has traditionally been a threat to established manufacturing and simple protectionism explains some criticism of the trade works like the waste makers by vance packard explain some of the criticism of exports of working product for example the ban on import of tested working pentium  laptops to china or the bans on export of used surplus working electronics by japan opponents of surplus electronics exports argue that lower environmental and labor standards cheap labor and the relatively high value of recovered raw materials leads to a transfer of pollutiongenerating activities such as smelting of copper wire in china malaysia india kenya and various african countries electronic waste is being sent to these countries for processing sometimes illegally many surplus laptops are routed to developing nations as dumping grounds for ewaste because the united states has not ratified the basel convention or its ban amendment and has few domestic federal laws forbidding the export of toxic waste the basel action network estimates that about  of the electronic waste directed to recycling in the us does not get recycled there at all but is put on container ships and sent to countries such as china this figure is disputed as an exaggeration by the epa the institute of scrap recycling industries and the world reuse repair and recycling association independent research by arizona state university showed that – of imported used computers did not have a higher value than the best value of the constituent materials they contained and that the official trade in endoflife computers is thus driven by reuse as opposed to recycling tradeedit proponents of the trade say growth of internet access is a stronger correlation to trade than poverty haiti is poor and closer to the port of new york than southeast asia but far more electronic waste is exported from new york to asia than to haiti thousands of men women and children are employed in reuse refurbishing repair and remanufacturing unsustainable industries in decline in developed countries denying developing nations access to used electronics may deny them sustainable employment affordable products and internet access or force them to deal with even less scrupulous suppliers in a series of seven articles for the atlantic shanghaibased reporter adam minter describes many of these computer repair and scrap separation activities as objectively sustainable opponents of the trade argue that developing countries utilize methods that are more harmful and more wasteful an expedient and prevalent method is simply to toss equipment onto an open fire in order to melt plastics and to burn away nonvaluable metals this releases carcinogens and neurotoxins into the air contributing to an acrid lingering smog these noxious fumes include dioxins and furans bonfire refuse can be disposed of quickly into drainage ditches or waterways feeding the ocean or local water supplies in june  a container of electronic waste destined from the port of oakland in the us to sanshui district in mainland china was intercepted in hong kong by greenpeace concern over exports of electronic waste were raised in press reports in india ghana côte divoire and nigeria guiyuedit main article electronic waste in china guiyu in the shantou region of china is a massive electronic waste processing community it is often referred to as the ewaste capital of the world traditionally guiyu was an agricultural community however in the mids it transformed into an ewaste recycling center involving over  of the local households and an additional  migrant workers thousands of individual workshops employ laborers to snip cables pry chips from circuit boards grind plastic computer cases into particles and dip circuit boards in acid baths to dissolve the precious metals others work to strip insulation from all wiring in an attempt to salvage tiny amounts of copper wire uncontrolled burning disassembly and disposal has led to a number of environmental problems such as groundwater contamination atmospheric pollution and water pollution either by immediate discharge or from surface runoff especially near coastal areas as well as health problems including occupational safety and health effects among those directly and indirectly involved due to the methods of processing the waste a number of studies have been conducted to measure a number of chemicals associated with informal ewaste recycling in the populations one study enrolled children from guiyu and a control site  km away to measure blood lead levels blls the average bll in guiyu was  ugdl compared to  ugdl in the control site in the united states the cdc has set a reference level for blood lead at  ugdl high levels of lead in young children can impact iq and the development of the central nervous system the highest concentrations of lead were found in the children of parents whose workshop dealt with circuit boards and the lowest was among those who recycled plastic six of the many villages in guiyu specialize in circuitboard disassembly seven in plastics and metals reprocessing and two in wire and cable disassembly greenpeace an environmental group sampled dust soil river sediment and groundwater in guiyu they found very high levels of toxic heavy metals and organic contaminants in both places lai yun a campaigner for the group found over  poisonous metals such as lead mercury and cadmium guiyu is only one example of digital dumps but similar places can be found across the world in nigeria ghana and india with amounts of ewaste growing rapidly each year urgent solutions are required while the waste continues to flow into digital dumps like guiyu there are measures that can help reduce the flow of ewaste a suggested preventative step involves the major electronics firms removing the worst chemicals in their products in order to make them safer and easier to recycle other informal ewaste recycling sitesedit a pile of discarded tvs and computer monitors guiyu is likely one of the oldest and largest informal ewaste recycling sites in the world however there are many sites worldwide including india ghana nigeria and the philippines most research involving informal ewaste recycling has been done in guiyu but there are a handful of studies that describe exposure levels in ewaste workers the community and the environmentcitation needed bangalore located in southern india is often referred as the silicon valley of india and has a growing informal ewaste recycling sector hair samples were collected from workers at an ewaste recycling facility and an ewaste recycling slum community in bangalore levels of v cr mn mo sn tl and pb were significantly higher in the workers at the ewaste recycling facility compared to the ewaste workers in the slum community however co ag cd and hg levels were significantly higher in the slum community workers compared to the facility workers a study in ghana found higher levels of urinary pahmetabolites in ewaste workers compared to unexposed controls they also found a greater frequency of complaints of cough chest pain and vertigo from those exposed to emissions from the ewaste recycling processes environmental impactedit old keyboards and one mouse the processes of dismantling and disposing of electronic waste in developing countries led to a number of environmental impacts as illustrated in the graphic liquid and atmospheric releases end up in bodies of water groundwater soil and air and therefore in land and sea animals – both domesticated and wild in crops eaten by both animals and human and in drinking water one study of environmental effects in guiyu china found the following airborne dioxins – one type found at  times levels previously measured levels of carcinogens in duck

computer monitors are typically packed into low stacks on wooden pallets for recycling and then shrinkwrapped see also computer recycling audiovisual components televisions vcrs stereo equipment mobile phones other handheld devices and computer components contain valuable elements and substances suitable for reclamation including lead copper and gold recyclingedit one of the major challenges is recycling the printed circuit boards from the electronic wastes the circuit boards contain such precious metals as gold silver platinum etc and such base metals as copper iron aluminum etc one way ewaste is processed is by melting circuit boards burning cable sheathing to recover copper wire and open pit acid leaching for separating metals of value conventional method employed is mechanical shredding and separation but the recycling efficiency is low alternative methods such as cryogenic decomposition have been studied for printed circuit board recycling and some other methods are still under investigation properly disposing of or reusing electronics can help prevent health problems reduce greenhousegas emissions and create jobs reuse and refurbishing offer a more environmentally friendly and socially conscious alternative to downcycling processescitation needed consumer awareness effortsedit the us environmental protection agency encourages electronic recyclers to become certified by demonstrating to an accredited independent third party auditor that they meet specific standards to safely recycle and manage electronics this should work so as to ensure the highest environmental standards are being maintained two certifications for electronic recyclers currently exist and are endorsed by the epa customers are encouraged to choose certified electronics recyclers responsible electronics recycling reduces environmental and human health impacts increases the use of reusable and refurbished equipment and reduces energy use while conserving limited resources the two epaendorsed certification programs are responsible recyclers practices r and estewards certified companies ensure they are meeting strict environmental standards which maximize reuse and recycling minimize exposure to human health or the environment ensure safe management of materials and require destruction of all data used on electronics certified electronics recyclers have demonstrated through audits and other means that they continually meet specific high environmental standards and safely manage used electronics once certified the recycler is held to the particular standard by continual oversight by the independent accredited certifying body a certification board accredits and oversees certifying bodies to ensure that they meet specific responsibilities and are competent to audit and provide certification some us retailers offer opportunities for consumer recycling of discarded electronic devices in the us the consumer electronics association cea urges consumers to dispose properly of endoflife electronics through its recycling locator at wwwgreenergadgetsorg this list only includes manufacturer and retailer programs that use the strictest standards and thirdparty certified recycling locations to provide consumers assurance that their products will be recycled safely and responsibly cea research has found that  percent of consumers know where to take their endoflife electronics and the electronics industry would very much like to see that level of awareness increase consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers sponsor or operate more than  recycling locations nationwide and have vowed to recycle one billion pounds annually by  a sharp increase from  million pounds industry recycled in  the sustainable materials management electronic challenge was created by the united states environmental protection agency epa participants of the challenge are manufacturers of electronics and electronic retailers these companies collect endoflife eol electronics at various locations and send them to a certified thirdparty recycler program participants are then able publicly promote and report  responsible recycling for their companies the electronics takeback coalition is a campaign aimed at protecting human health and limiting environmental effects where electronics are being produced used and discarded the etbc aims to place responsibility for disposal of technology products on electronic manufacturers and brand owners primarily through community promotions and legal enforcement initiatives it provides recommendations for consumer recycling and a list of recyclers judged environmentally responsible the certified electronics recycler program for electronic recyclers is a comprehensive integrated management system standard that incorporates key operational and continual improvement elements for quality environmental and health and safety qehs performance the grassroots silicon valley toxics coalition focuses on promoting human health and addresses environmental justice problems resulting from toxins in technologies the world reuse repair and recycling association wraorg is an organization dedicated to improving the quality of exported electronics encouraging better recycling standards in importing countries and improving practices through fair trade principles take back my tv is a project of the electronics takeback coalition and grades television manufacturers to find out which are responsible and which are not the ewaste association of south africa ewasa has been instrumental in building a network of ewaste recyclers and refurbishers in the country it continues to drive the sustainable environmentally sound management of all ewaste in south africa ecycling central is a website from the electronic industry alliance which allows you to search for electronic recycling programs in your state it lists different recyclers by state to find reuse recycle or find donation programs across the country ewasteguideinfo is a switzerlandbased website dedicated to improving the ewaste situation in developing and transitioning countries the site contains news events case studies and more step solving the ewaste problem this website of step an initiative founded by various un organizations to develop strategies to solve the ewaste problem follows its activities and programs processing techniquesedit recycling the lead from batteries in many developed countries electronic waste processing usually first involves dismantling the equipment into various parts metal frames power supplies circuit boards plastics often by hand but increasingly by automated shredding equipment a typical example is the nadin electronic waste processing plant in novi iskar bulgaria—the largest facility of its kind in eastern europe the advantages of this process are the humans ability to recognize and save working and repairable parts including chips transistors ram etc the disadvantage is that the labor is cheapest in countries with the lowest health and safety standards in an alternative bulk system a hopper conveys material for shredding into an unsophisticated mechanical separator with screening and granulating machines to separate constituent metal and plastic fractions which are sold to smelters or plastics recyclers such recycling machinery is enclosed and employs a dust collection system some of the emissions are caught by scrubbers and screens magnets eddy currents and trommel screens are employed to separate glass plastic and ferrous and nonferrous metals which can then be further separated at a smelter leaded glass from crts is reused in car batteries ammunition and lead wheel weights or sold to foundries as a fluxing agent in processing raw lead ore copper gold palladium silver and tin are valuable metals sold to smelters for recycling hazardous smoke and gases are captured contained and treated to mitigate environmental threat these methods allow for safe reclamation of all valuable computer construction materials hewlettpackard product recycling solutions manager renee st denis describes its process as we move them through giant shredders about  feet tall and it shreds everything into pieces about the size of a quarter once your disk drive is shredded into pieces about this big its hard to get the data off an ideal electronic waste recycling plant combines dismantling for component recovery with increased costeffective processing of bulk electronic waste reuse is an alternative option to recycling because it extends the lifespan of a device devices still need eventual recycling but by allowing others to purchase used electronics recycling can be postponed and value gained from device use benefits of recyclingedit recycling raw materials from endoflife electronics is the most effective solution to the growing ewaste problem most electronic devices contain a variety of materials including metals that can be recovered for future uses by dismantling and providing reuse possibilities intact natural resources are conserved and air and water pollution caused by hazardous disposal is avoided additionally recycling reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the manufacturing of new products another benefit of recycling ewaste is that many of the materials can be recycled and reused again materials that can be recycled include ferrous ironbased and nonferrous metals glass and various types of plastic “nonferrous metals mainly aluminum and copper can all be resmelted and remanufactured ferrous metals such as steel and iron can be also be reused due to the recent surge in popularity in d printing certain d printers have been designed fdm variety to produce waste that can be easily recycled which decreases the amount of harmful pollutants in the atmosphere the excess plastic from these printers that comes out as a byproduct can also be reused to create new d printed creations benefits of recycling are extended when responsible recycling methods are used in the us responsible recycling aims to minimize the dangers to human health and the environment that disposed and dismantled electronics can create responsible recycling ensures best management practices of the electronics being recycled worker health and safety and consideration for the environment locally and abroad in europe metals that are recycled are returned to companies of origin at a reduced cost through a committed recycling system manufacturers in japan have been pushed to make their products more sustainable since many companies were responsible for the recycling of their own products this imposed responsibility on manufacturers requiring many to redesign their infrastructure as a result manufacturers in japan have the added option to sell the recycled metals electronic waste substancesedit several sizes of button and coin cell with  v batteries as a size comparison they are all recycled in many countries since they contain lead mercury and cadmium some computer components can be reused in assembling new computer products while others are reduced to metals that can be reused

plastic etc to be commodities and reserve the term waste for residue or material which is dumped by the buyer rather than recycled including residue from reuse and recycling operations because loads of surplus electronics are frequently commingled good recyclable and nonrecyclable several public policy advocates apply the term ewaste broadly to all surplus electronics cathode ray tubes crts are considered one of the hardest types to recycle crts have relatively high concentration of lead and phosphors not to be confused with phosphorus both of which are necessary for the display the united states environmental protection agency epa includes discarded crt monitors in its category of hazardous household waste but considers crts that have been set aside for testing to be commodities if they are not discarded speculatively accumulated or left unprotected from weather and other damage the eu and its member states operate a system via the european waste catalogue ewc a european council directive which is interpreted into member state law in the uk this is in the form of the list of wastes directive however the list and ewc gives broad definition ewc code    of hazardous electronic wastes requiring waste operators to employ the hazardous waste regulations annex a annex b for refined definition constituent materials in the waste also require assessment via the combination of annex ii and annex iii again allowing operators to further determine whether a waste is hazardous debate continues over the distinction between commodity and waste electronics definitions some exporters are accused of deliberately leaving difficulttorecycle obsolete or nonrepairable equipment mixed in loads of working equipment though this may also come through ignorance or to avoid more costly treatment processes protectionists may broaden the definition of waste electronics in order to protect domestic markets from working secondary equipment the high value of the computer recycling subset of electronic waste working and reusable laptops desktops and components like ram can help pay the cost of transportation for a larger number of worthless pieces than can be achieved with display devices which have less or negative scrap value in a  report ghana ewaste country assessment found that of  tons of electronics imported to ghana  were brand new and  were used of the used product the study concluded that  was not reused and was scrapped or discarded this contrasts with published but uncredited claims that  of the imports into ghana were being burned in primitive conditions amount of electronic waste worldwideedit a fragment of discarded circuit board rapid changes in technology changes in media tapes software mp falling prices and planned obsolescence have resulted in a fastgrowing surplus of electronic waste around the globe technical solutions are available but in most cases a legal framework a collection logistics and other services need to be implemented before a technical solution can be applied display units crt lcd led monitors processors cpu gpu or apu chips memory dram or sram and audio components have different useful lives processors are most frequently outdated by software no longer being optimized and are more likely to become ewaste while display units are most often replaced while working without repair attempts due to changes in wealthy nation appetites for new display technology this problem could potentially be solved with modular smartphones or phonebloks these types of phones are more durable and have the technology to change certain parts of the phone making them more environmentally friendly being able to simply replace the part of the phone that is broken will reduce ewaste an estimated  million tons of ewaste are produced each year the usa discards  million computers each year and  million phones are disposed of in europe each year the environmental protection agency estimates that only – of ewaste is recycled the rest of these electronics go directly into landfills and incinerators in  the united nations estimated the amount of worldwide electronic waste discarded each year to be  million metric tons according to a report by unep titled recycling – from ewaste to resources the amount of ewaste being produced – including mobile phones and computers – could rise by as much as  percent over the next decade in some countries such as india the united states is the world leader in producing electronic waste tossing away about  million tons each year china already produces about  million tons  estimate domestically second only to the united states and despite having banned ewaste imports china remains a major ewaste dumping ground for developed countries society today revolves around technology and by the constant need for the newest and most hightech products we are contributing to mass amount of ewaste since the invention of the iphone cell phones have become the top source of ewaste products because they are not made to last more than two years electrical waste contains hazardous but also valuable and scarce materials up to  elements can be found in complex electronics as of  apple has sold over  million idevices ipod iphone ipad cell phone companies make cell phones that are not made to last so that the consumer will purchase new phones companies give these products such short life spans because they know that the consumer will want a new product and will buy it if they make it in the united states an estimated  of heavy metals in landfills comes from discarded electronics while there is agreement that the number of discarded electronic devices is increasing there is considerable disagreement about the relative risk compared to automobile scrap for example and strong disagreement whether curtailing trade in used electronics will improve conditions or make them worse according to an article in motherboard attempts to restrict the trade have driven reputable companies out of the supply chain with unintended consequences global trade issuesedit see also global waste trade and electronic waste by country electronic waste is often exported to developing countries volt d c aa aaa aaaa a volt cr and lr cells are all recyclable in most countries the ewaste centre of agbogbloshie ghana where electronic waste is burnt and disassembled with no safety or environmental considerations one theory is that increased regulation of electronic waste and concern over the environmental harm in nature economies creates an economic disincentive to remove residues prior to export critics of trade in used electronics maintain that it is still too easy for brokers calling themselves recyclers to export unscreened electronic waste to developing countries such as china india and parts of africa thus avoiding the expense of removing items like bad cathode ray tubes the processing of which is expensive and difficult the developing countries have become toxic dump yards of ewaste proponents of international trade point to the success of fair trade programs in other industries where cooperation has led to creation of sustainable jobs and can bring affordable technology in countries where repair and reuse rates are higher defenders of the tradewho in used electronics say that extraction of metals from virgin mining has been shifted to developing countries recycling of copper silver gold and other materials from discarded electronic devices is considered better for the environment than mining they also state that repair and reuse of computers and televisions has become a lost art in wealthier nations and that refurbishing has traditionally been a path to development south korea taiwan and southern china all excelled in finding retained value in used goods and in some cases have set up billiondollar industries in refurbishing used ink cartridges singleuse cameras and working crts refurbishing has traditionally been a threat to established manufacturing and simple protectionism explains some criticism of the trade works like the waste makers by vance packard explain some of the criticism of exports of working product for example the ban on import of tested working pentium  laptops to china or the bans on export of used surplus working electronics by japan opponents of surplus electronics exports argue that lower environmental and labor standards cheap labor and the relatively high value of recovered raw materials leads to a transfer of pollutiongenerating activities such as smelting of copper wire in china malaysia india kenya and various african countries electronic waste is being sent to these countries for processing sometimes illegally many surplus laptops are routed to developing nations as dumping grounds for ewaste because the united states has not ratified the basel convention or its ban amendment and has few domestic federal laws forbidding the export of toxic waste the basel action network estimates that about  of the electronic waste directed to recycling in the us does not get recycled there at all but is put on container ships and sent to countries such as china this figure is disputed as an exaggeration by the epa the institute of scrap recycling industries and the world reuse repair and recycling association independent research by arizona state university showed that – of imported used computers did not have a higher value than the best value of the constituent materials they contained and that the official trade in endoflife computers is thus driven by reuse as opposed to recycling tradeedit proponents of the trade say growth of internet access is a stronger correlation to trade than poverty haiti is poor and closer to the port of new york than southeast asia but far more electronic waste is exported from new york to asia than to haiti thousands of men women and children are employed in reuse refurbishing repair and remanufacturing unsustainable industries in decline in developed countries denying developing nations access to used electronics may deny them sustainable employment affordable products and internet access or force them to deal with even less scrupulous suppliers in a series of seven articles for the atlantic shanghaibased reporter adam minter describes many of these computer repair and scrap separation activities as objectively sustainable opponents of the trade argue that developing countries utilize methods that are more harmful and more wasteful an expedient and prevalent method is simply to toss equipment onto an open fire in order to melt plastics and to burn away nonvaluable metals this releases carcinogens and neurotoxins into the air contributing to an acrid lingering smog these noxious fumes include dioxins and furans bonfire refuse can be disposed of quickly into drainage ditches or waterways feeding the ocean or local water supplies in june  a container of electronic waste destined from the port of oakland in the us to sanshui district in mainland china was intercepted in hong kong by greenpeace concern over exports of electronic waste were raised in press reports in india ghana côte divoire and nigeria guiyuedit main article electronic waste in china guiyu in the shantou region of china is a massive electronic waste processing community it is often referred to as the ewaste capital of the world traditionally guiyu was an agricultural community however in the mids it transformed into an ewaste recycling center involving over  of the local households and an additional  migrant workers thousands of individual workshops employ laborers to snip cables pry chips from circuit boards grind plastic computer cases into particles and dip circuit boards in acid baths to dissolve the precious metals others work to strip insulation from all wiring in an attempt to salvage tiny amounts of copper wire uncontrolled burning disassembly and disposal has led to a number of environmental problems such as groundwater contamination atmospheric pollution and water pollution either by immediate discharge or from surface runoff especially near coastal areas as well as health problems including occupational safety and health effects among those directly and indirectly involved due to the methods of processing the waste a number of studies have been conducted to measure a number of chemicals associated with informal ewaste recycling in the populations one study enrolled children from guiyu and a control site  km away to measure blood lead levels blls the average bll in guiyu was  ugdl compared to  ugdl in the control site in the united states the cdc has set a reference level for blood lead at  ugdl high levels of lead in young children can impact iq and the development of the central nervous system the highest concentrations of lead were found in the children of parents whose workshop dealt with circuit boards and the lowest was among those who recycled plastic six of the many villages in guiyu specialize in circuitboard disassembly seven in plastics and metals reprocessing and two in wire and cable disassembly greenpeace an environmental group sampled dust soil river sediment and groundwater in guiyu they found very high levels of toxic heavy metals and organic contaminants in both places lai yun a campaigner for the group found over  poisonous metals such as lead mercury and cadmium guiyu is only one example of digital dumps but similar places can be found across the world in nigeria ghana and india with amounts of ewaste growing rapidly each year urgent solutions are required while the waste continues to flow into digital dumps like guiyu there are measures that can help reduce the flow of ewaste a suggested preventative step involves the major electronics firms removing the worst chemicals in their products in order to make them safer and easier to recycle other informal ewaste recycling sitesedit a pile of discarded tvs and computer monitors guiyu is likely one of the oldest and largest informal ewaste recycling sites in the world however there are many sites worldwide including india ghana nigeria and the philippines most research involving informal ewaste recycling has been done in guiyu but there are a handful of studies that describe exposure levels in ewaste workers the community and the environmentcitation needed bangalore located in southern india is often referred as the silicon valley of india and has a growing informal ewaste recycling sector hair samples were collected from workers at an ewaste recycling facility and an ewaste recycling slum community in bangalore levels of v cr mn mo sn tl and pb were significantly higher in the workers at the ewaste recycling facility compared to the ewaste workers in the slum community however co ag cd and hg levels were significantly higher in the slum community workers compared to the facility workers a study in ghana found higher levels of urinary pahmetabolites in ewaste workers compared to unexposed controls they also found a greater frequency of complaints of cough chest pain and vertigo from those exposed to emissions from the ewaste recycling processes environmental impactedit old keyboards and one mouse the processes of dismantling and disposing of electronic waste in developing countries led to a number of environmental impacts as illustrated in the graphic liquid and atmospheric releases end up in bodies of water groundwater soil and air and therefore in land and sea animals – both domesticated and wild in crops eaten by both animals and human and in drinking water one study of environmental effects in guiyu china found the following airborne dioxins – one type found at  times

recycling audiovisual components televisions vcrs stereo equipment mobile phones other handheld devices and computer components contain valuable elements and substances suitable for reclamation including lead copper and gold recyclingedit one of the major challenges is recycling the printed circuit boards from the electronic wastes the circuit boards contain such precious metals as gold silver platinum etc and such base metals as copper iron aluminum etc one way ewaste is processed is by melting circuit boards burning cable sheathing to recover copper wire and open pit acid leaching for separating metals of value conventional method employed is mechanical shredding and separation but the recycling efficiency is low alternative methods such as cryogenic decomposition have been studied for printed circuit board recycling and some other methods are still under investigation properly disposing of or reusing electronics can help prevent health problems reduce greenhousegas emissions and create jobs reuse and refurbishing offer a more environmentally friendly and socially conscious alternative to downcycling processescitation needed consumer awareness effortsedit the us environmental protection agency encourages electronic recyclers to become certified by demonstrating to an accredited independent third party auditor that they meet specific standards to safely recycle and manage electronics this should work so as to ensure the highest environmental standards are being maintained two certifications for electronic recyclers currently exist and are endorsed by the epa customers are encouraged to choose certified electronics recyclers responsible electronics recycling reduces environmental and human health impacts increases the use of reusable and refurbished equipment and reduces energy use while conserving limited resources the two epaendorsed certification programs are responsible recyclers practices r and estewards certified companies ensure they are meeting strict environmental standards which maximize reuse and recycling minimize exposure to human health or the environment ensure safe management of materials and require destruction of all data used on electronics certified electronics recyclers have demonstrated through audits and other means that they continually meet specific high environmental standards and safely manage used electronics once certified the recycler is held to the particular standard by continual oversight by the independent accredited certifying body a certification board accredits and oversees certifying bodies to ensure that they meet specific responsibilities and are competent to audit and provide certification some us retailers offer opportunities for consumer recycling of discarded electronic devices in the us the consumer electronics association cea urges consumers to dispose properly of endoflife electronics through its recycling locator at wwwgreenergadgetsorg this list only includes manufacturer and retailer programs that use the strictest standards and thirdparty certified recycling locations to provide consumers assurance that their products will be recycled safely and responsibly cea research has found that  percent of consumers know where to take their endoflife electronics and the electronics industry would very much like to see that level of awareness increase consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers sponsor or operate more than  recycling locations nationwide and have vowed to recycle one billion pounds annually by  a sharp increase from  million pounds industry recycled in  the sustainable materials management electronic challenge was created by the united states environmental protection agency epa participants of the challenge are manufacturers of electronics and electronic retailers these companies collect endoflife eol electronics at various locations and send them to a certified thirdparty recycler program participants are then able publicly promote and report  responsible recycling for their companies the electronics takeback coalition is a campaign aimed at protecting human health and limiting environmental effects where electronics are being produced used and discarded the etbc aims to place responsibility for disposal of technology products on electronic manufacturers and brand owners primarily through community promotions and legal enforcement initiatives it provides recommendations for consumer recycling and a list of recyclers judged environmentally responsible the certified electronics recycler program for electronic recyclers is a comprehensive integrated management system standard that incorporates key operational and continual improvement elements for quality environmental and health and safety qehs performance the grassroots silicon valley toxics coalition focuses on promoting human health and addresses environmental justice problems resulting from toxins in technologies the world reuse repair and recycling association wraorg is an organization dedicated to improving the quality of exported electronics encouraging better recycling standards in importing countries and improving practices through fair trade principles take back my tv is a project of the electronics takeback coalition and grades television manufacturers to find out which are responsible and which are not the ewaste association of south africa ewasa has been instrumental in building a network of ewaste recyclers and refurbishers in the country it continues to drive the sustainable environmentally sound management of all ewaste in south africa ecycling central is a website from the electronic industry alliance which allows you to search for electronic recycling programs in your state it lists different recyclers by state to find reuse recycle or find donation programs across the country ewasteguideinfo is a switzerlandbased website dedicated to improving the ewaste situation in developing and transitioning countries the site contains news events case studies and more step solving the ewaste problem this website of step an initiative founded by various un organizations to develop strategies to solve the ewaste problem follows its activities and programs processing techniquesedit recycling the lead from batteries in many developed countries electronic waste processing usually first involves dismantling the equipment into various parts metal frames power supplies circuit boards plastics often by hand but increasingly by automated shredding equipment a typical example is the nadin electronic waste processing plant in novi iskar bulgaria—the largest facility of its kind in eastern europe the advantages of this process are the humans ability to recognize and save working and repairable parts including chips transistors ram etc the disadvantage is that the labor is cheapest in countries with the lowest health and safety standards in an alternative bulk system a hopper conveys material for shredding into an unsophisticated mechanical separator with screening and granulating machines to separate constituent metal and plastic fractions which are sold to smelters or plastics recyclers such recycling machinery is enclosed and employs a dust collection system some of the emissions are caught by scrubbers and screens magnets eddy currents and trommel screens are employed to separate glass plastic and ferrous and nonferrous metals which can then be further separated at a smelter leaded glass from crts is reused in car batteries ammunition and lead wheel weights or sold to foundries as a fluxing agent in processing raw lead ore copper gold palladium silver and tin are valuable metals sold to smelters for recycling hazardous smoke and gases are captured contained and treated to mitigate environmental threat these methods allow for safe reclamation of all valuable computer construction materials hewlettpackard product recycling solutions manager renee st denis describes its process as we move them through giant shredders about  feet tall and it shreds everything into pieces about the size of a quarter once your disk drive is shredded into pieces about this big its hard to get the data off an ideal electronic waste recycling plant combines dismantling for component recovery with increased costeffective processing of bulk electronic waste reuse is an alternative option to recycling because it extends the lifespan of a device devices still need eventual recycling but by allowing others to purchase used electronics recycling can be postponed and value gained from device use benefits of recyclingedit recycling raw materials from endoflife electronics is the most effective solution to the growing ewaste problem most electronic devices contain a variety of materials including metals that can be recovered for future uses by dismantling and providing reuse possibilities intact natural resources are conserved and air and water pollution caused by hazardous disposal is avoided additionally recycling reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the manufacturing of new products another benefit of recycling ewaste is that many of the materials can be recycled and reused again materials that can be recycled include ferrous ironbased and nonferrous metals glass and various types of plastic “nonferrous metals mainly aluminum and copper can all be resmelted and remanufactured ferrous metals such as steel and iron can be also be reused due to the recent surge in popularity in d printing certain d printers have been designed fdm variety to produce waste that can be easily recycled which decreases the amount of harmful pollutants in the atmosphere the excess plastic from these printers that comes out as a byproduct can also be reused to create new d printed creations benefits of recycling are extended when responsible recycling methods are used in the us responsible recycling aims to minimize the dangers to human health and the environment that disposed and dismantled electronics can create responsible recycling ensures best management practices of the electronics being recycled worker health and safety and consideration for the environment locally and abroad in europe metals that are recycled are returned to companies of origin at a reduced cost through a committed recycling system manufacturers in japan have been pushed to make their products more sustainable since many companies were responsible for the recycling of their own products this imposed responsibility on manufacturers requiring many to redesign their infrastructure as a result manufacturers in japan have the added option to sell the recycled metals electronic waste substancesedit several sizes of button and coin cell with  v batteries as a size comparison they are all recycled in many countries since they contain lead mercury and cadmium some computer components can be reused in assembling new computer products while others are reduced to metals that can be reused in applications as varied as construction flatware and jewelry substances found in large quantities include epoxy resins fiberglass pcbs pvc polyvinyl chlorides thermosetting plastics lead tin copper silicon beryllium carbon iron and aluminium elements found in small amounts include cadmium mercury and thallium elements

penn valley double disc pump there are distinct technology differences between a double disc pump and a diaphragm pump penn valley pump company manufactures a true double disc pump technology while wastecorp pumps manufactures a diaphragm pump they are trying to market as a double disc pump penn valley pump – true double disc pump technology a true double disc pump technology is based on a “noncaptive” free disc design whereby two  discs are staged in the pump housing these discs work simultaneously together to perform the duties of both the pumping element and valving element the hydraulic interaction between the discs creates both vacuum and pressure simultaneously to move fluid from suction to discharge since the discs are not captive in the housing they are not subject to the flex fatigue failure pattern associated with captive diaphragm pump designs the discs are of integral elastomer design with rigid core and do not have any external metal components the double disc pump has a short stroke length created by eccentric cams pinned to the drive shaft the pump design provides for positive valving on every stroke since the discs are mechanically driven on the seat the pump incorporates an inlet side foot valve we termed a clack valve this device is a priming and repriming aid and only sees action under a suction lift condition or when the suction line is under a vacuum condition in flooded suction applications this device does not get back to the seating surface and does not valve the pump will operate without the clack valve on flooded suction applications this unique design allows the pump to pass larger solids rags and debris that will cause designs with internal check valves to clog and fail wastecorp pump technology the wastecorp pump technology incorporates one  “captive” diaphragm that is “sandwiched” between the pump housing and retaining mechanism each diaphragm pump is a simplex unit that contains one diaphragm and two ball check valves a duplex diaphragm pump adds another simplex pump in parallel and then drives it with a common motor a triplex pump adds a third and so on in order to accomplish higher flow rates the center of the diaphragm is mechanically attached to a connecting rod that raises and lowers the diaphragm on every revolution the stroke length is large and leads to a flexing the diaphragm twice upstroke and down stroke per revolution this design also requires the use of internal check valves ball or flapper for operation without these check valves the pump will not operate the “achilles” heel of the diaphragm pump technology has always been the flex fatigue life of the diaphragm and the clogging of the ball check valves the check valves rely on gravity to get back to the seating surface and when debris gets trapped between the ball valve and seat the unit stops pumping the reason these designs have a quick release cap to access the ball valve is that clogging is a frequent occurrence requiring the check valve to be accessed and the debris removed so the pump can be made operational again the typical operating life between rebuilds for a double disc pump is thousands of hours since the discs are not captive and therefore not subject to flex fatigue failure industry feedback on the diaphragm pump technology is that the lifespan of the diaphragm only lasts in the hundreds of hours given the flexing action of the diaphragm this is a significant difference in the pump technologies and therefore the reliability and longterm operational costs between a double disc pump and diaphragm pump wastecorp pumps – not a double disc pump wastecorp has manufactured the mudsucker® brand diaphragm pump technology for many years and properly called it a diaphragm pump this technology has never been accepted in the marketplace as an “equal” to the penn valley double disc pump and in fact has never been offered as an “or equal” before it has only been seen as a contractor’s pump and used in relatively light duty applications due the limited run hours between diaphragm failure and low head limitations it was not until january of  that wastecorp began marketing the sludge pro® branded pump as a double disc pump they modified the bearing pedestal design so externally the pump looks similar to our design they renamed the diaphragm a “trunnion” and the external metal plate that attaches the connecting rod to the diaphragm a “disc” there appears to be no other differences between the mudsucker pump and sludge pro pump wastecorp literature suggests the mudsucker pump has an average speed of rpm with head limitations of  vertical feet and  horizontal feed that would be a maximum limitation of ft tdh or  psi wastecorp now says their double disc diaphragm pump can be operated up to rpm with total heads to ft tdh higher speeds and heads will greatly impact the life of the diaphgram exponentially pump comparisondouble disc pump vs mechanical diaphragm pump features penn valley pump – double disc pump wastecorp pumps – sludgepro double disc “diaphragm” pump technology a true double disc pump technology based on “noncaptive” freefloating disc design whereby two independent discs perform duties of both pump and valve short stroke length not subject to flex fatigue failure and operates into the thousands of hours between rebuilds a traditional single “captive” diaphragm technology that requires internal ball check valves for operation long stroke length and captive diaphragm leads to flex fatigue failures in the hundreds of hours discs integral no external metal components reinforced elastomeric component that is both the pumping and valving element wastecorp’s disc is external metal plates that sandwiches diaphragm from above and below trunnion sealing device in a true double disc technology that is molded to flex only in the downward stroke extending flex life provides no pumping action only ” diameter on largest model and reinforced to eliminate catastrophic failure diaphragm has been renamed a trunnion based on pvp terminology this is a captive device that is ” diameter and flexes on both upward and downward stroke leading to twice the flexure rate and therefore shorter life drive arrangement inexpensive to replace simple vbelt and pulley drive system expensive to replace mechanical gearmotor arrangement close coupled to drive shaft pump drive assembly short stroke length cam arrangement utilizes noncorrosive lightweight aluminum modular pedestals and connecting rods eccentric cams are cast bronzealloy and pinned to shaft with spirol® drive pins that absorb reciprocating load of pump longstroke cam arrangement utilizes ductile iron pedestals connecting rods and eccentric cams which rust and corrode cams are keyed to shaft with traditional keyway and setscrew arrangement which is inferior for reciprocating loads internal check valves a double disc pump does not have internal check valves the inlet clack valve is a priming device that only operates under suction lift and high vacuum installation pump works without this device on flooded suction applications pump will not operate without the ” ball check valves or flapper check valves on suction and discharge side these items rely on gravity to get back to seat and if there is debris on seat the pumping stops pumping action short stroke length produces small pulses and relatively smooth flows long stroke length produces large pulses and large pressure spikes in flow maintenance maintaininplace design with integral hinged housings allows pump to be serviced without removing pump from mounting frame or disturbing piping staged assembly allows for disassembly one section at a time pedestal assembly requires complete removal when diaphragm fails on multiplex units all pedestals have to be removed even when only one diaphragm fails ball check valves clog requiring frequent clean out base frame and covers standard in ss carbon steel painted pumps

established   based on llc origination manufacturing location made in the usa product made in canada holding company in the us it is clear that wastecorp decided to reconfigure their pump and call it a double disc pump with the hope to capitalize on the successes of this technology over the last  years the use of the double disc name along with renaming the diaphragm a “trunnion” and the external metal plate a “disc” is a direct attempt to confuse the marketplace into thinking this new line of pumps is the same as our technology the wastecorp sludgepro pump is a diaphragm pump and changing the
