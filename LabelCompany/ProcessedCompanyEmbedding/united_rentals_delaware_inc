the state of delaware for the right or privilege to own a delaware company the tax has no bearing on income or company activity—it is simply required by the state of delaware to maintain the good standing status of your company   the term franchise tax does not imply that your company is a franchise business  when is it due the due date of your tax varies depending on your company type   the franchise tax for a corporation is due by march  of every year if the tax is not paid on or before march  the state imposes a  late penalty plus a monthly interest fee of  percent   the franchise tax for a delaware llc is due by june  of every year the limited partnership lp franchise tax is also due by june  of every year if the tax is not paid on or before june  the state imposes a  late penalty

franchise tax for a delaware limited liability company llc or delaware limited partnership lp is a flat annual rate of  as of july     the franchise tax for a corporation is a little more complicated it is based on your corporation type and the number of authorized shares your company has the total cost of the franchise tax is comprised of an annual report fee and the actual tax due   a nonstocknonprofit company is considered exempt with the state of delaware this type of company does not pay the annual tax but must file and pay the annual report fee the annual report fee is  per year   a corporation having  authorized shares or less is considered a minimum stock corporation the annual report fee is  and the tax is  as of july   for a total of  per year   a corporation having

the state of delaware for the right or privilege to own a delaware company the tax has no bearing on income or company activity—it is simply required by the state of delaware to maintain the good standing status of your company   the term franchise tax does not imply that your company is a franchise business  when is it due the due date of your tax varies depending on your company type   the franchise tax for a corporation is due by march  of every year if the tax is not paid on or before march  the state imposes a  late penalty plus a monthly interest fee of  percent   the franchise tax for a delaware llc is due by june  of every year the limited partnership lp franchise tax is also due by june  of every year if the tax is not paid on or before june  the state imposes a  late penalty

franchise tax for a delaware limited liability company llc or delaware limited partnership lp is a flat annual rate of  as of july     the franchise tax for a corporation is a little more complicated it is based on your corporation type and the number of authorized shares your company has the total cost of the franchise tax is comprised of an annual report fee and the actual tax due   a nonstocknonprofit company is considered exempt with the state of delaware this type of company does not pay the annual tax but must file and pay the annual report fee the annual report fee is  per year   a corporation having  authorized shares or less is considered a minimum stock corporation the annual report fee is  and the tax is  as of july   for a total of  per year   a corporation having  authorized shares or more is considered a maximum stock corporation the annual report fee is  and the tax would be somewhere between  and  per year   there are two methods to calculate a maximum stock

hey there are you maybe looking for firebase instead data dumps the freebase api will be completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase deleted triples freebasewikidata mappings license citing freebase triples this dataset contains every fact currently in freebase total triples  billion updated weekly data format ntriples rdf license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the rdf data is serialized using the ntriples format encoded as utf

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds deletor subject mid predicate mid object midliteral languagecode csv
