president good morning thank you for joining us to discuss neophotonics operating results for the first quarter of  and outlook for the second quarter of  with me today are tim jenks chairman and ceo and ray wallin chief financial officer tim will begin with brief comments on the first quarter and then discuss market dynamics currently impacting the second quarter ray will then provide financial results for the first quarter and the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal  before turning it back to tim to provide further detail on the outlook of the business before opening the call for questionsmaterial contained in the webcast is the sole property and copyright of neophotonics with all rights reserved certain statements in this conference call which are not historical facts may be considered forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and include statements regarding future business results level of sales and profitability subsequent events product and technology development customer demand inventory levels and economic and industry projections various factors could cause actual results to differ materially some of these risk factors have been set forth in our press release dated may   and are described at length in our annual and quarterly sec filings now ill turn the call over to ceo tim jenkstimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president thank you for joining us today as we discussed on our prior call we are pleased that our q marked a milestone in our transition to a purely highspeed company with our focus on gigabit and above as networks are moving to gig and gig following the sale of our lowspeed transceiver assets and with slowness in china revenue was in line with our outlook at  million quarterly shipments in the china region excluding low speed products were down approximately  versus the prior quarter in contrast to the growth in our business outside of china approaching  sequentially demand was very strong in china with overly optimistic forecast entering  a leading customer there accumulated significant inventory as a resultread morebut as we discussed on our call in midmarch demand dropped precipitously as they moved to rapidly adjust their outsized inventory to align with their production given that expected china tenders had not materialized i will return to this topic shortly coupled with these demand dynamics our revenue performance in q additionally reflects the seasonal impact from pricing chinese new year and other factors as we have discussed on prior calls gross margin was  adversely impacted by unfavorable direct material procurement costs from a major contract manufacturing partner a mixed shift due to the customer the china customer inventory plus underutilization on lower volumes in on our own hand the inventory overhang and customer actions to reduce it in turn reduced our q outlook and will similarly impact our qnotably some products with elevated levels of inventory are also among our highermargin products such that during the period of burning off this inventory our margins are being adversely affected weve queried direct nem network equipment manufacturer customers and their telecom carrier customers in china and things remains slow though anticipating subsequent nearterm tender awards from china mobile we expect the national backbone business will go to existing vendors without major announcements and that provincial business will be new awards from china mobile as well as from china telecom and china unicom as the year progressesas noted previously we believe that the total annual port volume will be up from  levels though given tender delays thus far and with limited visibility we expect our second quarter will be only modestly up as the significant china inventory overhang is reduced and with continuing growth in the west recall also that a meaningful amount of our shipments notably including those in china are from vmi vendor managed inventory so we do not recognize revenue until our customer pulls it for use from their warehouse and provides us notification this is different than sales and shipment by purchase order wherein delivery and recognition timing is set at the time the purchase order is placed rather than vmi where revenue recognition timing remains in the customers control until fulfillment we believe that in china the pulls against vmi are a very strong indicator of current customer demand as such such vmi planned pulls from leading chinese customers are slow in the current period and are expected to continue that way until new tenders are awarded and their inventory deflates that said the finished goods in vmi is committed for sale to the end customer within a contracted period at which time the customer must take it we saw both the build of inventory and the coming china market softness in early march and we discussed this on our last callwe now anticipate continuing china softness through q as they consume inventory followed by a stronger china market in the second half of the year as new provincial tenders are awarded and our chinese customers increase their pulls on both our production and are higherthannormal in the quarter finished goods inventory this will lead to a normalized product mix and gross margin again the overall forecast for port deployments in china are higher for  and  and are similarly expected to be higher in  than this year the overall demand picture and the strength of the china market remains intact china continues to build gigabit capacities to extend such capacities to smaller cities and provinces and theyre now looking forward as g installations in certain cities are being planned shifting to the data center market we are supplying key components into module supply chains and due to the continuing demand were experiencing we are steadily increasing output this market contributes roughly  to  of our revenue in light of our current visibility we believe were taking prudent steps in managing the business following the sale of our lowspeed transceiver assets and with continued slowness in the first half of this year were implementing several cost savings measures including limited restructuring actions reducing sga and thinning rd in legacy areas by addressing our operating expenses for the year we expect to realize increased leverage as demand returns as ray will detail shortly that said we have production capacities in place to serve what we expect to be a stronger second half of  compared to the first halfso ill now turn it over to ray to provide further detail on financial performance rayclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp thank you tim and good morning before i provide financial details since this will be my last conference call at neophotonics on a personal note i want to thank my team for the accomplishments weve made in the last  years including buildout of our global finance organization i have enjoyed working with the many talented and committed individuals at neophotonics and revenue for the first quarter totaled  million which as we discussed on our last call was lower due to the sale of our lowspeed transceiver assets in january and the slowness were seeing in china which tim discussed related to our lowspeed transceiver assets as a reminder these products had revenue of approximately  million in  and contributed roughly  million to revenue in q for shipments in the first  weeks of the quarter prior to the close of the transaction sales of our highspeed products were  million or  of revenue and networking products represented  million or  of revenuenow revenue excluding the divested lowspeed products of  million for the first quarter was  million our nongaap gross margin was  down from  in the first quarter of  and down from  in the fourth quarter as tim explained total nongaap operating expense for the first quarter was  million an increase of  versus the fourth quarter now this reflected some period costs and higher annual audit costs in the first quarter now these factors will not be continuing cost and our nongaap operating loss for the first quarter was  million or  of revenue down from an operating margin of  in the fourth quarternow nongaap net loss in the first quarter was  million based on a fully diluted share count of  million shares and this translates to a loss per share of  for the first quarter adjusted ebitda was a loss of  million i will close out my discussion of the first quarter income statement with a review of our gaap results our first quarter gross margin was  down from  in the fourth quarter including a  million gain on the sale of the lowspeed product assets operating expense was  million operating loss was  million for the first quarter which included approximately  million of amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles  million in stockbased compensation expense  million in restructuring charges and  million of cost related to the divestiture of our lowspeed transceiver product assets along with the gain on the sale of the lowspeed transceiver product assets of  million now net loss was  million for the quarter down from net income of  million in the prior periodgeographically our revenue mix for the first quarter was  in the americas china was  japan was  and the rest of the world was  note that these figures are based on shipment destination not the end use destination now further the sale of our lowspeed transceiver products appreciably lowered our percent of revenues from china and we had   or greater customers in the first quarter of  ciena comprised approximately  of our total revenue flat with our fourth quarter and huawei technologies and its affiliates high silicon technologies together comprised  of our total revenue compared to  in the fourth quarter and  of our total revenue excluding the lowspeed products for that period now a full reconciliation of our gaap to nongaap numbers for the quarter is included in our press releasegoing forward as tim described were implementing a series of costsaving measures in light of both our sale of lowspeed transceiver product assets and due to the current level of outlook from china now these changes include rationalizing the number of our product lines reducing our real estate footprint and making certain staffing reductions in line with the elimination of our lowspeed transceiver product line now we believe we will save on the order of  million to  million in annualized operating costs and we are looking further for areas to increase savings as the year progresses and we expect the full quarterly impact of our cost reduction actions to be realized by q and we expect to record a pretax charge of a range of approximately  million to  million for severance cost in q and were seeking to continue with limited critical hiring to ensure our key rd development move a pace and to maintain our production capabilities to respond to any upsidenow turning to the balance sheet we finished the quarter with  million in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash down from  million at december   our restricted cash at march   was  million now accounts receivable was  million with day sales outstanding at  days now net inventory was  million with  days of inventory on hand our capital expenditures were  million in the first quarter and depreciation and amortization was  millionas a reminder were very well along in our previously announced capacity expansion plan and to this end with both progress to date and with china overhang we anticipate returning to our normalized capex of  to  of revenue in the second halfnow before i discuss our revenue and earnings outlook for the second quarter of fiscal  i want to once again remind everyone of our public filings with the sec and our safe harbor statement included in our press release that discusses the risks and uncertainties that could affect future performance causing actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statementsnow as tim noted we expect our second quarter revenues will be only modestly up after excluding lowspeed product revenues for the reasons we have discussed we are not seeing an increase in gross margin primarily because of the temporary adverse mix impacts with low volumes on highermargin products largely the result of chinas inventory overhangin addition during recent quarters we have added net capacity resulting in higher depreciation costs on flat revenue in q at the same time production yields have largely normalized so that we expect to continue increasing output with increased demand in the second half as we continue production levels in line with our customer forecastsat this point we anticipate demand growing late in q as there are some current indicators for this timing so given these factors the companys expectations for the june  quarter are revenue in the range of  million to  million nongaap gross margin in the range of  to  gaap diluted net loss per share in the range of  to  per share and nongaap diluted net loss per share in the range of  to  per share now these numbers are reflective of approximately  million fully diluted shares ill now turn the call back to timtimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president thank you ray as i noted earlier we believe that demand for gigabit and beyond products will be stronger in the second half of  than in the first half the market dynamics driving growth in the optics market and which we have discussed on previous calls remains very robust the china market is a timing issue related to the transition from national backbone deployments to provincial backbone and metro deployments and related to the accumulated inventory overhang worldwide metro and data center interconnect gigabit coherent deployments continue to grow and now exceed longhaul levels by ports capex by webscale content providers remains robust with multiple mega data centers planned are under construction resulting in high demand for shortreach and longreach gigabit client optics modules and components gig is now standard in all line side and client side applications and networks are moving rapidly to gig and gig with gig on the horizon for data center interconnect fat pipe applicationsthis is important as we believe we are well positioned to serve these growing gig and beyond markets with both new products and expanded capacity in line with these drivers over the last few months we announced a number of exciting new products which will accelerate our growth in  and beyond targeting growth in metro provincial china backbone and data center interconnect networks is our pluggable coherent cfpdco module which supports both gig and gig utilizing qam modulation for highcapacity data center interconnect and flex coherent metro markets we demonstrated our  cfpdco pluggable module capable of single wave length gig and gig connections with a baud rate of  gigabaud and supporting up to qam modulation which means it could handle all data rates from gig up to gig we also announced a partnership with ciena to develop manufacture and sell a new single wave length gig xinch transponder utilizing cienas wavelogic ai dsp chipsettogether these products comprise a suite of gigabit module supporting a full range of modules and applications in key growth market segments supporting our modules we also introduced and demonstrated the new gigabaud micro modulator with integrated drivers designed for use in such cfp and smaller coherent module applications and providing data rates of gigabit and faster this is important as our new micro modulator completes our full line of coherent components for gig and beyond and it fulfills all new performance requirements for the most demanding highspeed coherent transmission applications including high bandwidth lowpower consumption in very small size adding this modulator to our portfolio expands our total addressable market or tam by an estimated  million continuing our focus on switching for colorless directionless and contentionless or cdc network architectures suitable for sdn networks we introduced a new x multicast switch and we continue to innovate on this front as we are working with each of the leading systems companies who support the most advanced ddc network architectures for applications inside the data center we introduced our new nonhermetic laser arrays to drive shortreach silicon photonicsbased interconnects and modules notably in psm and cwdm qsfp modules finally we announced our new lowpower consumption  gigabaud eml laser with integrated driver designed for lr and zr reaches at gig gig pam and gig pam applicationswe also demonstrated our gig cfp lr pluggable module and we anticipate that our nextgeneration  gigabaud eml lasers which can transmit at gigabit data rates using only  lasers again utilizing pam should see deployment the following year and will enable even smaller ddqsfp and osfp modules for gigabit data center use the mid and longterm market drivers for our business remain compelling china remains committed through the china broadband  initiative to continue buildout of the national back bone network and expand buildouts of gig provincial and metro networks as weve noted our oem customers in china expect these actions to increase the number of gigabit ports in china in  over  but with deployments being anticipated to ramp in the second half of the year in north america we continue to see strong demand driven by north american carriers with continued metro strength at verizon and att and growing dci deployments finally before opening up the call for questions i would like to thank ray wallin for the contributions he made in the neophotonics over the last  years leveraging his expertise ray played an important role in building strength in our finance organization and has added to the strength of the companys financial position we wish him success with his future endeavors this concludes our formal commentsand now id like to ask the operator to open up the line for questions mattquestions and answersoperator operator instructions and well take our first question from simon leopold with raymond jamessimon matthew leopold raymond james  associates inc research division  research analyst i want to just get a couple of housekeeping nuggets out of the way if i might first and then get into real question just capex in the quarter pleaseclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp  millionsimon matthew leopold raymond james  associates inc research division  research analyst  million and you indicated trending back down in the second half of the year what do you expect for the second quarterclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp lets see here well its going to trend down slightly simon to about  million and then in the fourth quarter it drops off well second quarter million third and fourth quarter it drops off precipitouslysimon matthew leopold raymond james  associates inc research division  research analyst okay and then i dont believe you gave us the typical segment breakdown between the networks in gig and aboveclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp well its  on the highspeed and  on the network solutionssimon matthew leopold raymond james  associates inc research division  research analyst okay great sorry if you give that i missed it and then in terms of kind of the  whats going on with the gross margin and the cost reductions couple of questions sort of trying to understand that so a little bit surprised about the gross margin weakness here particularly relative to the forecast for this quarter so  of the things im trying to understand is how much is fixed asset how much is underutilized staff is there any way to give us a little bit of color between those  factors and maybe the metrics of where your headcount is and where it could goclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp yes so if you look at the gross margin in q  versus the q call it  on a nongaap basis if we kind of bridge that its about  points from the material cost that we talked about higher its about a point from utilization and about a point from mixsimon matthew leopold raymond james  associates inc research division  research analyst and wheres your headcount on the quarterclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp we have  in the total company we have  people we can give you the breakdown by function if you like but its roughly  across the whole companysimon matthew leopold raymond james  associates inc research division  research analyst and where do you expect to be at the end of qtimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president i think we  the number of  the total number of people simon includes deal that varies by production level so its hard to say we dont have a quarterly forecast of headcountsimon matthew leopold raymond james  associates inc research division  research analyst okay well i guess what im trying to get at is making sure i get comfortable with where opex is going in terms of restructuring but roughly speaking if your operating expenses pro forma are about  million this quarter we should be thinking that december should be in the neighborhood of  million is that correctclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp no actually simon its going to be substantially less than that i would say that by the time we get to the fourth quarter of  on a nongaap basis our opex will be closer to  million  million probably on the lower sidesimon matthew leopold raymond james  associates inc research division  research analyst okay thats very helpful and then i wanted to come back to the inventory topic im sorry for taking so much time here but so many moving parts in this space in the past i think many of us have had the impression that the use of vendor managed inventory would reduce the risk of inventory buildups and that does not seem to be the case so i understand things ageout of the vmi hubs and get shipped to the customer anyway and so theres some risk but could you help us bridge and get comfortable with why vendor managed inventory didnt address the idea that inventory could get builtup in the channeltimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president this is tim simon i think its with the things going on right now its a particularly important point so the existence of vendor managed inventory at certain customers means that they have strong control over a certain amount of inventory thats actually in their warehouse and therefore theyre able to meter that with their production demand rather than continuing to receive product that they may have ordered in prior months or even quarter that is due for delivery and will be delivered whether or not they have the production demand to take it so with vmi in this particular situation there is less inventory buildup in fact in the vmi hub that is a difference i think it  we noted the demand situation actually on our last call and we began to see it in very early march and ultimately thats an ongoing conversation with the customer not only how much inventory might be in hubs but also what their intentions are to use it or to pull it so ultimately going forward that same pattern will play out as production levels increase or fluctuate over timesimon matthew leopold raymond james  associates inc research division  research analyst great and  last just trending question it sounds as if the market and industry are shifting more quickly than some had expected from cfp form factors to qsfp form factors and that may be reflective of whats going on in webscale and not just the telco side of world can you help us understand your positioning in this and your view on that market transitiontimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president okay the qsfp market of course were referring significantly to both the data com and the client side in the cfp were referring primarily to the cfp and cfp were referring primarily to the clientside we sell components in both but while theres continuing cfp and cfp the growth rate in the qsfp is considerably higher so theres a shift in the preponderance of production moving to the qsfp and that is consuming a greater portion of the components as well that  does that get to your pointsimon matthew leopold raymond james  associates inc research division  research analyst a little bit but  so are you  do you have any products in the qsfp market or are you just selling components into others who make qsfptimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president we sell components to others who make qsfp thats correctsimon matthew leopold raymond james  associates inc research division  research analyst and how material is that within your businessclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp in my comments i noted that overall this is in the range of  to  of our revenuetimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president simon  point just adjusting for the sale of our lowspeed products you had asked the question about highspeed versus network products and solutions with that adjustment its actually closer to  and  okayoperator and well now hear from richard shannon with craighallumrichard cutts shannon craighallum capital group llc research division  senior research analyst maybe ill follow up on one of those indices partly borne out by a comment tim i heard in your prepared remarks and other one that i might have heard as i was a bit distracted during the early part here but the comments that i heard i think i heard you say as that youre expecting demand to improve late in the second quarter and i think youre referring to china and im wondering about your earlier comments about the vmi hub whether there is any relationship there so i guess maybe ill just start with that first part of that which is can you help us understand what you mean by expecting demand improve late in the quartertimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president well yes because the indicators that we see are actually production rates and current production rates are actually now up from the first quarter so when were referring to china and in particular large customers in china what we observe is what the inventory is and the pull rates are so notably through the first quarter there was an accumulation of inventory and there was a relatively low production rate that caused the inventory to move up quite a bit and this is primarily key technology products and in early march that situation precipitously changed where customer forecasts precipitously dropped such that they were not going to pull the remainder of the quarter and that was reflected when we did our call in midmarch what we see now is higher production rates than at that time and were also seeing that inventories are being bled off they are diminishing and so ultimately with the other element in this somewhat complex puzzle is the fact that the move from national backbone networks to provincials means that big announcements about tenders diminish so when theres a national backbone tender award its centrally announced and betterknown and what were seeing is some feathering in of provincial awards awards that are smaller in size and with less headlines and so it becomes a bit more important to pay attention to the production rate and the use of inventoryrichard cutts shannon craighallum capital group llc research division  senior research analyst okay so just to be clear is this expectation about improving the second  late in this quarter is that either direct comments from your customers or more calculations by you using that production rate and where the levels the inventory and the hub sits right nowtimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president actually customer commentsrichard cutts shannon craighallum capital group llc research division  senior research analyst okay thats helpful lets see tim i think you mentioned that in the first quarter china was down  sequentially where the rest of the world was up  did i here that  those comments currentlytimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president you didrichard cutts shannon craighallum capital group llc research division  senior research analyst and so what bakes into our guidance for the second quarter for both of those geographical segmentstimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president were expecting that our growth in the west is continuing china is not in terms of our outlookrichard cutts shannon craighallum capital group llc research division  senior research analyst okay so there is some sort of negative number there also a positive in the rest of the world thentimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president yes thats correctrichard cutts shannon craighallum capital group llc research division  senior research analyst okay okay lets see i guess the third question and ill jump out of the line here just to touch on the gross margin topic here sounds like the i guess from our perspective lowerthanexpected gross margin guidance for the second quarter i think you mentioned is in part due to mix with a lot of weakness coming from your highest margin leading edge products sounds like from your previous comments tim that you expect those to pick up here with the demand late in the quarter any way that you want to help us think about how that inflection goes from the second quarter to the third quarter on gross margins i know you havent given us a revenue number but any way to bridge that forward would be helpful pleasetimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president first of all since you just asked the question about the trending in the west versus the trending in china so as we see demand increases in china it doesnt necessarily mean that theres an increase in shipments in the second quarter in china and so thats reflected in our outlook there is inventory on hand and  while in the vmi case there may be a limited amount of inventory there nonetheless can be lead time subsequently so were not  in our outlook were not reflecting that theres an uptick in shipments in china with respect to gross margin trends the impact of mix on margins is notable its significant and we had a strong fourth quarter we were shipping products that had a more normalized mix and that being pretty favorable means that those products were then in ample supply in customer inventory so what we have to see is we have to see the inventory deplete and then that could return but as the demand increases we get  benefits we get the benefits of product mix going back to normal and then we get a benefit from better absorption better utilization on our production so the  negatives we have right now with increased demand brings into positives going forward so we should see it go back to a more normalized gross marginoperator and we will now go to alex henderson with needham  companyalexander b henderson needham  company llc research division  senior analyst of networking and security technology lot of noise has disappeared with the conference call as well i just wanted to go back to the gross margins so  points from depreciation  from utilization  from mix is what i heard you say is that correcttimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president the mix is generally what i was addressing with the prior call but in the  let me just ask the question its a bit different for what we saw q to q ie what weve realized versus what were expecting so can you direct your questionalexander b henderson needham  company llc research division  senior analyst of networking and security technology the question is what did you say about the gross margin pressure on  in the fixed comments earlier there was static on the line and i didnt hear it was it  points of depreciation  utilization and  mix is that what you saidclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp let me go through that alex so we had in the fourth quarter of  we had a nongaap gross margin of approximately  and going into q of  thats about  so its about  points there so if i look at the factors that would bridge that difference the major factor was in terms of material cost being higher in our outside vendor  outside production vendor that we use number two is the underutilization of the factory as a result of the drop off in revenue and number three is aforementioned mix effects that we had so id say its one half to the material cost and quarter to the utilization and a quarter to the mixalexander b henderson needham  company llc research division  senior analyst of networking and security technology i see so as we look out into the back half of the year could you give us some sense given what you think mix is likely to do and therefore shifting the numbers based on say  million in numbers or  million or  million in quarterly revenues what does it take to get back to  or  or  gross margins without being a forecast but rather giving us some sense of when we forecast what would be the implications for margin recovery structureclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp yes so what weve modeled alex internally based on understanding our factory utilization dynamics also understanding the mix effects that were seeing and the reversal of those mix effects as the inventory has been bled off in the channel and as we crossover the  million mark and get into the low s id see gross margins returning to the very low s so youd be cracking at plus gross margin at that pointalexander b henderson needham  company llc research division  senior analyst of networking and security technology thats very helpful and so as were looking out i understand that you dont want to give more than  quarters forecast but as were looking out do you expect meaningful growth in the back half as things normalize and china recovers and we still see good solid growth in data com as well as in outside of china end markets or would you expect a more tepid kind of environment in the backtimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president this is tim there are  parts i think to saying that the customer forecast for the total number of port deployment suggests a strong rate of growth and so suggests its more stepwise with our vmi situation it would reflect i think quite directly to us but that said we have limited visibility and so our outlook for the current quarter reflects our limited visibility and it reflects the reality of what we can and cannot see in the second half in order for chinese customers to actually meet their forecast we would see a pretty significant growth in the second half with the move to provincial tenders the visibility is diminished versus the national tenders and therefore its harder to predict and we cant say whether its a step increase or a linear increase we wish we knew that but what we can say is as volumes increase and if they  if their forecasts are in fact reasonably accurate then the rate of increase could be high i dont think anybody really has greater visibility to all of the provincial plans and i think that reflects in the industry view right nowalexander b henderson needham  company llc research division  senior analyst of networking and security technology all right totally understand so just as i understand sort of the mechanics around this if these take longer and say it bleeds into the september  later in the september quarter before some of these orders come in does that result in the overall demand sliding between  and  i mean does that cause some of that to flush out into the first half of  analogous to the very late start in  q causing undue strength in the first half of timothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president we would view that as yes to your question a couple of points on it though certainly in the case of china mobile as an example we have pretty clear port forecast for them for  over  but also for  over  and so things that are not deployed or installed in  would roll over to  but then be augmented by the new port deployments for  so  and then when you get late in that period then youre starting to have some views toward what g installations might go in subsequently so there are a series of steps along the way and the impact i think we face is just the transition to a lowerlevel of visibility because of the deployments now being more diversified across the countryalexander b henderson needham  company llc research division  senior analyst of networking and security technology going back to the inventory side of the question for a second one of your competitors made the comment that the cfo at huawei had made a decision based on their strong growth but lack of profitability to bring down companywide inventory resulting in a more draconian inventory overhang would have happened had that not  that perception and that need not changed with an intention to increase cash flow do you view that as a factor here and if thats true does that result in a tighter inventory level as we go into the back half and into  which ultimately could cause things to be  to have a little bit more spring in themtimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president we have been given the same message by the same customer group im sure and so it does  it is discussed as a policy change a particular large customer has announced a number of new initiatives in some of their other businesses that are likely to be requiring cash for investments so i think that does affect their approach to overall inventory control it would be a onetime thing as they complete an adjustment and they deplete some of their inventory that certainly is affecting us in the current term but then rolling forward we expect it to be more aligned with whatever the current demand isalexander b henderson needham  company llc research division  senior analyst of networking and security technology one last question and ill cede the floor can you give us some guidance on what youre thinking on the income tax line which obviously is hard for us to manage externally given the circumstances in the forecast what should we be thinking about for the june quarter and for the full year on that linetimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president i think actually its hard to give it to you in a percentage basis alex why dont i followup with an email on that just to give you kind of a guidance around the dollar numbers i would expectalexander b henderson needham  company llc research division  senior analyst of networking and security technology were talking  million to  kind of number in the second quarter is that kind of thetimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president yes thats correct in the second quarter  provision probably would be pretty closer for the second quarteroperator and well now go to paul silverstein with cowen  companypaul jonas silverstein cowen and company llc research division  md and senior research analyst if i missed the comments i apologize but can you revisit your nonchina business i think i heard you say its growing at  is there any granular insight you could offer us in terms of applications customers regions would you saytimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president sure the business outside of china is on a  from a product perspective or a customer perspective they’re both reasonably diverse these are essentially a couple of different laser products receiver products and our switch products and each is actually sequentially up and trending up generally so these are areas where we have added a certain amount of capacity and over time were increasing output that is causing the sequential increasepaul jonas silverstein cowen and company llc research division  md and senior research analyst and same on your  on the metro road and build outs outside of china any update you can offer ustimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president well generally there is  so for metro road and build outs were referring in the neophotonics product line to multicast switches in my prepared remarks we talked about the fact that we have  we have been shipping into the verizon supply chain over some time weve qualified a new x product and then we have  we think  were now working with really each of the major cdc network players for multicast switches so multicast switch is being used with other  with wavelength selector switches from other companies the multicast switch business we expect this year to essentially double over last year last year it was a bit less than  million and this year we expect it to be in the  million to  million range we would expect and so that is an area of growth overall depending on deployments from carriers it can be lumpy quartertoquarter but because of the fact that its projectbased but that road of deployment activity as it picks up it will also pick up our shipments of switch productspaul jonas silverstein cowen and company llc research division  md and senior research analyst this quarter is a reminder of how hard it is to forecast for you and everybody else in the business that said how much visibility how confident are you on both the nonchina business in terms of the ramp as well as the situation in china i recognize china is particularly challenging just given its nature but any thoughts you can share in terms of visibility right nowtimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president yes the first thing is the north american business is a steadier business because its been  its in its third year now its continuing to ship and theres a bit more visibility and a bit steadier the china business is brand new products have gone through field trial testing qualification but major deployments actually have not really rolled out yet so those are poised for growth and we see increases announced with some wss deployments in china and then multicast switches will tend to follow that so were optimistic about that for this year but its small numbers yet on multicast switches in terms of forecasting overall i was following the discussion on switches but now  are you also asking more generally about all productspaul jonas silverstein cowen and company llc research division  md and senior research analyst absolutelytimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president okay the visibility in china just isnt very good because of the transition to provincial networks where you dont get the kinds of headlines to which we have been come accustomed over the last couple of years and we do see increasing production rates thats a good sign but we dont have enough visibility to say how rapidly things will recover or ramp so were going to have to wait and see with the lack of visibilityoperator and our next question comes from troy jensen with piper jaffraytroy donavon jensen piper jaffray companies research division  md and senior research analyst it would be my expectation that china comes back slowly sku by sku so id just be curious which ones do you think come back first or where is the least amount of inventory when you look across the product linestimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president okay well lets see i think that for us coherent components is  are big parts of our product lines going to major chinese network equipment manufacturers so those things come back the fastest with the last question i was referring to multicast switches those will come in sequentially with deployments and then the components that are not necessarily coherent components have continued to pace they really havent diminished at all in the current period so the thing that would step up most aggressively would be the coherent componentstroy donavon jensen piper jaffray companies research division  md and senior research analyst all right that makes sense and then how about maybe just to end for me at least just a dco update maybe remind us where you are with respect to the number of dsp partners you have is it  or  now and then just any update on trials or essentially when that rampstimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president okay so the dco product that we initially introduced in december is in a series of customers for qualification currently and that product  the ones that are first along the qualification are all primarily with a single dsp partner but theres availability from a second dsp partner as well though theyre not as far along the qualificationoperator and we will now go to dave kang with b rileydave ku kang b riley  co llc research division  senior analyst optical components first on cash so youre cash ended at  million down from what  million does that  million  does it include  million from pon sale and if so does it imply that you guys used like  million during the quarter can you just go out over that can you confirm that first of allclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp so actually the cash included a little bit less in pon sale theres a number of things that are going on there but lets just call it  million cash in q so if you  you had the cash there from the sale about  million and so that would have been included in the cash number that we reporteddave ku kang b riley  co llc research division  senior analyst optical components okay so its more like  million rather than  million thenclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp yes so that is a  million burn yes in that quarter if you kind of dissect the components of what is going on in the cash so you had the overall cash reduction of about  million and so we had about  million of cash that we received from the sale of the lowspeed transceiver business and so then you probably burned about  million of cash  million of that was capex and the  million was from cash flow from operations so its a  million cash loss including that  million and then on top of that working capital changed by about  million principally from buildup in inventorydave ku kang b riley  co llc research division  senior analyst optical components right so it doesnt sound like thats going to change that much in the second quarter i mean is that a fair assumption or…clyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp i think its a fair assumption yes i think if i look at the same components for the second quarter we have about a  million working capital change versus the  million working capital change we have about  million cash loss versus  million cash loss and we have about  million in capex we also have a new loan that we took in  have taken out to fund capex in japan of about  million for the quarter so kind of the net number theres about  milliondave ku kang b riley  co llc research division  senior analyst optical components the reason i ask is because you still have about  millionish debt to service im sure you guys are aware of the situation changes can you go over the cash situation going forward and typically how much minimum cash balance do your major customers require like ciena and hauwei im sure they must have some kind of minimum standard rightclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp well to answer that specific question dave they dont for us they dont ask us to maintain a certain level of cash but just get getting back to whether weve sufficient cash in the company so number of actions and levers that were pulling number one is we are reducing expenses which will help our cash situation as well secondly capex number for the third quarter will be dropping a lot from the second and first quarters as  we said we are about  of the way through our capex programs so that amount of money well spend on capex going forward in the third and fourth quarters its substantially less and number three is we do  we also have lines of credit in china that a lot of people dont focus on but theres another  million of borrowing capacity in china that we have available as well as a  million credit facility with comerica bank that we have available and as we get through the fourth quarter as we talked about we would be seeing a pickup in the second half which would ultimately generate cash for the companydave ku kang b riley  co llc research division  senior analyst optical components got it just a couple more if i could regarding in the first quarter how much of a revenue was impacted by the yield situation and has that been fully resolved so theres no impact in the second quartertimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president david this is tim there was a little bit of bleed over in the first quarter but thats all essentially resolved at this pointdave ku kang b riley  co llc research division  senior analyst optical components okay and what is the split between your itlas and receiverstimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president we just report that  is high speed we dont divide the specific productsdave ku kang b riley  co llc research division  senior analyst optical components can i assume receivers are still bigger than itlas or they are about same nowtimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president we dont divide themdave ku kang b riley  co llc research division  senior analyst optical components fair enough and lastly im just confirming from your k last night can you just explain what this financial covenant of  ebitda by end of july and what happens if you dont meet that covenant thats it from meclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp yes so its part of our  this relates to the comerica line of credit so  of the covenants in the comerica line of credit is that we achieve  of forecasted ebitda so we provide them the forecast and we have to meet half of itdave ku kang b riley  co llc research division  senior analyst optical components by julyclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp there was a covenant spend in there since the beginning of the arrangement its been  its just a standard covenant in there so its nothing really materially new there so  thats part of our normal covenant compliance with the comerica bankoperator and our next question comes from tim savageaux with northland capital marketstimothy paul savageaux northland capital markets research division  md and senior research analyst can i ask a quick product question but before i do that i want to followup on some of rays working capital commentary and really ask if he can give us more details about anticipated working capital consumption in q at that point id imagine that inventory might come down a bit are you looking for what would be a fairly dramatic increase in receivables in the quarter and what would be behind that or any other comments on the comment you just made on working capital consumption in qclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp so actually in q what we would be seeing is receivables and inventories versus q being effectively flat i would think revenues are flat q to q so we see the receivables being about flat and then the inventories based on our production plans for the quarter and how weve described how were maintaining in the company production readiness for the second half revenue plan that we are anticipating but we would see the inventory stand about the same i believe in q as welltimothy paul savageaux northland capital markets research division  md and senior research analyst so we expect payables to plummet or how do we get toclyde raymond wallin neophotonics corporation  cfo and svp wed see  we see about  million  we see some payables plummet because in payables we have payments for capex and so weve paid for a good chunk of that so wed see some payables plummet also some accruing of the current liabilities wed see a change there as well so yes we would definitely see some change in the payables and accrued liabilities probably about  milliontimothy paul savageaux northland capital markets research division  md and senior research analyst okay on to the product question i think most of them have been asked but tim you did mention i think putting kind of your cloud data center exposure at  to  of revenue i wonder if you might be able to provide a little more detail in terms of what sort of products or components that go into products or kind of included in that bucket and along with that maybe give us an update on cfpaco whats your timing is there in terms of bringing that product to markettimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president sure for the first part of your question there are a range of lasers different configurations different types of lasers that we sell both for modules as well as cifo based lasers and ultimately the  in many cases with drivers the semiconductor ics that go with these so its principally lasers and highspeed ics that are sold into this space as components and then with respect to the aco the gig aco that will not be a revenue producer in  so we should be looking out at least a year for that oneoperator and that concludes our questionandanswer session for today id like to turn the call back over for tim jenks for any closing remarkstimothy storrs jenks neophotonics corporation  chairman of the board ceo and president okay matt thank you id like to
