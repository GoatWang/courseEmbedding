teacher and crimping plier inventor interviewed and compiled by anne marie hunter exclusively for fire mountain gems and beads® omtara™ pliers story of omtara pliers a renowned jewelry artist teacher and author laura gasparrini is also the inventor of a line of stateoftheart crimping pliers carried by fire mountain gems and beads bringing new ease to crimping these tools have been called the crimpers for people who hate to crimp laura began designing jewelry when she was just  and at  designed her first line of jewelry using antique buttons when she finished this first collection laura made an appointment with a jewelry buyer at bloomingdales in new york though she didnt buy my jewelry this woman was so kind and treated me with such respect i was treated like an artist this pivotal moment in lauras life shaped and established the foundation for her teaching philosophy over the past three decades currently laura teaches in santa barbara as well as at trade shows across the country and has taught students from preschool through college i believe in the gentle approach with children and adults we are all little people inside especially when it comes to our creativity laura teaches beginning stringing and crimping wirework mixed media and much more lauras favorite medium is leather i love working in leather it has an earthy elegance about ten years ago with her students as inspiration laura began a new journey designing toolsspecifically crimping pliers many people hate to crimp she says they say they are bad at it as a teacher i didnt want any of my students to feel bad at something and it falls on the teacher to help students for many jewelry artists beginning and advanced alike crimping is a stressful and frustrating process but it is an essential skill well worth mastering over the years i have watched many students become discouraged with the necessity of crimping the traditional twostep crimping process is exacting and each step must be done precisely or the crimp fails to secure beads onto the wire laura believes crimping is an essential foundation skill for jewelry design and once mastered greatly expands jewelry artists potential for creative expression in noticing her students struggle with crimping laura realized tools were limited for crimping so she made it her passion to learn about them serendipitously as laura was pondering a way to help students with crimping skills her engineerfisherman father was in the process of inventing a tool to crimp big crimps on fishing line when laura saw this crimper and the potential for jewelrymaking she asked her fathers help in designing her own crimping tool with specifications for beading crimp sizes he helped her draw and design a line of crimping pliers the name for her jewelry business since its inception laura also named her line of pliers omtara™ omtara are the first words of a mantra to tara the female buddhist deity representing success in work and achievement who is always ready to jump in and help those in need laura felt omtara™ would be a fitting name for her innovative beneficial tool line lauras omtara™ crimping pliers are now manufactured by eurotool® and available to jewelry designers around the world when asked what these crimping tools mean to laura and her students she responded people tell me they are the best tools they have ever used when someone tries them and can crimp in one step they buy them it takes away all the negative emotion with crimping and gets them to the creative part doing what theyre best at with her lifetime of accomplishments laura says these tools are the most important work ive ever done they give a designer confidence about the process and the final product my tools are a support for others to discover their creativity empress talisman meet the designerartist where do you live beautiful santa barbara california describe your artistic style inspired adornment rustically elegant artisan jewelry what inspires you as a designerartist i love earthy materials pearls gemstones metal leather silk and linen ive sewn and crafted since i was a child designed clothing for my own line and that of other designers so i love to incorporate traditional fiber arts techniquessewing stitching braiding knotting macraméinto my designs what materials do you most enjoy working with leather pearls gemstones silk cord linen cord metal beads i love incorporating found objects into my work for something unexpected what is the name of the piece you submitted with your success story empress talisman what inspired this design i have always loved mythology and have studied the tarot and divine feminine archetypes since my early teens the empress represents the archetype of the great mother and she is a continuous source of inspiration to me in my art my business omtara and in my life the empress talisman is one of my earliest pieces and it continues to be one of my favorites it was purchased by a beautiful woman inside and out who is the embodiment of the great mothera loving generous and deeply caring person how did it come together i experimented with the concept of the empress picturing what she would look like imagining the colors that she would wear then i went to my bead stash and pulled out what ever called to me i enjoyed beaded appliqué so i started in that technique for the pendant once the pendant was done how i would create the necklace became more clear i really enjoy the feeling of discovering a piece when i work i love the creative process as it unfolds share your background when and how did you begin making jewelrybeading i started making jewelry when i was about  my mother owned  boutiques in ny and ct near where i grew up and i made jewelry to sell in her boutique my mom and i happened upon a fantastic button collection someone was selling and i created a line of button jewelry when i was  i made an appointment to show it to the jewelry buyer at bloomingdales my mom drove me there and i met with the buyer she didnt take the collectioni only have one piece left of that collection in my childhood memorabilia and it definitely isnt the greatestbut she treated me with the utmost respect and encouraged me to keep designing i am certain she contributed greatly to the confidence and enthusiasm with which i approach my work every day i dont remember her name but at the start of every session of introductory beading i teach i tell that story and send a thank you out to her wherever she is who introduced you to beading i am not sure who introduced me but i imagine it was my mother i grew up in a very crafty familymy mother aunt and both my grandmothers were avid sewers quilters painters ceramic or fiber artists  and we didnt have a television as children we read crafted cookedit was part of the fabric of our family do you have an artistic background i am not formally trained in art though i did study oil painting from age    as i mentioned creativity was all around me while i was growing up in addition to the maternal side of my family my father was an engineer and inventor and he would bring his inventions home and ask us to tell him what they were for we thought he was a train engineer for a long time so the answers were often quite funny my paternal grandfather was a retired tile setter and fisherman i remember watching him hand tie and repair fishing nets and learned many knots and splicing techniques from him that i use today i did have a bad experience in elementary art class that turned me off from painting til much later in life and though i have taught set design had a faux finishing business i still have not picked up a paintbrush to paint in oils i think that classroom experience pointed my creative expression toward the world of craft where i felt comfortable even now i remember the experience and as a teacher i am careful not to impose a limiting view on the work of my students i see creative expression as a process and feel it is important to encourage exploration how did you discover fire mountain gems and beads® i happened upon fire mountain when i started purchasing materials for my classes i teach  beading classes a week at our local collegeabout  people every week so i need a wide range of high quality materials that are affordably priced what other hobbies do you have i love to cook garden craft most anything collage walk kick box beach comb and travel do you belong to any beading societies or beading groups not yet i have been asked to form a local beading guild and have looked into the possibility i would love to find a group of colleagues that would be willing to work together to make that happen in santa barbara beading success what role does jewelrymaking play in your life beading is my fulltime work i design create and teach beading at our local college and privately through my business omtara i invented a new crimping toolthe easy crimp™ crimping pliersthat i am currently marketing in the us i create kits tutorials and videos and am currently working on developing a dvd series on beginning beading as well as a book on a specific technique i offer bead tours to the tucson shows and several years ago lead bead tours to thailand and bhutan i am hoping to offer another asia tour in the next year or so if you used jewelrymaking as a way to bring in income how are you selling yourself and your jewelry i have an active blog based website inspired adornment a facebook page for my business omtara and a youtube channel omtarabead i also have etsy and artfire sites that i dont work as much as i could i attend trade shows throughout the west coast to market my crimper and teach at those shows as well i have merchandised a clothing designer friends booth at a trade show in ny and brought in accounts that way several years ago i coowned a gallery with a group of other artists in our town and when i launched my business i produced quarterly fairs as a way for myself and other artists to market their wares i send out a weekly newsletter to my email list keeping them abreast of upcoming classes bead sales giveaways and the like i recently participated in a giveaway of my crimper in bead trends magazine and on my facebook page as well in the new year i am planning on offering quarterly crimper giveaways and design of the month giveaways of a specific tutorial and materials kit i connect with other creative people by following their blogs and taking online classes there is so much creativity and good will out there in the worldit feels good to be a part of it do you participate in any charity fundraisers i donate group and individual classes including materials to many schools in our area last year i donated classes valued at over  to over  local schools i have donated beads and other materials to local groups working with children and developmentally disabled adults any advice for aspiring jewelryartists give yourself some me time to create if possible make sure you have a space to work that doesnt need to be cleaned up every day even if it is only a tray or a rolling cart that you can put in a closet or behind a chair experiment most often i dont think too hard about the specific materials and color combos im going to use in a piece i usually decide the technique then graze on my bead stash gathering what catches my eye sometimes these materials can seem at odds with each other but i proceed anyway i place all the materials on my work placeit can be as simple as a bead mat even a paper platethen i begin i give myself permission to start wherever i feel the impulse and to change my mind midstream my sense is there is usually a piece that wants to emerge and if you can get your mind out of the way for a while theres a good chance youll surprise yourself one rule i have for myself is i make myself finish a piece even if i think its ugly most activities look messy when they are in processthink of cooking a meal or cleaning a room usually when i let myself finish a piece ive started it turns out well beading is a very forgiving hobbyif you dont like it you can take it apart when
