sloanapr  editors note on april  goldman sachs agreed to a  billion fine with the department of justice for deceiving investors in mortgage bonds in late  fortune published house of junk one of the first stories to document how wall street had packaged up risky mortgages into bonds and sold those bonds off as safe investments to an unsuspecting investing public the story looked under the cover of one particularly rotten mortgage bond underwritten by goldman the story went on to win a number of awards including a loeb award one of business journalisms highest honors according to the loeb judges of the countless stories about the subprime crisis this piece stood out among the rest in depth of reporting and quality of writingits getting hard to wrap your brain around subprime mortgages wall streets fancy name for junk home loans theres so much subprime stuff floating around—more than  trillion of loans maybe  billion of losses thousands of families facing foreclosure umpteen politicians yapping—that its like the federal budget its just too big to be understandableso lets reduce this macro story to human scale meet gsamp trust s a  million drop in the junkmortgage bucket part of the more than halfatrillion dollars of mortgagebacked securities issued last year we found this issue by asking mortgage mavens to pick the worst deal they knew of that had been floated by a toptier firm—and this ones pretty badrelatedfortune goldman sachs is warming up to casual dress codesfortune goldman sachs is warming up to casual dress codesit was sold by goldman sachs gs—gsamp originally stood for goldman sachs alternative mortgage products but now has become a name itself like att t and m mmm this issue which is backed by ultrarisky secondmortgage loans contains all the elements that facilitated the housing bubble and bust its got speculators searching for quick gains in hot housing markets its got loans that seem to have been made with little or no serious analysis by lenders and finally its got wall street which churned out mortgage product because buyers wanted it as they say on the street when the ducks quack feed themalas almost everyone involved in this duckfeeding deal has had a foul experience less than  months after the issue was floated a sixth of the borrowers had already defaulted on their loans investors who paid face value for these securities—they were looking for slightly more interest than theyd get on equivalent bonds—have suffered heavy losses thats because their securities have either defaulted for a  loss or been downgraded by creditrating agencies which has depressed the securities market prices check out one of these jewels on a bloomberg machine and the price chart looks like something falling off a cliffeven goldman may have lost money on gsamp—but being goldman the firm has more than covered its losses by betting successfully that the price of junk mortgages would drop of course goldman knew a lot about this market gsamp was just one of  mortgagebacked issues totaling  billion that goldman sold last yearnow lets take it from the topin the spring of  goldman assembled  secondmortgage loans originated by fremont investment  loan long beach mortgage co and assorted other players more than a third of the loans were in california then a hot market it was a runofthemill deal one of the  residential mortgagebacked issues totaling  billion that were sold last yearthe average equity that the secondmortgage borrowers had in their homes was  no thats not a misprint—the average loantovalue of the issues borrowers was  it gets even hinkier some  of the loans were nodocumentation or lowdocumentation this means that although  of the borrowers said they were occupying the homes they were borrowing on—“owneroccupied loans are considered less risky than loans to speculators—no one knows if that was true and no one knows whether borrowers incomes or assets bore any serious relationship to what they told the mortgage lendersfor more on wall street and the financial crisis robert rubin was targeted by financial crisis commissionyou can see why borrowers lined up for the loans even though they carried high interest rates if you took out one of these second mortgages and a typical  first mortgage you got to buy a house with essentially none of your own money at risk if house prices rose youd have a profit if house prices fell and you couldnt make your mortgage payments youd get to walk away with nothing or almost nothing out of pocket it was gogo finance very st centuryfor more on goldman sachs watch this fortune videogoldman acquired these secondmortgage loans and put them together as gsamp trust s to transform them into securities it could sell to investors it divided them into tranches—which is french for slices in case youre interestedthere are trillions of dollars of mortgagebacked securities in the world for the same reason that tyson foods offers you chicken pieces rather than insisting you buy an entire bird tyson can slice a chicken into breasts legs thighs giblets—and lord knows what else—and get more for the pieces than it gets for a whole chicken customers are happy because they get only the pieces they wantsimilarly wall street carves mortgages into tranches because it can get more for the pieces than it would get for whole mortgages mortgages have maturities that are unpredictable and they require all that messy maintenance like collecting the monthly payments making sure real estate taxes are paid chasing slowpay and nopay borrowers and sending out annual statements of interest and taxes paid securities are simpler to deal with and can be customizedsomeone wants a safe relatively lowinterest shortterm security fine well give him a nice aaarated slice that gets repaid quickly and is very unlikely to default someone wants a risky piece with a potentially very rich yield an indefinite maturity and no credit rating at all one unrated x tranche coming right up interested in legs thighs giblets the heart the butcher—excuse us the investment banker—gives customers what they wantin this case goldman sliced the  million of second mortgages into  separate tranches the  million of top tranches—named cleverly a a and a—carried the lowest interest rates and the least risk the  million of intermediate tranches—m for mezzanine  through —are next in line to get paid and carry progressively higher interest ratesrelatedmastering dataoracle once talked to palantir about a potential acquisitionmastering dataoracle once talked to palantir about a potential acquisitionfinally goldman sold two noninvestmentgrade tranches the first b  million went to the luxembourgbased ubs absolute return fund which is aimed at nonus investors and thus spread gsamps problems beyond our borders the second b  million went to the morgan keegan select high income fund like most of this article this information is based on our reading of various public filings ubs and morgan keegan both declined to comment goldman wouldnt say but it appears to have kept the th piece the x tranche which had a face value of  million and would have been worth much more had things gone as projected as its fee for putting the deal together goldman may have had money at risk in some of the other tranches but theres no way to know without goldmans cooperation which wasnt forthcominghow is a buyer of securities like these supposed to know how safe they are there are two options the first is to do what we did read the page prospectus related documents and other public records with a jaundiced eye and try to see how things can go wrong the second is to rely on the underwriter and the creditrating agencies—moodys and standard  poors that of course is what nearly everyone doesin any event its impossible for investors to conduct an independent analysis of the borrowers credit quality even if they choose to invest the time money and effort to do so thats because goldman like other assemblers of mortgagebacked deals doesnt tell investors who the borrowers are one goldman filing lists more than  pages of individual loans—but theyre by code number and zip code not name and addresseven though the individual loans in gsamp looked like financial toxic waste  of the issue or  million was rated aaa by both agencies—as secure as us treasury bonds another  million  of the issue was rated investment grade at levels from aa to bbb thus a total of  was rated investment grade thats despite the fact that this issue is backed by second mortgages of dubious quality on homes in which the borrowers most of whose income and financial assertions werent vetted by anyone had less than  equity and on which gsamp couldnt effectively foreclosehow does toxic waste get distilled into spring water watch its all in the math—and the assumptions about how borrowers will behavethese loans which are fixedrate carried an average interest rate of  after paying the people who collected the payments and handled all the other paperwork the gsamp trust had ten percentage points left however the interest on the securities that gsamp issued ran to only about  we say about because some of the tranches are floatingrate rather than fixedrate the difference between gsamps interest income and interest expense was projected at  a year that spread was supposed to provide a cushion to offset defaults by borrowers in addition the aforementioned x piece didnt get fixed monthly payments and thus provided another bit of protection for the  tranches ranked above itremember that were dealing with securities not actual loans thus losses arent shared equally by all of gsamps investors any loan losses would first hit the x tranche then if x were wiped out the losses would work their way up the food chain tranche by tranche b b m and so onthe  million a tranche  of which has already been repaid was designed to be supersafe and quickpaying it gets first dibs on principal paydowns from regular monthly payments refinancings and borrowers paying off their loans because theyre selling their homes then after a is paid in full its the turn of a and a and so on down the linemoodys projected in a public analysis of the issue that less than  of the loans would ultimately default sp which gave the securities the same ratings that moodys did almost certainly reached a similar conclusion but hasnt filed a public analysis and wouldnt share its numbers with us as long as housing prices kept rising it all looked copaceticgoldman peddled the securities in late april  in a matter of months the mathematical models used to assemble and market this issue—and the models that moodys and sp used to rate it—proved to be horribly flawed thats because the models were based on recent performances ofjunkmortgage borrowers who hadnt defaulted much until last year thanks to the housing bubblethrough the end of  if you couldnt make your mortgage payments you could generally get out from under by selling the house at a profit or refinancing it but in  we hit an inflection point house prices began stagnating or falling in many markets instead of hpa—industry shorthand for houseprice appreciation—we had hpd houseprice depreciationinterest rates on mortgages stopped falling way too late as usual regulators and lenders began imposing higher credit standards if you had borrowed plus of the purchase price as the average gsamp borrower did and couldnt make your payments couldnt refinance and couldnt sell at a profit it was over lights outas a secondmortgage holder gsamp couldnt foreclose on deadbeats unless the firstmortgage holder also foreclosed thats because to foreclose on a second mortgage you have to repay the first mortgage in full and there was no money set aside to do that so if a borrower decided to keep on paying the first mortgage but not the second the holder of the second would get baggedif the holder of the first mortgage foreclosed there was likely to be little or nothing left for gsamp the secondmortgage holder indeed the monthly reports issued by deutsche bank the issues trustee indicate that gsamp has recovered almost nothing on its foreclosed loansby february  moodys and sp began downgrading the issue see chart both agencies dropped the toprated tranches all the way to bbb from their original aaa depressing the securities market price substantiallyin march less than a year after the issue was sold gsamp began defaulting on its obligations by the end of september  of the loans had defaulted according to deutsche bank as a result the x tranche both b tranches and the four bottom m tranches have been wiped out and m is being chewed up like a frame house with termites at this point theres no way to know whether any of the a tranches will ultimately be impairedin hindsight i think we would not have rated it had moodys realized what was going on in the junkmortgage market says nicolas weill the firms chief credit officer for structured finance low credit scores and high loantovalue ratios were taken into account in moodys original analysis of course but the firm now thinks there were things it didnt know about weill doesnt lay blame on any particular party although in a sept  special report posted on moodys website he called for additional thirdparty oversight that reviews the accuracy of the information provided by borrowers appraisers and brokers to originators when it comes to junk issues or as he calls them nonprimesp by contrast says that it considers both its original rating and subsequent downward revisions correct we used the best information available at the time says vickie tillman sps chief rating officerif you read documents that goldman filed with the sec in connection with this offering you discover that they warn about pretty much everything weve discussed so far and some things we havent the impact of falling house prices the difficulty of foreclosing the possible changes in credit ratings the fact that more than half the mortgages were in california florida and new york all of which were overheated markets its all disclosed in capital letters so no buyer—and this is aimed at sophisticated investors—can say he wasnt warnedgoldman said it made money in the third quarter by shorting an index of mortgagebacked securities that prompted fortune to ask the firm to explain to us how it had managed to come out ahead while so many of its mortgagebacked customers were getting stompedgoldmans profits came from hedging the mortgage securities it keeps in inventory in order to make trading markets it said in a recent sec filing although we recognized significant losses on our nonprime mortgage loans and securities those losses were more than offset by gains on short mortgage positionsas we interpret this—the firm declined to elaborate—goldman made more on its hedges than it lost on its inventory because junk mortgages fell even more sharply than goldman thought they wouldwhat is there to take away from our course in junk mortgages  two things first you have to pay at least some attention to all those risk factors that issuers forever warn you about—especially when youre dealing with a whole new thing like junk mortgages issued en masse instead of by specialists second when you rely on the underwriter and the rating

august   edt first published on thursday  august   edt a former goldman sachs trader nicknamed fabulous fab has been found liable of six fraud claims in one of the most highprofile cases related to the credit crunch fabrice tourre was described by the face of wall street greed by securities and exchange commission lawyers during a civil case brought by federal regulators in response to the  mortgage crisis a new york city jury found tourre guilty of six out of seven of the sec fraud claims he faces potential fines and a possible ban from the financial industry the exact punishment will be determined at a later hearing the sec had accused tourre of misleading investors about subprime mortgage securities that he knew were doomed to fail that allowed a goldman sachs client paulson  co to secretly bet against the investment the manoeuvre ended up making bn for paulson and co and its wealthy president john a paulson and millions of dollars in fees for goldman the sec also sought to show that it helped earn tourre a bonus that boosted his salary to  million in  we are gratified by the jurys verdict said andrew ceresney codirector of the secs enforcement division we will continue to vigorously seek to hold accountable and bring to trial when necessary those who commit fraud on wall street the sec alleged that tourre  used a product known as abacus ac to mislead investors the regulator alleged that he failed to declare that paulson had helped choose and intended to bet against mortgage securities underlying the  deal torre a midlevel executive at goldman sachs was the only individual ever charged in relation to abacus goldman sachs escaped with a thenrecord m fine to settle sec charges in  without admitting or denying guilt during the trial sec lawyers confronted tourre with a january  email in which the sec said tourre had deliberately misled another institutional investor about paulsons position in the investment asked repeatedly if the information in the email was false tourre responded it was not accurate he added i wasnt trying to confuse anybody it just wasnt accurate at the time sec lawyer matthew martens told the jury that tourres testimony had been imaginary unreal dreamlike and accused the trader of living in a fantasy world tourres lawyer said the investments failure should be put in the perspective of a turbulent economy he noted that similarly packaged securities went off the cliff as well after  some of the testimony centred on personal emails sent by tourre who grew up in france and moved to the us in  to study at sanford to his girlfriend back in europe in the email sent as the markets teetered on the edge of panic toure referred to himself using the nickname fabulous fab the moniker leant itself to the idea of corporate greed and vanity running riot at a time when investors were losing savings the whole building is about to collapse anytime now … only potential survivor the fabulous fab … standing in the middle of all these complex highly leveraged exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstruosities sic tourre wrote other messages noted that a friend had given tourre the nickname despite him saying there was nothing fabulous about me the civil case had been called the most significant legal action related to the mortgage securities meltdown but the associated press reported that it lacked the drama and high stakes of whitecollar criminal cases much of the testimony was devoted to the intricacies of synthetic collateralised debt obligations or cdos a complex type of investment central to the case the associated press said tourre left court without talking to reporters the associated press in new york contributed to this report emails that brought trader down until  few people had heard of fabrice tourre but from the moment goldman sachs released some of his emails in connection with a us senate investigation into the causes of the financial crisis the frenchborn trader became famous as fabulous fab speaking to the wall street journal before yesterdays verdict the yearold had conceded he would never shake the image you cannot erase google searches he said you will forever get the same articles forever get the fabulous fab called to appear before the senate for its investigation in april  tourre rebutted unfounded attacks on his character i firmly believe that my conduct was correct he told the hearing – although he did admit errors of judgment in the infamous emails that appeared to demean his work at goldman they reflect very bad on the firm and myself i wish i hadnt sent them an email sent in march  referred to the financial products he worked on as pure intellectual masturbation the type of thing which you invent telling yourself well what if we created a thing which has no purpose which is absolutely conceptual and highly theoretical and which nobody knows how to price tourre joined goldman in new york

allegedly misleading results in december edit in april  floyd norris chief financial correspondent of the new york times accused goldman sachs of misleading investors by having puffed up its first quarter  earnings by creating a december orphan month into which it shifted large writedowns so they did not appear in any quarterly number in april  the company reported a  million net loss for the single month of december but reported net earnings of  billion for the first quarter of  however the accounting change to a calendar fiscal year which created the stub month of december  was required when the firm converted to a bank holding company and declared in item  of its form k us securities and exchange commission sec filing of december   the december loss also included a  million marktomarket writedown on loans to chemical maker lyondellbasell since it became clear in december that lyondell would file for bankruptcy protection and would not be able to meet its debt obligations while the results of december  were detailed in the press release reporting the results of december  and the first quarter of  and the related conference call with analysts according to an article in the washington post by david s hilzenrath the company included a page of charts in its monday news release showing its december results but it didnt include a narrative description of those results as it did for the januarythroughmarch period most financial analysts and the mainstream financial press were aware of the required change in fiscal year and deteriorating market conditions into december and were not surprised by the december loss analysts focused more on the first quarter results and the planned repayment of tarp funds but even merrill lynch told its clients not to forget about december merrill lynch took at least  billion of losses in the same period and morgan stanley which was also required to switch to a calendar year for accounting purposes as a result of its conversion to a bank holding company also reported a large loss for its stub month of december although unlike goldman morgan stanley also lost money in the first quarter of  bonuses paid to employees in  despite financial crisisedit in june  after the firm repaid the tarp investment from the us treasury goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance andrew cuomo then new york attorney general questioned goldmans decision to pay  employees bonuses of at least  million each after it received tarp funds in  that same period however ceo lloyd blankfein and  other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses stating they believed it was the right thing to do in light of the fact that we are part of an industry thats directly associated with the ongoing economic distress benefits from the government bailout of aigedit american international group received  billion in government loans during the financial crisis the money was used to repay customers of its securitylending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from aig however due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks including goldman sachs should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to aig the new york state attorney general andrew cuomo announced in march  that he was investigating whether aigs trading counterparties improperly received government money goldman sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to aig and received  billion during the unwind of credit default swap cds contracts by aig after receiving the government loans firms response to criticism of aig paymentsedit goldman sachs maintained that its net exposure to aig was not material and that the firm was protected by hedges in the form of cdss with other counterparties and  billion of collateral the firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over  million according to goldman both the collateral and cdss would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an aig bankruptcy however because aig was bailed out and not allowed to fail these hedges did not pay out cfo david viniar stated that profits related to aig in the first quarter of  rounded to zero and profits in december were not significant he went on to say that he was mystified by the interest the government and investors have shown in the banks trading relationship with aig considerable speculation remains that goldmans hedges against its aig exposure would not have paid out if aig was allowed to fail according to a report by the united states office of the inspector general of tarp if aig had collapsed it would have made it difficult for goldman to liquidate its trading positions with aig even at discounts and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that might have made it difficult for goldman sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an aig default finally the report said an aig default would have forced goldman sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations goldman argued that cdss are marked to market ie valued at their current market price and their positions netted between counterparties daily thus as the cost of insuring aigs obligations against default rose substantially in the leadup to its bailout the sellers of the cds contracts had to post more collateral to goldman sachs the firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an aig bankruptcy and the risk of knockon defaults had aig been allowed to fail however in practice the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an aig bankruptcy if the government let aig default according to money manager michael lewitt its collapse would be as close to an extinctionlevel event as the financial markets have seen since the great depression september   meetings at the new york federal reserveedit some have said incorrectly according to others that goldman sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only wall street firm to have participated in the crucial september meetings at the new york fed which decided aigs fate much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted new york times article the article was later corrected to state that blankfein ceo of goldman sachs was one of the wall street chief executives at the meeting emphasis added bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the september aig meetings furthermore goldman sachs cfo david viniar stated that ceo blankfein had never met with his predecessor and thenus treasury secretary henry paulson to discuss aig however there were frequent phone calls between the two of them paulson was not present at the september meetings at the new york fed morgan stanley was hired by the federal reserve to advise on the aig bailout according to the new york times paulson spoke with the ceo of goldman sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so while it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence particularly in a crisis the times noted he spoke with goldmans blankfein more frequently than with other large banks federal officials say that although paulson was involved in decisions to rescue aig it was the federal reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the aig bailout  million settlement for massachusetts subprime mortgages edit on may   goldman sachs agreed to pay up to  million to end an investigation by the massachusetts attorney generals office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state the settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of  massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by goldman sachs michael duvally a spokesman for goldman said it was pleased to have resolved this matter and declined to comment further this settlement may open the door to state government actions against goldman throughout the united states aimed at securing compensation for predatory mortgage lending practices abacus mortgagebacked cdos and  million settlement edit see also merrill lynch § cdo controversies and magnetar capital unlike many investors and investment bankers goldman sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis that developed in  some of its traders became bearish on the housing boom beginning in  and developed mortgagerelated securities originally intended to protect goldman from investment losses in the housing market in late  goldman management changed the firms overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative as the market began its downturn goldman created even more of these securities no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but according to business journalist gretchen morgenson enabling it to pocket huge profits from the mortgage defaults and that goldman used the cdos to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes authors bethany mclean and joe nocera stated that the firms later insistence that it was merely a market maker in these transactions—implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients—became less true over time the investments were called synthetic cdos because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as credit default swaps goldman and some other hedge funds held a short position in the securities paying the premiums while the investors insurance companies pension funds etc receiving the premiums were the long position the longs were responsible for paying the insurance claim to goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted through april  goldman issued over  cdos in its abacus series worth a total of  billion all together goldman packaged sold and shorted a total of  synthetic cdos with an aggregate face value of  billion between july   and may   but while goldman was praised for its foresight some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure these securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by april  at least us billion worth of the securities either carried junk ratings or had defaulted one cdo examined by critics which goldman bet against but also sold to investors was the  million hudson mezzanine cdo issued in  in the senate permanent subcommittee hearings goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books unable to sell them directly it included them in the underlying securities of the cdo and took the short side but critics mclean and nocera complained the cdo prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as assets sourced from the street making it sound as though goldman randomly selected the securities instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book the cdo did not perform well and by march —just  months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out about us million to goldman and others who had bet against it goldmans head of european fixedincome sales lamented in an email made public by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations the real bad feeling across european sales about some of the trades we did with clients who had invested in the cdo the damage this has done to our franchise is very significant critics also complain that while goldmans investors were large ostensibly sophisticated banks and insurers at least some of the cdo securities and their losses filtered down to small public agencies—money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets for example an investor in abacus ikb bank created a structured investment vehicle called rhinebridge rhinebridge like other sivs issued debt that it then used to buy mortgagebacked securities and cdos like abacus the debt issued by rhinebridge  was bought by among others king county washington which managed money on behalf of one hundred other public agencies this was money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets   for all of goldmans later claims that it dealt only with the most sophisticated of investors the fact remained that those investors could be fiduciaries investing on behalf of school districts fire departments pensioners and municipalities all across the country ikb paid for its share of the deal with money it collected from a number of relatively unsophisticated investors including king county in washington state in  the county bought us million of commercial paper a type of shortterm debt from rhineland a special fund created by ikb that in turn snapped up nearly us million of the securities created by the goldman vehicle known as abacus ac  king county also made a usmillion purchase  in  from another ikb fund dubbed rhinebridge the county lost us million when rhinebridge collapsed—and an additional us million when other similar funds defaulted about  county agencies in the seattle area including some that deal with libraries and schools saw their budgets cut as a result in public statements goldman claimed that it shorted simply to hedge and was not expecting the cdos to fail it also denied that its investors were unaware of goldmans bets against the products it was selling to them there were intricate links between a goldman sachs trader jonathan m egol synthetic collateralized debt obligations or cdo abacus and assetbacked securities index abx goldman is also alleged to have tried to pressure the credit rating agency moodys give its products a higher rating than they deserved according to an article in propublica goldman and other firms often seemed to have pressured the agencies to give good ratings emails released last week by the senate investigations subcommittee give a glimpse of the backandforth pdf i am getting serious pushback from goldman on a deal that they want to go to market with today wrote one moodys employee in an internal email message in april  the senate subcommittee found that rating decisions were often subject to concerns about losing market share to competitors the agencies are after all paid by the firms whose products they rate  sec civil fraud lawsuitedit in april  the us securities and exchange commission sec charged goldman sachs and one of its vicepresidents fabrice tourre with securities fraud the sec alleged that goldman had told buyers of a synthetic cdo a type of investment that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent cdo manager aca management in fact paulson  co a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a significant role in the selection and the package of securities turned out to become one of the worstperforming mortgage deals of the housing crisis because less than a year after the deal was completed  of the bonds selected for abacus had been downgraded the particular synthetic cdo that the secs  fraud suit charged goldman with misleading investors with was called abacus ac unlike many of the abacus securities ac did not have goldman sachs as a short seller in fact goldman sachs lost money on the deal that position was taken by the customer john paulson who hired goldman to issue the security according to the secs complaint paulson and his employees selected  bbbrated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for paulson and the manager of the cdo aca management worked on the portfolio of  bonds to be insured aca allegedly unaware of paulsons short position coming to an agreement in late february  paulson paid goldman approximately us million for its work in the deal paulson ultimately made a us billion from the short investments the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers these were primarily ikb deutsche industriebank us million loss and the investors and insurers of another us million—aca financial guaranty corp abn amro and the royal bank of scotland the sec alleged that goldman materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents about the financial security including the fact that it had permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market the hedge fund manager paulson  co to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent objective third party aca management the sec further alleged that tourre also misled aca into believing  that paulsons interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with acas when in reality paulsons interests were sharply conflicting in reply goldman issued a statement saying the secs charges were unfounded in law and fact and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the cdo that it had lost  million that aca selected the portfolio without goldman suggesting paulson was to be a long investor that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa as it was not normal business practice for a market maker and that aca was itself the largest purchaser of the abacus pool investing us million goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector rather than from a particular security in the cdo while some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading others believed goldmans defense was strong and the secs case was weak some experts on securities law such as duke university law professor james cox believed the suit had merit because goldman was aware of the relevance of paulsons involvement and took steps to downplay it others including wayne state university law school law professor peter henning noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved even without knowledge of the part played by paulson critics of goldman sachs point out that paulson went to goldman sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank bear stearns who he had asked to build a cdo ira wagner the head of bear stearnss cdo group in  told the financial crisis inquiry commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal paulson was proposing encouraged paulson to pick the worst assets describing bear stearnss reasoning one author compared the deal to a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team goldman claimed it lost  million critics maintain it was simply unable not due to a lack of trying to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted critics also question whether the deal was ethical even if it was legal goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers according to mclean and nocera there were dozens of securities being insured in the cdo—for example another abacus—had  credits from several different mortgage originators commercial mortgagebacked securities debt from sallie mae credit cards etc goldman bought mortgages to create securities which made it far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like new century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgageholders back—which is why the fine print on at least one abacus prospectus warned long investors that the protection buyer goldman may have information including material nonpublic information which it was not providing to the long investors according to an article in the houston chronicle critics also worried that abacus might undermine the position of the us as a safe harbor for the worlds investors and that the involvement of european interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that regions political leaders most notably british prime minister gordon brown who has accused goldman of moral bankruptcy this is in short a big global story  is what goldman sachs did with its abacus investment vehicle illegal that will be for the courts to decide  but it doesnt take a judge and jury to conclude that legalities aside this was just wrong on july   goldman settled out of court agreeing to pay the sec and investors us million including  million to the us government and  million to investors one of the largest penalties ever paid by a wall street firm in august  tourre was found liable on  of  counts by a federal jury the company did not admit or deny wrongdoing but did admit that its marketing materials for the investment contained incomplete information and agreed to change some of its business practices regarding mortgage investments tourre defense of abacus lawsuitedit the  goldman settlement did not cover charges against goldman vice president and salesman for abacus fabrice tourre tourre unsuccessfully sought a dismissal of the suit which then went to trial in  on august  a federal jury found tourre liable on six of seven counts including that he misled investors about the mortgage deal he was found not liable on the charge that he had deliberately made an untrue or misleading statement senate report on the causes of the financial crisis of edit on april   the united states senates permanent subcommittee on investigations released a page report entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse which described some of the causes of the financial crisis the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the united states department of justice to determine whether goldman executives had broken the law and two months later the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed goldman for relevant information on possible securities fraud but on august  the justice department announced it had decided not to file charges against goldman sachs or its employees for trades made during the subprime

years since the laws passing goldman sach and other investment banks morgan stanley jpmorgan chase have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials such as food products zinc copper tin nickel and aluminum some critics such as matt taibbi believe that allowing a company to both control the supply of crucial physical commodities and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets is akin to letting casino owners who take book on nfl games during the week also coach all the teams on sundays goldman sachs commodity index and the – food bubbleedit frederick kaufman a contributing editor of harpers magazine argued in a  article that goldmans creation of the goldman sachs commodity index now the sp gsci helped passive investors such as pension funds mutual funds and others engage in food price speculation by betting on financial products based on the commodity index these financial products disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange a june  article in the economist defended commodity investors and oil indextracking funds citing a report by the organisation for economic cooperation and development that found that commodities without futures markets and ignored by indextracking funds also saw price rises during the period aluminum price and supplyedit in a july  article david kocieniewski a journalist with the new york times accused goldman sachs and other wall street firms of capitalizing on loosened federal regulations to manipulate a variety of commodities markets particularly aluminum citing financial records regulatory documents and interviews with people involved in the activities after goldman sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company metro international in  the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories—to make beer cans home siding and other products—went from an average of  weeks to more than  months according to industry records aluminum industry analysts say that the lengthy delays at metro international after goldman took over are a major reason the premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market has doubled since  the price increase has cost american consumers more than  billion from  to  according to former industry executives analysts and consultants the cause of this was alleged to be goldmans ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of  metro international warehouses goldman owns in detroit michigan to avoid hoarding and price manipulation the london metal exchange requires that at least  tons of that metal must be moved out each day goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum—not to factories but from one warehouse to another—according to the times in august  goldman sachs was subpoenaed by the federal commodity futures trading commission as part of an investigation into complaints that goldmanowned metals warehouses had intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum in december  it was announced that  cases accusing goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase the two investment banks warehousing businesses and the london metal exchange in various combinations—of violating us antitrust laws would be assigned to united states district court for the southern district of new york judge katherine b forrest in manhattan according to lydia depillis of wonkblog when goldman bought the warehouses it started paying traders extra to bring their metal to goldmans warehouses rather than anywhere else the longer it stays the more rent goldman can charge which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium the effect is amplified by another company glencore which is doing the same thing in its warehouse in vlissingen michael duvally a spokesman for goldman sachs said the cases are without merit robert lenzner a columnist at forbes wrote that goldman sachs controls only  of the global market and is therefore too small to have pricing power an article published by bloomberg lp also debunked the conspiracy theory in december  goldman sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to ruben brothers oil futures speculationedit investment banks including goldman have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange in august  confidential documents were leaked detailing the positions in the oil futures market of several investment banks including goldman sachs morgan stanley jpmorgan chase deutsche bank and barclays just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of  the presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets and so the means to significantly sway prices and unlike traditional market participants neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold journalist kate sheppard of mother jones called it a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude however another source stated that just before crude oil hit its record high in mid  of the worlds largest banks were betting that prices would fall according to private trading data in april  a couple of observers—brad johnson of the blog climate progress founded by joseph j romm and alain sherter of cbs moneywatch—noted that goldman sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil climate progress quoted goldman as warning that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation in petroleum futures and that net speculative positions are four times as high as in june  when the price of oil peaked it stated that goldman sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least  higher than supply and demand dictate sherter noted that goldmans concern over speculation did not prevent it along with other speculators from lobbying against regulations by the commodity futures trading commission to establish position limits which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold and thus prevent speculation according to joseph p kennedy ii by  prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by hedge funds and bankers pumping billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price the problem started according to kennedy in  when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the new york mercantile exchange goldman sachs made an argument to the commodity futures trading commission that wall street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades the commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed goldman sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades other exemptions followed and by  eight investment banks accounted for  of the total oil futures market initial public

initial public offerings it was underwriting documents under seal in a decadelong lawsuit concerning etoyscoms initial public offering ipo in  but released accidentally to the new york times show that ipos managed by goldman were underpriced and that goldman asked clients able to profit from the prices to increase business with it the clients willingly complied with these demands because they

in may  concerning friedmans involvement with goldman and in particular his purchase of the firms stock when it traded at historical lows in the fourth quarter of  fueled controversy and criticism

supervised release and ordered to pay  million in fines stub month and allegedly misleading results in december edit in april  floyd norris chief financial correspondent of the new york times accused goldman sachs of misleading investors by having puffed up its first quarter  earnings by creating a december orphan month into which it shifted large writedowns so they did not appear in any quarterly number in april  the company reported a  million net loss for the single month of december but reported net earnings of  billion for the first quarter of  however the accounting change to a calendar fiscal year which created the stub month of december  was required when the firm converted to a bank holding company and declared in item  of its form k us securities and exchange commission sec filing of december   the december loss also included a  million marktomarket writedown on loans to chemical maker lyondellbasell since it became clear in december that lyondell would file for bankruptcy protection and would not be able to meet its debt obligations while the results of december  were detailed in the press release reporting the results of december  and the first quarter of  and the related conference call with analysts according to an article in the washington post by david s hilzenrath the company included a page of charts in its monday news release showing its december results but it didnt include a narrative description of those results as it did for the januarythroughmarch period most financial analysts and the mainstream financial press were aware of the required change in fiscal year and deteriorating market conditions into december and were not surprised by the december loss analysts focused more on the first quarter results and the planned repayment of tarp funds but even merrill lynch told its clients not to forget about december merrill lynch took at least  billion of losses in the same period and morgan stanley which was also required to switch to a calendar year for accounting purposes as a result of its conversion to a bank holding company also reported a large loss for its stub month of december although unlike goldman morgan stanley also lost money in the first quarter of  bonuses paid to employees in  despite financial crisisedit in june  after the firm repaid the tarp investment from the us treasury goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance andrew cuomo then new york attorney general questioned goldmans decision to pay  employees bonuses of at least  million each after it received tarp funds in  that same period however ceo lloyd blankfein and  other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses stating they believed it was the right thing to do in light of the fact that we are part of an industry thats directly associated with the ongoing economic distress benefits from the government bailout of aigedit american international group received  billion in government loans during the financial crisis the money was used to repay customers of its securitylending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from aig however due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks including goldman sachs should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to aig the new york state attorney general andrew cuomo announced in march  that he was investigating whether aigs trading counterparties improperly received government money goldman sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to aig and received  billion during the unwind of credit default swap cds contracts by aig after receiving the government loans firms response to criticism of aig paymentsedit goldman sachs maintained that its net exposure to aig was not material and that the firm was protected by hedges in the form of cdss with other counterparties and  billion of collateral the firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over  million according to goldman both the collateral and cdss would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an aig bankruptcy however because aig was bailed out and not allowed to fail these hedges did not pay out cfo david viniar stated that profits related to aig in the first quarter of  rounded to zero and profits in december were not significant he went on to say that he was mystified by the interest the government and investors have shown in the banks trading relationship with aig considerable speculation remains that goldmans hedges against its aig exposure would not have paid out if aig was allowed to fail according to a report by the united states office of the inspector general of tarp if aig had collapsed it would have made it difficult for goldman to liquidate its trading positions with aig even at discounts and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that might have made it difficult for goldman sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an aig default finally the report said an aig default would have forced goldman sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations goldman argued that cdss are marked to market ie valued at their current market price and their positions netted between counterparties daily thus as the cost of insuring aigs obligations against default rose substantially in the leadup to its bailout the sellers of the cds contracts had to post more collateral to goldman sachs the firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an aig bankruptcy and the risk of knockon defaults had aig been allowed to fail however in practice the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an aig bankruptcy if the government let aig default according to money manager michael lewitt its collapse would be as close to an extinctionlevel event as the financial markets have seen since the great depression september   meetings at the new york federal reserveedit some have said incorrectly according to others that goldman sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only wall street firm to have participated in the crucial september meetings at the new york fed which decided aigs fate much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted new york times article the article was later corrected to state that blankfein ceo of goldman sachs was one of the wall street chief executives at the meeting emphasis added bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the september aig meetings furthermore goldman sachs cfo david viniar stated that ceo blankfein had never met with his predecessor and thenus treasury secretary henry paulson to discuss aig however there were frequent phone calls between the two of them paulson was not present at the september meetings at the new york fed morgan stanley was hired by the federal reserve to advise on the aig bailout according to the new york times paulson spoke with the ceo of goldman sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so while it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence particularly in a crisis the times noted he spoke with goldmans blankfein more frequently than with other large banks federal officials say that although paulson was involved in decisions to rescue aig it was the federal reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the aig bailout  million settlement for massachusetts subprime mortgages edit on may   goldman sachs agreed to pay up to  million to end an investigation by the massachusetts attorney generals office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state the settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of  massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by goldman sachs michael duvally a spokesman for goldman said it was pleased to have resolved this matter and declined to comment further this settlement may open the door to state government actions against goldman throughout the united states aimed at securing compensation for predatory mortgage lending practices abacus mortgagebacked cdos and  million settlement edit see also merrill lynch § cdo controversies and magnetar capital unlike many investors and investment bankers goldman sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis that developed in  some of its traders became bearish on the housing boom beginning in  and developed mortgagerelated securities originally intended to protect goldman from investment losses in the housing market in late  goldman management changed the firms overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative as the market began its downturn goldman created even more of these securities no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but according to business journalist gretchen morgenson enabling it to pocket huge profits from the mortgage defaults and that goldman used the cdos to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes authors bethany mclean and joe nocera stated that the firms later insistence that it was merely a market maker in these transactions—implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients—became less true over time the investments were called synthetic cdos because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as credit default swaps goldman and some other hedge funds held a short position in the securities paying the premiums while the investors insurance companies pension funds etc receiving the premiums were the long position the longs were responsible for paying the insurance claim to goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted through april  goldman issued over  cdos in its abacus series worth a total of  billion all together goldman packaged sold and shorted a total of  synthetic cdos with an aggregate face value of  billion between july   and may   but while goldman was praised for its foresight some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure these securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by april  at least us billion worth of the securities either carried junk ratings or had defaulted one cdo examined by critics which goldman bet against but also sold to investors was the  million hudson mezzanine cdo issued in  in the senate permanent subcommittee hearings goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books unable to sell them directly it included them in the underlying securities of the cdo and took the short side but critics mclean and nocera complained the cdo prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as assets sourced from the street making it sound as though goldman randomly selected the securities instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book the cdo did not perform well and by march —just  months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out about us million to goldman and others who had bet against it goldmans head of european fixedincome sales lamented in an email made public by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations the real bad feeling across european sales about some of the trades we did with clients who had invested in the cdo the damage this has done to our franchise is very significant critics also complain that while goldmans investors were large ostensibly sophisticated banks and insurers at least some of the cdo securities and their losses filtered down to small public agencies—money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets for example an investor in abacus ikb bank created a structured investment vehicle called rhinebridge rhinebridge like other sivs issued debt that it then used to buy mortgagebacked securities and cdos like abacus the debt issued by rhinebridge  was bought by among others king county washington which managed money on behalf of one hundred other public agencies this was money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets   for all of goldmans later claims that it dealt only with the most sophisticated of investors the fact remained that those investors could be fiduciaries investing on behalf of school districts fire departments pensioners and municipalities all across the country ikb paid for its share of the deal with money it collected from a number of relatively unsophisticated investors including king county in washington state in  the county bought us million of commercial paper a type of shortterm debt from rhineland a special fund created by ikb that in turn snapped up nearly us million of the securities created by the goldman vehicle known as abacus ac  king county also made a usmillion purchase  in  from another ikb fund dubbed rhinebridge the county lost us million when rhinebridge collapsed—and an additional us million when other similar funds defaulted about  county agencies in the seattle area including some that deal with libraries and schools saw their budgets cut as a result in public statements goldman claimed that it shorted simply to hedge and was not expecting the cdos to fail it also denied that its investors were unaware of goldmans bets against the products it was selling to them there were intricate links between a goldman sachs trader jonathan m egol synthetic collateralized debt obligations or cdo abacus and assetbacked securities index abx goldman is also alleged to have tried to pressure the credit rating agency moodys give its products a higher rating than they deserved according to an article in propublica goldman and other firms often seemed to have pressured the agencies to give good ratings emails released last week by the senate investigations subcommittee give a glimpse of the backandforth pdf i am getting serious pushback from goldman on a deal that they want to go to market with today wrote one moodys employee in an internal email message in april  the senate subcommittee found that rating decisions were often subject to concerns about losing market share to competitors the agencies are after all paid by the firms whose products they rate  sec civil fraud lawsuitedit in april  the us securities and exchange commission sec charged goldman sachs and one of its vicepresidents fabrice tourre with securities fraud the sec alleged that goldman had told buyers of a synthetic cdo a type of investment that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent cdo manager aca management in fact paulson  co a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a significant role in the selection and the package of securities turned out to become one of the worstperforming mortgage deals of the housing crisis because less than a year after the deal was completed  of the bonds selected for abacus had been downgraded the particular synthetic cdo that the secs  fraud suit charged goldman with misleading investors with was called abacus ac unlike many of the abacus securities ac did not have goldman sachs as a short seller in fact goldman sachs lost money on the deal that position was taken by the customer john paulson who hired goldman to issue the security according to the secs complaint paulson and his employees selected  bbbrated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for paulson and the manager of the cdo aca management worked on the portfolio of  bonds to be insured aca allegedly unaware of paulsons short position coming to an agreement in late february  paulson paid goldman approximately us million for its work in the deal paulson ultimately made a us billion from the short investments the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers these were primarily ikb deutsche industriebank us million loss and the investors and insurers of another us million—aca financial guaranty corp abn amro and the royal bank of scotland the sec alleged that goldman materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents about the financial security including the fact that it had permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market the hedge fund manager paulson  co to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent objective third party aca management the sec further alleged that tourre also misled aca into believing  that paulsons interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with acas when in reality paulsons interests were sharply conflicting in reply goldman issued a statement saying the secs charges were unfounded in law and fact and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the cdo that it had lost  million that aca selected the portfolio without goldman suggesting paulson was to be a long investor that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa as it was not normal business practice for a market maker and that aca was itself the largest purchaser of the abacus pool investing us million goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector rather than from a particular security in the cdo while some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading others believed goldmans defense was strong and the secs case was weak some experts on securities law such as duke university law professor james cox believed the suit had merit because goldman was aware of the relevance of paulsons involvement and took steps to downplay it others including wayne state university law school law professor peter henning noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved even without knowledge of the part played by paulson critics of goldman sachs point out that paulson went to goldman sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank bear stearns who he had asked to build a cdo ira wagner the head of bear stearnss cdo group in  told the financial crisis inquiry commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal paulson was proposing encouraged paulson to pick the worst assets describing bear stearnss reasoning one author compared the deal to a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team goldman claimed it lost  million critics maintain it was simply unable not due to a lack of trying to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted critics also question whether the deal was ethical even if it was legal goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers according to mclean and nocera there were dozens of securities being insured in the cdo—for example another abacus—had  credits from several different mortgage originators commercial mortgagebacked securities debt from sallie mae credit cards etc goldman bought mortgages to create securities which made it far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like new century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgageholders back—which is why the fine print on at least one abacus prospectus warned long investors that the protection buyer goldman may have information including material nonpublic information which it was not providing to the long investors according to an article in the houston chronicle critics also worried that abacus might undermine the position of the us as a safe harbor for the worlds investors and that the involvement of european interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that regions political leaders most notably british prime minister gordon brown who has accused goldman of moral bankruptcy this is in short a big global story  is what goldman sachs did with its abacus investment vehicle illegal that will be for the courts to decide  but it doesnt take a judge and jury to conclude that legalities aside this was just wrong on july   goldman settled out of court agreeing to pay the sec and investors us million including  million to the us government and  million to investors one of the largest penalties ever paid by a wall street firm in august  tourre was found liable on  of  counts by a federal jury the company did not admit or deny wrongdoing but did admit that its marketing materials for the investment contained incomplete information and agreed to change some of its business practices regarding mortgage investments tourre defense of abacus lawsuitedit the  goldman settlement did not cover charges against goldman vice president and salesman for abacus fabrice tourre tourre unsuccessfully sought a dismissal of the suit which then went to trial in  on august  a federal jury found tourre liable on six of seven counts including that he misled investors about the mortgage deal he was found not liable on the charge that he had deliberately made an untrue or misleading statement senate report on the causes of the financial crisis of edit on april   the united states senates permanent subcommittee on investigations released a page report entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse which described some of the causes of the financial crisis the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the united states department of justice to determine whether goldman executives had broken the law and two months later the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed goldman for relevant information on possible securities fraud but on august  the justice department announced it had decided not to file charges against goldman sachs or its employees for trades made during the subprime

years since the laws passing goldman sach and other investment banks morgan stanley jpmorgan chase have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials such as food products zinc copper tin nickel and aluminum some critics such as matt taibbi believe that allowing a company to both control the supply of crucial physical commodities and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets is akin to letting casino owners who take book on nfl games during the week also coach all the teams on sundays goldman sachs commodity index and the – food bubbleedit frederick kaufman a contributing editor of harpers magazine argued in a  article that goldmans creation of the goldman sachs commodity index now the sp gsci helped passive investors such as pension funds mutual funds and others engage in food price speculation by betting on financial products based on the commodity index these financial products disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange a june  article in the economist defended commodity investors and oil indextracking funds citing a report by the organisation for economic cooperation and development that found that commodities without futures markets and ignored by indextracking funds also saw price rises during the period aluminum price and supplyedit in a july  article david kocieniewski a journalist with the new york times accused goldman sachs and other wall street firms of capitalizing on loosened federal regulations to manipulate a variety of commodities markets particularly aluminum citing financial records regulatory documents and interviews with people involved in the activities after goldman sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company metro international in  the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories—to make beer cans home siding and other products—went from an average of  weeks to more than  months according to industry records aluminum industry analysts say that the lengthy delays at metro international after goldman took over are a major reason the premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market has doubled since  the price increase has cost american consumers more than  billion from  to  according to former industry executives analysts and consultants the cause of this was alleged to be goldmans ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of  metro international warehouses goldman owns in detroit michigan to avoid hoarding and price manipulation the london metal exchange requires that at least  tons of that metal must be moved out each day goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum—not to factories but from one warehouse to another—according to the times in august  goldman sachs was subpoenaed by the federal commodity futures trading commission as part of an investigation into complaints that goldmanowned metals warehouses had intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum in december  it was announced that  cases accusing goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase the two investment banks warehousing businesses and the london metal exchange in various combinations—of violating us antitrust laws would be assigned to united states district court for the southern district of new york judge katherine b forrest in manhattan according to lydia depillis of wonkblog when goldman bought the warehouses it started paying traders extra to bring their metal to goldmans warehouses rather than anywhere else the longer it stays the more rent goldman can charge which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium the effect is amplified by another company glencore which is doing the same thing in its warehouse in vlissingen michael duvally a spokesman for goldman sachs said the cases are without merit robert lenzner a columnist at forbes wrote that goldman sachs controls only  of the global market and is therefore too small to have pricing power an article published by bloomberg lp also debunked the conspiracy theory in december  goldman sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to ruben brothers oil futures speculationedit investment banks including goldman have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange in august  confidential documents were leaked detailing the positions in the oil futures market of several investment banks including goldman sachs morgan stanley jpmorgan chase deutsche bank and barclays just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of  the presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets and so the means to significantly sway prices and unlike traditional market participants neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold journalist kate sheppard of mother jones called it a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude however another source stated that just before crude oil hit its record high in mid  of the worlds largest banks were betting that prices would fall according to private trading data in april  a couple of observers—brad johnson of the blog climate progress founded by joseph j romm and alain sherter of cbs moneywatch—noted that goldman sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil climate progress quoted goldman as warning that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation in petroleum futures and that net speculative positions are four times as high as in june  when the price of oil peaked it stated that goldman sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least  higher than supply and demand dictate sherter noted that goldmans concern over speculation did not prevent it along with other speculators from lobbying against regulations by the commodity futures trading commission to establish position limits which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold and thus prevent speculation according to joseph p kennedy ii by  prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by hedge funds and bankers pumping billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price the problem started according to kennedy in  when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the new york mercantile exchange goldman sachs made an argument to the commodity futures trading commission that wall street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades the commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed goldman sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades other exemptions followed and by  eight investment banks accounted for  of the total oil futures market initial public offering kickback bribesedit goldman sachs is accused of asking for kickback bribes from institutional clients who made large profits flipping stocks which goldman had intentionally undervalued in initial public offerings it was underwriting documents under seal in a decadelong lawsuit concerning etoyscoms initial public offering ipo in  but released accidentally to the new york times show that ipos managed by goldman were underpriced and that goldman asked clients able to profit from the prices to increase business with it the clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary in order to participate in further such undervalued ipos companies going public and their initial consumer stockholders are both defrauded by this practice unauthorized trades by goldman sachs trader matthew marshall tayloredit former goldman sachs trader matthew marshall taylor was convicted of hiding  billion worth of unauthorized trades involving derivatives on

supervised release and ordered to pay  million in fines stub month and allegedly misleading results in december edit in april  floyd norris chief financial correspondent of the new york times accused goldman sachs of misleading investors by having puffed up its first quarter  earnings by creating a december orphan month into which it shifted large writedowns so they did not appear in any quarterly number in april  the company reported a  million net loss for the single month of december but reported net earnings of  billion for the first quarter of  however the accounting change to a calendar fiscal year which created the stub month of december  was required when the firm converted to a bank holding company and declared in item  of its form k us securities and exchange commission sec filing of december   the december loss also included a  million marktomarket writedown on loans to chemical maker lyondellbasell since it became clear in december that lyondell would file for bankruptcy protection and would not be able to meet its debt obligations while the results of december  were detailed in the press release reporting the results of december  and the first quarter of  and the related conference call with analysts according to an article in the washington post by david s hilzenrath the company included a page of charts in its monday news release showing its december results but it didnt include a narrative description of those results as it did for the januarythroughmarch period most financial analysts and the mainstream financial press were aware of the required change in fiscal year and deteriorating market conditions into december and were not surprised by the december loss analysts focused more on the first quarter results and the planned repayment of tarp funds but even merrill lynch told its clients not to forget about december merrill lynch took at least  billion of losses in the same period and morgan stanley which was also required to switch to a calendar year for accounting purposes as a result of its conversion to a bank holding company also reported a large loss for its stub month of december although unlike goldman morgan stanley also lost money in the first quarter of  bonuses paid to employees in  despite financial crisisedit in june  after the firm repaid the tarp investment from the us treasury goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance andrew cuomo then new york attorney general questioned goldmans decision to pay  employees bonuses of at least  million each after it received tarp funds in  that same period however ceo lloyd blankfein and  other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses stating they believed it was the right thing to do in light of the fact that we are part of an industry thats directly associated with the ongoing economic distress benefits from the government bailout of aigedit american international group received  billion in government loans during the financial crisis the money was used to repay customers of its securitylending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from aig however due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks including goldman sachs should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to aig the new york state attorney general andrew cuomo announced in march  that he was investigating whether aigs trading counterparties improperly received government money goldman sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to aig and received  billion during the unwind of credit default swap cds contracts by aig after receiving the government loans firms response to criticism of aig paymentsedit goldman sachs maintained that its net exposure to aig was not material and that the firm was protected by hedges in the form of cdss with other counterparties and  billion of collateral the firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over  million according to goldman both the collateral and cdss would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an aig bankruptcy however because aig was bailed out and not allowed to fail these hedges did not pay out cfo david viniar stated that profits related to aig in the first quarter of  rounded to zero and profits in december were not significant he went on to say that he was mystified by the interest the government and investors have shown in the banks trading relationship with aig considerable speculation remains that goldmans hedges against its aig exposure would not have paid out if aig was allowed to fail according to a report by the united states office of the inspector general of tarp if aig had collapsed it would have made it difficult for goldman to liquidate its trading positions with aig even at discounts and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that might have made it difficult for goldman sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an aig default finally the report said an aig default would have forced goldman sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations goldman argued that cdss are marked to market ie valued at their current market price and their positions netted between counterparties daily thus as the cost of insuring aigs obligations against default rose substantially in the leadup to its bailout the sellers of the cds contracts had to post more collateral to goldman sachs the firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an aig bankruptcy and the risk of knockon defaults had aig been allowed to fail however in practice the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an aig bankruptcy if the government let aig default according to money manager michael lewitt its collapse would be as close to an extinctionlevel event as the financial markets have seen since the great depression september   meetings at the new york federal reserveedit some have said incorrectly according to others that goldman sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only wall street firm to have participated in the crucial september meetings at the new york fed which decided aigs fate much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted new york times article the article was later corrected to state that blankfein ceo of goldman sachs was one of the wall street chief executives at the meeting emphasis added bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the september aig meetings furthermore goldman sachs cfo david viniar stated that ceo blankfein had never met with his predecessor and thenus treasury secretary henry paulson to discuss aig however there were frequent phone calls between the two of them paulson was not present at the september meetings at the new york fed morgan stanley was hired by the federal reserve to advise on the aig bailout according to the new york times paulson spoke with the ceo of goldman sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so while it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence particularly in a crisis the times noted he spoke with goldmans blankfein more frequently than with other large banks federal officials say that although paulson was involved in decisions to rescue aig it was the federal reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the aig bailout  million settlement for massachusetts subprime mortgages edit on may   goldman sachs agreed to pay up to  million to end an investigation by the massachusetts attorney generals office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state the settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of  massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by goldman sachs michael duvally a spokesman for goldman said it was pleased to have resolved this matter and declined to comment further this settlement may open the door to state government actions against goldman throughout the united states aimed at securing compensation for predatory mortgage lending practices abacus mortgagebacked cdos and  million settlement edit see also merrill lynch § cdo controversies and magnetar capital unlike many investors and investment bankers goldman sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis that developed in  some of its traders became bearish on the housing boom beginning in  and developed mortgagerelated securities originally intended to protect goldman from investment losses in the housing market in late  goldman management changed the firms overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative as the market began its downturn goldman created even more of these securities no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but according to business journalist gretchen morgenson enabling it to pocket huge profits from the mortgage defaults and that goldman used the cdos to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes authors bethany mclean and joe nocera stated that the firms later insistence that it was merely a market maker in these transactions—implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients—became less true over time the investments were called synthetic cdos because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as credit default swaps goldman and some other hedge funds held a short position in the securities paying the premiums while the investors insurance companies pension funds etc receiving the premiums were the long position the longs were responsible for paying the insurance claim to goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted through april  goldman issued over  cdos in its abacus series worth a total of  billion all together goldman packaged sold and shorted a total of  synthetic cdos with an aggregate face value of  billion between july   and may   but while goldman was praised for its foresight some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure these securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by april  at least us billion worth of the securities either carried junk ratings or had defaulted one cdo examined by critics which goldman bet against but also sold to investors was the  million hudson mezzanine cdo issued in  in the senate permanent subcommittee hearings goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books unable to sell them directly it included them in the underlying securities of the cdo and took the short side but critics mclean and nocera complained the cdo prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as assets sourced from the street making it sound as though goldman randomly selected the securities instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book the cdo did not perform well and by march —just  months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out about us million to goldman and others who had bet against it goldmans head of european fixedincome sales lamented in an email made public by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations the real bad feeling across european sales about some of the trades we did with clients who had invested in the cdo the damage this has done to our franchise is very significant critics also complain that while goldmans investors were large ostensibly sophisticated banks and insurers at least some of the cdo securities and their losses filtered down to small public agencies—money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets for example an investor in abacus ikb bank created a structured investment vehicle called rhinebridge rhinebridge like other sivs issued debt that it then used to buy mortgagebacked securities and cdos like abacus the debt issued by rhinebridge  was bought by among others king county washington which managed money on behalf of one hundred other public agencies this was money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets   for all of goldmans later claims that it dealt only with the most sophisticated of investors the fact remained that those investors could be fiduciaries investing on behalf of school districts fire departments pensioners and municipalities all across the country ikb paid for its share of the deal with money it collected from a number of relatively unsophisticated investors including king county in washington state in  the county bought us million of commercial paper a type of shortterm debt from rhineland a special fund created by ikb that in turn snapped up nearly us million of the securities created by the goldman vehicle known as abacus ac  king county also made a usmillion purchase  in  from another ikb fund dubbed rhinebridge the county lost us million when rhinebridge collapsed—and an additional us million when other similar funds defaulted about  county agencies in the seattle area including some that deal with libraries and schools saw their budgets cut as a result in public statements goldman claimed that it shorted simply to hedge and was not expecting the cdos to fail it also denied that its investors were unaware of goldmans bets against the products it was selling to them there were intricate links between a goldman sachs trader jonathan m egol synthetic collateralized debt obligations or cdo abacus and assetbacked securities index abx goldman is also alleged to have tried to pressure the credit rating agency moodys give its products a higher rating than they deserved according to an article in propublica goldman and other firms often seemed to have pressured the agencies to give good ratings emails released last week by the senate investigations subcommittee give a glimpse of the backandforth pdf i am getting serious pushback from goldman on a deal that they want to go to market with today wrote one moodys employee in an internal email message in april  the senate subcommittee found that rating decisions were often subject to concerns about losing market share to competitors the agencies are after all paid by the firms whose products they rate  sec civil fraud lawsuitedit in april  the us securities and exchange commission sec charged goldman sachs and one of its vicepresidents fabrice tourre with securities fraud the sec alleged that goldman had told buyers of a synthetic cdo a type of investment that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent cdo manager aca management in fact paulson  co a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a significant role in the selection and the package of securities turned out to become one of the worstperforming mortgage deals of the housing crisis because less than a year after the deal was completed  of the bonds selected for abacus had been downgraded the particular synthetic cdo that the secs  fraud suit charged goldman with misleading investors with was called abacus ac unlike many of the abacus securities ac did not have goldman sachs as a short seller in fact goldman sachs lost money on the deal that position was taken by the customer john paulson who hired goldman to issue the security according to the secs complaint paulson and his employees selected  bbbrated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for paulson and the manager of the cdo aca management worked on the portfolio of  bonds to be insured aca allegedly unaware of paulsons short position coming to an agreement in late february  paulson paid goldman approximately us million for its work in the deal paulson ultimately made a us billion from the short investments the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers these were primarily ikb deutsche industriebank us million loss and the investors and insurers of another us million—aca financial guaranty corp abn amro and the royal bank of scotland the sec alleged that goldman materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents about the financial security including the fact that it had permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market the hedge fund manager paulson  co to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent objective third party aca management the sec further alleged that tourre also misled aca into believing  that paulsons interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with acas when in reality paulsons interests were sharply conflicting in reply goldman issued a statement saying the secs charges were unfounded in law and fact and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the cdo that it had lost  million that aca selected the portfolio without goldman suggesting paulson was to be a long investor that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa as it was not normal business practice for a market maker and that aca was itself the largest purchaser of the abacus pool investing us million goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector rather than from a particular security in the cdo while some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading others believed goldmans defense was strong and the secs case was weak some experts on securities law such as duke university law professor james cox believed the suit had merit because goldman was aware of the relevance of paulsons involvement and took steps to downplay it others including wayne state university law school law professor peter henning noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved even without knowledge of the part played by paulson critics of goldman sachs point out that paulson went to goldman sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank bear stearns who he had asked to build a cdo ira wagner the head of bear stearnss cdo group in  told the financial crisis inquiry commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal paulson was proposing encouraged paulson to pick the worst assets describing bear stearnss reasoning one author compared the deal to a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team goldman claimed it lost  million critics maintain it was simply unable not due to a lack of trying to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted critics also question whether the deal was ethical even if it was legal goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers according to mclean and nocera there were dozens of securities being insured in the cdo—for example another abacus—had  credits from several different mortgage originators commercial mortgagebacked securities debt from sallie mae credit cards etc goldman bought mortgages to create securities which made it far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like new century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgageholders back—which is why the fine print on at least one abacus prospectus warned long investors that the protection buyer goldman may have information including material nonpublic information which it was not providing to the long investors according to an article in the houston chronicle critics also worried that abacus might undermine the position of the us as a safe harbor for the worlds investors and that the involvement of european interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that regions political leaders most notably british prime minister gordon brown who has accused goldman of moral bankruptcy this is in short a big global story  is what goldman sachs did with its abacus investment vehicle illegal that will be for the courts to decide  but it doesnt take a judge and jury to conclude that legalities aside this was just wrong on july   goldman settled out of court agreeing to pay the sec and investors

senates permanent subcommittee on investigations released a page report entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse which described some of the causes of the financial crisis the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the united states department of justice to determine whether goldman executives had broken the law and two months later the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed goldman for relevant

warehouses goldman owns in detroit michigan to avoid hoarding and price manipulation the london metal exchange requires that at least  tons of that metal must be moved out each day goldman has dealt

accusing goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase the two investment banks warehousing businesses and the london metal exchange in various combinations—of violating us antitrust laws would be assigned to united states district court for the southern district of new york judge katherine b forrest in manhattan according to lydia depillis of wonkblog when goldman bought the warehouses it started paying traders extra to bring their metal to goldmans warehouses rather than anywhere else the longer it stays the more rent goldman can charge which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium the effect is amplified by another company glencore which is doing the same thing in its warehouse in vlissingen michael duvally a spokesman for goldman sachs said the cases are without merit robert lenzner a columnist at forbes wrote that goldman sachs controls only  of the global market and is therefore too small to have pricing power an article published by bloomberg lp also debunked the conspiracy theory in december  goldman sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to ruben brothers oil futures speculationedit investment banks including goldman have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange in august  confidential documents were leaked detailing the positions in the oil futures market of several investment banks including goldman sachs morgan stanley jpmorgan chase deutsche bank and barclays just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of  the presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets and so the means to significantly sway prices and unlike traditional market participants neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold journalist kate sheppard of mother jones called it a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude however another source stated that just before crude oil hit its record high in mid  of the worlds largest banks were betting that prices would fall according to private trading data in april  a couple of observers—brad johnson of the blog climate progress founded by joseph j romm and alain sherter of cbs moneywatch—noted that goldman sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil climate progress quoted goldman as warning that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation in petroleum futures and that net speculative positions are four times as high as in june  when the price of oil peaked it stated that goldman sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least  higher than supply and demand dictate sherter noted that goldmans concern over speculation did not prevent it along with other speculators from lobbying against regulations by the commodity futures trading commission to establish position limits which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold and thus prevent speculation according to joseph p kennedy ii by  prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by hedge funds and bankers pumping billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price the problem started according to kennedy in  when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the new york mercantile exchange goldman sachs made an argument to the commodity futures trading commission that wall street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades the commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed goldman sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades other exemptions followed and by  eight investment banks accounted for  of the total oil futures market initial public offering kickback bribesedit goldman sachs is accused of asking for kickback bribes from institutional clients who made large profits flipping stocks which goldman had intentionally undervalued in initial public offerings it was underwriting documents under seal in a decadelong lawsuit concerning etoyscoms initial public offering ipo in  but released accidentally to the new york times show that ipos managed by goldman were underpriced and that goldman asked clients able to profit from the prices to increase business with it the clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary in order to participate in further such undervalued ipos companies going public and their initial consumer stockholders are both defrauded by this practice unauthorized

commission that resulted in goldman paying a  million settlement goldman sachs was excoriated by the press and the public according to journalists mclean and nocera  this despite the nonretail nature of its business that would normally have kept it out of the public eye visibility and antagonism came from the  billion goldman received—more than any other firm—from aig counterparty payments

destructive environment in which the interests of the client continue to be sidelined senior management described clients as muppets and colleagues callously talked about ripping their clients off in

supervised release and ordered to pay  million in fines stub month and allegedly misleading results in december edit in april  floyd norris chief financial correspondent of the new york times accused goldman sachs of misleading investors by having puffed up its first quarter  earnings by creating a december orphan month into which it shifted large writedowns so they did not appear in any quarterly number in april  the company reported a  million net loss for the single month of december but reported net earnings of  billion for the first quarter of  however the accounting change to a calendar fiscal year which created the stub month of december  was required when the firm converted to a bank holding company and declared in item  of its form k us securities and exchange commission sec filing of december   the december loss also included a  million marktomarket writedown on loans to chemical maker lyondellbasell since it became clear in december that lyondell would file for bankruptcy protection and would not be able to meet its debt obligations while the results of december  were detailed in the press release reporting the results of december  and the first quarter of  and the related conference call with analysts according to an article in the washington post by david s hilzenrath the company included a page of charts in its monday news release showing its december results but it didnt include a narrative description of those results as it did for the januarythroughmarch period most financial analysts and the mainstream financial press were aware of the required change in fiscal year and deteriorating market conditions into december and were not surprised by the december loss analysts focused more on the first quarter results and the planned repayment of tarp funds but even merrill lynch told its clients not to forget about december merrill lynch took at least  billion of losses in the same period and morgan stanley which was also required to switch to a calendar year for accounting purposes as a result of its conversion to a bank holding company also reported a large loss for its stub month of december although unlike goldman morgan stanley also lost money in the first quarter of  bonuses paid to employees in  despite financial crisisedit in june  after the firm repaid the tarp investment from the us treasury goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance andrew cuomo then new york attorney general questioned goldmans decision to pay  employees bonuses of at least  million each after it received tarp funds in  that same period however ceo lloyd blankfein and  other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses stating they believed it was the right thing to do in light of the fact that we are part of an industry thats directly associated with the ongoing economic distress benefits from the government bailout of aigedit american international group received  billion in government loans during the financial crisis the money was used to repay customers of its securitylending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from aig however due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks including goldman sachs should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to aig the new york state attorney general andrew cuomo announced in march  that he was investigating whether aigs trading counterparties improperly received government money goldman sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to aig and received  billion during the unwind of credit default swap cds contracts by aig after receiving the government loans firms response to criticism of aig paymentsedit goldman sachs maintained that its net exposure to aig was not material and that the firm was protected by hedges in the form of cdss with other counterparties and  billion of collateral the firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over  million according to goldman both the collateral and cdss would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an aig bankruptcy however because aig was bailed out and not allowed to fail these hedges did not pay out cfo david viniar stated that profits related to aig in the first quarter of  rounded to zero and profits in december were not significant he went on to say that he was mystified by the interest the government and investors have shown in the banks trading relationship with aig considerable speculation remains that goldmans hedges against its aig exposure would not have paid out if aig was allowed to fail according to a report by the united states office of the inspector general of tarp if aig had collapsed it would have made it difficult for goldman to liquidate its trading positions with aig even at discounts and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that might have made it difficult for goldman sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an aig default finally the report said an aig default would have forced goldman sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations goldman argued that cdss are marked to market ie valued at their current market price and their positions netted between counterparties daily thus as the cost of insuring aigs obligations against default rose substantially in the leadup to its bailout the sellers of the cds contracts had to post more collateral to goldman sachs the firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an aig bankruptcy and the risk of knockon defaults had aig been allowed to fail however in practice the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an aig bankruptcy if the government let aig default according to money manager michael lewitt its collapse would be as close to an extinctionlevel event as the financial markets have seen since the great depression september   meetings at the new york federal reserveedit some have said incorrectly according to others that goldman sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only wall street firm to have participated in the crucial september meetings at the new york fed which decided aigs fate much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted new york times article the article was later corrected to state that blankfein ceo of goldman sachs was one of the wall street chief executives at the meeting emphasis added bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the september aig meetings furthermore goldman sachs cfo david viniar stated that ceo blankfein had never met with his predecessor and thenus treasury secretary henry paulson to discuss aig however there were frequent phone calls between the two of them paulson was not present at the september meetings at the new york fed morgan stanley was hired by the federal reserve to advise on the aig bailout according to the new york times paulson spoke with the ceo of goldman sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so while it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence particularly in a crisis the times noted he spoke with goldmans blankfein more frequently than with other large banks federal officials say that although paulson was involved in decisions to rescue aig it was the federal reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the aig bailout  million settlement for massachusetts subprime mortgages edit on may   goldman sachs agreed to pay up to  million to end an investigation by the massachusetts attorney generals office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state the settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of  massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by goldman sachs michael duvally a spokesman for goldman said it was pleased to have resolved this matter and declined to comment further this settlement may open the door to state government actions against goldman throughout the united states aimed at securing compensation for predatory mortgage lending practices abacus mortgagebacked cdos and  million settlement edit see also merrill lynch § cdo controversies and magnetar capital unlike many investors and investment bankers goldman sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis that developed in  some of its traders became bearish on the housing boom beginning in  and developed mortgagerelated securities originally intended to protect goldman from investment losses in the housing market in late  goldman management changed the firms overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative as the market began its downturn goldman created even more of these securities no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but according to business journalist gretchen morgenson enabling it to pocket huge profits from the mortgage defaults and that goldman used the cdos to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes authors bethany mclean and joe nocera stated that the firms later insistence that it was merely a market maker in these transactions—implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients—became less true over time the investments were called synthetic cdos because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as credit default swaps goldman and some other hedge funds held a short position in the securities paying the premiums while the investors insurance companies pension funds etc receiving the premiums were the long position the longs were responsible for paying the insurance claim to goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted through april  goldman issued over  cdos in its abacus series worth a total of  billion all together goldman packaged sold and shorted a total of  synthetic cdos with an aggregate face value of  billion between july   and may   but while goldman was praised for its foresight some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure these securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by april  at least us billion worth of the securities either carried junk ratings or had defaulted one cdo examined by critics which goldman bet against but also sold to investors was the  million hudson mezzanine cdo issued in  in the senate permanent subcommittee hearings goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books unable to sell them directly it included them in the underlying securities of the cdo and took the short side but critics mclean and nocera complained the cdo prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as assets sourced from the street making it sound as though goldman randomly selected the securities instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book the cdo did not perform well and by march —just  months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out about us million to goldman and others who had bet against it goldmans head of european fixedincome sales lamented in an email made public by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations the real bad feeling across european sales about some of the trades we did with clients who had invested in the cdo the damage this has done to our franchise is very significant critics also complain that while goldmans investors were large ostensibly sophisticated banks and insurers at least some of the cdo securities and their losses filtered down to small public agencies—money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets for example an investor in abacus ikb bank created a structured investment vehicle called rhinebridge rhinebridge like other sivs issued debt that it then used to buy mortgagebacked securities and cdos like abacus the debt issued by rhinebridge  was bought by among others king county washington which managed money on behalf of one hundred other public agencies this was money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets   for all of goldmans later claims that it dealt only with the most sophisticated of investors the fact remained that those investors could be fiduciaries investing on behalf of school districts fire departments pensioners and municipalities all across the country ikb paid for its share of the deal with money it collected from a number of relatively unsophisticated investors including king county in washington state in  the county bought us million of commercial paper a type of shortterm debt from rhineland a special fund created by ikb that in turn snapped up nearly us million of the securities created by the goldman vehicle known as abacus ac  king county also made a usmillion purchase  in  from another ikb fund dubbed rhinebridge the county lost us million when rhinebridge collapsed—and an additional us million when other similar funds defaulted about  county agencies in the seattle area including some that deal with libraries and schools saw their budgets cut as a result in public statements goldman claimed that it shorted simply to hedge and was not expecting the cdos to fail it also denied that its investors were unaware of goldmans bets against the products it was selling to them there were intricate links between a goldman sachs trader jonathan m egol synthetic collateralized debt obligations or cdo abacus and assetbacked securities index abx goldman is also alleged to have tried to pressure the credit rating agency moodys give its products a higher rating than they deserved according to an article in propublica goldman and other firms often seemed to have pressured the agencies to give good ratings emails released last week by the senate investigations subcommittee give a glimpse of the backandforth pdf i am getting serious pushback from goldman on a deal that they want to go to market with today wrote one moodys employee in an internal email message in april  the senate subcommittee found that rating decisions were often subject to concerns about losing market share to competitors the agencies are after all paid by the firms whose products they rate  sec civil fraud lawsuitedit in april  the us securities and exchange commission sec charged goldman sachs and one of its vicepresidents fabrice tourre with securities fraud the sec alleged that goldman had told buyers of a synthetic cdo a type of investment that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent cdo manager aca management in fact paulson  co a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a significant role in the selection and the package of securities turned out to become one of the worstperforming mortgage deals of the housing crisis because less than a year after the deal was completed  of the bonds selected for abacus had been downgraded the particular synthetic cdo that the secs  fraud suit charged goldman with misleading investors with was called abacus ac unlike many of the abacus securities ac did not have goldman sachs as a short seller in fact goldman sachs lost money on the deal that position was taken by the customer john paulson who hired goldman to issue the security according to the secs complaint paulson and his employees selected  bbbrated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for paulson and the manager of the cdo aca management worked on the portfolio of  bonds to be insured aca allegedly unaware of paulsons short position coming to an agreement in late february  paulson paid goldman approximately us million for its work in the deal paulson ultimately made a us billion from the short investments the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers these were primarily ikb deutsche industriebank us million loss and the investors and insurers of another us million—aca financial guaranty corp abn amro and the royal bank of scotland the sec alleged that goldman materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents about the financial security including the fact that it had permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market the hedge fund manager paulson  co to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent objective third party aca management the sec further alleged that tourre also misled aca into believing  that paulsons interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with acas when in reality paulsons interests were sharply conflicting in reply goldman issued a statement saying the secs charges were unfounded in law and fact and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the cdo that it had lost  million that aca selected the portfolio without goldman suggesting paulson was to be a long investor that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa as it was not normal business practice for a market maker and that aca was itself the largest purchaser of the abacus pool investing us million goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector rather than from a particular security in the cdo while some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading others believed goldmans defense was strong and the secs case was weak some experts on securities law such as duke university law professor james cox believed the suit had merit because goldman was aware of the relevance of paulsons involvement and took steps to downplay it others including wayne state university law school law professor peter henning noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved even without knowledge of the part played by paulson critics of goldman sachs point out that paulson went to goldman sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank bear stearns who he had asked to build a cdo ira wagner the head of bear stearnss cdo group in  told the financial crisis inquiry commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal paulson was proposing encouraged paulson to pick the worst assets describing bear stearnss reasoning one author compared the deal to a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team goldman claimed it lost  million critics maintain it was simply unable not due to a lack of trying to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted critics also question whether the deal was ethical even if it was legal goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers according to mclean and nocera there were dozens of securities being insured in the cdo—for example another abacus—had  credits from several different mortgage originators commercial mortgagebacked securities debt from sallie mae credit cards etc goldman bought mortgages to create securities which made it far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like new century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgageholders back—which is why the fine print on at least one abacus prospectus warned long investors that the protection buyer goldman may have information including material nonpublic information which it was not providing to the long investors according to an article in the houston chronicle critics also worried that abacus might undermine the position of the us as a safe harbor for the worlds investors and that the involvement of european interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that regions political leaders most notably british prime minister gordon brown who has accused goldman of moral bankruptcy this is in short a big global story  is what goldman sachs did with its abacus investment vehicle illegal that will be for the courts to decide  but it doesnt take a judge and jury to conclude that legalities aside this was just wrong on july   goldman settled out of court agreeing to pay the sec and investors

regarding mortgage investments tourre defense of abacus lawsuitedit the  goldman settlement did not cover charges against goldman vice president and salesman for abacus fabrice tourre tourre unsuccessfully sought a dismissal of the suit which then went to trial in  on august  a federal jury found tourre liable on six of seven counts including that he misled investors about the mortgage deal he was found not liable on the charge that he had deliberately made an untrue or misleading statement senate report on the causes of the financial crisis of edit on april   the united states senates permanent subcommittee on investigations released a page report entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse which described some of the causes of the financial crisis the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the united states department of justice to determine whether goldman executives had broken the law and two months later the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed goldman for relevant information on possible securities fraud but on august  the justice department announced it had decided not to file charges against goldman sachs or its employees for trades made during the subprime mortgage portfolio alleged commodity price manipulationedit see also s commodities boom a provision of the  financial deregulation law the grammleachbliley act allows commercial banks to enter into any business activity that is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally in the years since the laws passing goldman sach and other investment banks morgan stanley jpmorgan chase have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials such as food products zinc copper tin nickel and aluminum some critics such as matt taibbi believe that allowing a company to both control the supply of crucial physical commodities and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets is akin to letting casino owners who take book on nfl games during the week also coach all the teams on sundays goldman sachs commodity index and the – food bubbleedit frederick kaufman a contributing editor of harpers magazine argued in a  article that goldmans creation of the goldman sachs commodity index now the sp gsci helped passive investors such as pension funds mutual funds and others engage in food price speculation by betting on financial products based on the commodity index these financial products disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange a june  article in the economist defended commodity investors and oil indextracking funds citing a report by the organisation for economic cooperation and development that found that commodities without futures markets and ignored by indextracking funds also saw price rises during the period aluminum price and supplyedit in a july  article david kocieniewski a journalist with the new york times accused goldman sachs and other wall street firms of capitalizing on loosened federal regulations to manipulate a variety of commodities markets particularly aluminum citing financial records regulatory documents and interviews with people involved in the activities after goldman sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company metro international in  the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories—to make beer cans home siding and other products—went from an average of  weeks to more than  months according to industry records aluminum industry analysts say that the lengthy delays at metro international after goldman took over are a major reason the premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market has doubled since  the price increase has cost american consumers more than  billion from  to  according to former industry executives analysts and consultants the cause of this was alleged to be goldmans ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of  metro international warehouses goldman owns in detroit michigan to avoid hoarding and price manipulation the london metal exchange requires that at least  tons of that metal must be moved out each day goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum—not to factories but from one warehouse to another—according to the times in august  goldman sachs was subpoenaed by the federal commodity futures trading commission as part of an investigation into complaints that goldmanowned metals warehouses had intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum in december  it was announced that  cases accusing goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase the two investment banks warehousing businesses and the london metal exchange in various combinations—of violating us antitrust laws would be assigned to united states district court for the southern district of new york judge katherine b forrest in manhattan according to lydia depillis of wonkblog when goldman bought the warehouses it started paying traders extra to bring their metal to goldmans warehouses rather than anywhere else the longer it stays the more rent goldman can charge which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium the effect is amplified by another company glencore which is doing the same thing in its warehouse in vlissingen michael duvally a spokesman for goldman sachs said the cases are without merit robert lenzner a columnist at forbes wrote that goldman sachs controls only  of the global market and is therefore too small to have pricing power an article published by bloomberg lp also debunked the conspiracy theory in december  goldman sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to ruben brothers oil futures speculationedit investment banks including goldman have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange in august  confidential documents were leaked detailing the positions in the oil futures market of several investment banks including goldman sachs morgan stanley jpmorgan chase deutsche bank and barclays just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of  the presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets and so the means to significantly sway prices and unlike traditional market participants neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold journalist kate sheppard of mother jones called it a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude however another source stated that just before crude oil hit its record high in mid  of the worlds largest banks were betting that prices would fall according to private trading data in april  a couple of observers—brad johnson of the blog climate progress founded by joseph j romm and alain sherter of cbs moneywatch—noted that goldman sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil climate progress quoted goldman as warning that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation in petroleum futures and that net speculative positions are four times as high as in june  when the price of oil peaked it stated that goldman sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least  higher than supply and demand dictate sherter noted that goldmans concern over speculation did not prevent it along with other speculators from lobbying against regulations by the commodity futures trading commission to establish position limits which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold and thus prevent speculation according to joseph p kennedy ii by  prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by hedge funds and bankers pumping billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price the problem started according to kennedy in  when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the new york mercantile exchange goldman sachs made an argument to the commodity futures trading commission that wall street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades the commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed goldman sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades other exemptions followed and by  eight investment banks accounted for  of the total oil futures market initial public offering kickback bribesedit goldman sachs is accused of asking for kickback bribes from institutional clients who made large profits flipping stocks which goldman had intentionally undervalued in initial public offerings it was underwriting documents under seal in a decadelong lawsuit concerning etoyscoms initial public offering ipo in  but released accidentally to the new york times show that ipos managed by goldman were underpriced and that goldman asked clients able to profit from the prices to increase business with it the clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary in order to participate in further such undervalued ipos companies going public and their initial consumer stockholders are both defrauded by this practice unauthorized trades by goldman sachs trader matthew marshall tayloredit former goldman sachs trader matthew marshall taylor was convicted of hiding  billion worth of unauthorized trades involving derivatives on the sp  index by making multiple false entries into a goldman trading system when goldman sachs management uncovered the trades taylor was immediately fired the trades cost the company  million which taylor was ordered to repay in  taylor plead guilty to charges and was sentenced to  months in prison in addition to the monetary damages danish utility sale edit goldman sachss purchase of an  stake

a nerve with the danish public which is still suffering from the aftereffects of the global financial crisis protesters in copenhagen gathered around a banner with a drawing of a vampire squid—the

coup on wall street under weinbergs reign the firm also started an investment research division and a municipal bond department it also was at this time that the firm became an early innovator in risk

commission that resulted in goldman paying a  million settlement goldman sachs was excoriated by the press and the public according to journalists mclean and nocera  this despite the nonretail nature of its business that would normally have kept it out of the public eye visibility and antagonism came from the  billion goldman received—more than any other firm—from aig counterparty payments

supervised release and ordered to pay  million in fines stub month and allegedly misleading results in december edit in april  floyd norris chief financial correspondent of the new york times accused goldman sachs of misleading investors by having puffed up its first quarter  earnings by creating a december orphan month into which it shifted large writedowns so they did not appear in any quarterly number in april  the company reported a  million net loss for the single month of december but reported net earnings of  billion for the first quarter of  however the accounting change to a calendar fiscal year which created the stub month of december  was required when the firm converted to a bank holding company and declared in item  of its form k us securities and exchange commission sec filing of december   the december loss also included a  million marktomarket writedown on loans to chemical maker lyondellbasell since it became clear in december that lyondell would file for bankruptcy protection and would not be able to meet its debt obligations while the results of december  were detailed in the press release reporting the results of december  and the first quarter of  and the related conference call with analysts according to an article in the washington post by david s hilzenrath the company included a page of charts in its monday news release showing its december results but it didnt include a narrative description of those results as it did for the januarythroughmarch period most financial analysts and the mainstream financial press were aware of the required change in fiscal year and deteriorating market conditions into december and were not surprised by the december loss analysts focused more on the first quarter results and the planned repayment of tarp funds but even merrill lynch told its clients not to forget about december merrill lynch took at least  billion of losses in the same period and morgan stanley which was also required to switch to a calendar year for accounting purposes as a result of its conversion to a bank holding company also reported a large loss for its stub month of december although unlike goldman morgan stanley also lost money in the first quarter of  bonuses paid to employees in  despite financial crisisedit in june  after the firm repaid the tarp investment from the us treasury goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance andrew cuomo then new york attorney general questioned goldmans decision to pay  employees bonuses of at least  million each after it received tarp funds in  that same period however ceo lloyd blankfein and  other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses stating they believed it was the right thing to do in light of the fact that we are part of an industry thats directly associated with the ongoing economic distress benefits from the government bailout of aigedit american international group received  billion in government loans during the financial crisis the money was used to repay customers of its securitylending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from aig however due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks including goldman sachs should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to aig the new york state attorney general andrew cuomo announced in march  that he was investigating whether aigs trading counterparties improperly received government money goldman sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to aig and received  billion during the unwind of credit default swap cds contracts by aig after receiving the government loans firms response to criticism of aig paymentsedit goldman sachs maintained that its net exposure to aig was not material and that the firm was protected by hedges in the form of cdss with other counterparties and  billion of collateral the firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over  million according to goldman both the collateral and cdss would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an aig bankruptcy however because aig was bailed out and not allowed to fail these hedges did not pay out cfo david viniar stated that profits related to aig in the first quarter of  rounded to zero and profits in december were not significant he went on to say that he was mystified by the interest the government and investors have shown in the banks trading relationship with aig considerable speculation remains that goldmans hedges against its aig exposure would not have paid out if aig was allowed to fail according to a report by the united states office of the inspector general of tarp if aig had collapsed it would have made it difficult for goldman to liquidate its trading positions with aig even at discounts and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that might have made it difficult for goldman sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an aig default finally the report said an aig default would have forced goldman sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations goldman argued that cdss are marked to market ie valued at their current market price and their positions netted between counterparties daily thus as the cost of insuring aigs obligations against default rose substantially in the leadup to its bailout the sellers of the cds contracts had to post more collateral to goldman sachs the firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an aig bankruptcy and the risk of knockon defaults had aig been allowed to fail however in practice the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an aig bankruptcy if the government let aig default according to money manager michael lewitt its collapse would be as close to an extinctionlevel event as the financial markets have seen since the great depression september   meetings at the new york federal reserveedit some have said incorrectly according to others that goldman sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only wall street firm to have participated in the crucial september meetings at the new york fed which decided aigs fate much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted new york times article the article was later corrected to state that blankfein ceo of goldman sachs was one of the wall street chief executives at the meeting emphasis added bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the september aig meetings furthermore goldman sachs cfo david viniar stated that ceo blankfein had never met with his predecessor and thenus treasury secretary henry paulson to discuss aig however there were frequent phone calls between the two of them paulson was not present at the september meetings at the new york fed morgan stanley was hired by the federal reserve to advise on the aig bailout according to the new york times paulson spoke with the ceo of goldman sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so while it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence particularly in a crisis the times noted he spoke with goldmans blankfein more frequently than with other large banks federal officials say that although paulson was involved in decisions to rescue aig it was the federal reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the aig bailout  million settlement for massachusetts subprime mortgages edit on may   goldman sachs agreed to pay up to  million to end an investigation by the massachusetts attorney generals office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state the settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of  massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by goldman sachs michael duvally a spokesman for goldman said it was pleased to have resolved this matter and declined to comment further this settlement may open the door to state government actions against goldman throughout the united states aimed at securing compensation for predatory mortgage lending practices abacus mortgagebacked cdos and  million settlement edit see also merrill lynch § cdo controversies and magnetar capital unlike many investors and investment bankers goldman sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis that developed in  some of its traders became bearish on the housing boom beginning in  and developed mortgagerelated securities originally intended to protect goldman from investment losses in the housing market in late  goldman management changed the firms overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative as the market began its downturn goldman created even more of these securities no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but according to business journalist gretchen morgenson enabling it to pocket huge profits from the mortgage defaults and that goldman used the cdos to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes authors bethany mclean and joe nocera stated that the firms later insistence that it was merely a market maker in these transactions—implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients—became less true over time the investments were called synthetic cdos because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as credit default swaps goldman and some other hedge funds held a short position in the securities paying the premiums while the investors insurance companies pension funds etc receiving the premiums were the long position the longs were responsible for paying the insurance claim to goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted through april  goldman issued over  cdos in its abacus series worth a total of  billion all together goldman packaged sold and shorted a total of  synthetic cdos with an aggregate face value of  billion between july   and may   but while goldman was praised for its foresight some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure these securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by april  at least us billion worth of the securities either carried junk ratings or had defaulted one cdo examined by critics which goldman bet against but also sold to investors was the  million hudson mezzanine cdo issued in  in the senate permanent subcommittee hearings goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books unable to sell them directly it included them in the underlying securities of the cdo and took the short side but critics mclean and nocera complained the cdo prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as assets sourced from the street making it sound as though goldman randomly selected the securities instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book the cdo did not perform well and by march —just  months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out about us million to goldman and others who had bet against it goldmans head of european fixedincome sales lamented in an email made public by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations the real bad feeling across european sales about some of the trades we did with clients who had invested in the cdo the damage this has done to our franchise is very significant critics also complain that while goldmans investors were large ostensibly sophisticated banks and insurers at least some of the cdo securities and their losses filtered down to small public agencies—money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets for example an investor in abacus ikb bank created a structured investment vehicle called rhinebridge rhinebridge like other sivs issued debt that it then used to buy mortgagebacked securities and cdos like abacus the debt issued by rhinebridge  was bought by among others king county washington which managed money on behalf of one hundred other public agencies this was money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets   for all of goldmans later claims that it dealt only with the most sophisticated of investors the fact remained that those investors could be fiduciaries investing on behalf of school districts fire departments pensioners and municipalities all across the country ikb paid for its share of the deal with money it collected from a number of relatively unsophisticated investors including king county in washington state in  the county bought us million of commercial paper a type of shortterm debt from rhineland a special fund created by ikb that in turn snapped up nearly us million of the securities created by the goldman vehicle known as abacus ac  king county also made a usmillion purchase  in  from another ikb fund dubbed rhinebridge the county lost us million when rhinebridge collapsed—and an additional us million when other similar funds defaulted about  county agencies in the seattle area including some that deal with libraries and schools saw their budgets cut as a result in public statements goldman claimed that it shorted simply to hedge and was not expecting the cdos to fail it also denied that its investors were unaware of goldmans bets against the products it was selling to them there were intricate links between a goldman sachs trader jonathan m egol synthetic collateralized debt obligations or cdo abacus and assetbacked securities index abx goldman is also alleged to have tried to pressure the credit rating agency moodys give its products a higher rating than they deserved according to an article in propublica goldman and other firms often seemed to have pressured the agencies to give good ratings emails released last week by the senate investigations subcommittee give a glimpse of the backandforth pdf i am getting serious pushback from goldman on a deal that they want to go to market with today wrote one moodys employee in an internal email message in april  the senate subcommittee found that rating decisions were often subject to concerns about losing market share to competitors the agencies are after all paid by the firms whose products they rate  sec civil fraud lawsuitedit in april  the us securities and exchange commission sec charged goldman sachs and one of its vicepresidents fabrice tourre with securities fraud the sec alleged that goldman had told buyers of a synthetic cdo a type of investment that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent cdo manager aca management in fact paulson  co a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a significant role in the selection and the package of securities turned out to become one of the worstperforming mortgage deals of the housing crisis because less than a year after the deal was completed  of the bonds selected for abacus had been downgraded the particular synthetic cdo that the secs  fraud suit charged goldman with misleading investors with was called abacus ac unlike many of the abacus securities ac did not have goldman sachs as a short seller in fact goldman sachs lost money on the deal that position was taken by the customer john paulson who hired goldman to issue the security according to the secs complaint paulson and his employees selected  bbbrated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for paulson and the manager of the cdo aca management worked on the portfolio of  bonds to be insured aca allegedly unaware of paulsons short position coming to an agreement in late february  paulson paid goldman approximately us million for its work in the deal paulson ultimately made a us billion from the short investments the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers these were primarily ikb deutsche industriebank us million loss and the investors and insurers of another us million—aca financial guaranty corp abn amro and the royal bank of scotland the sec alleged that goldman materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents about the financial security including the fact that it had permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market the hedge fund manager paulson  co to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent objective third party aca management the sec further alleged that tourre also misled aca into believing  that paulsons interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with acas when in reality paulsons interests were sharply conflicting in reply goldman issued a statement saying the secs charges were unfounded in law and fact and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the cdo that it had lost  million that aca selected the portfolio without goldman suggesting paulson was to be a long investor that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa as it was not normal business practice for a market maker and that aca was itself the largest purchaser of the abacus pool investing us million goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector rather than from a particular security in the cdo while some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading others believed goldmans defense was strong and the secs case was weak some experts on securities law such as duke university law professor james cox believed the suit had merit because goldman was aware of the relevance of paulsons involvement and took steps to downplay it others including wayne state university law school law professor peter henning noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved even without knowledge of the part played by paulson critics of goldman sachs point out that paulson went to goldman sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank bear stearns who he had asked to build a cdo ira wagner the head of bear stearnss cdo group in  told the financial crisis inquiry commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal paulson was proposing encouraged paulson to pick the worst assets describing bear stearnss reasoning one author compared the deal to a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team goldman claimed it lost  million critics maintain it was simply unable not due to a lack of trying to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted critics also question whether the deal was ethical even if it was legal goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers according to mclean and nocera there were dozens of securities being insured in the cdo—for example another abacus—had  credits from several different mortgage originators commercial mortgagebacked securities debt from sallie mae credit cards etc goldman bought mortgages to create securities which made it far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like new century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgageholders back—which is why the fine print on at least one abacus prospectus warned long investors that the protection buyer goldman may have information including material nonpublic information which it was not providing to the long investors according to an article in the houston chronicle critics also worried that abacus might undermine the position of the us as a safe harbor for the worlds investors and that the involvement of european interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that regions political leaders most notably british prime minister gordon brown who has accused goldman of moral bankruptcy this is in short a big global story  is what goldman sachs did with its abacus investment vehicle illegal that will be for the courts to decide  but it doesnt take a judge and jury to conclude that legalities aside this was just wrong on july   goldman settled out of court agreeing to pay the sec and investors us million including  million to the us government and  million to investors one of the largest penalties ever paid by a wall street firm in august  tourre was found liable on  of  counts by a federal jury the company did not admit or deny wrongdoing but did admit that its marketing materials for the investment contained incomplete information and agreed to change some of its business practices regarding mortgage investments tourre defense of abacus lawsuitedit the  goldman settlement did not cover charges against goldman vice president and salesman for abacus fabrice tourre tourre unsuccessfully sought a dismissal of the suit which then went to trial in  on august  a federal jury found tourre liable on six of seven counts including that he misled investors about the mortgage deal he was found not liable on the charge that he had deliberately made an untrue or misleading statement senate report on the causes of the financial crisis of edit on april   the united states senates permanent subcommittee on investigations released a page report entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse which described some of the causes of the financial crisis the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the united states department of justice to determine whether goldman executives had broken the law and two months later the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed goldman for relevant information on possible securities fraud but on august  the justice department announced it had decided not to file charges against goldman sachs or its employees for trades made during the subprime mortgage portfolio alleged commodity price manipulationedit see also s commodities boom a provision of the  financial deregulation law the grammleachbliley act allows commercial banks to enter into any business activity that is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally in the years since the laws passing goldman sach and other investment banks morgan stanley jpmorgan chase have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials such as food products zinc copper tin nickel and aluminum some critics such as matt taibbi believe that allowing a company to both control the supply of crucial physical commodities and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets is akin to letting casino owners who take book on nfl games during the week also coach all the teams on sundays goldman sachs commodity index and the – food bubbleedit frederick kaufman a contributing editor of harpers magazine argued in a  article that goldmans creation of the goldman sachs commodity index now the sp gsci helped passive investors such as pension funds mutual funds and others engage in food price speculation by betting on financial products based on the commodity index these financial products disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange a june  article in the economist defended commodity investors and oil indextracking funds citing a report by the organisation for economic cooperation and development that found that commodities without futures markets and ignored by indextracking funds also saw price rises during the period aluminum price and supplyedit in a july  article david kocieniewski a journalist with the new york times accused goldman sachs and other wall street firms of capitalizing on loosened federal regulations to manipulate a variety of commodities markets particularly aluminum citing financial records regulatory documents and interviews with people involved in the activities after goldman sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company metro international in  the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories—to make beer cans home siding and other products—went from an average of  weeks to more than  months according to industry records aluminum industry analysts say that the lengthy delays at metro international after goldman took over are a major reason the premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market has doubled since  the price increase has cost american consumers more than  billion from  to  according to former industry executives analysts and consultants the cause of this was alleged to be goldmans ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of  metro international warehouses goldman owns in detroit michigan to avoid hoarding and price manipulation the london metal exchange requires that at least  tons of that metal must be moved out each day goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum—not to factories but from one warehouse to another—according to the times in august  goldman sachs was subpoenaed by the federal commodity futures trading commission as part of an investigation into complaints that goldmanowned metals warehouses had intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum in december  it was announced that  cases accusing goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase the two investment banks warehousing businesses and the london metal exchange in various combinations—of violating us antitrust laws would be assigned to united states district court for the southern district of new york judge katherine b forrest in manhattan according to lydia depillis of wonkblog when goldman bought the warehouses it started paying traders extra to bring their metal to goldmans warehouses rather than anywhere else the longer it stays the more rent goldman can charge which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium the effect is amplified by another company glencore which is doing the same thing in its warehouse in vlissingen michael duvally a spokesman for goldman sachs said the cases are without merit robert lenzner a columnist at forbes wrote that goldman sachs controls only  of the global market and is therefore too small to have pricing power an article published by bloomberg lp also debunked the conspiracy theory in december  goldman sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to ruben brothers oil futures speculationedit investment banks including goldman have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange in august  confidential documents were leaked detailing the positions in the oil futures market of several investment banks including goldman sachs morgan stanley jpmorgan chase deutsche bank and barclays just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of  the presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets and so the means to significantly sway prices and unlike traditional market participants neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold journalist kate sheppard of mother jones called it a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude however another source stated that just before crude oil hit its record high in mid  of the worlds largest banks were betting that prices would fall according to private trading data in april  a couple of observers—brad johnson of the blog climate progress founded by joseph j romm and alain sherter of cbs moneywatch—noted that goldman sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil climate progress quoted goldman as warning that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation in petroleum futures and that net speculative positions are four times as high as in june  when the price of oil peaked it stated that goldman sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least  higher than supply and demand dictate sherter noted that goldmans concern over speculation did not prevent it along with other speculators from lobbying against regulations by the commodity futures trading commission to establish position limits which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold and thus prevent speculation according to joseph p kennedy ii by  prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by hedge funds and bankers pumping billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price the problem started according to kennedy in  when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the new york mercantile exchange goldman sachs made an argument to the commodity futures trading commission that wall street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades the commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed goldman sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades other exemptions followed and by  eight investment banks accounted for  of the total oil futures market initial public offering kickback bribesedit goldman sachs is accused of asking for kickback bribes from institutional clients who made large profits flipping stocks which goldman had intentionally undervalued in initial public offerings it was underwriting documents under seal in a decadelong lawsuit concerning etoyscoms initial public offering ipo in  but released accidentally to the new york times show that ipos managed by goldman were underpriced and that goldman asked clients able to profit from the prices to increase business with it the clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary in order to participate in further such undervalued ipos companies going public and their initial consumer stockholders are both defrauded by this practice unauthorized trades by goldman sachs trader matthew marshall tayloredit former goldman sachs trader matthew marshall taylor was convicted of hiding  billion worth of unauthorized trades involving derivatives on the sp  index by making multiple false entries into a goldman trading system when goldman sachs management uncovered the trades taylor was immediately fired the trades cost the company  million which taylor was ordered to repay in  taylor plead guilty to charges and was sentenced to  months in prison in addition to the monetary damages danish utility sale edit goldman sachss purchase of an  stake

regulations that limit asset managers donations to state and local officials and prohibit certain toplevel employees from donating to such officials this sec regulation is an antipaytoplay measure

new york in  by marcus goldman in  goldmans soninlaw samuel sachs joined the firm in  goldman took his son henry and his soninlaw ludwig dreyfuss into the business and the firm adopted its present name goldman sachs  co the company made a name for itself pioneering the use of commercial paper for entrepreneurs and joined the new york stock exchange nyse in  by  the firms capital stood at  million about  million in real value and was growing rapidly goldman entered the initial public offering market in  when it took sears roebuck and company public the deal occurred due to henry goldmans personal friendship with the owner of sears julius rosenwald other ipos followed including f w woolworth and continental can in  henry s bowers became the first nonmember of the founding family to become partner of the company and share in its profits in  under growing pressure from the other partners in the firm due to his progerman stance henry goldman resigned control of the firm was now in the hands of the sachs family waddill catchings joined the company in  in  the firm moved from  wall street to  million story premises on – pine street by  catchings was the goldman partner with the single largest stake in the firm on december   the firm launched the goldman sachs trading corp a closedend fund the fund failed during the stock market crash of  amid accusations that goldman had engaged in share price manipulation and insider trading –edit in  the firm ousted catchings and sidney weinberg assumed the role of senior partner and shifted goldmans focus away from trading and toward investment banking it was weinbergs actions that helped to restore some of goldmans tarnished reputation on the back of weinberg goldman was lead advisor on the ford motor companys ipo in  which at the time was a major coup on wall street under weinbergs reign the firm also started an investment research division and a municipal bond department it also was at this time that the firm became an early innovator in risk arbitrage gus levy joined the firm in the s as a securities trader which started a trend at goldman where there would be two powers generally vying for supremacy one from investment banking and one from securities trading for most of the s and s this would be weinberg and levy levy was a pioneer in block trading and the firm established this trend under his guidance due to weinbergs heavy influence at the firm it formed an investment banking division in  in an attempt to spread around influence and not focus it all on weinberg in  levy took over as senior partner from weinberg and built goldmans trading franchise once again it is levy who is credited with goldmans famous philosophy of being longterm greedy which implied that as long as money is made over the long term trading losses in the short term were not to be worried about at the same time partners reinvested almost all of their earnings in the firm so the focus was always on the future that same year weinberg retired from the firm another financial crisis for the firm occurred in  when the penn central transportation company went bankrupt with over  million in commercial paper outstanding most of it issued through goldman sachs the bankruptcy was large and the resulting lawsuits notably by the sec threatened the partnership capital life and reputation of the firm it was this bankruptcy that resulted in credit ratings being created for every issuer of commercial paper today by several credit rating services during the s the firm also expanded in several ways under the direction of senior partner stanley r miller it opened its first international office in london in  and created a private wealth division along with a fixed income division in  it also pioneered the white knight strategy in  during its attempts to defend electric storage battery against a hostile takeover bid from international nickel and goldmans rival morgan stanley this action would boost the firms reputation as an investment advisor because it pledged to no longer participate in hostile takeovers john l weinberg the son of sidney weinberg and john c whitehead assumed roles of cosenior partners in  once again emphasizing the coleadership at the firm one of their initiatives was the establishment of  business principles that the firm still claims to apply –edit on november   the firm acquired j aron  company a commodities trading firm which merged with the fixed income division to become known as fixed income currencies and commodities j aron was a player in the coffee and gold markets and the current ceo of goldman lloyd blankfein joined the firm as a result of this merger in  it underwrote the public offering of the real estate investment trust that owned rockefeller center then the largest reit offering in history in accordance with the beginning of the dissolution of the soviet union the firm also became involved in facilitating the global privatization movement by advising companies that were spinning off from their parent governments in  the firm formed goldman sachs asset management which manages the majority of its mutual funds and hedge funds today in the same year the firm also underwrote the ipo of microsoft advised general electric on its acquisition of rca and joined the london and tokyo stock exchanges  also was the year when goldman became the first united states bank to rank in the top  of mergers and acquisitions in the united kingdom during the s the firm became the first bank to distribute its investment research electronically and created the first public offering of original issue deepdiscount bond robert rubin and stephen friedman assumed the cosenior partnership in  and pledged to focus on globalization of the firm and strengthening the merger  acquisition and trading business lines during their reign the firm introduced paperless trading to the new york stock exchange and leadmanaged the firstever global debt offering by a us corporation it also launched the goldman sachs commodity index gsci and opened a beijing office in  also in  jon corzine assumed leadership of the firm as ceo following the departure of rubin and friedman another momentous event in goldmans history was the mexican bailout of  rubin drew criticism in congress for using a treasury department account under his personal control to

goldman sachs of misleading investors by having puffed up its first quarter  earnings by creating a december orphan month into which it shifted large writedowns so they did not appear in any quarterly number in april  the company reported a  million net loss for the single month of december but reported net earnings of  billion for the first quarter of  however the accounting change to a calendar fiscal year which created the stub month of december  was required when the firm converted to a bank holding company and declared in item  of its form k us securities and exchange commission sec filing of december   the december loss also included a  million marktomarket writedown on loans to chemical maker lyondellbasell since it became clear in december that lyondell would file for bankruptcy protection and would not be able to meet its debt obligations while the results of december  were detailed in the press release reporting the results of december  and the first quarter of  and the related conference call with analysts according to an article in the washington post by david s hilzenrath the company included a page of charts in its monday news release showing its december results but it didnt include a narrative description of those results as it did for the januarythroughmarch period most financial analysts and the mainstream financial press were aware of the required change in fiscal year and deteriorating market conditions into december and were not surprised by the december loss analysts focused more on the first quarter results and the planned repayment of tarp funds but even merrill lynch told its clients not to forget about december merrill lynch took at least  billion of losses in the same period and morgan stanley which was also required to switch to a calendar year for accounting purposes as a result of its conversion to a bank holding company also reported a large loss for its stub month of december although unlike goldman morgan stanley also lost money in the first quarter of  bonuses paid to employees in  despite financial crisisedit in june  after the firm repaid the tarp investment from the us treasury goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance andrew cuomo then new york attorney general questioned goldmans decision to pay  employees bonuses of at least  million each after it received tarp funds in  that same period however ceo lloyd blankfein and  other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses stating they believed it was the right thing to do in light of the fact that we are part of an industry thats directly associated with the ongoing economic distress benefits from the government bailout of aigedit american international group received  billion in government loans during the financial crisis the money was used to repay customers of its securitylending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from aig however due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks including goldman sachs should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to aig the new york state attorney general andrew cuomo announced in march  that he was investigating whether aigs trading counterparties improperly received government money goldman sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to aig and received  billion during the unwind of credit default swap cds contracts by aig after receiving the government loans firms response to criticism of aig paymentsedit goldman sachs maintained that its net exposure to aig was not material and that the firm was protected by hedges in the form of cdss with other counterparties and  billion of collateral the firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over  million according to goldman both the collateral and cdss would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an aig bankruptcy however because aig was bailed out and not allowed to fail these hedges did not pay out cfo david viniar stated that profits related to aig in the first quarter of  rounded to zero and profits in december were not significant he went on to say that he was mystified by the interest the government and investors have shown in the banks trading relationship with aig considerable speculation remains that goldmans hedges against its aig exposure would not have paid out if aig was allowed to fail according to a report by the united states office of the inspector general of tarp if aig had collapsed it would have made it difficult for goldman to liquidate its trading positions with aig even at discounts and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that might have made it difficult for goldman sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an aig default finally the report said an aig default would have forced goldman sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations goldman argued that cdss are marked to market ie valued at their current market price and their positions netted between counterparties daily thus as the cost of insuring aigs obligations against default rose substantially in the leadup to its bailout the sellers of the cds contracts had to post more collateral to goldman sachs the firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an aig bankruptcy and the risk of knockon defaults had aig been allowed to fail however in practice the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an aig bankruptcy if the government let aig default according to money manager michael lewitt its collapse would be as close to an extinctionlevel event as the financial markets have seen since the great depression september   meetings at the new york federal reserveedit some have said incorrectly according to others that goldman sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only wall street firm to have participated in the crucial september meetings at the new york fed which decided aigs fate much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted new york times article the article was later corrected to state that blankfein ceo of goldman sachs was one of the wall street chief executives at the meeting emphasis added bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the september aig meetings furthermore goldman sachs cfo david viniar stated that ceo blankfein had never met with his predecessor and thenus treasury secretary henry paulson to discuss aig however there were frequent phone calls between the two of them paulson was not present at the september meetings at the new york fed morgan stanley was hired by the federal reserve to advise on the aig bailout according to the new york times paulson spoke with the ceo of goldman sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so while it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence particularly in a crisis the times noted he spoke with goldmans blankfein more frequently than with other large banks federal officials say that although paulson was involved in decisions to rescue aig it was the federal reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the aig bailout  million settlement for massachusetts subprime mortgages edit on may   goldman sachs agreed to pay up to  million to end an investigation by the massachusetts attorney generals office

firms overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative as the market began its downturn goldman created even more of these securities no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but according to business journalist gretchen morgenson enabling it to pocket huge profits from the mortgage defaults and that goldman used the cdos to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes authors bethany mclean and joe nocera stated that the firms later insistence that it was merely a market maker in these transactions—implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients—became less true over time the investments were called synthetic cdos because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as credit default swaps goldman and some other hedge funds held a short position in the securities paying the premiums while the investors insurance companies pension funds etc receiving the premiums were the long position the longs were responsible for paying the insurance claim to goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted through april  goldman issued over  cdos in its abacus series worth a total of  billion all together goldman packaged sold and shorted a total of  synthetic cdos with an aggregate face value of  billion between july   and may   but while goldman was praised for its foresight some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure these securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by april  at least us billion worth of the securities either carried junk ratings or had defaulted one cdo examined by critics which goldman bet against but also sold to investors was the  million hudson mezzanine cdo issued in  in the senate permanent subcommittee hearings goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books unable to sell them directly it included them in the underlying securities of the cdo and took the short side but critics mclean and nocera complained the cdo prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as assets sourced from the street making it sound as though goldman randomly selected the securities instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book the cdo did not perform well and by march —just  months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out about us million to goldman and others who had bet against it goldmans head of european fixedincome sales lamented in an email made public by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations the real bad feeling across european sales about some of the trades we did with clients who had invested in the cdo the damage this has done to our franchise is very significant critics also complain that while goldmans investors were large ostensibly sophisticated banks and insurers at least some of the cdo securities and their losses filtered down to small public agencies—money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets for example an investor in abacus ikb bank created a structured investment vehicle called rhinebridge rhinebridge like other sivs issued debt that it then used to buy mortgagebacked securities and cdos like abacus the debt issued by rhinebridge  was bought by among others king county washington which managed money on behalf of one hundred other public agencies this was money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets   for all of goldmans later claims that it dealt only with the most sophisticated of investors the fact remained that those investors could be fiduciaries investing on behalf of school districts fire departments pensioners and municipalities all across the country ikb paid for its share of the deal with money it collected from a number of relatively unsophisticated investors including king county in washington state in  the county bought us million of commercial paper a type of shortterm debt from rhineland a special fund created by ikb that in turn snapped up nearly us million of the securities created by the goldman vehicle known as abacus ac  king county also made a usmillion purchase  in  from another ikb fund dubbed rhinebridge the county lost us million when rhinebridge collapsed—and an additional us million when other similar funds defaulted about  county agencies in the seattle area including some that deal with libraries and schools saw their budgets cut as a result in public statements goldman claimed that it shorted simply to hedge and was not expecting the cdos to fail it also denied that its investors were unaware of goldmans bets against the products it was selling to them there were intricate links between a goldman sachs trader jonathan m egol synthetic collateralized debt obligations or cdo abacus and assetbacked securities index abx goldman is also alleged to have tried to pressure the credit rating agency moodys give its products a higher rating than they deserved according to an article in propublica goldman and other firms often seemed to have pressured the agencies to give good ratings emails released last week by the senate investigations subcommittee give a glimpse of the backandforth pdf i am getting serious pushback from goldman on a deal that they want to go to market with today wrote one moodys employee in an internal email message in april  the senate subcommittee found that rating decisions were often subject to concerns about losing market share to competitors the agencies are after all paid by the firms whose products they rate  sec civil fraud lawsuitedit in april  the us securities and exchange commission sec charged goldman sachs and one of its vicepresidents fabrice tourre with securities fraud the sec alleged that goldman had told buyers of a synthetic cdo a type of investment that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent cdo manager aca management in fact paulson  co a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a significant role in the selection and the package of securities turned out to become one of the worstperforming mortgage deals of the housing crisis because less than a year after the deal was completed  of the bonds selected for abacus had been downgraded the particular synthetic cdo that the secs  fraud suit charged goldman with misleading investors with was called abacus ac unlike many of the abacus securities ac did not have goldman sachs as a short seller in fact goldman sachs lost money on the deal that position was taken by the customer john paulson who hired goldman to issue the security according to the secs complaint paulson and his employees selected  bbbrated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for paulson and the manager of the cdo aca management worked on the portfolio of  bonds to be insured aca allegedly unaware of paulsons short position coming to an agreement in late february  paulson paid goldman approximately us million for its work in the deal paulson ultimately made a us billion from the short investments the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers these were primarily ikb deutsche industriebank us million loss and the investors and insurers of another us million—aca financial guaranty corp abn amro and the royal bank of scotland the sec alleged that goldman materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents about the financial security including the fact that it had permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market the hedge fund manager paulson  co to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent objective third party aca management the sec further alleged that tourre also misled aca into believing  that paulsons interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with acas when in reality paulsons interests were sharply conflicting in reply goldman issued a statement saying the secs charges were unfounded in law and fact and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the cdo that it had lost  million that aca selected the portfolio without goldman suggesting paulson was to be a long investor that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa as it was not normal business practice for a market maker and that aca was itself the largest purchaser of the abacus pool investing us million goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector rather than from a particular security in the cdo while some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading others believed goldmans defense was strong and the secs case was weak some experts on securities law such as duke university law professor james cox believed the suit had merit because goldman was aware of the relevance of paulsons involvement and took steps to downplay it others including wayne state university law school law professor peter henning noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved even without knowledge of the part played by paulson critics of goldman sachs point out that paulson went to goldman sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank bear stearns who he had asked to build a cdo ira wagner the head of bear stearnss cdo group in  told the financial crisis inquiry commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal paulson was proposing encouraged paulson to pick the worst assets describing bear stearnss reasoning one author compared the deal to a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team goldman claimed it lost  million critics maintain it was simply unable not due to a lack of trying to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted critics also question whether the deal was ethical even if it was legal goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers according to mclean and nocera there were dozens of securities being insured in the cdo—for example another abacus—had  credits from several different mortgage originators commercial mortgagebacked securities debt from sallie mae credit cards etc goldman bought mortgages to create securities which made it far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like new century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgageholders back—which is why the fine print on at least one abacus prospectus warned long investors that the protection buyer goldman may have information including material nonpublic information which it was not providing to the long investors according to an article in the houston chronicle critics also worried that abacus might undermine the position of the us as a safe harbor for the worlds investors and that the involvement of european interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that regions political leaders most notably british prime minister gordon brown who has accused goldman of moral bankruptcy this is in short a big global story  is what goldman sachs did with its abacus investment vehicle illegal that will be for the courts to decide  but it doesnt take a judge and jury to conclude that legalities aside this was just wrong on july   goldman settled out of court agreeing to pay the sec and investors us million including  million to the us government and  million to investors one of the largest penalties ever paid by a wall street firm in august  tourre was found liable on  of  counts by a federal jury the company did not admit or deny wrongdoing but did admit that its marketing materials for the investment contained incomplete information and agreed to change some of its business practices regarding mortgage investments tourre defense of abacus lawsuitedit the  goldman settlement did not cover charges against goldman vice president and salesman for abacus fabrice tourre tourre unsuccessfully sought a dismissal of the suit which then went to trial in  on august  a federal jury found tourre liable on six of seven counts including that he misled investors about the mortgage deal he was found not liable on the charge that he had deliberately made an untrue or misleading statement senate report on the causes of the financial crisis of edit on april   the united states senates permanent subcommittee on investigations released a page report entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse which described some of the causes of the financial crisis the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the united states department of justice to determine whether goldman executives had broken the law and two months later the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed goldman for relevant information on possible securities fraud but on august  the justice department announced it had decided not to file charges against goldman sachs or its employees for trades made during the subprime mortgage portfolio alleged commodity price manipulationedit see also s commodities boom a provision of the  financial deregulation law the grammleachbliley act allows commercial banks to enter into any business activity that is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally in the years since the laws passing goldman sach and other investment banks morgan stanley jpmorgan chase have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials such as food products zinc copper tin nickel and aluminum some critics such as matt taibbi believe that allowing a company to both control the supply of crucial physical commodities and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets is akin to letting casino owners who take book on nfl games during the week also coach all the teams on sundays goldman sachs commodity index and the – food bubbleedit frederick kaufman a contributing editor of harpers magazine argued in a  article that goldmans creation of the goldman sachs commodity index now the sp gsci helped passive investors such as pension funds mutual funds and others engage in food price speculation by betting on financial products based on the commodity index these financial products disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange a june  article in the economist defended commodity investors and oil indextracking funds citing a report by the organisation for economic cooperation and development that found that commodities without futures markets and ignored by indextracking funds also saw price rises during the period aluminum price and supplyedit in a july  article david kocieniewski a journalist with the new york times accused goldman sachs and other wall street firms of capitalizing on loosened federal regulations to manipulate a variety of commodities markets particularly aluminum citing financial records regulatory documents and interviews with people involved in the activities after goldman sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company metro international in  the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories—to make beer cans home siding and other products—went from an average of  weeks to more than  months according to industry records aluminum industry analysts say that the lengthy delays at metro international after goldman took over are a major reason the premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market has doubled since  the price increase has cost american consumers more than  billion from  to  according to former industry executives analysts and consultants the cause of this was alleged to be goldmans ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of  metro international warehouses goldman owns in detroit michigan to avoid hoarding and price manipulation the london metal exchange requires that at least  tons of that metal must be moved out each day goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum—not to factories but from one warehouse to another—according to the times in august  goldman sachs was subpoenaed by the federal commodity futures trading commission as part of an investigation into complaints that goldmanowned metals warehouses had intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum in december  it was announced that  cases accusing goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase the two investment banks warehousing businesses and the london metal exchange in various combinations—of violating us antitrust laws would be assigned to united states district court for the southern district of new york judge katherine b forrest in manhattan according to lydia depillis of wonkblog when goldman bought the warehouses it started paying traders extra to bring their metal to goldmans warehouses rather than anywhere else the longer it stays the more rent goldman can charge which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium the effect is amplified by another company glencore which is doing the same thing in its warehouse in vlissingen michael duvally a spokesman for goldman sachs said the cases are without merit robert lenzner a columnist at forbes wrote that goldman sachs controls only  of the global market and is therefore too small to have pricing power an article published by bloomberg lp also debunked the conspiracy theory in december  goldman sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to ruben brothers oil futures speculationedit investment banks including goldman have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange in august  confidential documents were leaked detailing the positions in the oil futures market of several investment banks including goldman sachs morgan stanley jpmorgan chase deutsche bank and barclays just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of  the presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets and so the means to significantly sway prices and unlike traditional market participants neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold journalist kate sheppard of mother jones called it a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude however another source stated that just before crude oil hit its record high in mid  of the worlds largest banks were betting that prices would fall according to private trading data in april  a couple of observers—brad johnson of the blog climate progress founded by joseph j romm and alain sherter of cbs moneywatch—noted that goldman sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil climate progress quoted goldman as warning that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation in petroleum futures and that net speculative positions are four times as high as in june  when the price of oil peaked it stated that goldman sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least  higher than supply and demand dictate sherter noted that goldmans concern over speculation did not prevent it along with other speculators from lobbying against regulations by the commodity futures trading commission to establish position limits which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold and thus prevent speculation according to joseph p kennedy ii by  prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by hedge funds and bankers pumping billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price the problem started according to kennedy in  when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the new york mercantile exchange goldman sachs made an argument to the commodity futures trading commission that wall street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades the commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed goldman sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades other exemptions followed and by  eight investment banks accounted for  of the total oil futures market initial public offering kickback bribesedit goldman sachs is accused of asking for kickback bribes from institutional clients who made large profits flipping stocks which goldman had intentionally undervalued in initial public offerings it was underwriting documents under seal in a decadelong lawsuit concerning etoyscoms initial public offering ipo in  but released accidentally to the new york times show that ipos managed by goldman were underpriced and that goldman asked clients able to profit from the prices to increase business with it the clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary in order to participate in further such undervalued ipos companies going public and their initial consumer stockholders are both defrauded by this practice unauthorized trades by goldman sachs trader matthew marshall tayloredit former goldman sachs trader matthew marshall taylor was convicted of hiding  billion worth of unauthorized trades involving derivatives on the sp  index by making multiple false entries into a goldman trading system when goldman sachs management uncovered the trades taylor was immediately fired the trades cost the company  million which taylor was ordered to repay in  taylor plead guilty to charges and was sentenced to  months in prison in addition to the monetary damages danish utility sale edit goldman sachss purchase of an  stake

regulations that limit asset managers donations to state and local officials and prohibit certain toplevel employees from donating to such officials this sec regulation is an antipaytoplay measure

calendar year for accounting purposes as a result of its conversion to a bank holding company also reported a large loss for its stub month of december although unlike goldman morgan stanley also lost money in the first quarter of  bonuses paid to employees in  despite financial crisisedit in june  after the firm repaid the tarp investment from the us treasury goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance andrew cuomo then new york attorney general questioned goldmans decision to pay  employees bonuses of at least  million each after it received tarp funds in  that same period however ceo lloyd blankfein and  other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses stating they believed it was the right thing to do in light of the fact that we are part of an industry thats directly associated with the ongoing economic distress benefits from the government bailout of aigedit american international group received  billion in government loans during the financial crisis the money was used to repay customers of its securitylending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from aig however due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks including goldman sachs should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to aig the new york state attorney general andrew cuomo announced in march  that he was investigating whether aigs trading counterparties improperly received government money goldman sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to aig and received  billion during the unwind of credit default swap cds contracts by aig after receiving the government loans firms response to criticism of aig paymentsedit goldman sachs maintained that its net exposure to aig was not material and that the firm was protected by hedges in the form of cdss with other counterparties and  billion of collateral the firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over  million according to goldman both the collateral and cdss would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an aig bankruptcy however because aig was bailed out and not allowed to fail these hedges did not pay out cfo david viniar stated that profits related to aig in the first quarter of  rounded to zero and profits in december were not significant he went on to say that he was mystified by the interest the government and investors have shown in the banks trading relationship with aig considerable speculation remains that goldmans hedges against its aig exposure would not have paid out if aig was allowed to fail according to a report by the united states office of the inspector general of tarp if aig had collapsed it would have made it difficult for goldman to liquidate its trading positions with aig even at discounts and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that might have made it difficult for goldman sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an aig default finally the report said an aig default would have forced goldman sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations goldman argued that cdss are marked to market ie valued at their current market price and their positions netted between counterparties daily thus as the cost of insuring aigs obligations against default rose substantially in the leadup to its bailout the sellers of the cds contracts had to post more collateral to goldman sachs the firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an aig bankruptcy and the risk of knockon defaults had aig been allowed to fail however in practice the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an aig bankruptcy if the government let aig default according to money manager michael lewitt its collapse would be as close to an extinctionlevel event as the financial markets have seen since the great depression september   meetings at the new york federal reserveedit some have said incorrectly according to others that goldman sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only wall street firm to have participated in the crucial september meetings at the new york fed which decided aigs fate much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted new york times article the article was later corrected to state that blankfein ceo of goldman sachs was one of the wall street chief executives at the meeting emphasis added bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the september aig meetings furthermore goldman sachs cfo david viniar stated that ceo blankfein had never met with his predecessor and thenus treasury secretary henry paulson to discuss aig however there were frequent phone calls between the two of them paulson was not present at the september meetings at the new york fed morgan stanley was hired by the federal reserve to advise on the aig bailout according to the new york times paulson spoke with the ceo of goldman sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so while it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence particularly in a crisis the times noted he spoke with goldmans blankfein more frequently than with other large banks federal officials say that although paulson was involved in decisions to rescue aig it was the federal reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the aig bailout  million settlement for massachusetts subprime mortgages edit on may   goldman sachs agreed to pay up to  million to end an investigation by the massachusetts attorney generals office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state the settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of  massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by goldman sachs michael duvally a spokesman for goldman said it was pleased to have resolved this matter and declined to comment further this settlement may open the door to state government actions against goldman throughout the united states aimed at securing compensation for predatory mortgage lending practices abacus mortgagebacked cdos and  million settlement edit see also merrill lynch § cdo controversies and magnetar capital unlike many investors and investment bankers goldman sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis that developed in  some of its traders became bearish on the housing boom beginning in  and developed mortgagerelated securities originally intended to protect goldman from investment losses in the housing market in late  goldman management changed the firms overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative as the market began its downturn goldman created even more of these securities no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but according to business journalist gretchen morgenson enabling it to pocket huge profits from the mortgage defaults and that goldman used the cdos to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes authors bethany mclean and joe nocera stated that the firms later insistence that it was merely a market maker in these transactions—implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients—became less true over time the investments were called synthetic cdos because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as credit default swaps goldman and some other hedge funds held a short position in the securities paying the premiums while the investors insurance companies pension funds etc receiving the premiums were the long position the longs were responsible for paying the insurance claim to goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted through april  goldman issued over  cdos in its abacus series worth a total of  billion all together goldman packaged sold and shorted a total of  synthetic cdos with an aggregate face value of  billion between july   and may   but while goldman was praised for its foresight some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure these securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by april  at least us billion worth of the securities either carried junk ratings or had defaulted one cdo examined by critics which goldman bet against but also sold to investors was the  million hudson mezzanine cdo issued in  in the senate permanent subcommittee hearings goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books unable to sell them directly it included them in the underlying securities of the cdo and took the short side but critics mclean and nocera complained the cdo prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as assets sourced from the street making it sound as though goldman randomly selected the securities instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book the cdo did not perform well and by march —just  months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out about us million to goldman and others who had bet against it goldmans head of european fixedincome sales lamented in an email made public by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations the real bad feeling across european sales about some of the trades we did with clients who had invested in the cdo the damage this has done to our franchise is very significant critics also complain that while goldmans investors were large ostensibly sophisticated banks and insurers at least some of the cdo securities and their losses filtered down to small public agencies—money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets for example an investor in abacus ikb bank created a structured investment vehicle called rhinebridge rhinebridge like other sivs issued debt that it then used to buy mortgagebacked securities and cdos like abacus the debt issued by rhinebridge  was bought by among others king county washington which managed money on behalf of one hundred other public agencies this was money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets   for all of goldmans later claims that it dealt only with the most sophisticated of investors the fact remained that those investors could be fiduciaries investing on behalf of school districts fire departments pensioners and municipalities all across the country ikb paid for its share of the deal with money it collected from a number of relatively unsophisticated investors including king county in washington state in  the county bought us million of commercial paper a type of shortterm debt from rhineland a special fund created by ikb that in turn snapped up nearly us million of the securities created by the goldman vehicle known as abacus ac  king county also made a usmillion purchase  in  from another ikb fund dubbed rhinebridge the county lost us million when rhinebridge collapsed—and an additional us million when other similar funds defaulted about  county agencies in the seattle area including some that deal with libraries and schools saw their budgets cut as a result in public statements goldman claimed that it shorted simply to hedge and was not expecting the cdos to fail it also denied that its investors were unaware of goldmans bets against the products it was selling to them there were intricate links between a goldman sachs trader jonathan m egol synthetic collateralized debt obligations or cdo abacus and assetbacked securities index abx goldman is also alleged to have tried to pressure the credit rating agency moodys give its products a higher rating than they deserved according to an article in propublica goldman and other firms often seemed to have pressured the agencies to give good ratings emails released last week by the senate investigations subcommittee give a glimpse of the backandforth pdf i am getting serious pushback from goldman on a deal that they want to go to market with today wrote one moodys employee in an internal email message in april  the senate subcommittee found that rating decisions were often subject to concerns about losing market share to competitors the agencies are after all paid by the firms whose products they rate  sec civil fraud lawsuitedit in april  the us securities and exchange commission sec charged goldman sachs and one of its vicepresidents fabrice tourre with securities fraud the sec alleged that goldman had told buyers of a synthetic cdo a type of investment that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent cdo manager aca management in fact paulson  co a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a significant role in the selection and the package of securities turned out to become one of the worstperforming mortgage deals of the housing crisis because less than a year after the deal was completed  of the bonds selected for abacus had been downgraded the particular synthetic cdo that the secs  fraud suit charged goldman with misleading investors with was called abacus ac unlike many of the abacus securities ac did not have goldman sachs as a short seller in fact goldman sachs lost money on the deal that position was taken by the customer john paulson who hired goldman to issue the security according to the secs complaint paulson and his employees selected  bbbrated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for paulson and the manager of the cdo aca management worked on the portfolio of  bonds to be insured aca allegedly unaware of paulsons short position coming to an agreement in late february  paulson paid goldman approximately us million for its work in the deal paulson ultimately made a us billion from the short investments the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers these were primarily ikb deutsche industriebank us million loss and the investors and insurers of another us million—aca financial guaranty corp abn amro and the royal bank of scotland the sec alleged that goldman materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents about the financial security including the fact that it had permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market the hedge fund manager paulson  co to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent objective third party aca management the sec further alleged that tourre also misled aca into believing  that paulsons interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with acas when in reality paulsons interests were sharply conflicting in reply goldman issued a statement saying the secs charges were unfounded in law and fact and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the cdo that it had lost  million that aca selected the portfolio without goldman suggesting paulson was to be a long investor that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa as it was not normal business practice for a market maker and that aca was itself the largest purchaser of the abacus pool investing us million goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector rather than from a particular security in the cdo while some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading others believed goldmans defense was strong and the secs case was weak some experts on securities law such as duke university law professor james cox believed the suit had merit because goldman was aware of the relevance of paulsons involvement and took steps to downplay it others including wayne state university law school law professor peter henning noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved even without knowledge of the part played by paulson critics of goldman sachs point out that paulson went to goldman sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank bear stearns who he had asked to build a cdo ira wagner the head of bear stearnss cdo group in  told the financial crisis inquiry commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal paulson was proposing encouraged paulson to pick the worst assets describing bear stearnss reasoning one author compared the deal to a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team goldman claimed it lost  million critics maintain it was simply unable not due to a lack of trying to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted critics also question whether the deal was ethical even if it was legal goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers according to mclean and nocera there were dozens of securities being insured in the cdo—for example another abacus—had  credits from several different mortgage originators commercial mortgagebacked securities debt from sallie mae credit cards etc goldman bought mortgages to create securities which made it far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like new century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgageholders back—which is why the fine print on at least one abacus prospectus warned long investors that the protection buyer goldman may have information including material nonpublic information which it was not providing to the long investors according to an article in the houston chronicle critics also worried that abacus might undermine the position of the us as a safe harbor for the worlds investors and that the involvement of european interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that regions political leaders most notably british prime minister gordon brown who has accused goldman of moral bankruptcy this is in short a big global story  is what goldman sachs did with its abacus investment vehicle illegal that will be for the courts to decide  but it doesnt take a judge and jury to conclude that legalities aside this was just wrong on july   goldman settled out of court agreeing to pay the sec and investors us million including  million to the us government and  million to investors one of the largest penalties ever paid by a wall street firm in august  tourre was found liable on  of  counts by a federal jury the company did not admit or deny wrongdoing but did admit that its marketing materials for the investment contained incomplete information and agreed to change some of its business practices regarding mortgage investments tourre defense of abacus lawsuitedit the  goldman settlement did not cover charges against goldman vice president and salesman for abacus fabrice tourre tourre unsuccessfully sought a dismissal of the suit which then went to trial in  on august  a federal jury found tourre liable on six of seven counts including that he misled investors about the mortgage deal he was found not liable on the charge that he had deliberately made an untrue or misleading statement senate report on the causes of the financial crisis of edit on april   the united states senates permanent subcommittee on investigations released a page report entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse which described some of the causes of the financial crisis the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the united states department of justice to determine whether goldman executives had broken the law and two months later the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed goldman for relevant information on possible securities fraud but on august  the justice department announced it had decided not to file charges against goldman sachs or its employees for trades made during the subprime mortgage portfolio alleged commodity price manipulationedit see also s commodities boom a provision of the  financial deregulation law the grammleachbliley act allows commercial banks to enter into any business activity that is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally in the years since the laws passing goldman sach and other investment banks morgan stanley jpmorgan chase have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials such as food products zinc copper tin nickel and aluminum some critics such as matt taibbi believe that allowing a company to both control the supply of crucial physical commodities and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets is akin to letting casino owners who take book on nfl games during the week also coach all the teams on sundays goldman sachs commodity index and the – food bubbleedit frederick kaufman a contributing editor of harpers magazine argued in a  article that goldmans creation of the goldman sachs commodity index now the sp gsci helped passive investors such as pension funds mutual funds and others engage in food price speculation by betting on financial products based on the commodity index these financial products disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange a june  article in the economist defended commodity investors and oil indextracking funds citing a report by the organisation for economic cooperation and development that found that commodities without futures markets and ignored by indextracking funds also saw price rises during the period aluminum price and supplyedit in a july  article david kocieniewski a journalist with the new york times accused goldman sachs and other wall street firms of capitalizing on loosened federal regulations to manipulate a variety of commodities markets particularly aluminum citing financial records regulatory documents and interviews with people involved in the activities after goldman sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company metro international in  the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories—to make beer cans home siding and other products—went from an average of  weeks to more than  months according to industry records aluminum industry analysts say that the lengthy delays at metro international after goldman took over are a major reason the premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market has doubled since  the price increase has cost american consumers more than  billion from  to  according to former industry executives analysts and consultants the cause of this was alleged to be goldmans ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of  metro international warehouses goldman owns in detroit michigan to avoid hoarding and price manipulation the london metal exchange requires that at least  tons of that metal must be moved out each day goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum—not to factories but from one warehouse to another—according to the times in august  goldman sachs was subpoenaed by the federal commodity futures trading commission as part of an investigation into complaints that goldmanowned metals warehouses had intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum in december  it was announced that  cases accusing goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase the two investment banks warehousing businesses and the london metal exchange in various combinations—of violating us antitrust laws would be assigned to united states district court for the southern district of new york judge katherine b forrest in manhattan according to lydia depillis of wonkblog when goldman bought the warehouses it started paying traders extra to bring their metal to goldmans warehouses rather than anywhere else the longer it stays the more rent goldman can charge which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium the effect is amplified by another company glencore which is doing the same thing in its warehouse in vlissingen michael duvally a spokesman for goldman sachs said the cases are without merit robert lenzner a columnist at forbes wrote that goldman sachs controls only  of the global market and is therefore too small to have pricing power an article published by bloomberg lp also debunked the conspiracy theory in december  goldman sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to ruben brothers oil futures speculationedit investment banks including goldman have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange in august  confidential documents were leaked detailing the positions in the oil futures market of several investment banks including goldman sachs morgan stanley jpmorgan chase deutsche bank and barclays just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of  the presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets and so the means to significantly sway prices and unlike traditional market participants neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold journalist kate sheppard of mother jones called it a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude however another source stated that just before crude oil hit its record high in mid  of the worlds largest banks were betting that prices would fall according to private trading data in april  a couple of observers—brad johnson of the blog climate progress founded by joseph j romm and alain sherter of cbs moneywatch—noted that goldman sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil climate progress quoted goldman as warning that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation in petroleum futures and that net speculative positions are four times as high as in june  when the price of oil peaked it stated that goldman sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least  higher than supply and demand dictate sherter noted that goldmans concern over speculation did not prevent it along with other speculators from lobbying against regulations by the commodity futures trading commission to establish position limits which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold and thus prevent speculation according to joseph p kennedy ii by  prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by hedge funds and bankers pumping billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price the problem started according to kennedy in  when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the new york mercantile exchange goldman sachs made an argument to the commodity futures trading commission that wall street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades the commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed goldman sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades other exemptions followed and by  eight investment banks accounted for  of the total oil futures market initial public

initial public offerings it was underwriting documents under seal in a decadelong lawsuit concerning etoyscoms initial public offering ipo in  but released accidentally to the new york times show that ipos managed by goldman were underpriced and that goldman asked clients able to profit from the prices to increase business with it the clients willingly complied with these demands because they

trades by goldman sachs trader matthew marshall tayloredit former goldman sachs trader matthew marshall taylor was convicted of hiding  billion worth of unauthorized trades involving derivatives on
