rite mass which appears in typical editions of the roman missal published from  to  the most widely used mass liturgy in the world until the introduction of the mass of paul vi in  it is celebrated in ecclesiastical latin tridentine is derived from the latin tridentinus related to the city of tridentum modernday trent italy in response to a decision of the council of trent pope pius v promulgated the  roman missal making it mandatory throughout the latin church except in places and religious orders with missals from before  despite being often described as the traditional latin mass the mass of paul vi the novus ordo missae that replaced it as the ordinary form of the roman rite has its official text in latin and is sometimes celebrated in that language in  pope benedict xvi issued the motu proprio summorum pontificum accompanied by a letter to the worlds bishops authorizing use of the tridentine mass and ritual for competent priests the pope stated that the  edition of the roman missal is to be considered an extraordinary form forma extraordinaria of the roman rite of which the  mass of paul vi is the ordinary normal or standard form since that is the only authorized

rites and uses  media  directories of latin masses languageedit in most countries the language used for celebrating the tridentine mass was and is latin however in dalmatia and parts of istria in croatia the liturgy was celebrated in church slavonic and authorisation for use of this language was extended to some other slavic regions between  and  after the publication of the  edition of the roman missal the  instruction on implementing the constitution on sacred liturgy of the second vatican council laid down that normally the epistle and gospel from the mass of the day shall be read in the vernacular episcopal conferences were to decide with the consent of the holy see what other parts if any of the mass were to be celebrated in the vernacular outside the roman catholic church the vernacular language was introduced into the celebration of the tridentine mass by some old catholics and anglocatholics with the introduction of the english missal some western rite orthodox christians particularly in the antiochian orthodox archdiocese of north america use the tridentine mass in the vernacular with minor alterations under the title of the divine liturgy of st gregory most old catholics use the tridentine mass either in the vernacular or in latin terminologyedit a pre roman rite high altar decorated with reredos and fixed on a three step platform at which the prayers at the foot of the altar are said leaning against the tabernacle and two of the candlesticks are altar cards to remind the celebrant of the words when he is away from the missal the catholic church uses the term extraordinary form of the roman rite mass among other terms the most widespread term for the rite other than tridentine mass is latin mass likewise the ordinary form of the roman rite mass was promulgated in latin and can be celebrated in that language occasionally the term gregorian rite is used when talking about the tridentine massdiscuss as is more frequently tridentine rite pope benedict xvi declared it inappropriate to speak of the versions of the roman missal of before and after  as if they were two rites rather he said it is a matter of a twofold use of one and the same rite traditionalist catholics whose bestknown characteristic is an attachment to the tridentine mass frequently refer to it as the traditional mass or the traditional latin mass they describe as a codifying of the form of the mass the preparation of pius vs edition of the roman missal of which he said that the experts to whom he had entrusted the work collated the existing text with ancient manuscripts and writings restored it to the original form and rite of the holy fathers and further emended it to distinguish this form of mass from the mass of paul vi traditionalist catholics sometimes call it the mass of the ages and say that it comes down to us from the church of the apostles and ultimately indeed from him who is its principal priest and its spotless victim pope st pius vs revision of the liturgyedit at the time of the council of trent the traditions preserved in printed and manuscript missals varied considerably and standardization was sought both within individual dioceses and throughout the latin west standardization was required also in order to prevent the introduction into the liturgy of protestant ideas in the wake of the protestant reformation pope st pius v accordingly imposed uniformity by law in  with the papal bull quo primum ordering use of the roman missal as revised by him he allowed only those rites that were at least  years old to survive the promulgation of his  missal several of the rites that remained in existence were progressively abandoned though the ambrosian rite survives in milan italy and neighbouring areas stretching even into switzerland and the mozarabic rite remains in use to a limited extent in toledo and madrid spain the carmelite carthusian and dominican religious orders kept their rites but in the second half of the th century two of these three chose to adopt the roman rite the rite of braga in northern portugal seems to have been practically abandoned since  november  that archdiocese authorizes its use only on an optional basis beginning in the late th century france and neighbouring areas such as münster cologne and trier in germany saw a flurry of independent missals published by bishops influenced by jansenism and gallicanism this ended when abbot guéranger and others initiated in the th century a campaign to return to the roman missal pius vs revision of the liturgy had as one of its declared aims the restoration of the roman missal to the original form and rite of the holy fathers due to the relatively limited resources available to his scholars this aim was in fact not realised three different printings of pius vs roman missal with minor variations appeared in  a folio and a quarto edition in rome and a folio edition in venice a reproduction of what is considered to be the earliest referred to therefore as the editio princeps was produced in  in the course of the printing of the editio princeps some corrections were made by pasting revised texts over parts of the already printed pages there were several printings again in the following year  with various corrections of the text historical variationsedit missale romanum in croatian glagolitic script printed in  in the apostolic constitution papal bull quo primum with which he prescribed use of his  edition of the roman missal pius v decreed we order and enjoin that nothing must be added to our recently published missal nothing omitted from it nor anything whatsoever be changed within it this of course did not exclude changes by a pope and pope pius v himself added to the missal the feast of our lady of victory to celebrate the victory of lepanto of  october  his immediate successor pope gregory xiii changed the name of this feast to the most holy rosary of the blessed virgin mary and pope john xxiii changed it to our lady of the rosary pius vs work in severely reducing the number of feasts in the roman calendar see this comparison was very soon further undone by his successors feasts that he had abolished such as those of the presentation of mary saint anne and saint anthony of padua were restored even before clement viiis  typical edition of the missal was issued in the course of the following centuries new feasts were repeatedly added and the ranks of certain feasts were raised or lowered a comparison between pope pius vs tridentine calendar and the general roman calendar of  shows the changes made from  to  pope pius xii made a general revision in  and pope john xxiii made further general revisions in  simplifying the terminology concerning the ranking of liturgical celebrations while keeping on  december what he called the feast of the conception of blessed mary omitting the word immaculate pius v suppressed the existing special mass for the feast directing that the mass for the nativity of mary with the word nativity replaced by conception be used instead part of that earlier mass was revived in the mass that pope pius ix ordered to be used on the feast typical editions of the roman missaledit altar of santa cecilia in trastevere as arranged in  one of many churches in rome whose altar placed at the western end of the church was positioned so that the priest necessarily faced east and so towards the people when celebrating mass in addition to such occasional changes the roman missal was subjected to general revisions whenever a new typical edition an official edition whose text was to be reproduced in printings by all publishers was issued after pius vs original tridentine roman missal the first new typical edition was promulgated in  by pope clement viii who in  had issued a revised edition of the vulgate the bible texts in the missal of pope pius v did not correspond exactly to the new vulgate and so clement edited and revised pope pius vs missal making alterations both in the scriptural texts and in other matters he abolished some prayers that the  missal obliged the priest to say on entering the church shortened the two prayers to be said after the confiteor directed that the words haec quotiescumque feceritis in meam memoriam facietis do this in memory of me should not be said while displaying the chalice to the people after the consecration but before doing so inserted directions at several points of the canon that the priest was to pronounce the words inaudibly suppressed the rule that at high mass the priest even if not a bishop was to give the final blessing with three signs of the cross and rewrote the rubrics introducing for instance the ringing of a small bell the next typical edition was issued in  when pope urban viii made another general revision of the roman missal there was no further typical edition until that of pope leo xiii in  it introduced only minor changes not profound enough to merit having the papal bull of its promulgation included in the missal as the bulls of  and  were in  with the bull divino afflatu pope pius x made significant changes in the rubrics he died in  so it fell to his successor pope benedict xv to issue a new typical edition incorporating his changes this  edition included a new section headed additions and changes in the rubrics of the missal in accordance with the bull divino afflatu and the subsequent decrees of the sacred congregation of rites this additional section was almost as long as the previous section on the general rubrics of the missal which continued to be printed unchanged pope pius xii radically revised the palm sunday and easter triduum liturgy suppressed many vigils and octaves and made other alterations in the calendar see general roman calendar of pope pius xii reforms that were completed in pope john xxiiis  code of rubrics which were incorporated in the final  typical edition of the tridentine missal replacing both pius xs additions and changes in the rubrics of the missal and the earlier general rubrics of the missal changes made to the liturgy in  and  in the wake of decisions of the second vatican council were not incorporated in the roman missal but were reflected in the provisional vernacular translations produced when the language of the people began to be used in addition to latin this explains the references sometimes seen to the  missal the general roman calendar was revised partially in  and  and completely in  in pope paul vis motu proprio mysterii paschalis again reducing the number of feasts  missaledit the roman missal issued by pope john xxiii in  differed from earlier editions in a number of ways it incorporated the change made by john xxiii in  when he inserted into the canon of the mass the name of saint joseph the first change for centuries in the canon of the mass it incorporated major changes that pope pius xii made in  in the liturgy of palm sunday and the easter triduum these included abolition of the ceremonies whereby the blessing of palms on palm sunday resembled a mass with epistle gospel preface and sanctus suppression of the knocking three times on the closed doors before returning to the church after the blessing and distribution of the palms omission of the prayers at the foot of the altar and of the last gospel on holy thursday the washing of feet was incorporated into the mass instead of being an independent ceremony if done by a bishop  men not  had their feet washed the mass itself was said in the evening instead of the morning and some of its prayers were removed or altered on good friday elements that suggested the usual practices of the mass were removed the sacred ministers began the liturgy in alb and for celebrant and deacon black stoles rather than respectively in black chasuble dalmatic and tunicle as per a typical mass the sacred ministers donned their vestments without maniples only for the solemn intercessions in which the celebrant wore a cope instead of a chasuble and removed them for the adoration of the cross the sacred ministers changed to violet vestments again without maniples for the distribution of holy communion let us pray let us kneel arise was added at the prayer for the jews and the adjective perfidis was removed see good friday prayer for the jews an afternoon communion service replaced the morning mass of the presanctified at which the priest alone received the earlierconsecrated host and drank unconsecrated wine into which a small portion of the consecrated host had been put the easter vigil was moved from holy saturday morning to the following nighttime the use of a triple candle was abolished and other changes were made both to the initial ceremonies centred on the paschal candle and to other parts such as the reduction from twelve to four of the prophecies read and the introduction of a renewal of baptismal promises for the laity notable for being the first time since the codification of the missal of pope pius v that the vernacular was permitted to be used in such a manner it incorporated the rubrical changes made by pope pius xiis  decree cum nostra which included vigils were abolished except those of easter christmas ascension pentecost saints peter and paul saint john the baptist and saint lawrence all octaves were abolished except those of easter christmas and pentecost no more than three collects were to be said at low mass and one at solemn mass its calendar incorporated both the changes made by pope pius xii in  general roman calendar of pope pius xii and those introduced by pope john xxiii himself with his  code of rubrics general roman calendar of  these included suppression of the solemnity of saint joseph spouse of the blessed virgin mary wednesday after the second sunday after easter and its replacement by the feast of saint joseph the worker  may removal of some duplicate feasts that appeared twice in earlier versions of the calendar namely the chair of saint peter at rome  january the finding of the holy cross  may saint john before the latin gate  may the apparition of saint michael  may saint peter in chains  august and the invention of the relics of saint stephen  august addition of feasts such as that of the queenship of mary  may it replaced the roman missals introductory sections

to the rubrics of the missal in line with the bull divino afflatu and the subsequent decrees of the sacred congregation of rites with the text of the general rubrics and the general rubrics of the roman missal parts of the  code of rubrics pope benedict xvi authorized under certain conditions continued use of this  edition of the roman missal as an extraordinary form of the roman rite alongside the later form introduced in  which is now the normal or ordinary form pre forms of the roman rite which some individuals and groups employ are not authorized for liturgical use liturgical structureedit the mass is divided into two parts the mass of the catechumens and the mass of the faithful catechumens those being instructed in the faith were once dismissed after the first half not having yet professed the faith profession of faith was considered essential for participation in the eucharistic sacrifice this rule of the didache is still in effect it is only one of the three conditions baptism right faith and right living for admission to receiving holy communion that the catholic church has always applied and that were already mentioned in the early nd century by saint justin martyr and this food is called among us the eucharist of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins and unto regeneration and who is so living as christ has enjoined first apology chapter lxvi before massedit asperges sprinkling with holy water psalm   is an optional penitential rite that ordinarily precedes only the principal mass on sunday in the sacristy a priest wearing an alb if he is to celebrate the mass or surplice if he is not the celebrant of the mass and vested with a stole which is the color of the day if the priest is the celebrant of the mass or purple if he is not the celebrant of the mass exorcises and blesses salt and water then puts the blessed salt into the water by thrice sprinkling it in the form of a cross while saying once commixtio salis et aquæ pariter fiat in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti may a mixture of salt and water now be made in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit after that the priest vested in a cope of the color of the day while the choir sings an antiphon and a verse of psalm  or  sprinkles with the holy water the altar three times and then the clergy and the congregation this rite if used precedes the prayers at the foot of the altar during the easter season the asperges me verse is replaced by the vidi aquam verse and alleluia is added to the ostende nobis verse and to its response following the asperges mass begins mass of the catechumensedit the first part is the mass of the catechumens prayers at the foot of the altaredit prayers at the foot of the altar the sequence of prayers at the foot of the altar is sign of the cross the priest after processing in—at solemn mass with deacon and subdeacon master of ceremonies and servers and at other masses with one or more servers—and at low mass placing the veiled chalice on the centre of the altar makes the sign of the cross at the foot of the altar at solemn mass the chalice is placed beforehand on the credence table psalm  psalm  mt ie masoretic numbering known by its incipit iudica me is recited except in masses of the season during passiontide and in requiem masses it is preceded and followed by an antiphon of psalm   mt introibo ad altare dei ad deum qui lætificat iuventutem meam translation i shall go in to the altar of god the god who gives joy to my youth is recited by the priest alternating with the deacon and subdeacon if present or servers psalm  is recited priest makes the sign of the cross our help is in the name of the lord servers who made heaven and earth the double form of a prayer of general confession of sins known by its incipit confiteor i confess is recited priest while bowing low confíteor deo omnipoténti beátæ maríæ semper vírgini beáto michaéli archángelo beáto ioanni baptístæ sanctis apóstolis petro et paulo ómnibus sanctis et vobis fratres tibi pater quia peccávi nimis cogitatióne verbo et ópere while striking the breast three times mea culpa mea culpa mea máxima culpa ideo precor beátam maríam semper vírginem beátum michaélem archángelum beátum ioánnem baptístam sanctos apóstolos petrum et paulum omnes sanctos et vos fratres te pater oráre pro me ad dóminum deum nostrum translation i confess to almighty god to blessed mary ever virgin to blessed michael the archangel to blessed john the baptist to the holy apostles peter and paul to all the saints and to you brethren that i have sinned exceedingly in thought word and deed through my fault through my fault through my most grievous fault therefore i beseech blessed mary ever virgin  and you brethren to pray to the lord our god for me the servers pray for the priest may almighty god have mercy on thee forgive thee thy sins and bring thee to life everlasting then it is the ministers or servers turn to confess sinfulness and to ask for prayers they use the same words as those used by the priest except that they say you father in place of you brethren and the priest responds with the same prayer that the servers have used for him but using the plural number plus an extra prayer some verses are then said by priest and ministers or servers ending with the priest saying oremus te domine let us pray after this he ascends to the altar praying silently take away from us our iniquities that with pure minds we may worthily enter into the holy of holies a reference to exodus   kings   kings   chronicles  ezekiel  and others he places his joined hands on the edge of the altar so that only the tips of the small fingers touch the front of it and silently prays that by the merits of the saints whose relics are in the altar god may pardon all his sins at the words quorum relíquiæ hic sunt whose relics are here he spreads his hands and kisses the altar priest at the altaredit dominus vobiscum the lord be with you before the collect in the tridentine mass the priest should keep his eyes downcast at this point introit the priest again makes the sign of the cross while he begins to read the introit which is usually taken from a psalm exceptions occur eg the introit for easter sunday is adapted from wis  and the antiphon in masses of the blessed virgin mary was from the poet sedulius this evolved from the practice of singing a full psalm interspersed with the antiphon during the entrance of the clergy before the prayers at the foot of the altar were added to the mass in medieval times this is indicated by the very name of introit kyrie this part of mass is a linguistic marker of the origins of the roman liturgy in greek kyrie eleison christe eleison kyrie eleison means lord have mercy christ have mercy each phrase is said or sung three times gloria in excelsis deo the first line of the gloria is taken from lk  the gloria is omitted during the penitential liturgical seasons of advent septuagesima lent and passiontide in which violet vestments are worn but is used on feasts falling during such seasons as well as on holy thursday it is always omitted for a requiem mass the collect the priest turns toward the people and says dominus vobiscum the servers respond et cum spiritu tuo the lord be with you and with thy spirit the collect follows a prayer not drawn directly from scripture it tends to reflect the season instructionedit the priest reads the epistle primarily an extract from the letters of st paul to various churches in his motu proprio summorum pontificum pope benedict xvi has permitted this to be read in the vernacular language when mass is celebrated with the people between the epistle and the gospel two rarely three choir responses are sung or said usually these are a gradual followed by an alleluia but between septuagesima sunday and holy saturday or in a requiem mass or other penitential mass the alleluia is replaced by a tract and between easter sunday and pentecost the gradual is replaced by a second alleluia on a few exceptional occasions most notably easter pentecost corpus christi and in a requiem mass a sequence follows the alleluia or tract the gradual is partly composed of a portion of a psalm the gospel reading an extract from one of the four gospels before the reading or chanting of the gospel the priest prays cleanse my heart and my lips o almighty god who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet isaias a reference to isaiah  in this passage after being cleansed by the angel isaiah was instructed to prophesy the homily the rite of mass as revised by pope pius v the tridentine mass does not consider a sermon obligatory and speaks of it instead as merely optional it presumes that the creed if it is to be said will follow the gospel immediately but adds if however someone is to preach the homilist after the gospel has been finished preaches and when the sermon or moral address has been completed the credo is said or if it is not to be said the offertory is sung by contrast the roman missal as revised by pope paul vi declares that the homily may not be omitted without a grave reason from mass celebrated with the people attending on sundays and holy days of obligation and that it is recommended on other days the creed this is the nicene creed professing faith in god the father in god the son the word made flesh in god the holy ghost and in the holy church at the mention of the incarnation the celebrant and the congregation genuflect mass of the faithfuledit the second part is the mass of the faithful offertoryedit offertory verse after greeting the people once more dominus vobiscumet cum spiritu tuo and giving the invitation to pray oremus the priest enters upon the mass of the faithful from which the nonbaptized were once excluded he reads the offertory verse a short quotation from holy scripture which varies with the mass of each day with hands joined offering of bread and wine the priest offers the host holding it on the paten at breast level and praying that although he is unworthy god may accept this spotless host or victim the basic meaning of hostia in latin for his own innumerable sins offences and neglects for all those present and for all faithful christians living and dead that it may avail unto salvation of himself and those mentioned he then mixes a few drops of water with the wine which will later become the blood of jesus and holding the chalice so that the lip of the chalice is about the height of his lips offers the chalice of salvation asking that it may ascend with a sweet fragrance he then prays a prayer of contrition adapted from dan  incensing of the offerings and of the faithful at a high mass the priest blesses the incense then incenses the bread and wine among the prayers the priest says is psalm  let my prayer o lord be directed as incense in thy sight which is prayed as he incenses the altar the priest then gives the thurible to the deacon who incenses the priest then the other ministers and the congregation washing the hands the priest prays psalm  i will wash my hands among the innocent prayer to the most holy trinity this prayer asks that the divine trinity may receive the oblation being made in remembrance of the passion resurrection and ascension of jesus and in honour of blessed mary ever virgin and the other saints that it may avail to their honour and our salvation and that they may vouchsafe to intercede for us in heaven orate fratres suscipiat and secret amen concludes offertory here the priest turns to the congregation and says the first two words orate fratres in an elevated tone and then turns around while finishing the exhortation in the secret tone pray brethren that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to god the father almighty the altar servers respond with the suscipiat to which the priest secretly responds amen suscipiat dominus sacrificium de manibus tuis ad laudem et gloriam nominis sui ad utilitatem quoque nostram totiusque ecclesiæ suae sanctæ a translation in the english is may the lord accept this sacrifice at your hands to the praise and glory of his name for our good and the good of all his holy church the priest then says the days secret inaudibly and concludes it with per omnia sæcula sæculorum aloud the altar servers and in dialogue mass the congregation respond amen consecrationedit preface of the canon the roman canon dates in essentials from before st gregory the great who died in  and who is credited with adding a phrase to it see history of the roman canon it contains the main elements found in almost all rites but in an unusual arrangement and it is unclear which part should be considered to be the epiclesis dominus vobiscum et cum spiritu tuo sursum corda habemus ad dominum gratias agamus domino deo nostro dignum et iustum est the first part can be seen above at the collect the rest means lift up your hearts we lift them up to the lord let us give thanks to the lord our god it is right and just next a preface is prayed indicating specific reasons for giving thanks to god this leads to the sanctus canon or rule of consecration intercession corresponding to the reading of the diptychs in the byzantine rite—a diptych is a twoleaf painting carving or writing tablet here the priest prays for the living that god may guard unite and govern the church together with the pope and all those who holding to the truth hand on the catholic and apostolic faith then specific living people are mentioned and the congregation in the church next mary ever virgin saint joseph the apostles and some popes and other martyrs are mentioned by name as well as a generic and all your saints in communion with whom prayer is offered prayers preparatory to the consecration a prayer that god may graciously accept the offering and command that we be delivered from eternal damnation and counted among the flock of those you have chosen consecration transubstantiation and major elevation elevation of the chalice during the canon of the mass at a solemn mass the passage lk  is key in this section in summa theologiae iii   thomas aquinas addresses the interspersed phrase the mystery of faith on this phrase see mysterium fidei oblation of the victim to god an oblation is an offering the pure holy spotless victim is now offered with a prayer that god may accept the offering and command his holy angel to carry the offering to gods altar on high so that those who receive the body and blood of christ may be filled with every grace and heavenly blessing remembrance of the dead the priest now prays for the dead those who have gone before us with the sign of faith and rest in the sleep of peace and asks that they be granted a place of refreshment light and peace this is followed by a prayer that we be granted fellowship with the saints john the baptist and fourteen martyrs seven men and seven women are mentioned by name end of the canon and doxology with minor elevation the concluding doxology is through him and with him and in him o god almighty father in the unity of the holy spirit all glory and honour is yours for ever and ever amen ratifies the canon prayer elevation candleedit beuron art school representation of an elevation candle mistakenly placed at the gospel side and upon the altar until  the tridentine form of the roman missal laid down that a candle should be placed at the epistle side of the altar and that it should be lit at the showing of the consecrated sacrament to the people in practice except in monasteries and on special occasions this had fallen out of use long before pope john xxiii replaced the section on the general rubrics of the roman missal with his code of rubrics which no longer mentioned this custom on this see elevation candle communionedit before receiving communion from the chalice the priest makes the sign of the cross over himself saying in latin may the blood of our lord jesus christ keep my soul for eternal life amen the lords prayer and libera nos the libera nos is an extension of the lords prayer developing the line sed libera nos a malo but deliver us from evil the priest prays that we may be delivered from all evils and that the virgin mary mother of god together with the apostles and saints may intercede to obtain for us peace in our day fraction of the host during the preceding prayer the priest breaks the consecrated host into three parts and after concluding the prayer drops the smallest part into the chalice while praying that this commingling and consecration of the body and blood of christ may be to us who receive it effectual to life everlasting agnus dei agnus dei means lamb of god the priest then prays lamb of god who takest away the sins of the world have mercy on us he repeats this and then adds lamb of god who takest away the sins of the world grant us peace the mass of the last supper on holy thursday has have mercy on us all three times in requiem masses the petitions are grant them rest twice followed by grant them eternal rest the pax the priest asks christ to look not at the priests sins but at the faith of christs church and prays for peace and unity within the church then if a high mass is being celebrated he gives the sign of peace to the deacon saying peace be with you prayers preparatory to the communion in the first of these two prayers for himself the priests asks that by holy communion he may be freed from all his iniquities and evils be made to adhere to the commandments of jesus and never be separated from him in the second he asks let not the partaking of thy body o lord jesus christturn to my judgment and condemnation but through thy goodness may it be unto me a safeguard receiving of the body and blood of our lord the priest quietly says several prayers here before receiving communion the first is said in a low voice while taking up the host onto the paten the second of them spoken three times in a slightly audible voice while the priest holds the host in his left hand and strikes his breast with his right is based on matthew  lord i am not worthy then after having reverently consumed the host he takes up the chalice while in a low voice reciting psalm  what shall i render to the lord for all the things he hath rendered unto me i will take the chalice of salvation and i will call upon the name of the lord immediately adding psalm  praising i will call upon the lord and i shall be saved from my enemies priest on the ecce agnus dei  behold the lamb of god in the people communion if the priest is to give communion to others he holds up a small host and says aloud behold the lamb of god  and three times lord i am not worthy  he then gives communion first making with the host the sign of the cross over each communicant while saying may the body of our lord jesus christ preserve your soul for eternal life amen conclusionedit ite missa est sung by the deacon at a solemn mass prayers during the ablutions the prayers now focus on what has been received that we may receive with a pure mind that no stain of sin may remain in me whom these pure and holy sacraments have refreshed communion antiphon and postcommunion the communion antiphon is normally a portion of a psalm the postcommunion prayer is akin to the collect in being an appropriate prayer not directly drawn from scripture ite missa est blessing go it is the dismissal the word mass derives from this phrase after saying a silent prayer for himself the priest then gives the people his blessing prior to the revisions of pope pius xii and pope john xxiii the ite missa est was replaced with benedicamus domino let us bless the lord on days in which the gloria was not said and the rubrics required the priest to wear violet vestments ie masses of the season during advent septuagesima lent and passiontide vigils certain votive masses in the  missal benedicamus domino is said only when the mass is followed by another liturgical action such as the eucharistic processions on holy thursday and corpus christi in requiem masses the ite missa est is replaced with requiescant in pace with the response being amen instead of deo gratias the last gospel the priest then reads the last gospel the beginning of the gospel of john john  which recounts the incarnation of the son of god on certain occasions as for instance at the day mass on christmas day another gospel passage was read instead because that gospel is read as the gospel of the mass but pope john xxiiis revision of the rubrics decreed that on those and on other occasions the last gospel should simply be omitted prayers of the priest before and after massedit the tridentine missal includes prayers for the priest to say before and after mass in later editions of the roman missal including that of  the introductory heading of these prayers indicates that they are to be recited pro opportunitate as circumstances allow which in practice means that they are merely optional and may be omitted the original tridentine missal presents most of the prayers as obligatory indicating as optional only a very long prayer attributed to saint ambrose which later editions divide into seven sections each to be recited on only one day of the week and two other prayers attributed to saint ambrose and saint thomas aquinas respectively in addition to these three prayers the original tridentine missal proposes for the priest to recite before he celebrates mass the whole of psalms –   the numbering is that of the septuagint and vulgate and a series of collectstyle prayers later editions add after the three that in the original missal are only optional prayers to the blessed virgin saint joseph all the angels and saints and the saint whose mass is to be celebrated but as has been said treats as optional all the prayers before mass even those originally given as obligatory the original tridentine missal proposes for recitation by the priest after mass three prayers including the adoro te devote later editions place before these three the canticle of the three youths dan with three collects and follow them with the anima christi and seven more prayers treating as optional even the three prescribed in the original tridentine missal leonine prayersedit from  to  the holy see prescribed the recitation after low mass of certain prayers originally for the solution of the roman question and after this problem was solved by the lateran treaty to permit tranquillity and freedom to profess the faith to be restored to the afflicted people of russia these prayers are known as the leonine prayers because it was pope leo xiii who on  january  ordered their recitation throughout the world in what had been the papal states they were already in use since  the prayers comprised three ave marias one salve regina followed by a versicle and response and a collect prayer that from  on asked for the conversion of sinners and the freedom and exaltation of holy mother the church and again from  on a prayer to saint michael in  pope pius x added a thricerepeated most sacred heart of jesus have mercy on us in  with effect from  march  the holy see ended the obligation to recite the leonine prayers after low mass however the leonine prayers are sometimes still recited after presentday celebrations of tridentine mass although they are not included even in the  edition of the tridentine missal participation by the peopleedit nuptial low mass distribution of communion at a tridentine mass typically the faithful kneel and receive in the mouth and women wear a headcovering the participation of the congregation at the tridentine mass is interior involving eye and heart and exterior by mouth except in the dialogue mass form which arose about  and led to a more active exterior participation of the congregation the people present at the tridentine mass do not recite out loud the prayers of the mass only the server or servers join with the priest in reciting the prayers at the foot of the altar which include the confiteor and in speaking the other responses most of the prayers that the priest says are spoken inaudibly including almost all the mass of the faithful the offertory prayers the canon of the mass except for the preface and the final doxology and apart from the agnus dei those between the lords prayer and the postcommunion at a solemn mass or missa cantata a choir sings the servers responses except for the prayers at the foot of the altar the choir sings the introit the kyrie the gloria the gradual the tract or alleluia the credo the offertory and communion antiphons the sanctus and the agnus dei of these only the five that form part of the ordinary of the mass are usually sung at a missa cantata in addition to the gregorian chant music for these polyphonic compositions exist some quite elaborate the priest largely says quietly the words of the chants and then recites other prayers while the choir continues the chant different levels of celebrationedit there are various forms of celebration of the tridentine mass pontifical high mass celebrated by a bishop accompanied by an assisting priest deacon subdeacon thurifer acolytes and other ministers under the guidance of a priest acting as master of ceremonies most often the specific parts assigned to deacon and subdeacon are performed by priests the parts that are said aloud are all chanted except that the prayers at the foot of the altar which before the reform of pope pius v were said in the sacristy are said quietly by the bishop with the deacon and the subdeacon while the choir sings the introit the main difference between a pontifical and an ordinary high mass is that the bishop remains at his throne almost all the time until the offertory solemn or high mass latin missa solemnis offered by a priest accompanied by a deacon and subdeacon and the other ministers mentioned above missa cantata latin for sung mass celebrated by a priest without deacon and subdeacon and thus a form of low mass but with some parts the three variable prayers the scripture readings preface pater noster and ite missa est sung by the priest and other parts introit kyrie gloria gradual tract or alleluia credo offertory antiphon sanctus and benedictus agnus dei and communion antiphon sung by the choir incense may be used exactly as at a solemn mass with the exception of incensing the celebrant after the gospel which is not done low mass the priest sings no part of the mass though in some places a choir or the congregation sings during the mass hymns not always directly related to the mass in its article the liturgy of the mass the  catholic encyclopedia describes how when concelebration ceased to be practised in western europe low mass became distinguished from high mass the separate celebrations then involved the building of many altars in one church and the reduction of the ritual to the simplest possible form the deacon and subdeacon were in this case dispensed with the celebrant took their part as well as his own one server took the part of the choir and of all the other ministers everything was said instead of being sung the incense and kiss of peace were omitted so we have the wellknown rite of low mass missa privata this then reacted on high mass missa solemnis so that at high mass too the celebrant himself recites everything even though it be sung by the deacon subdeacon or choir on the origin of the missa cantata the same source gives the following information  high mass is the norm it is only in the complete rite with deacon and subdeacon that the ceremonies can be understood thus the rubrics of the ordinary of the mass always suppose that the mass is high low mass said by a priest alone with one server is a shortened and simplified form of the same thing its ritual can be explained only by a reference to high mass for instance the celebrant goes over to the north side of the altar to read the gospel because that is the side to which the deacon goes in procession at high mass he turns round always by the right because at high mass he should not turn his back to the deacon and so on a sung mass missa cantata is a modern compromise it is really a low mass since the essence of high mass is not the music but the deacon and subdeacon only in churches which have no ordained person except one priest and in which high mass is thus impossible is it allowed to celebrate the mass on sundays and feasts with most of the adornment borrowed from high mass with singing and generally with incense revision of the roman missaledit pius xii began in earnest the work of revising the roman missal with a thorough revision of the rites of holy week which after an experimental period beginning in  was made obligatory in  the mass that used to be said on holy thursday morning was moved to the evening necessitating a change in the rule that previously had required fasting from midnight the good friday service was moved to the afternoon holy communion was no longer reserved for the priest alone as before hosts consecrated at the holy thursday mass were used and the priest no longer received part of the host in unconsecrated wine the easter vigil service that used to be held in morning of holy saturday was moved to the night that leads to easter sunday and many changes were made to the content in  pope john xxiii – ordered the suppression of the word perfidis unbelieving ie not believing in jesus applied to the jews in the rites for good friday he revised the rubrics to the order of mass and the breviary two years later in  he made some more minor modifications on the occasion of publishing a new typical edition of the roman missal this is the edition authorized for use by virtue of the quattuor abhinc annos indult see below under present status of the tridentine mass among the other changes he made and that were included in the  missal were adding st josephs name to the roman canon eliminating the second confiteor before communion suppressing  feasts such as st peters chair in rome or more accurately combining both feasts of st peters chair into one as they originally had been incorporating the abolition of  festal octaves and  vigils of feasts and other changes made by pope pius xii and modifying rubrics especially for solemn high masses among the names that disappeared from the roman missal was that of st philomena her liturgical celebration had never been admitted to the general roman calendar but from  it had been included with an indication that the mass was to be taken entirely from the common in the section headed masses for some places ie only those places for which it had been specially authorized but her name had already in  been ordered to be removed from all liturgical calendars on  december  the second vatican council decreed in chapter ii of its constitution on the sacred liturgy sacrosanctum concilium the rite of the mass is to be revised  the rites are to be simplified due care being taken to preserve their substance parts which with the passage of time came to be duplicated or were added with little advantage are to be omitted other parts which suffered loss through accidents of history are to be restored to the vigor they had in the days of the holy fathers as may seem useful or necessary the treasures of the bible are to be opened up more lavishly so that a richer fare may be provided for the faithful at the table of god’s word  a suitable place may be allotted to the vernacular in masses which are celebrated with the people  communion under both kinds may be granted when the bishops think fitas for instance to the newly ordained in the mass of their sacred ordination to the newly professed in the mass of their religious profession and to the newly baptized in the mass which follows their baptism the instruction inter oecumenici of  september  initiated the application to the mass of the decisions that the council had taken less than a year before permission was given for use only in mass celebrated with the people of the vernacular language especially in the biblical readings and the reintroduced prayers of the faithful but until the whole of the ordinary of the mass has been revised in the chants kyrie gloria creed sanctus agnus dei and the entrance offertory and communion antiphons and in the parts that involved dialogue with the people and in the our father which the people could now recite entirely together with the priest most episcopal conferences quickly approved interim vernacular translations generally different from country to country and after having them confirmed by the holy see published them in  other changes included the omission of psalm   at the start of mass and the last gospel at the end both of which pope pius v had first inserted into the missal having previously been private prayers said by the priest in the sacristy and the leonine prayers of pope leo xiii the canon of the mass which continued to be recited silently was kept in latin three years later the instruction tres abhinc annos of  may  gave permission for use of the vernacular even in the canon of the mass and allowed it to be said audibly and even in part to be chanted the vernacular could be used even at mass celebrated without the people being present use of the maniple was made optional and at three ceremonies at which the cope was previously the obligatory vestment the chasuble could be used instead pope paul vi continued implementation of the councils directives ordering with apostolic constitution missale romanum of holy thursday  april  publication of a new official edition of the roman missal which appeared in latin in  opposition to the latest revisions of the liturgyedit some traditionalist catholics reject to a greater or lesser extent the changes made since  see traditionalist catholic none advocate returning to the original  form of the liturgy though some may perhaps wish a reestablishment of its form before pius xs revision of the rubrics in  some do refuse to accept the  changes in the liturgy of palm sunday and the easter triduum and in the liturgical calendar see general roman calendar of pope pius xii and instead use the general roman calendar as in  others accept the  changes by pius xii but not those of pope john xxiii others again in accordance with the authorization granted by pope benedict xvi in summorum pontificum use the missal and calendar as it was in  some of them argue that unlike earlier reforms the revision of  which replaced the tridentine mass with the mass of pope paul vi represented a major break with the past they consider that the content of the revised liturgy is in catholic terms seriously deficient and defective some hold that it is displeasing to god and that no catholic should attend it when a preliminary text of two of the sections of the revised missal was published in  archbishop marcel lefebvre gathered a group of twelve theologians who under his direction wrote a study of the text they stated that it represents both as a whole and in its details a striking departure from the catholic theology of the mass as it was formulated in session  of the council of trent cardinal alfredo ottaviani a former prefect of the sacred congregation for the doctrine of the faith supported this study with a letter of  september  to pope paul vi cardinal antonio bacci signed the same letter the critical study became known as the ottaviani intervention cardinal ottaviani subsequently stated in writing that he had not intended his letter to be made public and that pope paul vis doctrinal exposition on  november and  november  of the revised liturgy in its definitive form meant that no one can be genuinely scandalised any more jean madiran a critic of vatican ii and foundereditor of the french journal itinéraires claimed that this letter was fraudulently presented to the elderly and already blind cardinal for his signature by his secretary monsignor and future cardinal gilberto agustoni and that agustoni resigned shortly afterwards this allegation remains unproven and madiran himself was not an eyewitness of the alleged deception in october  a meeting of the synod of bishops had already given its opinion on a still earlier draft of the  members  approved it as it stood  approved it but suggested various modifications  abstained and  voted against from the s onwards western countries have experienced a drop in mass attendance in the united states from  of catholics attending in  to  attending by  these same countries saw a decline in seminary enrollments and in the number of priests in the united states from  ordinations in  to  in  and a general erosion of belief in the doctrines of the catholic faith opponents of the revision of the mass liturgy argue citing opinion poll evidence in their support that the revision contributed to this decline others pointing among other considerations to the fact that globally there are more priests and seminarians now than in previous years in  there were  major seminarians worldwide in  there were  an increase of  at a time however when there was an increase of global population of  suggest that the apparent decline of catholic practice in the west is due to the general influence of secularism and liberalism on western societies rather than to developments within the catholic church attitudes of popes since the second vatican counciledit pope paul viedit following the introduction of the mass of paul vi in  the holy see granted a significant number of permissions for the use of the former liturgy for example elderly priests were not required to switch to celebrating the new form in england and wales occasional celebrations of the tridentine mass were allowed in virtue of what became known as the agatha christie indult however there was no general worldwide legal framework allowing for the celebration of the rite following the rise of the traditionalist catholic movement in the s pope paul vi reportedly declined to liberalise its use further on the grounds that it had become a politically charged symbol associated with opposition to his policies pope john paul iiedit in  the holy see sent a letter known as quattuor abhinc annos to the presidents of the worlds episcopal conferences this document empowered diocesan bishops to authorise on certain conditions celebrations of the tridentine mass for priests and laypeople who requested them in  following the excommunication of archbishop marcel lefebvre and four bishops that he had consecrated the pope issued a further document a motu proprio known as ecclesia dei which stated that respect must everywhere be shown for the feelings of all those who are attached to the latin liturgical tradition the pope urged bishops to give a wide and generous application to the provisions of quattuor abhinc annos and established the pontifical commission ecclesia dei to oversee relations between rome and traditionalist catholics the holy see itself granted authorisation to use the tridentine mass to a significant number of priests and priestly societies such as the priestly fraternity of st peter the institute of christ the king sovereign priest and the personal apostolic administration of saint john mary vianney some diocesan bishops however declined to authorise celebrations within their dioceses or did so only to a limited extent in some cases the difficulty was that those seeking the permission were hostile to the church authorities other refusals of permission were alleged to have stemmed from certain bishops disapproval in principle of celebrations of the tridentine liturgy pope benedict xviedit as a cardinal joseph ratzinger was regarded as having a particular interest in the liturgy and as being favourable towards the older rite of mass he famously criticized the erratic way in which contrary to official policy many priests celebrated the revised rite in september  the pontifical commission ecclesia dei established the institute of the good shepherd made up of former members of the society of st pius x in bordeaux france with permission to use the tridentine liturgy this step was met with some discontent from french clergy and thirty priests wrote an open letter to the pope consistently with its previous policy the society of st pius x rejected the move following repeated rumours that the use of the tridentine mass would be liberalised the pope issued a motu proprio called summorum pontificum on  july  together with an accompanying letter to the worlds bishops the pope declared that the roman missal promulgated by paul vi is the ordinary expression of the lex orandi law of prayer of the catholic church of the latin rite nevertheless the roman missal promulgated by st pius v and reissued by st john xxiii is to be considered as an extraordinary expression of that same lex orandi he further stated that the  missal  was never juridically abrogated he replaced with new rules those of quattuor abhinc annos on use of the older form essentially authorization for using the  form for parish masses and those celebrated on public occasions such as a wedding is devolved from the local bishop to the priest in charge of a church and any priest of the latin rite may use the  roman missal in masses celebrated without the people a term that does not exclude attendance by other worshippers lay or clergy while requests by groups of catholics wishing to use the tridentine liturgy in parish masses are to be dealt with by the parish priest or the rector of the church rather than as before by the local bishop the pope and cardinal darío castrillón have stated that the bishops authority is not thereby undermined present regulationsedit the regulations set out in summorum pontificum provide that in masses celebrated without the people every latin rite priest may use either the  roman missal or that of paul vi except during the easter triduum when masses without participation by the people are no longer allowed celebrations of mass in this form formerly referred to as private masses may as before be attended by laypeople who ask to be admitted in parish masses where there is a stable group of laypeople who adhere to the earlier liturgical tradition the parish priest should willingly accept their requests to be allowed to celebrate the mass according to the  missal and should ensure that their welfare harmonises with the ordinary pastoral care of the parish under the guidance of the bishop in accordance with canon  of the code of canon law avoiding discord and favouring the unity of the church mass may be celebrated using the  missal on working days while on sundays and feast days one such celebration may be held for priests and laypeople who request it the parish priest should allow celebrations of the  form on special occasions such as weddings funerals and pilgrimages communities belonging to institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life which wish to use the  missal for conventual or community celebration in their oratories may do so with letter  of  january  the pontifical council ecclesia dei responded positively to a question whether a parish priest pastor or another priest may on his own initiative publicly celebrate the extraordinary form along with the customary regular use of the new form so that the faithful both young and old can familiarize themselves with the old rites and benefit from their perceptible beauty and transcendence although the council accompanied this response with the observation that a stable group of the faithful attached to the older form has a right to assist at mass in the extraordinary form a website that published the response interpreted it as not requiring the existence of such a stable group present practiceedit the publication of summorum pontificum has led to an increase in the number of regularly scheduled public tridentine masses on  june  cardinal darío castrillón hoyos told a london press conference that pope benedict wants every parish to offer both the old and the new forms for sunday mass the cardinal said that the vatican was preparing to instruct seminaries to teach all students the tridentine form of the roman rite the complexity of the rubrics makes it difficult for priests accustomed to the simpler modern form to celebrate the tridentine form properly and it is unclear how many have the required knowledge some traditionalist catholic priests and organisations holding that no official permission is required to use any form of the tridentine mass celebrate it without regularizing their situation and sometimes using editions of the roman missal earlier than the  edition approved in summorum pontificum in order to provide for priests who celebrate the tridentine mass publishers have issued facsimiles or reprintings of old

for the forms of the mass liturgy prior to  see pretridentine mass elevation of the chalice after the consecration during a solemn mass the tridentine mass now officially often referred to as the extraordinary form of the roman rite extraordinary form for short latin forma extraordinaria is the roman rite mass which appears in typical editions of the roman missal published from  to  the most widely used mass liturgy in the world until the introduction of the mass of paul vi in  it is celebrated in ecclesiastical latin tridentine is derived from the latin tridentinus related to the city of tridentum modernday trent italy in response to a decision of the council of trent pope pius v promulgated the  roman missal making it mandatory throughout the latin church except in places and religious orders with missals from before  despite being often described as the traditional latin mass the mass of paul vi the novus ordo missae that replaced it as the ordinary form of the roman rite has its official text in latin and is sometimes celebrated in that language in  pope benedict xvi issued the motu proprio summorum pontificum accompanied by a letter to the worlds bishops authorizing use of the tridentine mass and ritual for competent priests the pope stated that the  edition of the roman missal is to be considered an extraordinary form forma extraordinaria of the roman rite of which the  mass of paul vi is the ordinary normal or standard form since that is the only authorized extraordinary form some refer to the  tridentine mass as the extraordinary form of the mass the  tridentine mass is sometimes referred to as the usus antiquior older use or forma antiquior older form to differentiate it from the mass of paul vi again in the sense of being the only one of the older forms for which authorization has been granted in masses celebrated without the people latin rite catholic priests are free to use either the  tridentine missal or the ordinary form missal these masses may—observing all the norms of law—also be attended by faithful who of their own free will ask to be admitted permission to use the tridentine mass as parish liturgies may be given by the

missals  texts of parts of the tridentine missal post  history  comparison with nonroman western rites and uses  media  directories of latin masses languageedit in most countries the language used for celebrating the tridentine mass was and is latin however in dalmatia and parts of istria in croatia the liturgy was celebrated in church slavonic and authorisation for use of this language was extended to some other slavic regions between  and  after the publication of the  edition of the roman missal the  instruction on implementing the constitution on sacred liturgy of the second vatican council laid down that normally the epistle and gospel from the mass of the day shall be read in the vernacular episcopal conferences were to decide with the consent of the holy see what other parts if any of the mass were to be celebrated in the vernacular outside the roman catholic church the vernacular language was introduced into the celebration of the tridentine mass by some old catholics and anglocatholics with the introduction of the english missal some western rite orthodox christians particularly in the antiochian orthodox archdiocese of north america use the tridentine mass in the vernacular with minor alterations under the title of the divine liturgy of st gregory most old catholics use the tridentine mass either in the vernacular or in latin terminologyedit a pre roman rite high altar decorated with reredos and fixed on a three step platform at which the prayers at the foot of the altar are said leaning against the tabernacle and two of the candlesticks are altar cards to remind the celebrant of the words when he is away from the missal the catholic church uses the term extraordinary form of the roman rite mass among other terms the most widespread term for the rite other than tridentine mass is latin mass likewise the ordinary form of the roman rite mass was promulgated in latin and can be celebrated in that language occasionally the term gregorian rite is used when talking about the tridentine massdiscuss as is more frequently tridentine rite pope benedict xvi declared it inappropriate to speak of the versions of the roman missal of before and after  as if they were two rites rather he said it is a matter of a twofold use of one and the same rite traditionalist catholics whose bestknown characteristic is an attachment to the tridentine mass frequently refer to it as the traditional mass or the traditional latin mass they describe as a codifying of the form of the mass the preparation of pius vs edition of the roman missal of which he said that the experts to whom he had entrusted the work collated the existing text with ancient manuscripts and writings restored it to the original form and rite of the holy fathers and further emended it to distinguish this form of mass from the mass of paul vi traditionalist catholics sometimes call it the mass of the ages and say that it comes down to us from the church of the apostles and ultimately indeed from him who is its principal priest and its spotless victim pope st pius vs revision of the liturgyedit at the time of the council of trent the traditions preserved in printed and manuscript missals varied considerably and standardization was sought both within individual dioceses and throughout the latin west standardization was required also in order to prevent the introduction into the liturgy of protestant ideas in the wake of the protestant reformation pope st pius v accordingly imposed uniformity by law in  with the papal bull quo primum ordering use of the roman missal as revised by him he allowed only those rites that were at least  years old to survive the promulgation of his  missal several of the rites that remained in existence were progressively abandoned though the ambrosian rite survives in milan italy and neighbouring areas stretching even into switzerland and the mozarabic rite remains in use to a limited extent in toledo and madrid spain the carmelite carthusian and dominican religious orders kept their rites but in the second half of the th century two of these three chose to adopt the roman rite the rite of braga in northern portugal seems to have been practically abandoned since  november  that archdiocese authorizes its use only on an optional basis beginning in the late th century france and neighbouring areas such as münster cologne and trier in germany saw a flurry of independent missals published by bishops influenced by jansenism and gallicanism this ended when abbot guéranger and others initiated in the th century a campaign to return to the roman missal pius vs revision of the liturgy had as one of its declared aims the restoration of the roman missal to the original form and rite of the holy fathers due to the relatively limited resources available to his scholars this aim was in fact not realised three different printings of pius vs roman missal with minor variations appeared in  a folio and a quarto edition in rome and a folio edition in venice a reproduction of what is considered to be the earliest referred to therefore as the editio princeps was produced in  in the course of the printing of the editio princeps some corrections were made by pasting revised texts over parts of the already printed pages there were several printings again in the following year  with various corrections of the text historical variationsedit missale romanum in croatian glagolitic script printed in  in the apostolic constitution papal bull quo primum with which he prescribed use of his  edition of the roman missal pius v decreed we order and enjoin that nothing must be added to our recently published missal nothing omitted from it nor anything whatsoever be changed within it this of course did not exclude changes by a pope and pope pius v himself added to the missal the feast of our lady of victory to celebrate the victory of lepanto of  october  his immediate successor pope gregory xiii changed the name of this feast to the most holy rosary of the blessed virgin mary and pope john xxiii changed it to our lady of the rosary pius vs work in severely reducing the number of feasts in the roman calendar see this comparison was very soon further undone by his successors feasts that he had abolished such as those of the presentation of mary saint anne and saint anthony of padua were restored even before clement viiis  typical edition of the missal was issued in the course of the following centuries new feasts were repeatedly added and the ranks of certain feasts were raised or lowered a comparison between pope pius vs tridentine calendar and the general roman calendar of  shows the changes made from  to  pope pius xii made a general revision in  and pope john xxiii made further general revisions in  simplifying the terminology concerning the ranking of liturgical celebrations while keeping on  december what he called the feast of the conception of blessed mary omitting the word immaculate pius v suppressed the existing special mass for the feast directing that the mass for the nativity of mary with the word nativity replaced by conception be used instead part of that earlier mass was revived in the mass that pope pius ix ordered to be used on the feast typical editions of the roman missaledit altar of santa cecilia in trastevere as arranged in  one of many churches in rome whose altar placed at the western end of the church was positioned so that the priest necessarily faced east and so towards the people when celebrating mass in addition to such occasional changes the roman missal was subjected to general revisions whenever a new typical edition an official edition whose text was to be reproduced in printings by all publishers was issued after pius vs original tridentine roman missal the first new typical edition was promulgated in  by pope clement viii who in  had issued a revised edition of the vulgate the bible texts in the missal of pope pius v did not correspond exactly to the new vulgate and so clement edited and revised pope pius vs missal making alterations both in the scriptural texts and in other matters he abolished some prayers that the  missal obliged the priest to say on entering the church shortened the two prayers to be said after the confiteor directed that the words haec quotiescumque feceritis in meam memoriam facietis do this in memory of me should not be said while displaying the chalice to the people after the consecration but before doing so inserted directions at several points of the canon that the priest was to pronounce the words inaudibly suppressed the rule that at high mass the priest even if not a bishop was to give the final blessing with three signs of the cross and rewrote the rubrics introducing for instance the ringing of a small bell the next typical edition was issued in  when pope urban viii made another general revision of the roman missal there was no further typical edition until that of pope leo xiii in  it introduced only minor changes not profound enough to merit having the papal bull of its promulgation included in the missal as the bulls of  and  were in  with the bull divino afflatu pope pius x made significant changes in the rubrics he died in  so it fell to his successor pope benedict xv to issue a new typical edition incorporating his changes this  edition included a new section headed additions and changes in the rubrics of the missal in accordance with the bull divino afflatu and the subsequent decrees of the sacred congregation of rites this additional section was almost as long as the previous section on the general rubrics of the missal which continued to be printed unchanged pope pius xii radically revised the palm sunday and easter triduum liturgy suppressed many vigils and octaves and made other alterations in the calendar see general roman calendar of pope pius xii reforms that were completed in pope john xxiiis  code of rubrics which were incorporated in the final  typical edition of the tridentine missal replacing both pius xs additions and changes in the rubrics of the missal and the earlier general rubrics of the missal changes made to the liturgy in  and  in the wake of decisions of the second vatican council were not incorporated in the roman missal but were reflected in the provisional vernacular translations produced when the language of the people began to be used in addition to latin this explains the references sometimes seen to the  missal the general roman calendar was revised partially in  and  and completely in  in pope paul vis motu proprio mysterii paschalis again reducing the number of feasts  missaledit the roman missal issued by pope john xxiii in  differed from earlier editions in a number of ways it incorporated the change made by john xxiii in  when he inserted into the canon of the mass the name of saint joseph the first change for centuries in the canon of the mass it incorporated major changes that pope pius xii made in  in the liturgy of palm sunday and the easter triduum these included abolition of the ceremonies whereby the blessing of palms on palm sunday resembled a mass with epistle gospel preface and sanctus suppression of the knocking three times on the closed doors before returning to the church after the blessing and distribution of the palms omission of the prayers at the foot of the altar and of the last gospel on holy thursday the washing of feet was incorporated into the mass instead of being an independent ceremony if done by a bishop  men not  had their feet washed the mass itself was said in the evening instead of the morning and some of its prayers were removed or altered on good friday elements that suggested the usual practices of the mass were removed the sacred ministers began the liturgy in alb and for celebrant and deacon black stoles rather than respectively in black chasuble dalmatic and tunicle as per a typical mass the sacred ministers donned their vestments without maniples only for the solemn intercessions in which the celebrant wore a cope instead of a chasuble and removed them for the adoration of the cross the sacred ministers changed to violet vestments again without maniples for the distribution of holy communion let us pray let us kneel arise was added at the prayer for the jews and the adjective perfidis was removed see good friday prayer for the jews an afternoon communion service replaced the morning mass of the presanctified at which the priest alone received the earlierconsecrated host and drank unconsecrated wine into which a small portion of the consecrated host had been put the easter vigil was moved from holy saturday morning to the following nighttime the use of a triple candle was abolished and other changes were made both to the initial ceremonies centred on the paschal candle and to other parts such as the reduction from twelve to four of the prophecies read and the introduction of a renewal of baptismal promises for the laity notable for being the first time since the codification of the missal of pope pius v that the vernacular was permitted to be used in such a manner it incorporated the rubrical changes made by pope pius xiis  decree cum nostra which included vigils were abolished except those of easter christmas ascension pentecost saints peter and paul saint john the baptist and saint lawrence all octaves were abolished except those of easter christmas and pentecost no more than three collects were to be said at low mass and one at solemn mass its calendar incorporated both the changes made by pope pius xii in  general roman calendar of pope pius xii and those introduced by pope john xxiii himself with his  code of rubrics general roman calendar of  these included suppression of the solemnity of saint joseph spouse of the blessed virgin mary wednesday after the second sunday after easter and its replacement by the feast of saint joseph the worker  may removal of some duplicate feasts that appeared twice in earlier versions of the calendar namely the chair of saint peter at rome  january the finding of the holy cross  may saint john before the latin gate  may the apparition of saint michael  may saint peter in chains  august and the invention of the relics of saint stephen  august addition of feasts

catechumens those being instructed in the faith were once dismissed after the first half not having yet professed the faith profession of faith was considered essential for participation in the eucharistic sacrifice this rule of the didache is still in effect it is only one of the three conditions baptism right faith and right living for admission to receiving holy communion that the catholic church has always applied and that were already mentioned in the early nd century by saint justin martyr and this food is called among us the eucharist of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins and unto regeneration and who is so living as christ has

that the priest vested in a cope of the color of the day while the choir sings an antiphon and a verse of psalm  or  sprinkles with the holy water the altar three times and then the clergy and the congregation this rite if used precedes the prayers at the foot of the altar during the easter season the asperges me verse is replaced by the vidi aquam verse and alleluia is added to the ostende

the altar the sequence of prayers at the foot of the altar is sign of the cross the priest after processing in—at solemn mass with deacon and subdeacon master of ceremonies and servers and at other masses with one or more servers—and at low mass placing the veiled chalice on the centre of the altar makes the sign of the cross at the foot of the altar at solemn mass the chalice is placed beforehand on the credence table psalm  psalm  mt ie masoretic numbering known by its incipit iudica me is recited except in masses of the season during passiontide and in requiem masses it is preceded and followed by an antiphon of psalm   mt introibo ad altare dei ad deum qui lætificat iuventutem meam translation i shall go in to the altar of god the god who gives joy to my youth is recited by the priest alternating with the deacon and subdeacon if present or servers psalm  is recited priest makes the sign of the cross our help is in the name of the lord servers who made heaven and earth the double form of a prayer of general confession of sins known by its incipit confiteor i confess is recited priest while bowing low confíteor deo omnipoténti beátæ maríæ semper vírgini beáto michaéli archángelo beáto ioanni baptístæ sanctis apóstolis petro et paulo ómnibus sanctis et vobis fratres tibi pater quia peccávi nimis cogitatióne verbo et ópere while striking the breast three times mea culpa mea culpa mea máxima culpa ideo precor beátam maríam semper vírginem beátum michaélem archángelum beátum ioánnem baptístam sanctos apóstolos petrum et paulum omnes sanctos et vos fratres te pater oráre pro me ad dóminum deum nostrum translation i confess to almighty god to blessed mary ever virgin to blessed michael the archangel to blessed john the baptist to the holy apostles peter and paul to all the saints and to you brethren that i have sinned exceedingly in thought word and deed through my fault through my fault through my most grievous fault therefore i beseech blessed mary ever virgin  and you brethren to pray to the lord our god for me the servers pray for the priest may almighty god have mercy on thee forgive thee thy sins and bring thee to life everlasting then it is the ministers or servers turn to confess sinfulness and to ask for prayers they use the same words as those used by the priest except that they say you father in place of you brethren and the priest responds with the same prayer that the servers have used for him but using the plural number plus an extra prayer some verses are then said by priest and ministers or servers ending with the priest saying oremus te domine let us pray after this he ascends to the altar praying silently take away from us our iniquities that with pure minds we may worthily enter into the holy of holies a reference to exodus   kings   kings   chronicles  ezekiel  and others he places his joined hands on the edge of the altar so that only the tips of the small fingers touch the front of it and silently prays that by the merits of the saints whose relics are in the altar god may pardon all his sins at the words quorum relíquiæ hic sunt whose relics are here he spreads his hands and kisses the altar priest at the altaredit dominus vobiscum the lord be with you before the collect in the tridentine mass the priest should keep his eyes downcast at this point introit the priest again makes the sign of the cross while he begins to read the introit which is usually taken from a psalm exceptions occur eg the introit for easter sunday is adapted from wis  and the antiphon in masses of the blessed virgin mary was from the poet sedulius this evolved from the practice of singing a full psalm interspersed with the antiphon during the entrance of the clergy before the prayers at the foot of the altar were added to the mass in medieval times this is indicated by the very name of introit kyrie this part of mass is a linguistic marker of the origins of the roman liturgy in greek kyrie eleison christe eleison kyrie eleison means lord have mercy christ have mercy each phrase is said or sung three times gloria in excelsis deo the first line of the gloria is taken from lk  the gloria is omitted during the penitential liturgical seasons of advent septuagesima lent and passiontide in which violet vestments are worn but is used on feasts falling during such seasons as well as on holy thursday it is always omitted for a requiem mass the collect the priest turns toward the people and says dominus vobiscum the servers respond et cum spiritu tuo the lord be with you and with thy spirit the collect follows a prayer not drawn directly from scripture it tends to reflect the season instructionedit the priest reads the epistle primarily an extract from the letters of st paul to various churches in his motu proprio summorum pontificum pope benedict xvi has permitted this to be read in the vernacular language when mass is celebrated with the people between the epistle and the gospel two rarely three choir responses are sung or said usually these are a gradual followed by an alleluia but between septuagesima sunday and holy saturday or in a requiem mass or other penitential mass the alleluia is replaced by a tract and between easter sunday and pentecost the gradual is replaced by a second alleluia on a few exceptional occasions most notably easter pentecost corpus christi and in a requiem mass a sequence follows the alleluia or tract the gradual is partly composed of a portion of a psalm the gospel reading an extract from one of the four gospels before the reading or chanting of the gospel the priest prays cleanse my heart and my lips o almighty god who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet isaias a reference to isaiah  in this passage after being cleansed by the angel isaiah was instructed to prophesy the homily the rite of mass as revised by pope pius v the tridentine mass does not consider a sermon obligatory and speaks of it instead as merely optional it presumes that the creed if it is to be said will follow the gospel immediately but adds if however someone is to preach the homilist after the gospel has been finished preaches and when the sermon or moral address has been completed the credo is said or if it is not to be said the offertory is sung by contrast the roman missal as revised by pope paul vi declares that the homily may not be omitted without a grave reason from mass celebrated with the people attending on sundays and holy days of obligation and that it is recommended on other days the creed this is the nicene creed professing faith in god the father in god the son the word made flesh in god the holy ghost and in the holy church at the mention of the incarnation the celebrant and the congregation genuflect mass of the faithfuledit the second part is the mass of the faithful offertoryedit offertory verse after greeting the people once more dominus vobiscumet cum spiritu tuo and giving the invitation to pray oremus the priest enters upon the mass of the faithful from which the nonbaptized were once excluded he reads the offertory verse a short quotation from holy scripture which varies with the mass of each day with hands joined offering of bread and wine the priest offers the host holding it on the paten at breast level and praying that although he is unworthy god may accept this spotless host or victim the basic meaning of hostia in latin for his own innumerable sins offences and neglects for all those present and for all faithful christians living and dead that it may avail unto salvation of himself and those mentioned he then mixes a few drops of water with the wine which will later become the blood of jesus and holding the chalice so that the lip of the chalice is about the height of his lips offers the chalice of salvation asking that it may ascend with a sweet fragrance he then prays a prayer of contrition adapted from dan  incensing of the offerings and of the faithful at a high mass the priest blesses the incense then incenses the bread and wine among the prayers the priest says is psalm  let my prayer o lord be directed as incense in thy sight which is prayed as he incenses the altar the priest then gives the thurible to the deacon who incenses the priest then the other ministers and the congregation washing the hands the priest prays psalm  i will wash my hands among the innocent prayer to the most holy trinity this prayer asks that the divine trinity may receive the oblation being made in remembrance of the passion resurrection and ascension of jesus and in honour of blessed mary ever virgin and the other saints that it may avail to their honour and our salvation and that they may vouchsafe to intercede for us in heaven orate fratres suscipiat and secret amen concludes offertory here the priest turns to the congregation and says the first two words orate fratres in an elevated tone and then turns around while finishing the exhortation in the secret tone pray brethren that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to god the father almighty the altar servers respond with the suscipiat to which the priest secretly responds amen suscipiat dominus sacrificium de manibus tuis ad laudem et gloriam nominis sui ad utilitatem quoque nostram totiusque ecclesiæ suae sanctæ a translation in the english is may the lord accept this sacrifice at your hands to the praise and glory of his name for our good and the good of all his holy church the priest then says the days secret inaudibly and concludes it with per omnia sæcula sæculorum aloud the altar servers and in dialogue mass the congregation respond amen consecrationedit preface of the canon the roman canon dates in essentials from before st gregory the great who died in  and who is credited with adding a phrase to it see history of the roman canon it contains the main elements found in almost all rites but in an unusual arrangement and it is unclear which part should be considered to be the epiclesis dominus vobiscum et cum spiritu tuo sursum corda habemus ad dominum gratias agamus domino deo nostro dignum et iustum est the first part can be seen above at the collect the rest means lift up your hearts we lift them up to the lord let us give thanks to the lord our god it is right and just next a preface is prayed indicating specific reasons for giving thanks to god this leads to the sanctus canon or rule of consecration intercession corresponding to the reading of the diptychs in the byzantine rite—a diptych is a twoleaf painting carving or writing tablet here the priest prays for the living that god may guard unite and govern the church together with the pope and all those who holding to the truth hand on the catholic and apostolic faith then specific living people are mentioned and the congregation in the church next mary ever virgin saint joseph the apostles and some popes and other martyrs are mentioned by name as well as a generic and all your saints in communion with whom prayer is offered prayers preparatory to the consecration a prayer that god may graciously accept the offering and command that we be delivered from eternal damnation and counted among the flock of those you have chosen consecration transubstantiation and major elevation elevation of the chalice during the canon of the mass at a solemn mass the passage lk  is key in this section in summa theologiae iii   thomas aquinas addresses the interspersed phrase the mystery of faith on this phrase see mysterium fidei oblation of the victim to god an oblation is an offering the pure holy spotless victim is now offered with a prayer that god may accept the offering and command his holy angel to carry the offering to gods altar on high so that those who receive the body and blood of christ may be filled with every grace and heavenly blessing remembrance of the dead the priest now prays for the dead those who have gone before us with the sign of faith and rest in the sleep of peace and asks that they be granted a place of refreshment light and peace this is followed by a prayer that we be granted fellowship with the saints john the baptist and fourteen martyrs seven men and seven women are mentioned by name end of the canon and doxology with minor elevation the concluding doxology is through him and with him and in him o god almighty father in the unity of the holy spirit all glory and honour is yours for ever and ever amen ratifies the canon prayer elevation candleedit beuron art school representation of an elevation candle mistakenly placed at the gospel side and upon the altar until  the tridentine form of the roman missal laid down that a candle should be placed at the epistle side of the altar and that it should be lit at the showing of the consecrated sacrament to the people in practice except in monasteries and on special occasions this had fallen out of use long before pope john xxiii replaced the section on the general rubrics of the roman missal with his code of rubrics which no longer mentioned this custom on this see elevation candle communionedit before receiving communion from the chalice the priest makes the sign of the cross over himself saying in latin may the blood of our lord jesus christ keep my soul for eternal life amen the lords prayer and libera nos the libera nos is an extension of the lords prayer developing the line sed libera nos a malo but deliver us from evil the priest prays that we may be delivered from all evils and that the virgin mary mother of god together with the apostles and saints may intercede to obtain for us peace in our day fraction of the host during the preceding prayer the priest breaks the consecrated host into three parts and after concluding the prayer drops the smallest part into the chalice while praying that this commingling and consecration of the body and blood of christ may be to us who receive it effectual to life everlasting agnus dei agnus dei means lamb of god the priest then prays lamb of god who takest away the sins of the world have mercy on us he repeats this and then adds lamb of god who takest away the sins of the world grant us peace the mass of the last supper on holy thursday has have mercy on us all three times in requiem masses the petitions are grant them rest twice followed by grant them eternal rest the pax the priest asks christ to look not at the priests sins but at the faith of christs church and prays for peace and unity within the church then if a high mass is being celebrated he gives the sign of peace to the deacon saying peace be with you prayers preparatory to the communion in the first of these two prayers for himself the priests asks that by holy communion he may be freed from all his iniquities and evils be made to adhere to the commandments of jesus and never be separated from him in the second he asks let not the partaking of thy body o lord jesus christturn to my judgment and condemnation but through thy goodness may it be unto me a safeguard receiving of the body and blood of our lord the priest quietly says several prayers here before receiving communion the first is said in a low voice while taking up the host onto the paten the second of them spoken three times in a slightly audible voice while the priest holds the host in his left hand and strikes his breast with his right is based on matthew  lord i am not worthy then after having reverently consumed the host he takes up the chalice while in a low voice reciting psalm  what shall i render to the lord for all the things he hath rendered unto me i will take the chalice of salvation and i will call upon the name of the lord immediately adding psalm  praising i will call upon the lord and i shall be saved from my enemies priest on the ecce agnus dei  behold the lamb of god in the people communion if the priest is to give communion to others he holds up a small host and says aloud behold the lamb of god  and three times lord i am not worthy  he then gives communion first making with the host the sign of the cross over each communicant while saying may the body of our lord jesus christ preserve your soul for eternal life amen conclusionedit ite missa est sung by the deacon at a solemn mass prayers during the ablutions the prayers now focus on what has been received that we may receive with a pure mind that no stain of sin may remain in me whom these pure and holy sacraments have refreshed communion antiphon and postcommunion the communion antiphon is normally a portion of a psalm the postcommunion prayer is akin to the collect in being an appropriate prayer not directly drawn from scripture ite missa est blessing go it is the dismissal the word mass derives from this phrase after saying a silent prayer for himself the priest then gives the people his blessing prior to the revisions of pope pius xii and pope john xxiii the ite missa est was replaced with benedicamus domino let us bless the lord on days in which the gloria was not said and the rubrics required the priest to wear violet vestments ie masses of the season during advent septuagesima lent and passiontide vigils certain votive masses in the  missal benedicamus domino is said only when the mass is followed by another liturgical action such as the eucharistic processions on holy thursday and corpus christi in requiem masses the ite missa est is replaced with requiescant in pace with the response being amen instead of deo gratias the last gospel the priest then reads the last gospel the beginning of the gospel of john john  which recounts the incarnation of the son of god on certain occasions as for instance at the day mass on christmas day another gospel passage was read instead because that gospel is read as the gospel of the mass but pope john xxiiis revision of the rubrics decreed that on those and on other occasions the last gospel should simply be omitted prayers of the priest before and after massedit the tridentine missal includes prayers for the priest to say before and after mass in later editions of the roman missal including that of  the introductory heading of these prayers indicates that they are to be recited pro opportunitate as circumstances allow which in practice means that they are merely optional and may be omitted the original tridentine missal presents most of the prayers as obligatory indicating as optional only a very long prayer attributed to saint ambrose which later editions divide into seven sections each to be recited on only one day of the week and two other prayers attributed to saint ambrose and saint thomas aquinas respectively in addition to these three prayers the original tridentine missal proposes for the priest to recite before he celebrates mass the whole of psalms –   the numbering is that of the septuagint and vulgate and a series of collectstyle prayers later editions add after the three that in the original missal are only optional prayers to the blessed virgin saint joseph all the angels and saints and the saint whose mass is to be celebrated but as has been said treats as optional all the prayers before mass even those originally given as obligatory the original tridentine missal proposes for recitation by the priest after mass three prayers including the adoro te devote later editions place before these three the canticle of the three youths dan with three collects and follow them with the anima christi and seven more prayers treating as optional even the three prescribed in the original tridentine missal leonine prayersedit from  to  the holy see prescribed the recitation after low mass of certain prayers originally for the solution of the roman question and after this problem was solved by the lateran treaty to permit tranquillity and freedom to profess the faith to be restored to the afflicted people of russia these prayers are known as the leonine prayers because it was pope leo xiii who on  january  ordered their recitation throughout the world in what had been the papal states they were already in use since  the prayers comprised three ave marias one salve regina followed by a versicle and response and a collect prayer that from  on asked for the conversion of sinners and the freedom and exaltation of holy mother the church and again from  on a prayer to saint michael in  pope pius x added a thricerepeated most sacred heart of jesus have mercy on us in  with effect from  march  the holy see ended the obligation to recite the leonine prayers after low mass however the leonine prayers are sometimes still recited after presentday celebrations of tridentine mass although they are not included even in the  edition of the tridentine missal participation by the peopleedit nuptial low mass distribution of communion at a tridentine mass typically the faithful kneel and receive in the mouth and women wear a headcovering the participation of the congregation at the tridentine mass is interior involving eye and heart and exterior by mouth except in the dialogue mass form which arose about  and led to a more active exterior participation of the congregation the people present at the tridentine mass do not recite out loud the prayers of the mass only the server or servers join with the priest in reciting the prayers at the foot of the altar which include the confiteor and in speaking the other responses most of the prayers that the priest says are spoken inaudibly including almost all the mass of the faithful the offertory prayers the canon of the mass except for the preface and the final doxology and apart from the agnus dei those between the lords prayer and the postcommunion at a solemn mass or missa cantata a choir sings the servers responses except for the prayers at the foot of the altar the choir sings the introit the kyrie the gloria the gradual the tract or alleluia the credo the offertory and communion antiphons the sanctus and the agnus dei of these only the five that form part of the ordinary of the mass are usually sung at a missa cantata in addition to the gregorian chant music for these polyphonic compositions exist some quite elaborate the priest largely says quietly the words of the chants and then recites other prayers while the choir continues the chant different levels of celebrationedit there are various forms of celebration of the tridentine mass pontifical high mass celebrated by a bishop accompanied by an assisting priest deacon subdeacon thurifer acolytes and other ministers under the guidance of a priest acting as master of ceremonies most often the specific parts assigned to deacon and subdeacon are performed by priests the parts that are said aloud are all chanted except that the prayers at the foot of the altar which before the reform of pope pius v were said in the sacristy are said quietly by the bishop with the deacon and the subdeacon while the choir sings the introit the main difference between a pontifical and an ordinary high mass is that the bishop remains at his throne almost all the time until the offertory solemn or high mass latin missa solemnis offered by a priest accompanied by a deacon and subdeacon and the other ministers mentioned above missa cantata latin for sung mass celebrated by a priest without deacon and subdeacon and thus a form of low mass but with some parts the three variable prayers the scripture readings preface pater noster and ite missa est sung by the priest and other parts introit kyrie gloria gradual tract or alleluia credo offertory antiphon sanctus and benedictus agnus dei and communion antiphon sung by the choir incense may be used exactly as at a solemn mass with the exception of incensing the celebrant after the gospel which is not done low mass the priest sings no part of the mass though in some places a choir or the congregation sings during the mass hymns not always directly related to the mass in its article the liturgy of the mass the  catholic encyclopedia describes how when concelebration ceased to be practised in western europe low mass became distinguished from high mass the separate celebrations then involved the building of many altars in one church and the reduction of the ritual to the simplest possible form the deacon and subdeacon were in this case dispensed with the celebrant took their part as well as his own one server took the part of the choir and of all the other ministers everything was said instead of being sung the incense and kiss of peace were omitted so we have the wellknown rite of low mass missa privata this then reacted on high mass missa solemnis so that at high mass too the celebrant himself recites everything even though it be sung by the deacon subdeacon or choir on the origin of the missa cantata the same source gives the following information  high mass is the norm it is only in the complete rite with deacon and subdeacon that the ceremonies can be understood thus the rubrics of the ordinary of the mass always suppose that the mass is high low mass said by a priest alone with one server is a shortened and simplified form of the same thing its ritual can be explained only by a reference to high mass for instance the celebrant goes over to the north side of the altar to read the gospel because that is the side to which the deacon goes in procession at high mass he turns round always by the right because at high mass he should not turn his back to the deacon and so on a sung mass missa cantata is a modern compromise it is really a low mass since the essence of high mass is not the music but the deacon and subdeacon only in churches which have no ordained person except one priest and in which high mass is thus impossible is it allowed to celebrate the mass on sundays and feasts with most of the adornment borrowed from high mass with singing and generally with incense revision of the roman missaledit pius xii began in earnest the work of revising the roman missal with a thorough revision of the rites of holy week which after an experimental period beginning in  was made obligatory in  the mass that used to be said on holy thursday morning was moved to the evening necessitating a change in the rule that previously had required fasting from midnight the good friday service was moved to the afternoon holy communion was no longer reserved for the priest alone as before hosts consecrated at the holy thursday mass were used and the priest no longer received part of the host in unconsecrated wine the easter vigil service that used to be held in morning of holy saturday was moved to the night that leads to easter sunday and many changes were made to the content in  pope john xxiii – ordered the suppression of the word perfidis unbelieving ie not believing in jesus applied to the jews in the rites for good friday he revised the rubrics to the order of mass and the breviary two years later in  he made some more minor modifications on the occasion of publishing a new typical edition of the roman missal this is the edition authorized for use by virtue of the quattuor abhinc annos indult see below under present status of the tridentine mass among the other changes he made and that were included in the  missal were adding st josephs name to the roman canon eliminating the second confiteor before communion suppressing  feasts such as st peters chair in rome or more accurately combining both feasts of st peters chair into one as they originally had been incorporating the abolition of  festal octaves and  vigils of feasts and other changes made by pope pius xii and modifying rubrics especially for solemn high masses among the names that disappeared from the roman missal was that of st philomena her liturgical celebration had never been admitted to the general roman calendar but from  it had been included with an indication that the mass was to be taken entirely from the common in the section headed masses for some places ie only those places for which it had been specially authorized but her name had already in  been ordered to be removed from all liturgical calendars on  december  the second vatican council decreed in chapter ii of its constitution on the sacred liturgy sacrosanctum concilium the rite of the mass is to be revised  the rites are to be simplified due care being taken to preserve their substance parts which with the passage of time came to be duplicated or were added with little advantage are to be omitted other parts which suffered loss through accidents of history are to be restored to the vigor they had in the days of the holy fathers as may seem useful or necessary the treasures of the bible are to be opened up more lavishly so that a richer fare may be provided for the faithful at the table of god’s word  a suitable place may be allotted to the vernacular in masses which are celebrated with the people  communion under both kinds may be granted when the bishops think fitas for instance to the newly ordained in the mass of their sacred ordination to the newly professed in the mass of their religious profession and to the newly baptized in the mass which follows their baptism the instruction inter oecumenici of  september  initiated the application to the mass of the decisions that the council had taken less than a year before permission was given for use only in mass celebrated with the people of the vernacular language especially in the biblical readings and the reintroduced prayers of the faithful but until the whole of the ordinary of the mass has been revised in the chants kyrie gloria creed sanctus agnus dei and the entrance offertory and communion antiphons and in the parts that involved dialogue with the people and in the our father which the people could now recite entirely together with the priest most episcopal conferences quickly approved interim vernacular translations generally different from country to country and after having them confirmed by the holy see published them in  other changes included the omission of psalm   at the start of mass and the last gospel at the end both of which pope pius v had first inserted into the missal having previously been private prayers said by the priest in the sacristy and the leonine prayers of pope leo xiii the canon of the mass which continued to be recited silently was kept in latin three years later the instruction tres abhinc annos of  may  gave permission for use of the vernacular even in the canon of the mass and allowed it to be said audibly and even in part to be chanted the vernacular could be used even at mass celebrated without the people being present use of the maniple was made optional and at three ceremonies at which the cope was previously the obligatory vestment the chasuble could be used instead pope paul vi continued implementation of the councils directives ordering with apostolic constitution missale romanum of holy thursday  april  publication of a new official edition of the roman missal which appeared in latin in  opposition to the latest revisions of the liturgyedit some traditionalist catholics reject to a greater or lesser extent the changes made since  see traditionalist catholic none advocate returning to the original  form of the liturgy though some may perhaps wish a reestablishment of its form before pius xs revision of the rubrics in  some do refuse to accept the  changes in the liturgy of palm sunday and the easter triduum and in the liturgical calendar see general roman calendar of pope pius xii and instead use the general roman calendar as in  others accept the  changes by pius xii but not those of pope john xxiii others again in accordance with the authorization granted by pope benedict xvi in summorum pontificum use the missal and calendar as it was in  some of them argue that unlike earlier reforms the revision of  which replaced the tridentine mass with the mass of pope paul vi represented a major break with the past they consider that the content of the revised liturgy is in catholic terms seriously deficient and defective some hold that it is displeasing to god and that no catholic should attend it when a preliminary text of two of the sections of the revised missal was published in  archbishop marcel lefebvre gathered a group of twelve theologians who under his direction wrote a study of the text they stated that it represents both as a whole and in its details a striking departure from the catholic theology of the mass as it was formulated in session  of the council of trent cardinal alfredo ottaviani a former prefect of the sacred congregation for the doctrine of the faith supported this study with a letter of  september  to pope paul vi cardinal antonio bacci signed the same letter the critical study became known as the ottaviani intervention cardinal ottaviani subsequently stated in writing that he had not intended his letter to be made public and that pope paul vis doctrinal exposition on  november and  november  of the revised liturgy in its definitive form meant that no one can be genuinely scandalised any more jean madiran a critic of vatican ii and foundereditor of the french journal itinéraires claimed that this letter was fraudulently presented to the elderly and already blind cardinal for his signature by his secretary monsignor and future cardinal gilberto agustoni and that agustoni resigned shortly afterwards this allegation remains unproven and madiran himself was not an eyewitness of the alleged deception in october  a meeting of the synod of bishops had already given its opinion on a still earlier draft of the  members  approved it as it stood  approved it but suggested various modifications  abstained and  voted against from the s onwards western countries have experienced a drop in mass attendance in the united states from  of catholics attending in  to  attending by  these same countries saw a decline in seminary enrollments and in the number of priests in the united states from  ordinations in  to  in  and a general erosion of belief in the doctrines of the catholic faith opponents of the revision of the mass liturgy argue citing opinion poll evidence in their support that the revision contributed to this decline others pointing among other considerations to the fact that globally there are more priests and seminarians now than in previous years in  there were  major seminarians worldwide in  there were  an increase of  at a time however when there was an increase of global population of  suggest that the apparent decline of catholic practice in the west is due to the general influence of secularism and liberalism on western societies rather than to developments within the catholic church attitudes of popes since the second vatican counciledit pope paul viedit following the introduction of the mass of paul vi in  the holy see granted a significant number of permissions for the use of the former liturgy for example elderly priests were not required to switch to celebrating the new form in england and wales occasional celebrations of the tridentine mass were allowed in virtue of what became known as the agatha christie indult however there was no general worldwide legal framework allowing for the celebration of the rite following the rise of the traditionalist catholic movement in the s pope paul vi reportedly declined to liberalise its use further on the grounds that it had become a politically charged symbol associated with opposition to his policies pope john paul iiedit in  the holy see sent a letter known as quattuor abhinc annos to the presidents of the worlds episcopal conferences this document empowered diocesan bishops to authorise on certain conditions celebrations of the tridentine mass for priests and laypeople who requested them in  following the excommunication of archbishop marcel lefebvre and four bishops that he had consecrated the pope issued a further document a motu proprio known as ecclesia dei which stated that respect must everywhere be shown for the feelings of all those who are attached to the latin liturgical tradition the pope urged bishops to give a wide and generous application to the provisions of quattuor abhinc annos and established the pontifical commission ecclesia dei to oversee relations between rome and traditionalist catholics the holy see itself granted authorisation to use the tridentine mass to a significant number of priests and priestly societies such as the priestly fraternity of st peter the institute of christ the king sovereign priest and the personal apostolic administration of saint john mary vianney some diocesan bishops however declined to authorise celebrations within their dioceses or did so only to a limited extent in some cases the difficulty was that those seeking the permission were hostile to the church authorities other refusals of permission were alleged to have stemmed from certain bishops disapproval in principle of celebrations of the tridentine liturgy pope benedict xviedit as a cardinal joseph ratzinger was regarded as having a particular interest in the liturgy and as being favourable towards the older rite of mass he famously criticized the erratic way in which contrary to official policy many priests celebrated the revised rite in september  the pontifical commission ecclesia dei established the institute of the good shepherd made up of former members of the society of st pius x in bordeaux france with permission to use the tridentine liturgy this step was met with some discontent from french clergy and thirty priests wrote an open letter to the pope consistently with its previous policy the society of st pius x rejected the move following repeated rumours that the use of the tridentine mass would be liberalised the pope issued a motu proprio called summorum pontificum on  july  together with an accompanying letter to the worlds bishops the pope declared that the roman missal promulgated by paul vi is the ordinary expression of the lex orandi law of prayer of the catholic church of the latin rite nevertheless the roman missal promulgated by st pius v and reissued by st john xxiii is to be considered as an extraordinary expression of that same lex orandi he further stated that the  missal  was never juridically abrogated he replaced with new rules those of quattuor abhinc annos on use of the older form essentially authorization for using the  form for parish masses and those celebrated on public occasions such as a wedding is devolved from the local bishop to the priest in charge of a church and any priest of the latin rite may use the  roman missal in masses celebrated without the people a term that does not exclude attendance by other worshippers lay or clergy while requests by groups of catholics wishing to use the tridentine liturgy in parish masses are to be dealt with by the parish priest or the rector of the church rather than as before by the local bishop the pope and cardinal darío castrillón have stated that the bishops authority is not thereby undermined present regulationsedit the regulations set out in summorum pontificum provide that in masses celebrated without the people every latin rite priest may use either the  roman missal or that of paul vi except during the easter triduum when masses without participation by the people are no longer allowed celebrations of mass in this form formerly referred to as private masses may as before be attended by laypeople who ask to be admitted in parish masses where there is a stable group of laypeople who adhere to the earlier liturgical tradition the parish priest should willingly accept their requests to be allowed to celebrate the mass according to the  missal and should ensure that their welfare harmonises with the ordinary pastoral care of the parish under the guidance of the bishop in accordance with canon  of the code of canon law avoiding discord and favouring the unity of the church mass may be celebrated using the  missal on working days while on sundays and feast days one such celebration may be held for priests and laypeople who request it the parish priest should allow celebrations of the  form on special occasions such as weddings funerals and pilgrimages communities belonging to institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life which wish to use the  missal for conventual or community celebration in their oratories may do so with letter  of  january  the pontifical council ecclesia dei responded positively to a question whether a parish priest pastor or another priest may on his own initiative publicly celebrate the extraordinary form along with the customary regular use of the new form so that the faithful both young and old can familiarize themselves with the old rites and benefit from their perceptible beauty and transcendence although the council accompanied this response with the observation that a stable group of the faithful attached to the older form has a right to assist at mass in the extraordinary form a website that published the response interpreted it as not requiring the existence of such a stable group present practiceedit the publication of summorum pontificum has led to an increase in the number of regularly scheduled public tridentine masses on  june  cardinal darío castrillón hoyos told a london press conference that pope benedict wants every parish to offer both the old and the new forms for sunday mass the cardinal said that the vatican was preparing to instruct seminaries to teach all students the tridentine form of the roman rite the complexity of the rubrics makes it difficult for priests accustomed to the simpler modern form to celebrate the tridentine form properly and it is unclear how many have the required knowledge some traditionalist catholic priests and organisations holding that no official permission is required to use any form of the tridentine mass celebrate it without regularizing their situation and sometimes using editions of the roman missal earlier than the  edition approved in summorum pontificum in order to provide for priests who celebrate the tridentine mass publishers have issued facsimiles or reprintings of old missals there were two new printings of the  tridentine missal in  one with the imprimatur of bishop fabian bruskewitz of lincoln nebraska by baronius press in association with the priestly fraternity

widely used mass liturgy in the world until the introduction of the mass of paul vi in  it is celebrated in ecclesiastical latin tridentine is derived from the latin tridentinus related to the city of tridentum modernday trent italy in response to a decision of the council of trent pope pius v promulgated the  roman missal making it mandatory throughout the latin church except in places and religious orders with missals from before  despite being often described as the traditional latin mass the mass of paul vi the novus ordo missae that replaced it as the ordinary form of the roman rite has its official text in latin and is sometimes celebrated in that language in  pope benedict xvi issued the motu proprio summorum pontificum accompanied by a letter to the worlds bishops authorizing use of the tridentine mass and ritual for competent priests the pope stated that the  edition of the roman missal is to be considered an extraordinary form forma extraordinaria of the roman rite of which the  mass of paul vi is the ordinary normal or standard form since that is the only authorized extraordinary form some refer to the  tridentine mass as the extraordinary form of the mass the  tridentine mass is sometimes referred to as the usus antiquior older use or forma antiquior older form to differentiate it from the mass of paul vi again in the sense of being the only one of the older forms for which authorization has been granted in masses celebrated without the people latin rite catholic priests are free to use either the  tridentine missal or the ordinary form missal these masses may—observing all the norms of law—also be attended by faithful who of their own free will ask to be admitted permission to use the tridentine mass as parish liturgies may be given by the

celebrating the tridentine mass was and is latin however in dalmatia and parts of istria in croatia the liturgy was celebrated in church slavonic and authorisation for use of this language was extended to some other slavic regions between  and  after the publication of the  edition of the roman missal the  instruction on implementing the constitution on sacred liturgy of the second vatican council laid down that normally the epistle and gospel from the mass of the day shall be read in the vernacular episcopal conferences were to decide with the consent of the holy see what other parts if any of the mass were to be celebrated in the vernacular outside the roman catholic church the vernacular language was introduced into the celebration of the tridentine mass by some old catholics and anglocatholics with the introduction of the english missal some western rite orthodox christians particularly in the antiochian orthodox archdiocese of north america use the tridentine mass in the vernacular with minor alterations under the title of the divine liturgy of st gregory most old catholics use the tridentine mass either in the vernacular or in latin terminologyedit a pre roman rite high altar decorated with reredos and fixed on a three step platform at which the prayers at the foot of the altar are said leaning against the tabernacle and two of the candlesticks are altar cards to remind the celebrant of the words when he is away from the missal the catholic church uses the term extraordinary form of the roman rite mass among other terms the most widespread term for the rite other than tridentine mass is latin mass likewise the ordinary form of the roman rite mass was promulgated in latin and can be celebrated in that language occasionally the term gregorian rite is used when talking about the tridentine massdiscuss as is more frequently tridentine rite pope benedict xvi declared it inappropriate to speak of the versions of the roman missal of before and after  as if they were two rites rather he said it is a matter of a twofold use of one and the same rite traditionalist catholics whose bestknown characteristic is an attachment to the tridentine mass frequently refer to it as the traditional mass or the traditional latin mass they describe as a codifying of the form of the mass the preparation of pius vs edition of the roman missal of which he said that the experts to whom he had entrusted the work collated the existing text with ancient manuscripts and writings restored it to the original form and rite of the holy fathers and further emended it to distinguish this form of mass from the mass of paul vi traditionalist catholics sometimes call it the mass of the ages and say that it comes down to us from the church of the apostles and ultimately indeed from him who is its principal priest and its spotless victim pope st pius vs revision of the liturgyedit at the time of the council of trent the traditions preserved in printed and manuscript missals varied considerably and standardization was sought both within individual dioceses and throughout the latin west standardization was required also in order to prevent the introduction into the liturgy of protestant ideas in the wake of the protestant reformation pope st pius v accordingly imposed uniformity by law in  with the papal bull quo primum ordering use of the roman missal as revised by him he allowed only those rites that were at least  years old to survive the promulgation of his  missal several of the rites that remained in existence were progressively abandoned though the ambrosian rite survives in milan italy and neighbouring areas stretching even into switzerland and the mozarabic rite remains in use to a limited extent in toledo and madrid spain the carmelite carthusian and dominican religious orders kept their rites but in the second half of the th century two of these three chose to adopt the roman rite the rite of braga in northern portugal seems to have been practically abandoned since  november  that archdiocese authorizes its use only on an optional basis beginning in the late th century france and neighbouring areas such as münster cologne and trier in germany saw a flurry of independent missals published by bishops influenced by jansenism and gallicanism this ended when abbot guéranger and others initiated in the th century a campaign to return to the roman missal pius vs revision of the liturgy had as one of its declared aims the restoration of the roman missal to the original form and rite of the holy fathers due to the relatively limited resources available to his scholars this aim was in fact not realised three different printings of pius vs roman missal with minor variations appeared in  a folio and a quarto edition in rome and a folio edition in venice a reproduction of what is considered to be the earliest referred to therefore as the editio princeps was produced in  in the course of the printing of the editio princeps some corrections were made by pasting revised texts over parts of the already printed pages there were several printings again in the following year  with various corrections of the text historical variationsedit missale romanum in croatian glagolitic script printed in  in the apostolic constitution papal bull quo primum with which he prescribed use of his  edition of the roman missal pius v decreed we order and enjoin that nothing must be added to our recently published missal nothing omitted from it nor anything whatsoever be changed within it this of course did not exclude changes by a pope and pope pius v himself added to the missal the feast of our lady of victory to celebrate the victory of lepanto of  october  his immediate successor pope gregory xiii changed the name of this feast to the most holy rosary of the blessed virgin mary and pope john xxiii changed it to our lady of the rosary pius vs work in severely reducing the number of feasts in the roman calendar see this comparison was very soon further undone by his successors feasts that he had abolished such as those of the presentation of mary saint anne and saint anthony of padua were restored even before clement viiis  typical edition of the missal was issued in the course of the following centuries new feasts were repeatedly added and the ranks of certain feasts were raised or lowered a comparison between pope pius vs tridentine calendar and the general roman calendar of  shows the changes made from  to  pope pius xii made a general revision in  and pope john xxiii made further general revisions in  simplifying the terminology concerning the ranking of liturgical celebrations while keeping on  december what he called the feast of the conception of blessed mary omitting the word immaculate pius v suppressed the existing special mass for the feast directing that the mass for the nativity of mary with the word nativity replaced by conception be used instead part of that earlier mass was revived in the mass that pope pius ix ordered to be used on the feast typical editions of the roman missaledit altar of santa cecilia in trastevere as arranged in  one of many churches in rome whose altar placed at the western end of the church was positioned so that the priest necessarily faced east and so towards the people when celebrating mass in addition to such occasional changes the roman missal was subjected to general revisions whenever a new typical edition an official edition whose text was to be reproduced in printings by all publishers was issued after pius vs original tridentine roman missal the first new typical edition was promulgated in  by pope clement viii who in  had issued a revised edition of the vulgate the bible texts in the missal of pope pius v did not correspond exactly to the new vulgate and so clement edited and revised pope pius vs missal making alterations both in the scriptural texts and in other matters he abolished some prayers that the  missal obliged the priest to say on entering the church shortened the two prayers to be said after the confiteor directed that the words haec quotiescumque feceritis in meam memoriam facietis do this in memory of me should not be said while displaying the chalice to the people after the consecration but before doing so inserted directions at several points of the canon that the priest was to pronounce the words inaudibly suppressed the rule that at high mass the priest even if not a bishop was to give the final blessing with three signs of the cross and rewrote the rubrics introducing for instance the ringing of a small bell the next typical edition was issued in  when pope urban viii made another general revision of the roman missal there was no further typical edition until that of pope leo xiii in  it introduced only minor changes not profound enough to merit having the papal bull of its promulgation included in the missal as the bulls of  and  were in  with the bull divino afflatu pope pius x made significant changes in the rubrics he died in  so it fell to his successor pope benedict xv to issue a new typical edition incorporating his changes this  edition included a new section headed additions and changes in the rubrics of the missal in accordance with the bull divino afflatu and the subsequent decrees of the sacred congregation of rites this additional section was almost as long as the previous section on the general rubrics of the missal which continued to be printed unchanged pope pius xii radically revised the palm sunday and easter triduum liturgy suppressed many vigils and octaves and made other alterations in the calendar see general roman calendar of pope pius xii reforms that were completed in pope john xxiiis  code of rubrics which were incorporated in the final  typical edition of the tridentine missal replacing both pius xs additions and changes in the rubrics of the missal and the earlier general rubrics of the missal changes made to the liturgy in  and  in the wake of decisions of the second vatican council were not incorporated in the roman missal but were reflected in the provisional vernacular translations produced when the language of the people began to be used in addition to latin this explains the references sometimes seen to the  missal the general roman calendar was revised partially in  and  and completely in  in pope paul vis motu proprio mysterii paschalis again reducing the number of feasts  missaledit the roman missal issued by pope john xxiii in  differed from earlier editions in a number of ways it incorporated the change made by john xxiii in  when he inserted into the canon of the mass the name of saint joseph the first change for centuries in the canon of the mass it incorporated major changes that pope pius xii made in  in the liturgy of palm sunday and the easter triduum these included abolition of the ceremonies whereby the blessing of palms on palm sunday resembled a mass with epistle gospel preface and sanctus suppression of the knocking three times on the closed doors before returning to the church after the blessing and distribution of the palms omission of the prayers at the foot of the altar and of the last gospel on holy thursday the washing of feet was incorporated into the mass instead of being an independent ceremony if done by a bishop  men not  had their feet washed the mass itself was said in the evening instead of the morning and some of its prayers were removed or altered on good friday elements that suggested the usual practices of the mass were removed the sacred ministers began the liturgy in alb and for celebrant and deacon black stoles rather than respectively in black chasuble dalmatic and tunicle as per a typical mass the sacred ministers donned their vestments without maniples only for the solemn intercessions in which the celebrant wore a cope instead of a chasuble and removed them for the adoration of the cross the sacred ministers changed to violet vestments again without maniples for the distribution of holy communion let us pray let us kneel arise was added at the prayer for the jews and the adjective perfidis was removed see good friday prayer for the jews an afternoon communion service replaced the morning mass of the presanctified at which the priest alone received the earlierconsecrated host and drank unconsecrated wine into which a small portion of the consecrated host had been put the easter vigil was moved from holy saturday morning to the following nighttime the use of a triple candle was abolished and other changes were made both to the initial ceremonies centred on the paschal candle and to other parts such as the reduction from twelve to four of the prophecies read and the introduction of a renewal of baptismal promises for the laity notable for being the first time since the codification of the missal of pope pius v that the vernacular was permitted to be used in such a manner it incorporated the rubrical changes made by pope pius xiis  decree cum nostra which included vigils were abolished except those of easter christmas ascension pentecost saints peter and paul saint john the baptist and saint lawrence all octaves were abolished except those of easter christmas and pentecost no more than three collects were to be said at low mass and one at solemn mass its calendar incorporated both the changes made by pope pius xii in  general roman calendar of pope pius xii and those introduced by pope john xxiii himself with his  code of rubrics general roman calendar of  these included suppression of the solemnity of saint joseph spouse of the blessed virgin mary wednesday after the second sunday after easter and its replacement

continued use of this  edition of the roman missal as an extraordinary form of the roman rite alongside the later form introduced in  which is now the normal or ordinary form pre forms of the roman

catechumens those being instructed in the faith were once dismissed after the first half not having yet professed the faith profession of faith was considered essential for participation in the eucharistic sacrifice this rule of the didache is still in effect it is only one of the three conditions baptism right faith and right living for admission to receiving holy communion that the catholic church has always applied and that were already mentioned in the early nd century by saint justin martyr and this food is called among us the eucharist of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins and unto regeneration and who is so living as christ has enjoined first apology chapter lxvi before massedit asperges sprinkling with holy water psalm   is an optional penitential rite that ordinarily precedes only the principal mass on sunday in the sacristy a priest wearing an alb if he is to celebrate the mass or surplice if he is not the celebrant of the mass and vested with a stole which is the color of the day if the priest is the celebrant of the mass or purple if he is not the celebrant of the mass exorcises and blesses salt and water then puts the blessed salt into the water by thrice sprinkling it in the form of a cross while saying once commixtio salis et aquæ pariter fiat in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti may a mixture of salt and water now be made in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit after that the priest vested in a cope of the color of the day while the choir sings an antiphon and a verse of psalm  or  sprinkles with the holy water the altar three times and then the clergy and the congregation this rite if used precedes the prayers at the foot of the altar during the easter season the asperges me verse is replaced by the vidi aquam verse and alleluia is added to the ostende nobis verse and to its response following the asperges mass begins mass of the catechumensedit the first part is the mass of the catechumens prayers at the foot of the altaredit prayers at the foot of the altar the sequence of prayers at the foot of the altar is sign of the cross the priest after processing in—at solemn mass with deacon and subdeacon master of ceremonies and servers and at other masses with one or more servers—and at low mass placing the veiled chalice on the centre of the altar makes the sign of the cross at the foot of the altar at solemn mass the chalice is placed beforehand on the credence table psalm  psalm  mt ie masoretic numbering known by its incipit iudica me is recited except in masses of the season during passiontide and in requiem masses it is preceded and followed by an antiphon of psalm   mt introibo ad altare dei ad deum qui lætificat iuventutem meam translation i shall go in to the altar of god the god who gives joy to my youth is recited by the priest alternating with the deacon and subdeacon if present or servers psalm  is recited priest makes the sign of the cross our help is in the name of the lord servers who made heaven

fratres te pater oráre pro me ad dóminum deum nostrum translation i confess to almighty god to blessed mary ever virgin to blessed michael the archangel to blessed john the baptist to the holy apostles peter and paul to all the saints and to you brethren that i have sinned exceedingly in thought word and deed through my fault through my fault through my most grievous fault therefore i beseech blessed mary ever virgin  and you brethren to pray to the lord our god for me the servers pray for the priest may almighty god have mercy on thee forgive thee thy sins and bring thee to life everlasting then it is the ministers or servers turn to confess sinfulness and to ask for prayers they use the same words as those used by the priest except that they say you father in place of you brethren and the priest responds with the same prayer that the servers have used for him but using the plural number plus an extra prayer some verses are then said by priest and ministers or servers ending with the priest saying oremus te domine let us pray after this he ascends to the altar praying silently take away from us our iniquities that with pure minds we may worthily enter into the holy of holies a reference to exodus   kings   kings   chronicles  ezekiel  and others he places his joined hands on the edge of the altar so that only the tips of the small fingers touch the front of it and silently prays that by the merits of the saints whose relics are in the altar god may pardon all his sins at the words quorum relíquiæ hic sunt whose relics are here he spreads his hands and kisses the altar priest at the altaredit dominus vobiscum the lord be with you before the collect in the tridentine mass the priest should keep his eyes downcast at this point introit the priest again makes the sign of the cross while he begins to read the introit which is usually taken from a psalm exceptions occur eg the introit for easter sunday is adapted from wis  and the antiphon in masses of the blessed virgin mary was from the poet sedulius this evolved from the practice of singing a full psalm interspersed with the antiphon during the entrance of the clergy before the prayers at the foot of the altar were added to the mass in medieval times this is indicated by the very name of introit kyrie this part of mass is a linguistic marker of the origins of the roman liturgy in greek kyrie eleison christe eleison kyrie eleison means lord have mercy christ have mercy each phrase is said or sung three times gloria in excelsis deo the first line of the gloria is taken from lk  the gloria is omitted during the penitential liturgical seasons of advent septuagesima lent and passiontide in which violet vestments are worn but is used on feasts falling during such seasons as well as on holy thursday it is always omitted for a requiem mass the collect the priest turns toward the people and says dominus vobiscum the servers respond et cum spiritu tuo the lord be with you and with thy spirit the collect follows a prayer not drawn directly from scripture it tends to reflect the season instructionedit the priest reads the epistle primarily an extract from the letters of st paul to various churches in his motu proprio summorum pontificum pope benedict xvi has permitted this to be read in the vernacular language when mass is celebrated with the people between the epistle and the gospel two rarely three choir responses are sung or said usually these are a gradual followed by an alleluia but between septuagesima sunday and holy saturday or in a requiem mass or other penitential mass the alleluia is replaced by a tract and between easter sunday and pentecost the gradual is replaced by a second alleluia on a few exceptional occasions most notably easter pentecost corpus christi and in a requiem mass a sequence follows the alleluia or tract the gradual is partly composed of a portion of a psalm the gospel reading an extract from one of the four gospels before the reading or chanting of the gospel the priest prays cleanse my heart and my lips o almighty god who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet isaias a reference to isaiah  in this passage after being cleansed by the angel isaiah was instructed to prophesy the homily the rite of mass as revised by pope pius v the tridentine mass does not consider a sermon obligatory and speaks of it instead as merely optional it presumes that the creed if it is to be said will follow the gospel immediately but adds if however someone is to preach the homilist after the gospel has been finished preaches and when the sermon or moral address has been completed the credo is said or if it is not to be said the offertory is sung by contrast the roman missal as revised by pope paul vi declares that the homily may not be omitted without a grave reason from mass celebrated with the people attending on sundays and holy days of obligation and that it is recommended on other days the creed this is the nicene creed professing faith in god the father in god the son the word made flesh in god the holy ghost and in the holy church at the mention of the incarnation the celebrant and the congregation genuflect mass of the faithfuledit the second part is the mass of the faithful offertoryedit offertory verse after greeting the people once more dominus vobiscumet cum spiritu tuo and giving the invitation to pray oremus the priest enters upon the mass of the faithful from which the nonbaptized were once excluded he reads the offertory verse a short quotation from holy scripture which varies with the mass of each day with hands joined offering of bread and wine the priest offers the host holding it on the paten at breast level and praying that although he is unworthy god may accept this spotless host or victim the basic meaning of hostia in latin for his own innumerable sins offences and neglects for all those present and for all faithful christians living and dead that it may avail unto salvation of himself and those mentioned he then mixes a few drops of water with the wine which will later become the blood of jesus and holding the chalice so that the lip of the chalice is about the height of his lips offers the chalice of salvation asking that it may ascend with a sweet fragrance he then prays a prayer of contrition adapted from dan  incensing of the offerings and of the faithful at a high mass the priest blesses the incense then incenses the bread and wine among the prayers the priest says is psalm  let my prayer o lord be directed as incense in thy sight which is prayed as he incenses the altar the priest then gives the thurible to the deacon who incenses the priest then the other ministers and the congregation washing the hands the priest prays psalm  i will wash my hands among the innocent prayer to the most holy trinity this prayer asks that the divine trinity may receive the oblation being made in remembrance of the passion resurrection and ascension of jesus and in honour of blessed mary ever virgin and the other saints that it may avail to their honour and our salvation and that they may vouchsafe to intercede for us in heaven orate fratres suscipiat and secret amen concludes offertory here the priest turns to the congregation and says the first two words orate fratres in an elevated tone and then turns around while finishing the exhortation in the secret tone pray brethren that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to god the father almighty the altar servers respond with the suscipiat to which the priest secretly responds amen suscipiat dominus sacrificium de manibus tuis ad laudem et gloriam nominis sui ad utilitatem quoque nostram totiusque ecclesiæ suae sanctæ a translation in the english is may the lord accept this sacrifice at your hands to the praise and glory of his name for our good and the good of all his holy church the priest then says the days secret inaudibly and concludes it with per omnia sæcula sæculorum aloud the altar servers and in dialogue mass the congregation respond amen consecrationedit preface of the canon the roman canon dates in essentials from before st gregory the great who died in  and who is credited with adding a phrase to it see history of the roman canon it contains the main elements found in almost all rites but in an unusual arrangement and it is unclear which part should be considered to be the epiclesis dominus vobiscum et cum spiritu tuo sursum corda habemus ad dominum gratias agamus domino deo nostro dignum et iustum est the first part can be seen above at the collect the rest means lift up your hearts we lift them up to the lord let us give thanks to the lord our god it is right and just next a preface is prayed indicating specific reasons for giving thanks to god this leads to the sanctus canon or rule of consecration intercession corresponding to the reading of the diptychs in the byzantine rite—a diptych is a twoleaf painting carving or writing tablet here the priest prays for the living that god may guard unite and govern the church together with the pope and all those who holding to the truth hand on the catholic and apostolic faith then specific living people are mentioned and the congregation in the church next mary ever virgin saint joseph the apostles and some popes and other martyrs are mentioned by name as well as a generic and all your saints in communion with whom prayer is offered prayers preparatory to the consecration a prayer that god may graciously accept the offering and command that we be delivered from eternal damnation and counted among the flock of those you have chosen consecration transubstantiation and major elevation elevation of the chalice during the canon of the mass at a solemn mass the passage lk  is key in this section in summa theologiae iii   thomas aquinas addresses the interspersed phrase the mystery of faith on this phrase see mysterium fidei oblation of the victim to god an oblation is an offering the pure holy spotless victim is now offered with a prayer that god may accept the offering and command his holy angel to carry the offering to gods altar on high so that those who receive the body and blood of christ may be filled with every grace and heavenly blessing remembrance of the dead the priest now prays for the dead those who have gone before us with the sign of faith and rest in the sleep of peace and asks that they be granted a place of refreshment light and peace this is followed by a prayer that we be granted fellowship with the saints john the baptist and fourteen martyrs seven men and seven women are mentioned by name end of the canon and doxology with minor elevation the concluding doxology is through him and with him and in him o god almighty father in the unity of the holy spirit all glory and honour is yours for ever and ever amen ratifies the canon prayer elevation candleedit beuron art school representation of an elevation candle mistakenly placed at the gospel side and upon the altar until  the tridentine form of the roman missal laid down that a candle should be placed at the epistle side of the altar and that it should be lit at the showing of the consecrated sacrament to the people in practice except in monasteries and on special occasions this had fallen out of use long before pope john xxiii replaced the section on the general rubrics of the roman missal with his code of rubrics which no longer mentioned this custom on this see elevation candle communionedit before receiving communion from the chalice the priest makes the sign of the cross over himself saying in latin may the blood of our lord jesus christ keep my soul for eternal life amen the lords prayer and libera nos the libera nos is an extension of the lords prayer developing the line sed libera nos a malo but deliver us from evil the priest prays that we may be delivered from all evils and that the virgin mary mother of god together with the apostles and saints may intercede to obtain for us peace in our day fraction of the host during the preceding prayer the priest breaks the consecrated host into three parts and after concluding the prayer drops the smallest part into the chalice while praying that this commingling and consecration of the body and blood of christ may be to us who receive it effectual to life everlasting agnus dei agnus dei means lamb of god the priest then prays lamb of god who takest away the sins of the world have mercy on us he repeats this and then adds lamb of god who takest away the sins of the world grant us peace the mass of the last supper on holy thursday has have mercy on us all three times in requiem masses the petitions are grant them rest twice followed by grant them eternal rest the pax the priest asks christ to look not at the priests sins but at the faith of christs church and prays for peace and unity within the church then if a high mass is being celebrated he gives the sign of peace to the deacon saying peace be with you prayers preparatory to the communion in the first of these two prayers for himself the priests asks that by holy communion he may be freed from all his iniquities and evils be made to adhere to the commandments of jesus and never be separated from him in the second he asks let not the partaking of thy body o lord jesus christturn to my judgment and condemnation but through thy goodness may it be unto me a safeguard receiving of the body and blood of our lord the priest quietly says several prayers here before receiving communion the first is said in a low voice while taking up the host onto the paten the second of them spoken three times in a slightly audible voice while the priest holds the host in his left hand and strikes his breast with his right is based on matthew  lord i am not worthy then after having reverently consumed the host he takes up the chalice while in a low voice reciting psalm  what shall i render to the lord for all the things he hath rendered unto me i will take the chalice of salvation and i will call upon the name of the lord immediately adding psalm  praising i will call upon the lord and i shall be saved from my enemies priest on the ecce agnus dei  behold the lamb of god in the people communion if the priest is to give communion to others he holds up a small host and says aloud behold the lamb of god  and three times lord i am not worthy  he then gives communion first making with the host the sign of the cross over each communicant while saying may the body of our lord jesus christ preserve your soul for eternal life amen conclusionedit ite missa est sung by the deacon at a solemn mass prayers during the ablutions the prayers now focus on what has been received that we may receive with a pure mind that no stain of sin may remain in me whom these pure and holy sacraments have refreshed communion antiphon and postcommunion the communion antiphon is normally a portion of a psalm the postcommunion prayer is akin to the collect in being an appropriate prayer not directly drawn from scripture ite missa est blessing go it is the dismissal the word mass derives from this phrase after saying a silent prayer for himself the priest then gives the people his blessing prior to the revisions of pope pius xii and pope john xxiii the ite missa est was replaced with benedicamus domino let us bless the lord on days in which the gloria was not said and the rubrics required the priest to wear violet vestments ie masses of the season during advent septuagesima lent and passiontide vigils certain votive masses in the  missal benedicamus domino is said only when the mass is followed by another liturgical action such as the eucharistic processions on holy thursday and corpus christi in requiem masses the ite missa est is replaced with requiescant in pace with the response being amen instead of deo gratias the last gospel the priest then reads the last gospel the beginning of the gospel of john john  which recounts the incarnation of the son of god on certain occasions as for instance at the day mass on christmas day another gospel passage was read instead because that gospel is read as the gospel of the mass but pope john xxiiis revision of the rubrics decreed that on those and on other occasions the last gospel should simply be omitted prayers of the priest before and after massedit the tridentine missal includes prayers for the priest to say before and after mass in later editions of the roman missal including that of  the introductory heading of these prayers indicates that they are to be recited pro opportunitate as circumstances allow which in practice means that they are merely optional and may be omitted the original tridentine missal presents most of the prayers as obligatory indicating as optional only a very long prayer attributed to saint ambrose which later editions divide into seven sections each to be recited on only one day of the week and two other prayers attributed to saint ambrose and saint thomas aquinas respectively in addition to these three prayers the original tridentine missal proposes for the priest to recite before he celebrates mass the whole of psalms –   the numbering is that of the septuagint and vulgate and a series of collectstyle prayers later editions add after the three that in the original missal are only optional prayers to the blessed virgin saint joseph all the angels and saints and the saint whose mass is to be celebrated but as has been said treats as optional all the prayers before mass even those originally given as obligatory the original tridentine missal proposes for recitation by the priest after mass three prayers including the adoro te devote later editions place before these three the canticle of the three youths dan with three collects and follow them with the anima christi and seven more prayers treating as optional even the three prescribed in the original tridentine missal leonine prayersedit from  to  the holy see prescribed the recitation after low mass of certain prayers originally for the solution of the roman question and after this problem was solved by the lateran treaty to permit tranquillity and freedom to profess the faith to be restored to the afflicted people of russia these prayers are known as the leonine prayers because it was pope leo xiii who on  january  ordered their recitation throughout the world in what had been the papal states they were already in use since  the prayers comprised three ave marias one salve regina followed by a versicle and response and a collect prayer that from  on asked for the conversion of sinners and the freedom and exaltation of holy mother the church and again from  on a prayer to saint michael in  pope pius x added a thricerepeated most sacred heart of jesus have mercy on us in  with effect from  march  the holy see ended the obligation to recite the leonine prayers after low mass however the leonine prayers are sometimes still recited after presentday celebrations of tridentine mass although they are not included even in the  edition of the tridentine missal participation by the peopleedit nuptial low mass distribution of communion at a tridentine mass typically the faithful kneel and receive in the mouth and women wear a headcovering the participation of the congregation at the tridentine mass is interior involving eye and heart and exterior by mouth except in the dialogue mass form which arose about  and led to a more active exterior participation of the congregation the people present at the tridentine mass do not recite out loud the prayers of the mass only the server or servers join with the priest in reciting the prayers at the foot of the altar which include the confiteor and in speaking the other responses most of the prayers that the priest says are spoken inaudibly including almost all the mass of the faithful the offertory prayers the canon of the mass except for the preface and the final doxology and apart from the agnus dei those between the lords prayer and the postcommunion at a solemn mass or missa cantata a choir sings the servers responses except for the prayers at the foot of the altar the choir sings the introit the kyrie the gloria the gradual the tract or alleluia the credo the offertory and communion antiphons the sanctus and the agnus dei of these only the five that form part of the ordinary of the mass are usually sung at a missa cantata in addition to the gregorian chant music for these polyphonic compositions exist some quite elaborate the priest largely says quietly the words of the chants and then recites other prayers while the choir continues the chant different levels of celebrationedit there are various forms of celebration of the tridentine mass pontifical high mass celebrated by a bishop accompanied by an assisting priest deacon subdeacon thurifer acolytes and other ministers under the guidance of a priest acting as master of ceremonies most often the specific parts assigned to deacon and subdeacon are performed by priests the parts that are said aloud are all chanted except that the prayers at the foot of the altar which before the reform of pope pius v were said in the sacristy are said quietly by the bishop with the deacon and the subdeacon while the choir sings the introit the main difference between a pontifical and an ordinary high mass is that the bishop remains at his throne almost all the time until the offertory solemn or high mass latin missa solemnis offered by a priest accompanied by a deacon and subdeacon and the other ministers mentioned above missa cantata latin for sung mass celebrated by a priest without deacon and subdeacon and thus a form of low mass but with some parts the three variable prayers the scripture readings preface pater noster and ite missa est sung by the priest and other parts introit kyrie gloria gradual tract or alleluia credo offertory antiphon sanctus and benedictus agnus dei and communion antiphon sung by the choir incense may be used exactly as at a solemn mass with the exception of incensing the celebrant after the gospel which is not done low mass the priest sings no part of the mass though in some places a choir or the congregation sings during the mass hymns not always directly related to the mass in its article the liturgy of the mass the  catholic encyclopedia describes how when concelebration ceased to be practised in western europe low mass became distinguished from high mass the separate celebrations then involved the building of many altars in one church and the reduction of the ritual to the simplest possible form the deacon and subdeacon were in this case dispensed with the celebrant took their part as well as his own one server took the part of the choir and of all the other ministers everything was said instead of being sung the incense and kiss of peace were omitted so we have the wellknown rite of low mass missa privata this then reacted on high mass missa solemnis so that at high mass too the celebrant himself recites everything even though it be sung by the deacon subdeacon or choir on the origin of the missa cantata the same source gives the following information  high mass is the norm it is only in the complete rite with deacon and subdeacon that the ceremonies can be understood thus the rubrics of the ordinary of the mass always suppose that the mass is high low mass said by a priest alone with one server is a shortened and simplified form of the same thing its ritual can be explained only by a reference to high mass for instance the celebrant goes over to the north side of the altar to read the gospel because that is the side to which the deacon goes in procession at high mass he turns round always by the right because at high mass he should not turn his back to the deacon and so on a sung mass missa cantata is a modern compromise it is really a low mass since the essence of high mass is not the music but the deacon and subdeacon only in churches which have no ordained person except one priest and in which high mass is thus impossible is it allowed to celebrate the mass on sundays and feasts with most of the adornment borrowed from high mass with singing and generally with incense revision of the roman missaledit pius xii began in earnest the work of revising the roman missal with a thorough revision of the rites of holy week which after an experimental period beginning in  was made obligatory in  the mass that used to be said on holy thursday morning was moved to the evening necessitating a change in the rule that previously had required fasting from midnight the good friday service was moved to the afternoon holy communion was no longer reserved for the priest alone as before hosts consecrated at the holy thursday mass were used and the priest no longer received part of the host in unconsecrated wine the easter vigil service that used to be held in morning of holy saturday was moved to the night that leads to easter sunday and many changes were made to the content in  pope john xxiii – ordered the suppression of the word perfidis unbelieving ie not believing in jesus applied to the jews in the rites for good friday he revised the rubrics to the order of mass and the breviary two years later in  he made some more minor modifications on the occasion of publishing a new typical edition of the roman missal this is the edition authorized for use by virtue of the quattuor abhinc annos indult see below under present status of the tridentine mass among the other changes he made and that were included in the  missal were adding st josephs name to the roman canon eliminating the second confiteor before communion suppressing  feasts such as st peters chair in rome or more accurately combining both feasts of st peters chair into one as they originally had been incorporating the abolition of  festal octaves and  vigils of feasts and other changes made by pope pius xii and modifying rubrics especially for solemn high masses among the names that disappeared from the roman missal was that of st philomena her liturgical celebration had never been admitted to the general roman calendar but from  it had been included with an indication that the mass was to be taken entirely from the common in the section headed masses for some places ie only those places for which it had been specially authorized but her name had already in  been ordered to be removed from all liturgical calendars on  december  the second vatican council decreed in chapter ii of its constitution on the sacred liturgy sacrosanctum concilium the rite of the mass is to be revised  the rites are to be simplified due care being taken to preserve their substance parts which with the passage of time came to be duplicated or were added with little advantage are to be omitted other parts which suffered loss through accidents of history are to be restored to the vigor they had in the days of the holy fathers as may seem useful or necessary the treasures of the bible are to be opened up more lavishly so that a richer fare may be provided for the faithful at the table of god’s word  a suitable place may be allotted to the vernacular in masses which are celebrated with the people  communion under both kinds may be granted when the bishops think fitas for instance to the newly ordained in the mass of their sacred ordination to the newly professed in the mass of their religious profession and to the newly baptized in the mass which follows their baptism the instruction inter oecumenici of  september  initiated the application to the mass of the decisions that the council had taken less than a year before permission was given for use only in mass celebrated with the people of the vernacular language especially in the biblical readings and the reintroduced prayers of the faithful but until the whole of the ordinary of the mass has been revised in the chants kyrie gloria creed sanctus agnus dei and the entrance offertory and communion antiphons and in the parts that involved dialogue with the people and in the our father which the people could now recite entirely together with the priest most episcopal conferences quickly approved interim vernacular translations generally different from country to country and after having them confirmed by the holy see published them in  other changes included the omission of psalm   at the start of mass and the last gospel at the end both of which pope pius v had first inserted into the missal having previously been private prayers said by the priest in the sacristy and the leonine prayers of pope leo xiii the canon of the mass which continued to be recited silently was kept in latin three years later the instruction tres abhinc annos of  may  gave permission for use of the vernacular even in the canon of the mass and allowed it to be said audibly and even in part to be chanted the vernacular could be used even at mass celebrated without the people being present use of the maniple was made optional and at three ceremonies at which the cope was previously the obligatory vestment the chasuble could be used instead pope paul vi continued implementation of the councils directives ordering with apostolic constitution missale romanum of holy thursday  april  publication of a new official edition of the roman missal which appeared in latin in  opposition to the latest revisions of the liturgyedit some traditionalist catholics reject to a greater or lesser extent the changes made since  see traditionalist catholic none advocate returning to the original  form of the liturgy though some may perhaps wish a reestablishment of its form before pius xs revision of the rubrics in  some do refuse to accept the  changes in the liturgy of palm sunday and the easter triduum and in the liturgical calendar see general roman calendar of pope pius xii and instead use the general roman calendar as in  others accept the  changes by pius xii but not those of pope john xxiii others again in accordance with the authorization granted by pope benedict xvi in summorum pontificum use the missal and calendar as it was in  some of them argue that unlike earlier reforms the revision of  which replaced the tridentine mass with the mass of pope paul vi represented a major break with the past they consider that the content of the revised liturgy is in catholic terms seriously deficient and defective some hold that it is displeasing to god and that no catholic should attend it when a preliminary text of two of the sections of the revised missal was published in  archbishop marcel lefebvre gathered a group of twelve theologians who under his direction wrote a study of the text they stated that it represents both as a whole and in its details a striking departure from the catholic theology of the mass as it was formulated in session  of the council of trent cardinal alfredo ottaviani a former prefect of the sacred congregation for the doctrine of the faith supported this study with a letter of  september  to pope paul vi cardinal antonio bacci signed the same letter the critical study became known as the ottaviani intervention cardinal ottaviani subsequently stated in writing that he had not intended his letter to be made public and that pope paul vis doctrinal exposition on  november and  november  of the revised liturgy in its definitive form meant that no one can be genuinely scandalised any more jean madiran a critic of vatican ii and foundereditor of the french journal itinéraires claimed that this letter was fraudulently presented to the elderly and already blind cardinal for his signature by his secretary monsignor and future cardinal gilberto agustoni and that agustoni resigned shortly afterwards this allegation remains unproven and madiran himself was not an eyewitness of the alleged deception in october  a meeting of the synod of bishops had already given its opinion on a still earlier draft of the  members  approved it as it stood  approved it but suggested various modifications  abstained and  voted against from the s onwards western countries have experienced a drop in mass attendance in the united states from  of catholics attending in  to  attending by  these same countries saw a decline in seminary enrollments and in the number of priests in the united states from  ordinations in  to  in  and a general erosion of belief in the doctrines of the catholic faith opponents of the revision of the mass liturgy argue citing opinion poll evidence in their support that the revision contributed to this decline others pointing among other considerations to the fact that globally there are more priests and seminarians now than in previous years in  there were  major seminarians worldwide in  there were  an increase of  at a time however when there was an increase of global population of  suggest that the apparent decline of catholic practice in the west is due to the general influence of secularism and liberalism on western societies rather than to developments within the catholic church attitudes of popes since the second vatican counciledit pope paul viedit following the introduction of the mass of paul vi in  the holy see granted a significant number of permissions for the use of the former liturgy for example elderly priests were not required to switch to celebrating the new form in england and wales occasional celebrations of the tridentine mass were allowed in virtue of what became known as the agatha christie indult however there was no general worldwide legal framework allowing for the celebration of the rite following the rise of the traditionalist catholic movement in the s pope paul vi reportedly declined to liberalise its use further on the grounds that it had become a politically charged symbol associated with opposition to his policies pope john paul iiedit in  the holy see sent a letter known as quattuor abhinc annos to the presidents of the worlds episcopal conferences this document empowered diocesan bishops to authorise on certain conditions celebrations of the tridentine mass for priests and laypeople who requested them in  following the excommunication of archbishop marcel lefebvre and four bishops that he had consecrated the pope issued a further document a motu proprio known as ecclesia dei which stated that respect must everywhere be shown for the feelings of all those who are attached to the latin liturgical tradition the pope urged bishops to give a wide and generous application to the provisions of quattuor abhinc annos and established the pontifical commission ecclesia dei to oversee relations between rome and traditionalist catholics the holy see itself granted authorisation to use the tridentine mass to a significant number of priests and priestly societies such as the priestly fraternity of st peter the institute of christ the king sovereign priest and the personal apostolic administration of saint john mary vianney some diocesan bishops however declined to authorise celebrations within their dioceses or did so only to a limited extent in some cases the difficulty was that those seeking the permission were hostile to the church authorities other refusals of permission were alleged to have stemmed from certain bishops disapproval in principle of celebrations of the tridentine liturgy pope benedict xviedit as a cardinal joseph ratzinger was regarded as having a particular interest in the liturgy and as being favourable towards the older rite of mass he famously criticized the erratic way in which contrary to official policy many priests celebrated the revised rite in september  the pontifical commission ecclesia dei established the institute of the good shepherd made up of former members of the society of st pius x in bordeaux france with permission to use the tridentine liturgy this step was met with some discontent from french clergy and thirty priests wrote an open letter to the pope consistently with its previous policy the society of st pius x rejected the move following repeated rumours that the use of the tridentine mass would be liberalised the pope issued a motu proprio called summorum pontificum on  july  together with an accompanying letter to the worlds bishops the pope declared that the roman missal promulgated by paul vi is the ordinary expression of the lex orandi law of prayer of the catholic church of the latin rite nevertheless the roman missal promulgated by st pius v and reissued by st john xxiii is to be considered as an extraordinary expression of that same lex orandi he further stated that the  missal  was never juridically abrogated he replaced with new rules those of quattuor abhinc annos on use of the older form essentially authorization for using the  form for parish masses and those celebrated on public occasions such as a wedding is devolved from the local bishop to the priest in charge of a church and any priest of the latin rite may use the  roman missal in masses celebrated without the people a term that does not exclude attendance by other worshippers lay or clergy while requests by groups of catholics wishing to use the tridentine liturgy in parish masses are to be dealt with by the parish priest or the rector of the church rather than as before by the local bishop the pope and cardinal darío castrillón have stated that the bishops authority is not thereby undermined present regulationsedit the regulations set out in summorum pontificum provide that in masses celebrated without the people every latin rite priest may use either the  roman missal or that of paul vi except during the easter triduum when masses without participation by the people are no longer allowed celebrations of mass in this form formerly referred to as private masses may as before be attended by laypeople who ask to be admitted in parish masses where there is a stable group of laypeople who adhere to the earlier liturgical tradition the parish priest should willingly accept their requests to be allowed to celebrate the mass according to the  missal and should ensure that their welfare harmonises with the ordinary pastoral care of the parish under the guidance of the bishop in accordance with canon  of the code of canon law avoiding discord and favouring the unity of the church mass may be celebrated using the  missal on working days while on sundays and feast days one such celebration may be held for priests and laypeople who request it the parish priest should allow celebrations of the  form on special occasions such as weddings funerals and pilgrimages communities belonging to institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life which wish to use the  missal for conventual or community celebration in their oratories may do so with letter  of  january  the pontifical council ecclesia dei responded positively to a question whether a parish priest pastor or another priest may on his own initiative publicly celebrate the extraordinary form along with the customary regular use of the new form so that the faithful both young and old can familiarize themselves with the old rites and benefit from their perceptible beauty and transcendence although the council accompanied this response with the observation that a stable group of the faithful attached to the older form has a right to assist at mass in the extraordinary form a website that published the response interpreted it as not requiring the existence of such a stable group present practiceedit the publication of summorum pontificum has led to an increase in the number of regularly scheduled public tridentine masses on  june  cardinal darío castrillón hoyos told a london press conference that pope benedict wants every parish to offer both the old and the new forms for sunday mass the cardinal said that the vatican was preparing to instruct seminaries to teach all students the tridentine form of the roman rite the complexity of the rubrics makes it difficult for priests accustomed to the simpler modern form to celebrate the tridentine form properly and it is unclear how many have the required knowledge some traditionalist catholic priests and organisations holding that no official permission is required to use any form of the tridentine mass celebrate it without regularizing their situation and sometimes using editions of the roman missal earlier than the  edition approved in summorum pontificum in order to provide for priests who celebrate the tridentine mass publishers have issued facsimiles or reprintings of old

for the forms of the mass liturgy prior to  see pretridentine mass elevation of the chalice after the consecration during a solemn mass the tridentine mass now officially often referred to as the extraordinary form of the roman rite extraordinary form for short latin forma extraordinaria is the roman rite mass which appears in typical editions of the roman missal published from  to  the most widely used mass liturgy in the world until the introduction of the mass of paul vi in  it is celebrated in ecclesiastical latin tridentine is derived from the latin tridentinus related to the city of tridentum modernday trent italy in response to a decision of the council of trent pope pius v promulgated the  roman missal making it mandatory throughout the latin church except in places and religious orders with missals from before  despite being often described as the traditional latin mass the mass of paul vi the novus ordo missae that replaced it as the ordinary form of the roman rite has its official text in latin and is sometimes celebrated in that language in  pope benedict xvi issued the motu proprio summorum pontificum accompanied by a letter to the worlds bishops authorizing use of the tridentine mass and ritual for competent priests the pope stated that the  edition of the roman missal is to be considered an extraordinary form forma extraordinaria of the roman rite of which the  mass of paul vi is the ordinary normal or standard form since that is the only authorized extraordinary form some refer to the  tridentine mass as the extraordinary form of the mass the  tridentine mass is sometimes referred to as the usus antiquior older use or forma antiquior older form to differentiate it from the mass of paul vi again in the sense of being the only one of the older forms for which authorization has been granted in masses celebrated without the people latin rite catholic priests are free to use either the  tridentine missal or the ordinary form missal these masses may—observing all the norms of law—also be attended by faithful who of their own free will ask to be admitted permission to use the tridentine mass as parish liturgies may be given by the

missals  texts of parts of the tridentine missal post  history  comparison with nonroman western rites and uses  media  directories of latin masses languageedit in most countries the language used for celebrating the tridentine mass was and is latin however in dalmatia and parts of istria in croatia the liturgy was celebrated in church slavonic and authorisation for use of this language was extended to some other slavic regions between  and  after the publication of the  edition of the roman missal the  instruction on implementing the constitution on sacred liturgy of the second vatican council laid down that normally the epistle and gospel from the mass of the day shall be read in the vernacular episcopal conferences were to decide with the consent of the holy see what other parts if any of the mass were to be celebrated in the vernacular outside the roman catholic church the vernacular language was introduced into the celebration of the tridentine mass by some old catholics and anglocatholics with the introduction of the english missal some western rite orthodox christians particularly in the antiochian orthodox archdiocese of north america use the tridentine mass in the vernacular with minor alterations under the title of the divine liturgy of st gregory most old catholics use the tridentine mass either in the vernacular or in latin terminologyedit a pre roman rite high altar decorated with reredos and fixed on a three step platform at which the prayers at the foot of the altar are said leaning against the tabernacle and two of the candlesticks are altar cards to remind the celebrant of the words when he is away from the missal the catholic church uses the term extraordinary form of the roman rite mass among other terms the most widespread term for the rite other than tridentine mass is latin mass likewise the ordinary form of the roman rite mass was promulgated in latin and can be celebrated in that language occasionally the term gregorian rite is used when talking about the tridentine massdiscuss as is more frequently tridentine rite pope benedict xvi declared it inappropriate to speak of the versions of the roman missal of before and after  as if they were two rites rather he said it is a matter of a twofold use of one and the same rite traditionalist catholics whose bestknown characteristic is an attachment to the tridentine mass frequently refer to it as the traditional mass or the traditional latin mass they describe as a codifying of the form of the mass the preparation of pius vs edition of the roman missal of which he said that the experts to whom he had entrusted the work collated the existing text with ancient manuscripts and writings restored it to the original form and rite of the holy fathers and further emended it to distinguish this form of mass from the mass of paul vi traditionalist catholics sometimes call it the mass of the ages and say that it comes down to us from the church of the apostles and ultimately indeed from him who is its principal priest and its spotless victim pope st pius vs revision of the liturgyedit at the time of the council of trent the traditions preserved in printed and manuscript missals varied considerably and standardization was sought both within individual dioceses and throughout the latin west standardization was required also in order to prevent the introduction into the liturgy of protestant ideas in the wake of the protestant reformation pope st pius v accordingly imposed uniformity by law in  with the papal bull quo primum ordering use of the roman missal as revised by him he allowed only those rites that were at least  years old to survive the promulgation of his  missal several of the rites that remained in existence were progressively abandoned though the ambrosian rite survives in milan italy and neighbouring areas stretching even into switzerland and the mozarabic rite remains in use to a limited extent in toledo and madrid spain the carmelite carthusian and dominican religious orders kept their rites but in the second half of the th century two of these three chose to adopt the roman rite the rite of braga in northern portugal seems to have been practically abandoned since  november  that archdiocese authorizes its use only on an optional basis beginning in the late th century france and neighbouring areas such as münster cologne and trier in germany saw a flurry of independent missals published by bishops influenced by jansenism and gallicanism this ended when abbot guéranger and others initiated in the th century a campaign to return to the roman missal pius vs revision of the liturgy had as one of its declared aims the restoration of the roman missal to the original form and rite of the holy fathers due to the relatively limited resources available to his scholars this aim was in fact not realised three different printings of pius vs roman missal with minor variations appeared in  a folio and a quarto edition in rome and a folio edition in venice a reproduction of what is considered to be the earliest referred to therefore as the editio princeps was produced in  in the course of the printing of the editio princeps some corrections were made by pasting revised texts over parts of the already printed pages there were several printings again in the following year  with various corrections of the text historical variationsedit missale romanum in croatian glagolitic script printed in  in the apostolic constitution papal bull quo primum with which he prescribed use of his  edition of the roman missal pius v decreed we order and enjoin that nothing must be added to our recently published missal nothing omitted from it nor anything whatsoever be changed within it this of course did not exclude changes by a pope and pope pius v himself added to the missal the feast of our lady of victory to celebrate the victory of lepanto of  october  his immediate successor pope gregory xiii changed the name of this feast to the most holy rosary of the blessed virgin mary and pope john xxiii changed it to our lady of the rosary pius vs work in severely reducing the number of feasts in the roman calendar see this comparison was very soon further undone by his successors feasts that he had abolished such as those of the presentation of mary saint anne and saint anthony of padua were restored even before clement viiis  typical edition of the missal was issued in the course of the following centuries new feasts were repeatedly added and the ranks of certain feasts were raised or lowered a comparison between pope pius vs tridentine calendar and the general roman calendar of  shows the changes made from  to  pope pius xii made a general revision in  and pope john xxiii made further general revisions in  simplifying the terminology concerning the ranking of liturgical celebrations while keeping on  december what he called the feast of the conception of blessed mary omitting the word immaculate pius v suppressed the existing special mass for the feast directing that the mass for the nativity of mary with the word nativity replaced by conception be used instead part of that earlier mass was revived in the mass that pope pius ix ordered to be used on the feast typical editions of the roman missaledit altar of santa cecilia in trastevere as arranged in  one of many churches in rome whose altar placed at the western end of the church was positioned so that the priest necessarily faced east and so towards the people when celebrating mass in addition to such occasional changes the roman missal was subjected to general revisions whenever a new typical edition an official edition whose text was to be reproduced in printings by all publishers was issued after pius vs original tridentine roman missal the first new typical edition was promulgated in  by pope clement viii who in  had issued a revised edition of the vulgate the bible texts in the missal of pope pius v did not correspond exactly to the new vulgate and so clement edited and revised pope pius vs missal making alterations both in the scriptural texts and in other matters he abolished some prayers that the  missal obliged the priest to say on entering the church shortened the two prayers to be said after the confiteor directed that the words haec quotiescumque feceritis in meam memoriam facietis do this in memory of me should not be said while displaying the chalice to the people after the consecration but before doing so inserted directions at several points of the canon that the priest was to pronounce the words inaudibly suppressed the rule that at high mass the priest even if not a bishop was to give the final blessing with three signs of the cross and rewrote the rubrics introducing for instance the ringing of a small bell the next typical edition was issued in  when pope urban viii made another general revision of the roman missal there was no further typical edition until that of pope leo xiii in  it introduced only minor changes not profound enough to merit having the papal bull of its promulgation included in the missal as the bulls of  and  were in  with the bull divino afflatu pope pius x made significant changes in the rubrics he died in  so it fell to his successor pope benedict xv to issue a new typical edition incorporating his changes this  edition included a new section headed additions and changes in the rubrics of the missal in accordance with the bull divino afflatu and the subsequent decrees of the sacred congregation of rites this additional section was almost as long as the previous section on the general rubrics of the missal which continued to be printed unchanged pope pius xii radically revised the palm sunday and easter triduum liturgy suppressed many vigils and octaves and made other alterations in the calendar see general roman calendar of pope pius xii reforms that were completed in pope john xxiiis  code of rubrics which were incorporated in the final  typical edition of the tridentine missal replacing both pius xs additions and changes in the rubrics of the missal and the earlier general rubrics of the missal changes made to the liturgy in  and  in the wake of decisions of the second vatican council were not incorporated in the roman missal but were reflected in the provisional vernacular translations produced when the language of the people began to be used in addition to latin this explains the references sometimes seen to the  missal the general roman calendar was revised partially in  and  and completely in  in pope paul vis motu proprio mysterii paschalis again reducing the number of feasts  missaledit the roman missal issued by pope john xxiii in  differed from earlier editions in a number of ways it incorporated the change made by john xxiii in  when he inserted into the canon of the mass the name of saint joseph the first change for centuries in the canon of the mass it incorporated major changes that pope pius xii made in  in the liturgy of palm sunday and the easter triduum these included abolition of the ceremonies whereby the blessing of palms on palm sunday resembled a mass with epistle gospel preface and sanctus suppression of the knocking three times on the closed doors before returning to the church after the blessing and distribution of the palms omission of the prayers at the foot of the altar and of the last gospel on holy thursday the washing of feet was incorporated into the mass instead of being an independent ceremony if done by a bishop  men not  had their feet washed the mass itself was said in the evening instead of the morning and some of its prayers were removed or altered on good friday elements that suggested the usual practices of the mass were removed the sacred ministers began the liturgy in alb and for celebrant and deacon black stoles rather than respectively in black chasuble dalmatic and tunicle as per a typical mass the sacred ministers donned their vestments without maniples only for the solemn intercessions in which the celebrant wore a cope instead of a chasuble and removed them for the adoration of the cross the sacred ministers changed to violet vestments again without maniples for the distribution of holy communion let us pray let us kneel arise was added at the prayer for the jews and the adjective perfidis was removed see good friday prayer for the jews an afternoon communion service replaced the morning mass of the presanctified at which the priest alone received the earlierconsecrated host and drank unconsecrated wine into which a small portion of the consecrated host had been put the easter vigil was moved from holy saturday morning to the following nighttime the use of a triple candle was abolished and other changes were made both to the initial ceremonies centred on the paschal candle and to other parts such as the reduction from twelve to four of the prophecies read and the introduction of a renewal of baptismal promises for the laity notable for being the first time since the codification of the missal of pope pius v that the vernacular was permitted to be used in such a manner it incorporated the rubrical changes made by pope pius xiis  decree cum nostra which included vigils were abolished except those of easter christmas ascension pentecost saints peter and paul saint john the baptist and saint lawrence all octaves were abolished except those of easter christmas and pentecost no more than three collects were to be said at low mass and one at solemn mass its calendar incorporated both the changes made by pope pius xii in  general roman calendar of pope pius xii and those introduced by pope john xxiii himself with his  code of rubrics general roman calendar of  these included suppression of the solemnity of saint joseph spouse of the blessed virgin mary wednesday after the second sunday after easter and its replacement by the feast of saint joseph the worker  may removal of some duplicate feasts that appeared twice in earlier versions of the calendar namely the chair of saint peter at rome  january the finding of the holy cross  may saint john before the latin gate  may the apparition of saint michael  may saint peter in chains  august and the invention of the relics of saint stephen  august addition of feasts

continued use of this  edition of the roman missal as an extraordinary form of the roman rite alongside the later form introduced in  which is now the normal or ordinary form pre forms of the roman

catechumens those being instructed in the faith were once dismissed after the first half not having yet professed the faith profession of faith was considered essential for participation in the eucharistic sacrifice this rule of the didache is still in effect it is only one of the three conditions baptism right faith and right living for admission to receiving holy communion that the catholic church has always applied and that were already mentioned in the early nd century by saint justin martyr and this food is called among us the eucharist of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins and unto regeneration and who is so living as christ has enjoined first apology chapter lxvi before massedit asperges sprinkling with holy water psalm   is an optional penitential rite that ordinarily precedes only the principal mass on sunday in the

of the mass or purple if he is not the celebrant of the mass exorcises and blesses salt and water then puts the blessed salt into the water by thrice sprinkling it in the form of a cross while saying once commixtio salis et aquæ pariter fiat in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti may a mixture of salt and water now be made in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit after that the priest vested in a cope of the color of the day while the choir sings an antiphon and a verse of psalm  or  sprinkles with the holy water the altar three times and then the clergy and the congregation this rite if used precedes the prayers at the foot of the altar during the easter season the asperges me verse is replaced by the vidi aquam verse and alleluia is added to the ostende

beforehand on the credence table psalm  psalm  mt ie masoretic numbering known by its incipit iudica me is recited except in masses of the season during passiontide and in requiem masses it is preceded and followed by an antiphon of psalm   mt introibo ad altare dei ad deum qui lætificat iuventutem meam translation i shall go in to the altar of god the god who gives joy to my youth is

beseech blessed mary ever virgin  and you brethren to pray to the lord our god for me the servers pray for the priest may almighty god have mercy on thee forgive thee thy sins and bring thee to life everlasting then it is the ministers or servers turn to confess sinfulness and to ask for prayers they use the same words as those used by the priest except that they say you father in place of you brethren and the priest responds with the same prayer that the servers have used for him but using the plural number plus an extra prayer some verses are then said by priest and ministers or servers

makes the sign of the cross while he begins to read the introit which is usually taken from a psalm exceptions occur eg the introit for easter sunday is adapted from wis  and the antiphon in masses of the blessed virgin mary was from the poet sedulius this evolved from the practice of singing a full psalm interspersed with the antiphon during the entrance of the clergy before the prayers at the foot of the altar were added to the mass in medieval times this is indicated by the very name of introit kyrie this part of mass is a linguistic marker of the origins of the roman liturgy in greek kyrie eleison christe eleison kyrie eleison means lord have mercy christ have mercy each phrase is said or sung three times gloria in excelsis deo the first line of the gloria is taken from lk  the gloria is omitted during the penitential liturgical seasons of advent septuagesima lent and passiontide in which violet vestments are worn but is used on feasts falling during such seasons as well as on holy thursday it is always omitted for a requiem mass the collect the priest turns toward the people and says dominus vobiscum the servers respond et cum spiritu tuo the lord be with you and with thy spirit the collect follows a prayer not drawn directly from scripture it tends to reflect the season instructionedit the priest reads the epistle primarily an extract from the letters of st paul to various churches in his motu proprio summorum pontificum pope benedict xvi has permitted this to be read in the vernacular language when mass is celebrated with the people between the epistle and the gospel two rarely three choir responses are sung or said usually these are a gradual followed by an alleluia but between septuagesima sunday and holy saturday or in a requiem mass or other penitential mass the alleluia is replaced by a tract and between easter sunday and pentecost the gradual is replaced by a second alleluia on a few exceptional occasions most notably easter pentecost corpus christi and in a requiem mass a sequence follows the alleluia or tract the gradual is partly composed of a portion of a psalm the gospel reading an extract from one of the four gospels before the reading or chanting of the gospel the priest prays cleanse my heart and my lips o almighty god who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet isaias a reference to isaiah  in this passage after being cleansed by the angel isaiah was instructed to prophesy the homily the rite of mass as revised by pope pius v the tridentine mass does not consider a sermon obligatory and speaks of it instead as merely optional it presumes that the creed if it is to be said will follow the gospel immediately but adds if however someone is to preach the homilist after the gospel has been finished preaches and when the sermon or moral address has been completed the credo is said or if it is not to be said the offertory is sung by contrast the roman missal as revised by pope paul vi declares that the homily may not be omitted without a grave reason from mass celebrated with the people attending on sundays and holy days of obligation and that it is recommended on other days the creed this is the nicene creed professing faith in god the father in god the son the word made flesh in god the holy ghost and in the holy church at the mention of the incarnation the celebrant and the congregation genuflect mass of the faithfuledit the second part is the mass of the faithful offertoryedit offertory verse after greeting the people once more dominus vobiscumet cum spiritu tuo and giving the invitation to pray oremus the priest enters upon the mass of the faithful from which the nonbaptized were once excluded he reads the offertory verse a short quotation from holy scripture which varies with the mass of each day with hands joined offering of bread and wine the priest offers the host holding it on the paten at breast level and praying that although he is unworthy god may accept this spotless host or victim the basic meaning of hostia in latin for his own innumerable sins offences and neglects for all those present and for all faithful christians living and dead that it may avail unto salvation of himself and those mentioned he then mixes a few drops of water with the wine which will later become the blood of jesus and holding the chalice so that the lip of the chalice is about the height of his lips offers the chalice of salvation asking that it may ascend with a sweet fragrance he then prays a prayer of contrition adapted from dan  incensing of the offerings and of the faithful at a high mass the priest blesses the incense then incenses the bread and wine among the prayers the priest says is psalm  let my prayer o lord be directed as incense in thy sight which is prayed as he incenses the altar the priest then gives the thurible to the deacon who incenses the priest then the other ministers and the congregation washing the hands the priest prays psalm  i will wash my hands among the innocent prayer to the most holy trinity this prayer asks that the divine trinity may receive the oblation being made in remembrance of the passion resurrection and ascension of jesus and in honour of blessed mary ever virgin and the other saints that it may avail to their honour and our salvation and that they may vouchsafe to intercede for us in heaven orate fratres suscipiat and secret amen concludes offertory here the priest turns to the congregation and says the first two words orate fratres in an elevated tone and then turns around while finishing the exhortation in the secret tone pray brethren that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to god the father almighty the altar servers respond with the suscipiat to which the priest secretly responds amen suscipiat dominus sacrificium de manibus tuis ad laudem et gloriam nominis sui ad utilitatem quoque nostram totiusque ecclesiæ suae sanctæ a translation in the english is may the lord accept this sacrifice at your hands to the praise and glory of his name for our good and the good of all his holy church the priest then says the days secret inaudibly and concludes it with per omnia sæcula sæculorum aloud the altar servers and in dialogue mass the congregation respond amen consecrationedit preface of the canon the roman canon dates in essentials from before st gregory the great who died in  and who is credited with adding a phrase to it see history of the roman canon it contains the main elements found in almost all rites but in an unusual arrangement and it is unclear which part should be considered to be the epiclesis dominus vobiscum et cum spiritu tuo sursum corda habemus ad dominum gratias agamus domino deo nostro dignum et iustum est the first part can be seen above at the collect the rest means lift up your hearts we lift them up to the lord let us give thanks to the lord our god it is right and just next a preface is prayed indicating specific reasons for giving thanks to god this leads to the sanctus canon or rule of consecration intercession corresponding to the reading of the diptychs in the byzantine rite—a diptych is a twoleaf painting carving or writing tablet here the priest prays for the living that god may guard unite and govern the church together with the pope and all those who holding to the truth hand on the catholic and apostolic faith then specific living people are mentioned and the congregation in the church next mary ever virgin saint joseph the apostles and some popes and other martyrs are mentioned by name as well as a generic and all your saints in communion with whom prayer is offered prayers preparatory to the consecration a prayer that god may graciously accept the offering and command that we be delivered from eternal damnation and counted among the flock of those you have chosen consecration transubstantiation and major elevation elevation of the chalice during the canon of the mass at a solemn mass the passage lk  is key in this section in summa theologiae iii   thomas aquinas addresses the interspersed phrase the mystery of faith on this phrase see mysterium fidei oblation of the victim to god an oblation is an offering the pure holy spotless victim is now offered with a prayer that god may accept the offering and command his holy angel to carry the offering to gods altar on high so that those who receive the body and blood of christ may be filled with every grace and heavenly blessing remembrance of the dead the priest now prays for the dead those who have gone before us with the sign of faith and rest in the sleep of peace and asks that they be granted a place of refreshment light and peace this is followed by a prayer that we be granted fellowship with the saints john the baptist and fourteen martyrs seven men and seven women are mentioned by name end of the canon and doxology with minor elevation the concluding doxology is through him and with him and in him o god almighty father in the unity of the holy spirit all glory and honour is yours for ever and ever amen ratifies the canon prayer elevation candleedit beuron art school representation of an elevation candle mistakenly placed at the gospel side and upon the altar until  the tridentine form of the roman missal laid down that a candle should be placed at the epistle side of the altar and that it should be lit at the showing of the consecrated sacrament to the people in practice except in monasteries and on special occasions this had fallen out of use long before pope john xxiii replaced the section on the general rubrics of the roman missal with his code of rubrics which no longer mentioned this custom on this see elevation candle communionedit before receiving communion from the chalice the priest makes the sign of the cross over himself saying in latin may the blood of our lord jesus christ keep my soul for eternal life amen the lords prayer and libera nos the libera nos is an extension of the lords prayer developing the line sed libera nos a malo but deliver us from evil the priest prays that we may be delivered from all evils and that the virgin mary mother of god together with the apostles and saints may intercede to obtain for us peace in our day fraction of the host during the preceding prayer the priest breaks the consecrated host into three parts and after concluding the prayer drops the smallest part into the chalice while praying that this commingling and consecration of the body and blood of christ may be to us who receive it effectual to life everlasting agnus dei agnus dei means lamb of god the priest then prays lamb of god who takest away the sins of the world have mercy on us he repeats this and then adds lamb of god who takest away the sins of the world grant us peace the mass of the last supper on holy thursday has have mercy on us all three times in requiem masses the petitions are grant them rest twice followed by grant them eternal rest the pax the priest asks christ to look not at the priests sins but at the faith of christs church and prays for peace and unity within the church then if a high mass is being celebrated he gives the sign of peace to the deacon saying peace be with you prayers preparatory to the communion in the first of these two prayers for himself the priests asks that by holy communion he may be freed from all his iniquities and evils be made to adhere to the commandments of jesus and never be separated from him in the second he asks let not the partaking of thy body o lord jesus christturn to my judgment and condemnation but through thy goodness may it be unto me a safeguard receiving of the body and blood of our lord the priest quietly says several prayers here before receiving communion the first is said in a low voice while taking up the host onto the paten the second of them spoken three times in a slightly audible voice while the priest holds the host in his left hand and strikes his breast with his right is based on matthew  lord i am not worthy then after having reverently consumed the host he takes up the chalice while in a low voice reciting psalm  what shall i render to the lord for all the things he hath rendered unto me i will take the chalice of salvation and i will call upon the name of the lord immediately adding psalm  praising i will call upon the lord and i shall be saved from my enemies priest on the ecce agnus dei  behold the lamb of god in the people communion if the priest is to give communion to others he holds up a small host and says aloud behold the lamb of god  and three times lord i am not worthy  he then gives communion first making with the host the sign of the cross over each communicant while saying may the body of our lord jesus christ preserve your soul for eternal life amen conclusionedit ite missa est sung by the deacon at a solemn mass prayers during the ablutions the prayers now focus on what has been received that we may receive with a pure mind that no stain of sin may remain in me whom these pure and holy sacraments have refreshed communion antiphon and postcommunion the communion antiphon is normally a portion of a psalm the postcommunion prayer is akin to the collect in being an appropriate prayer not directly drawn from scripture ite missa est blessing go it is the dismissal the word mass derives from this phrase after saying a silent prayer for himself the priest then gives the people his blessing prior to the revisions of pope pius xii and pope john xxiii the ite missa est was replaced with benedicamus domino let us bless the lord on days in which the gloria was not said and the rubrics required the priest to wear violet vestments ie masses of the season during advent septuagesima lent and passiontide vigils certain votive masses in the  missal benedicamus domino is said only when the mass is followed by another liturgical action such as the eucharistic processions on holy thursday and corpus christi in requiem masses the ite missa est is replaced with requiescant in pace with the response being amen instead of deo gratias the last gospel the priest then reads the last gospel the beginning of the gospel of john john  which recounts the incarnation of the son of god on certain occasions as for instance at the day mass on christmas day another gospel passage was read instead because that gospel is read as the gospel of the mass but pope john xxiiis revision of the rubrics decreed that on those and on other occasions the last gospel should simply be omitted prayers of the priest before and after massedit the tridentine missal includes prayers for the priest to say before and after mass in later editions of the roman missal including that of  the introductory heading of these prayers indicates that they are to be recited pro opportunitate as circumstances allow which in practice means that they are merely optional and may be omitted the original tridentine missal presents most of the prayers as obligatory indicating as optional only a very long prayer attributed to saint ambrose which later editions divide into seven sections each to be recited on only one day of the week and two other prayers attributed to saint ambrose and saint thomas aquinas respectively in addition to these three prayers the original tridentine missal proposes for the priest to recite before he celebrates mass the whole of psalms –   the numbering is that of the septuagint and vulgate and a series of collectstyle prayers later editions add after the three that in the original missal are only optional prayers to the blessed virgin saint joseph all the angels and saints and the saint whose mass is to be celebrated but as has been said treats as optional all the prayers before mass even those originally given as obligatory the original tridentine missal proposes for recitation by the priest after mass three prayers including the adoro te devote later editions place before these three the canticle of the three youths dan with three collects and follow them with the anima christi and seven more prayers treating as optional even the three prescribed in the original tridentine missal leonine prayersedit from  to  the holy see prescribed the recitation after low mass of certain prayers originally for the solution of the roman question and after this problem was solved by the lateran treaty to permit tranquillity and freedom to profess the faith to be restored to the afflicted people of russia these prayers are known as the leonine prayers because it was pope leo xiii who on  january  ordered their recitation throughout the world in what had been the papal states they were already in use since  the prayers comprised three ave marias one salve regina followed by a versicle and response and a collect prayer that from  on asked for the conversion of sinners and the freedom and exaltation of holy mother the church and again from  on a prayer to saint michael in  pope pius x added a thricerepeated most sacred heart of jesus have mercy on us in  with effect from  march  the holy see ended the obligation to recite the leonine prayers after low mass however the leonine prayers are sometimes still recited after presentday celebrations of tridentine mass although they are not included even in the  edition of the tridentine missal participation by the peopleedit nuptial low mass distribution of communion at a tridentine mass typically the faithful kneel and receive in the mouth and women wear a headcovering the participation of the congregation at the tridentine mass is interior involving eye and heart and exterior by mouth except in the dialogue mass form which arose about  and led to a more active exterior participation of the congregation the people present at the tridentine mass do not recite out loud the prayers of the mass only the server or servers join with the priest in reciting the prayers at the foot of the altar which include the confiteor and in speaking the other responses most of the prayers that the priest says are spoken inaudibly including almost all the mass of the faithful the offertory prayers the canon of the mass except for the preface and the final doxology and apart from the agnus dei those between the lords prayer and the postcommunion at a solemn mass or missa cantata a choir sings the servers responses except for the prayers at the foot of the altar the choir sings the introit the kyrie the gloria the gradual the tract or alleluia the credo the offertory and communion antiphons the sanctus and the agnus dei of these only the five that form part of the ordinary of the mass are usually sung at a missa cantata in addition to the gregorian chant music for these polyphonic compositions exist some quite elaborate the priest largely says quietly the words of the chants and then recites other prayers while the choir continues the chant different levels of celebrationedit there are various forms of celebration of the tridentine mass pontifical high mass celebrated by a bishop accompanied by an assisting priest deacon subdeacon thurifer acolytes and other ministers under the guidance of a priest acting as master of ceremonies most often the specific parts assigned to deacon and subdeacon are performed by priests the parts that are said aloud are all chanted except that the prayers at the foot of the altar which before the reform of pope pius v were said in the sacristy are said quietly by the bishop with the deacon and the subdeacon while the choir sings the introit the main difference between a pontifical and an ordinary high mass is that the bishop remains at his throne almost all the time until the offertory solemn or high mass latin missa solemnis offered by a priest accompanied by a deacon and subdeacon and the other ministers mentioned above missa cantata latin for sung mass celebrated by a priest without deacon and subdeacon and thus a form of low mass but with some parts the three variable prayers the scripture readings preface pater noster and ite missa est sung by the priest and other parts introit kyrie gloria gradual tract or alleluia credo offertory antiphon sanctus and benedictus agnus dei and communion antiphon sung by the choir incense may be used exactly as at a solemn mass with the exception of incensing the celebrant after the gospel which is not done low mass the priest sings no part of the mass though in some places a choir or the congregation sings during the mass hymns not always directly related to the mass in its article the liturgy of the mass the  catholic encyclopedia describes how when concelebration ceased to be practised in western europe low mass became distinguished from high mass the separate celebrations then involved the building of many altars in one church and the reduction of the ritual to the simplest possible form the deacon and subdeacon were in this case dispensed with the celebrant took their part as well as his own one server took the part of the choir and of all the other ministers everything was said instead of being sung the incense and kiss of peace were omitted so we have the wellknown rite of low mass missa privata this then reacted on high mass missa solemnis so that at high mass too the celebrant himself recites everything even though it be sung by the deacon subdeacon or choir on the origin of the missa cantata the same source gives the following information  high mass is the norm it is only in the complete rite with deacon and subdeacon that the ceremonies can be understood thus the rubrics of the ordinary of the mass always suppose that the mass is high low mass said by a priest alone with one server is a shortened and simplified form of the same thing its ritual can be explained only by a reference to high mass for instance the celebrant goes over to the north side of the altar to read the gospel because that is the side to which the deacon goes in procession at high mass he turns round always by the right because at high mass he should not turn his back to the deacon and so on a sung mass missa cantata is a modern compromise it is really a low mass since the essence of high mass is not the music but the deacon and subdeacon only in churches which have no ordained person except one priest and in which high mass is thus impossible is it allowed to celebrate the mass on sundays and feasts with most of the adornment borrowed from high mass with singing and generally with incense revision of the roman missaledit pius xii began in earnest the work of revising the roman missal with a thorough revision of the rites of holy week which after an experimental period beginning in  was made obligatory in  the mass that used to be said on holy thursday morning was moved to the evening necessitating a change in the rule that previously had required fasting from midnight the good friday service was moved to the afternoon holy communion was no longer reserved for the priest alone as before hosts consecrated at the holy thursday mass were used and the priest no longer received part of the host in unconsecrated wine the easter vigil service that used to be held in morning of holy saturday was moved to the night that leads to easter sunday and many changes were made to the content in  pope john xxiii – ordered the suppression of the word perfidis unbelieving ie not believing in jesus applied to the jews in the rites for good friday he revised the rubrics to the order of mass and the breviary two years later in  he made some more minor modifications on the occasion of publishing a new typical edition of the roman missal this is the edition authorized for use by virtue of the quattuor abhinc annos indult see below under present status of the tridentine mass among the other changes he made and that were included in the  missal were adding st josephs name to the roman canon eliminating the second confiteor before communion suppressing  feasts such as st peters chair in rome or more accurately combining both feasts of st peters chair into one as they originally had been incorporating the abolition of  festal octaves and  vigils of feasts and other changes made by pope pius xii and modifying rubrics especially for solemn high masses among the names that disappeared from the roman missal was that of st philomena her liturgical celebration had never been admitted to the general roman calendar but from  it had been included with an indication that the mass was to be taken entirely from the common in the section headed masses for some places ie only those places for which it had been specially authorized but her name had already in  been ordered to be removed from all liturgical calendars on  december  the second vatican council decreed in chapter ii of its constitution on the sacred liturgy sacrosanctum concilium the rite of the mass is to be revised  the rites are to be simplified due care being taken to preserve their substance parts which with the passage of time came to be duplicated or were added with little advantage are to be omitted other parts which suffered loss through accidents of history are to be restored to the vigor they had in the days of the holy fathers as may seem useful or necessary the treasures of the bible are to be opened up more lavishly so that a richer fare may be provided for the faithful at the table of god’s word  a suitable place may be allotted to the vernacular in masses which are celebrated with the people  communion under both kinds may be granted when the bishops think fitas for instance to the newly ordained in the mass of their sacred ordination to the newly professed in the mass of their religious profession and to the newly baptized in the mass which follows their baptism the instruction inter oecumenici of  september  initiated the application to the mass of the decisions that the council had taken less than a year before permission was given for use only in mass celebrated with the people of the vernacular language especially in the biblical readings and the reintroduced prayers of the faithful but until the whole of the ordinary of the mass has been revised in the chants kyrie gloria creed sanctus agnus dei and the entrance offertory and communion antiphons and in the parts that involved dialogue with the people and in the our father which the people could now recite entirely together with the priest most episcopal conferences quickly approved interim vernacular translations generally different from country to country and after having them confirmed by the holy see published them in  other changes included the omission of psalm   at the start of mass and the last gospel at the end both of which pope pius v had first inserted into the missal having previously been private prayers said by the priest in the sacristy and the leonine prayers of pope leo xiii the canon of the mass which continued to be recited silently was kept in latin three years later the instruction tres abhinc annos of  may  gave permission for use of the vernacular even in the canon of the mass and allowed it to be said audibly and even in part to be chanted the vernacular could be used even at mass celebrated without the people being present use of the maniple was made optional and at three ceremonies at which the cope was previously the obligatory vestment the chasuble could be used instead pope paul vi continued implementation of the councils directives ordering with apostolic constitution missale romanum of holy thursday  april  publication of a new official edition of the roman missal which appeared in latin in  opposition to the latest revisions of the liturgyedit some traditionalist catholics reject to a greater or lesser extent the changes made since  see traditionalist catholic none advocate returning to the original  form of the liturgy though some may perhaps wish a reestablishment of its form before pius xs revision of the rubrics in  some do refuse to accept the  changes in the liturgy of palm sunday and the easter triduum and in the liturgical calendar see general roman calendar of pope pius xii and instead use the general roman calendar as in  others accept the  changes by pius xii but not those of pope john xxiii others again in accordance with the authorization granted by pope benedict xvi in summorum pontificum use the missal and calendar as it was in  some of them argue that unlike earlier reforms the revision of  which replaced the tridentine mass with the mass of pope paul vi represented a major break with the past they consider that the content of the revised liturgy is in catholic terms seriously deficient and defective some hold that it is displeasing to god and that no catholic should attend it when a preliminary text of two of the sections of the revised missal was published in  archbishop marcel lefebvre gathered a group of twelve theologians who under his direction wrote a study of the text they stated that it represents both as a whole and in its details a striking departure from the catholic theology of the mass as it was formulated in session  of the council of trent cardinal alfredo ottaviani a former prefect of the sacred congregation for the doctrine of the faith supported this study with a letter of  september  to pope paul vi cardinal antonio bacci signed the same letter the critical study became known as the ottaviani intervention cardinal ottaviani subsequently stated in writing that he had not intended his letter to be made public and that pope paul vis doctrinal exposition on  november and  november  of the revised liturgy in its definitive form meant that no one can be genuinely scandalised any more jean madiran a critic of vatican ii and foundereditor of the french journal itinéraires claimed that this letter was fraudulently presented to the elderly and already blind cardinal for his signature by his secretary monsignor and future cardinal gilberto agustoni and that agustoni resigned shortly afterwards this allegation remains unproven and madiran himself was not an eyewitness of the alleged deception in october  a meeting of the synod of bishops had already given its opinion on a still earlier draft of the  members  approved it as it stood  approved it but suggested various modifications  abstained and  voted against from the s onwards western countries have experienced a drop in mass attendance in the united states from  of catholics attending in  to  attending by  these same countries saw a decline in seminary enrollments and in the number of priests in the united states from  ordinations in  to  in  and a general erosion of belief in the doctrines of the catholic faith opponents of the revision of the mass liturgy argue citing opinion poll evidence in their support that the revision contributed to this decline others pointing among other considerations to the fact that globally there are more priests and seminarians now than in previous years in  there were  major seminarians worldwide in  there were  an increase of  at a time however when there was an increase of global population of  suggest that the apparent decline of catholic practice in the west is due to the general influence of secularism and liberalism on western societies rather than to developments within the catholic church attitudes of popes since the second vatican counciledit pope paul viedit following the introduction of the mass of paul vi in  the holy see granted a significant number of permissions for the use of the former liturgy for example elderly priests were not required to switch to celebrating the new form in england and wales occasional celebrations of the tridentine mass were allowed in virtue of what became known as the agatha christie indult however there was no general worldwide legal framework allowing for the celebration of the rite following the rise of the traditionalist catholic movement in the s pope paul vi reportedly declined to liberalise its use further on the grounds that it had become a politically charged symbol associated with opposition to his policies pope john paul iiedit in  the holy see sent a letter known as quattuor abhinc annos to the presidents of the worlds episcopal conferences this document empowered diocesan bishops to authorise on certain conditions celebrations of the tridentine mass for priests and laypeople who requested them in  following the excommunication of archbishop marcel lefebvre and four bishops that he had consecrated the pope issued a further document a motu proprio known as ecclesia dei which stated that respect must everywhere be shown for the feelings of all those who are attached to the latin liturgical tradition the pope urged bishops to give a wide and generous application to the provisions of quattuor abhinc annos and established the pontifical commission ecclesia dei to oversee relations between rome and traditionalist catholics the holy see itself granted authorisation to use the tridentine mass to a significant number of priests and priestly societies such as the priestly fraternity of st peter the institute of christ the king sovereign priest and the personal apostolic administration of saint john mary vianney some diocesan bishops however declined to authorise celebrations within their dioceses or did so only to a limited extent in some cases the difficulty was that those seeking the permission were hostile to the church authorities other refusals of permission were alleged to have stemmed from certain bishops disapproval in principle of celebrations of the tridentine liturgy pope benedict xviedit as a cardinal joseph ratzinger was regarded as having a particular interest in the liturgy and as being favourable towards the older rite of mass he famously criticized the erratic way in which contrary to official policy many priests celebrated the revised rite in september  the pontifical commission ecclesia dei established the institute of the good shepherd made up of former members of the society of st pius x in bordeaux france with permission to use the tridentine liturgy this step was met with some discontent from french clergy and thirty priests wrote an open letter to the pope consistently with its previous policy the society of st pius x rejected the move following repeated rumours that the use of the tridentine mass would be liberalised the pope issued a motu proprio called summorum pontificum on  july  together with an accompanying letter to the worlds bishops the pope declared that the roman missal promulgated by paul vi is the ordinary expression of the lex orandi law of prayer of the catholic church of the latin rite nevertheless the roman missal promulgated by st pius v and reissued by st john xxiii is to be considered as an extraordinary expression of that same lex orandi he further stated that the  missal  was never juridically abrogated he replaced with new rules those of quattuor abhinc annos on use of the older form essentially authorization for using the  form for parish masses and those celebrated on public occasions such as a wedding is devolved from the local bishop to the priest in charge of a church and any priest of the latin rite may use the  roman missal in masses celebrated without the people a term that does not exclude attendance by other worshippers lay or clergy while requests by groups of catholics wishing to use the tridentine liturgy in parish masses are to be dealt with by the parish priest or the rector of the church rather than as before by the local bishop the pope and cardinal darío castrillón have stated that the bishops authority is not thereby undermined present regulationsedit the regulations set out in summorum pontificum provide that in masses celebrated without the people every latin rite priest may use either the  roman missal or that of paul vi except during the easter triduum when masses without participation by the people are no longer allowed celebrations of mass in this form formerly referred to as private masses may as before be attended by laypeople who ask to be admitted in parish masses where there is a stable group of laypeople who adhere to the earlier liturgical tradition the parish priest should willingly accept their requests to be allowed to celebrate the mass according to the  missal and should ensure that their welfare harmonises with the ordinary pastoral care of the parish under the guidance of the bishop in accordance with canon  of the code of canon law avoiding discord and favouring the unity of the church mass may be celebrated using the  missal on working days while on sundays and feast days one such celebration may be held for priests and laypeople who request it the parish priest should allow celebrations of the  form on special occasions such as weddings funerals and pilgrimages communities belonging to institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life which wish to use the  missal for conventual or community celebration in their oratories may do so with letter  of  january  the pontifical council ecclesia dei responded positively to a question whether a parish priest pastor or another priest may on his own initiative publicly celebrate the extraordinary form along with the customary regular use of the new form so that the faithful both young and old can familiarize themselves with the old rites and benefit from their perceptible beauty and transcendence although the council accompanied this response with the observation that a stable group of the faithful attached to the older form has a right to assist at mass in the extraordinary form a website that published the response interpreted it as not requiring the existence of such a stable group present practiceedit the publication of summorum pontificum has led to an increase in the number of regularly scheduled public tridentine masses on  june  cardinal darío castrillón hoyos told a london press conference that pope benedict wants every parish to offer both the old and the new forms for sunday mass the cardinal said that the vatican was preparing to instruct seminaries to teach all students the tridentine form of the roman rite the complexity of the rubrics makes it difficult for priests accustomed to the simpler modern form to celebrate the tridentine form properly and it is unclear how many have the required knowledge some traditionalist catholic priests and organisations holding that no official permission is required to use any form of the tridentine mass celebrate it without regularizing their situation and sometimes using editions of the roman missal earlier than the  edition approved in summorum pontificum in order to provide for priests who celebrate the tridentine mass publishers have issued facsimiles or reprintings of old missals there were two new printings of the  tridentine missal in  one with the imprimatur of bishop fabian bruskewitz of lincoln nebraska by baronius press in association with the priestly fraternity of st peter the other by the society of st pius xs publishing house angelus press there was a new printing of a facsimile  tridentine altar missal in  by pcp books some other missals reproduced date from before  and so do not have the revised holy week rites promulgated by pope pius xii they are used by traditionalists who reject pius xiis liturgical changes as well as such altar missals for use

for the forms of the mass liturgy prior to  see pretridentine mass elevation of the chalice after the consecration during a solemn mass the tridentine mass now officially often referred to as the extraordinary form of the roman rite extraordinary form for short latin forma extraordinaria is the roman rite mass which appears in typical editions of the roman missal published from  to  the most widely used mass liturgy in the world until the introduction of the mass of paul vi in  it is celebrated in ecclesiastical latin tridentine is derived from the latin tridentinus related to the city of tridentum modernday trent italy in response to a decision of the council of trent pope pius v promulgated the  roman missal making it mandatory throughout the latin church except in places and religious orders with missals from before  despite being often described as the traditional latin mass the mass of paul vi the novus ordo missae that replaced it as the ordinary form of the roman rite has its official text in latin and is sometimes celebrated in that language in  pope benedict xvi issued the motu proprio summorum pontificum accompanied by a letter to the worlds bishops authorizing use of the tridentine mass and ritual for competent priests the pope stated that the  edition of the roman missal is to be considered an extraordinary form forma extraordinaria of the roman rite of which the  mass of paul vi is the ordinary normal or standard form since that is the only authorized extraordinary form some refer to the  tridentine mass as the extraordinary form of the mass the  tridentine mass is sometimes referred to as the usus antiquior older use or forma antiquior older form to differentiate it from the mass of paul vi again in the sense of being the only one of the older forms for which authorization has been granted in masses celebrated without the people latin rite catholic priests are free to use either the  tridentine missal or the ordinary form missal these masses may—observing all the norms of law—also be attended by faithful who of their own free will ask to be admitted permission to use the tridentine mass as parish liturgies may be given by the

celebrating the tridentine mass was and is latin however in dalmatia and parts of istria in croatia the liturgy was celebrated in church slavonic and authorisation for use of this language was extended to some other slavic regions between  and  after the publication of the  edition of the roman missal the  instruction on implementing the constitution on sacred liturgy of the second vatican council laid down that normally the epistle and gospel from the mass of the day shall be read in the vernacular episcopal conferences were to decide with the consent of the holy see what other parts if any of the mass were to be celebrated in the vernacular outside the roman catholic church the vernacular language was introduced into the celebration of the tridentine mass by some old catholics and anglocatholics with the introduction of the english missal some western rite orthodox christians particularly in the antiochian orthodox archdiocese of north america use the tridentine mass in the vernacular with minor alterations under the title of the divine liturgy of st gregory most old catholics use the tridentine mass either in the vernacular or in latin terminologyedit a pre roman rite high altar decorated with reredos and fixed on a three step platform at which the prayers at the foot of the altar are said leaning against the tabernacle and two of the candlesticks are altar cards to remind the celebrant of the words when he is away from the missal the catholic church uses the term extraordinary form of the roman rite mass among other terms the most widespread term for the rite other than tridentine mass is latin mass likewise the ordinary form of the roman rite mass was promulgated in latin and can be celebrated in that language occasionally the term gregorian rite is used when talking about the tridentine massdiscuss as is more frequently tridentine rite pope benedict xvi declared it inappropriate to speak of the versions of the roman missal of before and after  as if they were two rites rather he said it is a matter of a twofold use of one and the same rite traditionalist catholics whose bestknown characteristic is an attachment to the tridentine mass frequently refer to it as the traditional mass or the traditional latin mass they describe as a codifying of the form of the mass the preparation of pius vs edition of the roman missal of which he said that the experts to whom he had entrusted the work collated the existing text with ancient manuscripts and writings restored it to the original form and rite of the holy fathers and further emended it to distinguish this form of mass from the mass of paul vi traditionalist catholics sometimes call it the mass of the ages and say that it comes down to us from the church of the apostles and ultimately indeed from him who is its principal priest and its spotless victim pope st pius vs revision of the liturgyedit at the time of the council of trent the traditions preserved in printed and manuscript missals varied considerably and standardization was sought both within individual dioceses and throughout the latin west standardization was required also in order to prevent the introduction into the liturgy of protestant ideas in the wake of the protestant reformation pope st pius v accordingly imposed uniformity by law in  with the papal bull quo primum ordering use of the roman missal as revised by him he allowed only those rites that were at least  years old to survive the promulgation of his  missal several of the rites that remained in existence were progressively abandoned though the ambrosian rite survives in milan italy and neighbouring areas stretching even into switzerland and the mozarabic rite remains in use to a limited extent in toledo and madrid spain the carmelite carthusian and dominican religious orders kept their rites but in the second half of the th century two of these three chose to adopt the roman rite the rite of braga in northern portugal seems to have been practically abandoned since  november  that archdiocese authorizes its use only on an optional basis beginning in the late th century france and neighbouring areas such as münster cologne and trier in germany saw a flurry of independent missals published by bishops influenced by jansenism and gallicanism this ended when abbot guéranger and others initiated in the th century a campaign to return to the roman missal pius vs revision of the liturgy had as one of its declared aims the restoration of the roman missal to the original form and rite of the holy fathers due to the relatively limited resources available to his scholars this aim was in fact not realised three different printings of pius vs roman missal with minor variations appeared in  a folio and a quarto edition in rome and a folio edition in venice a reproduction of what is considered to be the earliest referred to therefore as the editio princeps was produced in  in the course of the printing of the editio princeps some corrections were made by pasting revised texts over parts of the already printed pages there were several printings again in the following year  with various corrections of the text historical variationsedit missale romanum in croatian glagolitic script printed in  in the apostolic constitution papal bull quo primum with which he prescribed use of his  edition of the roman missal pius v decreed we order and enjoin that nothing must be added to our recently published missal nothing omitted from it nor anything whatsoever be changed within it this of course did not exclude changes by a pope and pope pius v himself added to the missal the feast of our lady of victory to celebrate the victory of lepanto of  october  his immediate successor pope gregory xiii changed the name of this feast to the most holy rosary of the blessed virgin mary and pope john xxiii changed it to our lady of the rosary pius vs work in severely reducing the number of feasts in the roman calendar see this comparison was very soon further undone by his successors feasts that he had abolished such as those of the presentation of mary saint anne and saint anthony of padua were restored even before clement viiis  typical edition of the missal was issued in the course of the following centuries new feasts were repeatedly added and the ranks of certain feasts were raised or lowered a comparison between pope pius vs tridentine calendar and the general roman calendar of  shows the changes made from  to  pope pius xii made a general revision in  and pope john xxiii made further general revisions in  simplifying the terminology concerning the ranking of liturgical celebrations while keeping on  december what he called the feast of the conception of blessed mary omitting the word immaculate pius v suppressed the existing special mass for the feast directing that the mass for the nativity of mary with the word nativity replaced by conception be used instead part of that earlier mass was revived in the mass that pope pius ix ordered to be used on the feast typical editions of the roman missaledit altar of santa cecilia in trastevere as arranged in  one of many churches in rome whose altar placed at the western end of the church was positioned so that the priest necessarily faced east and so towards the people when celebrating mass in addition to such occasional changes the roman missal was subjected to general revisions whenever a new typical edition an official edition whose text was to be reproduced in printings by all publishers was issued after pius vs original tridentine roman missal the first new typical edition was promulgated in  by pope clement viii who in  had issued a revised edition of the vulgate the bible texts in the missal of pope pius v did not correspond exactly to the new vulgate and so clement edited and revised pope pius vs missal making alterations both in the scriptural texts and in other matters he abolished some prayers that the  missal obliged the priest to say on entering the church shortened the two prayers to be said after the confiteor directed that the words haec quotiescumque feceritis in meam memoriam facietis do this in memory of me should not be said while displaying the chalice to the people after the consecration but before doing so inserted directions at several points of the canon that the priest was to pronounce the words inaudibly suppressed the rule that at high mass the priest even if not a bishop was to give the final blessing with three signs of the cross and rewrote the rubrics introducing for instance the ringing of a small bell the next typical edition was issued in  when pope urban viii made another general revision of the roman missal there was no further typical edition until that of pope leo xiii in  it introduced only minor changes not profound enough to merit having the papal bull of its promulgation included in the missal as the bulls of  and  were in  with the bull divino afflatu pope pius x made significant changes in the rubrics he died in  so it fell to his successor pope benedict xv to issue a new typical edition incorporating his changes this  edition included a new section headed additions and changes in the rubrics of the missal in accordance with the bull divino afflatu and the subsequent decrees of the sacred congregation of rites this additional section was almost as long as the previous section on the general rubrics of the missal which continued to be printed unchanged pope pius xii radically revised the palm sunday and easter

missal changes made to the liturgy in  and  in the wake of decisions of the second vatican council were not incorporated in the roman missal but were reflected in the provisional vernacular

in  and  and completely in  in pope paul vis motu proprio mysterii paschalis again reducing the number of feasts  missaledit the roman missal issued by pope john xxiii in  differed from earlier editions in a number of ways it incorporated the change made by john xxiii in  when he inserted into the canon of the mass the name of saint joseph the first change for centuries in the canon of the mass it incorporated major changes that pope pius xii made in  in the liturgy of palm sunday and the easter triduum these included abolition of the ceremonies whereby the blessing of palms on palm sunday resembled a mass with epistle gospel preface and sanctus suppression of the knocking three times on the closed doors before returning to the church after the blessing and distribution of the palms omission of the prayers at the foot of the altar and of the last gospel on holy thursday the washing of feet was incorporated into the mass instead of being an independent ceremony if done by a bishop  men not  had their feet washed the mass itself was said in the evening instead of the morning and some of its prayers were removed or altered on good friday elements that suggested the usual practices of the mass were removed the sacred ministers began the liturgy in alb and for celebrant and deacon black stoles rather than respectively in black chasuble dalmatic and tunicle as per a typical mass the sacred ministers donned their vestments without maniples only for the solemn intercessions in which the celebrant wore a cope instead of a chasuble and removed them for the adoration of the cross the sacred ministers changed to violet vestments again without maniples for the distribution of holy communion let us pray let us kneel arise was added at the prayer for the jews and the adjective perfidis was removed see good friday prayer for the jews an afternoon communion service replaced the morning mass of the presanctified at which the priest alone received the earlierconsecrated host and drank unconsecrated wine into which a small portion of the consecrated host had been put the easter vigil was moved from holy saturday morning to the following nighttime the use of a triple candle was abolished and other changes were made both to the initial ceremonies centred on the paschal candle and to other parts such as the reduction from twelve to four of the prophecies read and the introduction of a renewal of baptismal promises for the laity notable for being the first time since the codification of the missal of pope pius v that the vernacular was permitted to be used in such a manner it incorporated the rubrical changes made by pope pius xiis  decree cum nostra which included vigils were abolished except those of easter christmas ascension pentecost saints peter and paul saint john the baptist and saint lawrence all octaves were abolished except those of easter christmas and pentecost no more than three collects were to be said at low mass and one at solemn mass its calendar incorporated both the changes made by pope pius xii in  general roman calendar of pope pius xii and those introduced by pope john xxiii himself with his  code

continued use of this  edition of the roman missal as an extraordinary form of the roman rite alongside the later form introduced in  which is now the normal or ordinary form pre forms of the roman rite which some individuals and groups employ are not authorized for liturgical use liturgical structureedit the mass is divided into two parts the mass of the catechumens and the mass of the faithful catechumens those being instructed in the faith were once dismissed after the first half not having yet professed the faith profession of faith was considered essential for participation in the eucharistic sacrifice this rule of the didache is still in effect it is only one of the three conditions baptism right faith and right living for admission to receiving holy communion that the catholic church has always applied and that were already mentioned in the early nd century by saint justin martyr and this food is called among us the eucharist of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins and unto regeneration and who is so living as christ has enjoined first apology chapter lxvi before massedit asperges sprinkling with holy water psalm   is an optional penitential rite that ordinarily precedes only the principal mass on sunday in the sacristy a priest wearing an alb if he is to celebrate the mass or surplice if he is not the celebrant of the mass and vested with a stole which is the color of the day if the priest is the celebrant of the mass or purple if he is not the celebrant of the mass exorcises and blesses salt and water then puts the blessed salt into the water by thrice sprinkling it in the form of a cross while saying once commixtio salis et aquæ pariter fiat in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti may a mixture of salt and water now be made in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit after that the priest vested in a cope of the color of the day while the choir sings an antiphon and a verse of psalm  or  sprinkles with the holy water the altar three times and then the clergy and the congregation this rite if used precedes the prayers at the foot of the altar during the easter season the asperges me verse is replaced by the vidi aquam verse and alleluia is added to the ostende nobis verse and to its response following the asperges mass begins mass of the catechumensedit the first part is the mass of the catechumens prayers at the foot of the altaredit prayers at the foot of the altar the sequence of prayers at the foot of the altar is sign of the cross the priest after processing in—at solemn mass with deacon and subdeacon master of ceremonies and servers and at other masses with one or more servers—and at low mass placing the veiled chalice on the centre of the altar makes the sign of the cross at the foot of the altar at solemn mass the chalice is placed beforehand on the credence table psalm  psalm  mt ie masoretic numbering known by its incipit iudica me is recited except in masses of the season during passiontide and in requiem masses it is preceded and followed by an antiphon of psalm   mt introibo ad altare dei ad deum qui lætificat iuventutem meam translation i shall go in to the altar of god the god who gives joy to my youth is recited by the priest alternating with the deacon and subdeacon if present or servers psalm  is recited priest makes the sign of the cross our help is in the name of the lord servers who made heaven and earth the double form of a prayer of general confession of sins known by its incipit confiteor i confess is recited priest while bowing low confíteor deo omnipoténti beátæ maríæ semper vírgini

fratres te pater oráre pro me ad dóminum deum nostrum translation i confess to almighty god to blessed mary ever virgin to blessed michael the archangel to blessed john the baptist to the holy apostles peter and paul to all the saints and to you brethren that i have sinned exceedingly in thought word and deed through my fault through my fault through my most grievous fault therefore i beseech blessed mary ever virgin  and you brethren to pray to the lord our god for me the servers pray for the priest may almighty god have mercy on thee forgive thee thy sins and bring thee to life everlasting then it is the ministers or servers turn to confess sinfulness and to ask for prayers they use the same words as those used by the priest except that they say you father in place of you brethren and the priest responds with the same prayer that the servers have used for him but using the plural number plus an extra prayer some verses are then said by priest and ministers or servers ending with the priest saying oremus te domine let us pray after this he ascends to the altar praying silently take away from us our iniquities that with pure minds we may worthily enter into the holy of holies a reference to exodus   kings   kings   chronicles  ezekiel  and others he places his joined hands on the edge of the altar so that only the tips of the small fingers touch the front of it and silently prays that by the merits of the saints whose relics are in the altar god may pardon all his sins at the words quorum relíquiæ hic sunt whose relics are here he spreads his hands and kisses the altar priest at the altaredit dominus vobiscum the lord be with you before the collect in the tridentine mass the priest should keep his eyes downcast at this point introit the priest again makes the sign of the cross while he begins to read the introit which is usually taken from a psalm exceptions occur eg the introit for easter sunday is adapted from wis  and the antiphon in masses of the blessed virgin mary was from the poet sedulius this evolved from the practice of singing a full psalm interspersed with the antiphon during the entrance of the clergy before the prayers at the foot of the altar were added to the mass in medieval times this is indicated by the very name of introit kyrie this part of mass is a linguistic marker of the origins of the roman liturgy in greek kyrie eleison christe eleison kyrie eleison means lord have mercy christ have mercy each phrase is said or sung three times gloria in excelsis deo the first line of the gloria is taken from lk  the gloria is omitted during the penitential liturgical seasons of advent septuagesima lent and passiontide in which violet vestments are worn but is used on feasts falling during such seasons as well as on holy thursday it is always omitted for a requiem mass the collect the priest turns toward the people and says dominus vobiscum the servers respond et cum spiritu tuo the lord be with you and with thy spirit the collect follows a prayer not drawn directly from scripture it tends to reflect the season instructionedit the priest reads the epistle primarily an extract from the letters of st paul to various churches in his motu proprio summorum pontificum pope benedict xvi has permitted this to be read in the vernacular language when mass is celebrated with the people between the epistle and the gospel two rarely three choir responses are sung or said usually these are a gradual followed by an alleluia but between septuagesima sunday and holy saturday or in a requiem mass or other penitential mass the alleluia is replaced by a tract and between easter sunday and pentecost the gradual is replaced by a second alleluia on a few exceptional occasions most notably easter pentecost corpus christi and in a requiem mass a sequence follows the alleluia or tract the gradual is partly composed of a portion of a psalm the gospel reading an extract from one of the four gospels before the reading or chanting of the gospel the priest prays cleanse my heart and my lips o almighty god who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet isaias a reference to isaiah  in this passage after being cleansed by the angel isaiah was instructed to prophesy the homily the rite of mass as revised by pope pius v the tridentine mass does not consider a sermon obligatory and speaks of it instead as merely optional it presumes that the creed if it is to be said will follow the gospel immediately but adds if however someone is to preach the homilist after the gospel has been finished preaches and when the sermon or moral address has been completed the credo is said or if it is not to be said the offertory is sung by contrast the roman missal as revised by pope paul vi declares that the homily may not be omitted without a grave reason from mass celebrated with the people attending on sundays and holy days of obligation and that it is recommended on other days the creed this is the nicene creed professing faith in god the father in god the son the word made flesh in god the holy ghost and in the holy church at the mention of the incarnation the celebrant and the congregation genuflect mass of the faithfuledit the second part is the mass of the faithful offertoryedit offertory verse after greeting the people once more dominus vobiscumet cum spiritu tuo and giving the invitation to pray oremus the priest enters upon the mass of the faithful from which the nonbaptized were once excluded he reads the offertory verse a short quotation from holy scripture which varies with the mass of each day with hands joined offering of bread and wine the priest offers the host holding it on the paten at breast level and praying that although he is unworthy god may accept this spotless host or victim the basic meaning of hostia in latin for his own innumerable sins offences and neglects for all those present and for all faithful christians living and dead that it may avail unto salvation of himself and those mentioned he then mixes a few drops of water with the wine which will later become the blood of jesus and holding the chalice so that the lip of the chalice is about the height of his lips offers the chalice of salvation asking that it may ascend with a sweet fragrance he then prays a prayer of contrition adapted from dan  incensing of the offerings and of the faithful at a high mass the priest blesses the incense then incenses the bread and wine among the prayers the priest says is psalm  let my prayer o lord be directed as incense in thy sight which is prayed as he incenses the altar the priest then gives the thurible to the deacon who incenses the priest then the other ministers and the congregation washing the hands the priest prays psalm  i will wash my hands among the innocent prayer to the most holy trinity this prayer asks that the divine trinity may receive the oblation being made in remembrance of the passion resurrection and ascension of jesus and in honour of blessed mary ever virgin and the other saints that it may avail to their honour and our salvation and that they may vouchsafe to intercede for us in heaven orate fratres suscipiat and secret amen concludes offertory here the priest turns to the congregation and says the first two words orate fratres in an elevated tone and then turns around while finishing the exhortation in the secret tone pray brethren that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to god the father almighty the altar servers respond with the suscipiat to which the priest secretly responds amen suscipiat dominus sacrificium de manibus tuis ad laudem et gloriam nominis sui ad utilitatem quoque nostram totiusque ecclesiæ suae sanctæ a translation in the english is may the lord accept this sacrifice at your hands to the praise and glory of his name for our good and the good of all his holy church the priest then says the days secret inaudibly and concludes it with per omnia sæcula sæculorum aloud the altar servers and in dialogue mass the congregation respond amen consecrationedit preface of the canon the roman canon dates in essentials from before st gregory the great who died in  and who is credited with adding a phrase to it see history of the roman canon it contains the main elements found in almost all rites but in an unusual arrangement and it is unclear which part should be considered to be the epiclesis dominus vobiscum et cum spiritu tuo sursum corda habemus ad dominum gratias agamus domino deo nostro dignum et iustum est the first part can be seen above at the collect the rest means lift up your hearts we lift them up to the lord let us give thanks to the lord our god it is right and just next a preface is prayed indicating specific reasons for giving thanks to god this leads to the sanctus canon or rule of consecration intercession corresponding to the reading of the diptychs in the byzantine rite—a diptych is a twoleaf painting carving or writing tablet here the priest prays for the living that god may guard unite and govern the church together with the pope and all those who holding to the truth hand on the catholic and apostolic faith then specific living people are mentioned and the congregation in the church next mary ever virgin saint joseph the apostles and some popes and other martyrs are mentioned by name as well as a generic and all your saints in communion with whom prayer is offered prayers preparatory to the consecration a prayer that god may graciously accept the offering and command that we be delivered from eternal damnation and counted among the flock of those you have chosen consecration transubstantiation and major elevation elevation of the chalice during the canon of the mass at a solemn mass the passage lk  is key in this section in summa theologiae iii   thomas aquinas addresses the interspersed phrase the mystery of faith on this phrase see mysterium fidei oblation of the victim to god an oblation is an offering the pure holy spotless victim is now offered with a prayer that god may accept the offering and command his holy angel to carry the offering to gods altar on high so that those who receive the body and blood of christ may be filled with every grace and heavenly blessing remembrance of the dead the priest now prays for the dead those who have gone before us with the sign of faith and rest in the sleep of peace and asks that they be granted a place of refreshment light and peace this is followed by a prayer that we be granted fellowship with the saints john the baptist and fourteen martyrs seven men and seven women are mentioned by name end of the canon and doxology with minor elevation the concluding doxology is through him and with him and in him o god almighty father in the unity of the holy spirit all glory and honour is yours for ever and ever amen ratifies the canon prayer elevation candleedit beuron art school representation of an elevation candle mistakenly placed at the gospel side and upon the altar until  the tridentine form of the roman missal laid down that a candle should be placed at the epistle side of the altar and that it should be lit at the showing of the consecrated sacrament to the people in practice except in monasteries and on special occasions this had fallen out of use long before pope john xxiii replaced the section on the general rubrics of the roman missal with his code of rubrics which no longer mentioned this custom on this see elevation candle communionedit before receiving communion from the chalice the priest makes the sign of the cross over himself saying in latin may the blood of our lord jesus christ keep my soul for eternal life amen the lords prayer and libera nos the libera nos is an extension of the lords prayer developing the line sed libera nos a malo but deliver us from evil the priest prays that we may be delivered from all evils and that the virgin mary mother of god together with the apostles and saints may intercede to obtain for us peace in our day fraction of the host during the preceding prayer the priest breaks the consecrated host into three parts and after concluding the prayer drops the smallest part into the chalice while praying that this commingling and consecration of the body and blood of christ may be to us who receive it effectual to life everlasting agnus dei agnus dei means lamb of god the priest then prays lamb of god who takest away the sins of the world have mercy on us he repeats this and then adds lamb of god who takest away the sins of the world grant us peace the mass of the last supper on holy thursday has have mercy on us all three times in requiem masses the petitions are grant them rest twice followed by grant them eternal rest the pax the priest asks christ to look not at the priests sins but at the faith of christs church and prays for peace and unity within the church then if a high mass is being celebrated he gives the sign of peace to the deacon saying peace be with you prayers preparatory to the communion in the first of these two prayers for himself the priests asks that by holy communion he may be freed from all his iniquities and evils be made to adhere to the commandments of jesus and never be separated from him in the second he asks let not the partaking of thy body o lord jesus christturn to my judgment and condemnation but through thy goodness may it be unto me a safeguard receiving of the body and blood of our lord the priest quietly says several prayers here before receiving communion the first is said in a low voice while taking up the host onto the paten the second of them spoken three times in a slightly audible voice while the priest holds the host in his left hand and strikes his breast with his right is based on matthew  lord i am not worthy then after having reverently consumed the host he takes up the chalice while in a low voice reciting psalm  what shall i render to the lord for all the things he hath rendered unto me i will take the chalice of salvation and i will call upon the name of the lord immediately adding psalm  praising i will call upon the lord and i shall be saved from my enemies priest on the ecce agnus dei  behold the lamb of god in the people communion if the priest is to give communion to others he holds up a small host and says aloud behold the lamb of god  and three times lord i am not worthy  he then gives communion first making with the host the sign of the cross over each communicant while saying may the body of our lord jesus christ preserve your soul for eternal life amen conclusionedit ite missa est sung by the deacon at a solemn mass prayers during the ablutions the prayers now focus on what has been received that we may receive with a pure mind that no stain of sin may remain in me whom these pure and holy sacraments have refreshed communion antiphon and postcommunion the communion antiphon is normally a portion of a psalm the postcommunion prayer is akin to the collect in being an appropriate prayer not directly drawn from scripture ite missa est blessing go it is the dismissal the word mass derives from this phrase after saying a silent prayer for himself the priest then gives the people his blessing prior to the revisions of pope pius xii and pope john xxiii the ite missa est was replaced with benedicamus domino let us bless the lord on days in which the gloria was not said and the rubrics required the priest to wear violet vestments ie masses of the season during advent septuagesima lent and passiontide vigils certain votive masses in the  missal benedicamus domino is said only when the mass is followed by another liturgical action such as the eucharistic processions on holy thursday and corpus christi in requiem masses the ite missa est is replaced with requiescant in pace with the response being amen instead of deo gratias the last gospel the priest then reads the last gospel the beginning of the gospel of john john  which recounts the incarnation of the son of god on certain occasions as for instance at the day mass on christmas day another gospel passage was read instead because that gospel is read as the gospel of the mass but pope john xxiiis revision of the rubrics decreed that on those and on other occasions the last gospel should simply be omitted prayers of the priest before and after massedit the tridentine missal includes prayers for the priest to say before and after mass in later editions of the roman missal including that of  the introductory heading of these prayers indicates that they are to be recited pro opportunitate as circumstances allow which in practice means that they are merely optional and may be omitted the original tridentine missal presents most of the prayers as obligatory indicating as optional only a very long prayer attributed to saint ambrose which later editions divide into seven sections each to be recited on only one day of the week and two other prayers attributed to saint ambrose and saint thomas aquinas respectively in addition to these three prayers the original tridentine missal proposes for the priest to recite before he celebrates mass the whole of psalms –   the numbering is that of the septuagint and vulgate and a series of collectstyle prayers later editions add after the three that in the original missal are only optional prayers to the blessed virgin saint joseph all the angels and saints and the saint whose mass is to be celebrated but as has been said treats as optional all the prayers before mass even those originally given as obligatory the original tridentine missal proposes for recitation by the priest after mass three prayers including the adoro te devote later editions place before these three the canticle of the three youths dan with three collects and follow them with the anima christi and seven more prayers treating as optional even the three prescribed in the original tridentine missal leonine prayersedit from  to  the holy see prescribed the recitation after low mass of certain prayers originally for the solution of the roman question and after this problem was solved by the lateran treaty to permit tranquillity and freedom to profess the faith to be restored to the afflicted people of russia these prayers are known as the leonine prayers because it was pope leo xiii who on  january  ordered their recitation throughout the world in what had been the papal states they were already in use since  the prayers comprised three ave marias one salve regina followed by a versicle and response and a collect prayer that from  on asked for the conversion of sinners and the freedom and exaltation of holy mother the church and again from  on a prayer to saint michael in  pope pius x added a thricerepeated most sacred heart of jesus have mercy on us in  with effect from  march  the holy see ended the obligation to recite the leonine prayers after low mass however the leonine prayers are sometimes still recited after presentday celebrations of tridentine mass although they are not included even in the  edition of the tridentine missal participation by the peopleedit nuptial low mass distribution of communion at a tridentine mass typically the faithful kneel and receive in the mouth and women wear a headcovering the participation of the congregation at the tridentine mass is interior involving eye and heart and exterior by mouth except in the dialogue mass form which arose about  and led to a more active exterior participation of the congregation the people present at the tridentine mass do not recite out loud the prayers of the mass only the server or servers join with the priest in reciting the prayers at the foot of the altar which include the confiteor and in speaking the other responses most of the prayers that the priest says are spoken inaudibly including almost all the mass of the faithful the offertory prayers the canon of the mass except for the preface and the final doxology and apart from the agnus dei those between the lords prayer and the postcommunion at a solemn mass or missa cantata a choir sings the servers responses except for the prayers at the foot of the altar the choir sings the introit the kyrie the gloria the gradual the tract or alleluia the credo the offertory and communion antiphons the sanctus and the agnus dei of these only the five that form part of the ordinary of the mass are usually sung at a missa cantata in addition to the gregorian chant music for these polyphonic compositions exist some quite elaborate the priest largely says quietly the words of the chants and then recites other prayers while the choir continues the chant different levels of celebrationedit there are various forms of celebration of the tridentine mass pontifical high mass celebrated by a bishop accompanied by an assisting priest deacon subdeacon thurifer acolytes and other ministers under the guidance of a priest acting as master of ceremonies most often the specific parts assigned to deacon and subdeacon are performed by priests the parts that are said aloud are all chanted except that the prayers at the foot of the altar which before the reform of pope pius v were said in the sacristy are said quietly by the bishop with the deacon and the subdeacon while the choir sings the introit the main difference between a pontifical and an ordinary high mass is that the bishop remains at his throne almost all the time until the offertory solemn or high mass latin missa solemnis offered by a priest accompanied by a deacon and subdeacon and the other ministers mentioned above missa cantata latin for sung mass celebrated by a priest without deacon and subdeacon and thus a form of low mass but with some parts the three variable prayers the scripture readings preface pater noster and ite missa est sung by the priest and other parts introit kyrie gloria gradual tract or alleluia credo offertory antiphon sanctus and benedictus agnus dei and communion antiphon sung by the choir incense may be used exactly as at a solemn mass with the exception of incensing the celebrant after the gospel which is not done low mass the priest sings no part of the mass though in some places a choir or the congregation sings during the mass hymns not always directly related to the mass in its article the liturgy of the mass the  catholic encyclopedia describes how when concelebration ceased to be practised in western europe low mass became distinguished from high mass the separate celebrations then involved the building of many altars in one church and the reduction of the ritual to the simplest possible form the deacon and subdeacon were in this case dispensed with the celebrant took their part as well as his own one server took the part of the choir and of all the other ministers everything was said instead of being sung the incense and kiss of peace were omitted so we have the wellknown rite of low mass missa privata this then reacted on high mass missa solemnis so that at high mass too the celebrant himself recites everything even though it be sung by the deacon subdeacon or choir on the origin of the missa cantata the same source gives the following information  high mass is the norm it is only in the complete rite with deacon and subdeacon that the ceremonies can be understood thus the rubrics of the ordinary of the mass always suppose that the mass is high low mass said by a priest alone with one server is a shortened and simplified form of the same thing its ritual can be explained only by a reference to high mass for instance the celebrant goes over to the north side of the altar to read the gospel because that is the side to which the deacon goes in procession at high mass he turns round always by the right because at high mass he should not turn his back to the deacon and so on a sung mass missa cantata is a modern compromise it is really a low mass since the essence of high mass is not the music but the deacon and subdeacon only in churches which have no ordained person except one priest and in which high mass is thus impossible is it allowed to celebrate the mass on sundays and feasts with most of the adornment borrowed from high mass with singing and generally with incense revision of the roman missaledit pius xii began in earnest the work of revising the roman missal with a thorough revision of the rites of holy week which after an experimental period beginning in  was made obligatory in  the mass that used to be said on holy thursday morning was moved to the evening necessitating a change in the rule that previously had required fasting from midnight the good friday service was moved to the afternoon holy communion was no longer reserved for the priest alone as before hosts consecrated at the holy thursday mass were used and the priest no longer received part of the host in unconsecrated wine the easter vigil service that used to be held in morning of holy saturday was moved to the night that leads to easter sunday and many changes were made to the content in  pope john xxiii – ordered the suppression of the word perfidis unbelieving ie not believing in jesus applied to the jews in the rites for good friday he revised the rubrics to the order of mass and the breviary two years later in  he made some more minor modifications on the occasion of publishing a new typical edition of the roman missal this is the edition authorized for use by virtue of the quattuor abhinc annos indult see below under present status of the tridentine mass among the other changes he made and that were included in the  missal were adding st josephs name to the roman canon eliminating the second confiteor before communion suppressing  feasts such as st peters chair in rome or more accurately combining both feasts of st peters chair into one as they originally had been incorporating the abolition of  festal octaves and  vigils of feasts and other changes made by pope pius xii and modifying rubrics especially for solemn high masses among the names that disappeared from the roman missal was that of st philomena her liturgical celebration had never been admitted to the general roman calendar but from  it had been included with an indication that the mass was to be taken entirely from the common in the section headed masses for some places ie only those places for which it had been specially authorized but her name had already in  been ordered to be removed from all liturgical calendars on  december  the second vatican council decreed in chapter ii of its constitution on the sacred liturgy sacrosanctum concilium the rite of the mass is to be revised  the rites are to be simplified due care being taken to preserve their substance parts which with the passage of time came to be duplicated or were added with little advantage are to be omitted other parts which suffered loss through accidents of history are to be restored to the vigor they had in the days of the holy fathers as may seem useful or necessary the treasures of the bible are to be opened up more lavishly so that a richer fare may be provided for the faithful at the table of god’s word  a suitable place may be allotted to the vernacular in masses which are celebrated with the people  communion under both kinds may be granted when the bishops think fitas for instance to the newly ordained in the mass of their sacred ordination to the newly professed in the mass of their religious profession and to the newly baptized in the mass which follows their baptism the instruction inter oecumenici of  september  initiated the application to the mass of the decisions that the council had taken less than a year before permission was given for use only in mass celebrated with the people of the vernacular language especially in the biblical readings and the reintroduced prayers of the faithful but until the whole of the ordinary of the mass has been revised in the chants kyrie gloria creed sanctus agnus dei and the entrance offertory and communion antiphons and in the parts that involved dialogue with the people and in the our father which the people could now recite entirely together with the priest most episcopal conferences quickly approved interim vernacular translations generally different from country to country and after having them confirmed by the holy see published them in  other changes included the omission of psalm   at the start of mass and the last gospel at the end both of which pope pius v had first inserted into the missal having previously been private prayers said by the priest in the sacristy and the leonine prayers of pope leo xiii the canon of the mass which continued to be recited silently was kept in latin three years later the instruction tres abhinc annos of  may  gave permission for use of the vernacular even in the canon of the mass and allowed it to be said audibly and even in part to be chanted the vernacular could be used even at mass celebrated without the people being present use of the maniple was made optional and at three ceremonies at which the cope was previously the obligatory vestment the chasuble could be used instead pope paul vi continued implementation of the councils directives ordering with apostolic constitution missale romanum of holy thursday  april  publication of a new official edition of the roman missal which appeared in latin in  opposition to the latest revisions of the liturgyedit some traditionalist catholics reject to a greater or lesser extent the changes made since  see traditionalist catholic none advocate returning to the original  form of the liturgy though some may perhaps wish a reestablishment of its form before pius xs revision of the rubrics in  some do refuse to accept the  changes in the liturgy of palm sunday and the easter triduum and in the liturgical calendar see general roman calendar of pope pius xii and instead use the general roman calendar as in  others accept the  changes by pius xii but not those of pope john xxiii others again in accordance with the authorization granted by pope benedict xvi in summorum pontificum use the missal and calendar as it was in  some of them argue that unlike earlier reforms the revision of  which replaced the tridentine mass with the mass of pope paul vi represented a major break with the past they consider that the content of the revised liturgy is in catholic terms seriously deficient and defective some hold that it is displeasing to god and that no catholic should attend it when a preliminary text of two of the sections of the revised missal was published in  archbishop marcel lefebvre gathered a group of twelve theologians who under his direction wrote a study of the text they stated that it represents both as a whole and in its details a striking departure from the catholic theology of the mass as it was formulated in session  of the council of trent cardinal alfredo ottaviani a former prefect of the sacred congregation for the doctrine of the faith supported this study with a letter of  september  to pope paul vi cardinal antonio bacci signed the same letter the critical study became known as the ottaviani intervention cardinal ottaviani subsequently stated in writing that he had not intended his letter to be made public and that pope paul vis doctrinal exposition on  november and  november  of the revised liturgy in its definitive form meant that no one can be genuinely scandalised any more jean madiran a critic of vatican ii and foundereditor of the french journal itinéraires claimed that this letter was fraudulently presented to the elderly and already blind cardinal for his signature by his secretary monsignor and future cardinal gilberto agustoni and that agustoni resigned shortly afterwards this allegation remains unproven and madiran himself was not an eyewitness of the alleged deception in october  a meeting of the synod of bishops had already given its opinion on a still earlier draft of the  members  approved it as it stood  approved it but suggested various modifications  abstained and  voted against from the s onwards western countries have experienced a drop in mass attendance in the united states from  of catholics attending in  to  attending by  these same countries saw a decline in seminary enrollments and in the number of priests in the united states from  ordinations in  to  in  and a general erosion of belief in the doctrines of the catholic faith opponents of the revision of the mass liturgy argue citing opinion poll evidence in their support that the revision contributed to this decline others pointing among other considerations to the fact that globally there are more priests and seminarians now than in previous years in  there were  major seminarians worldwide in  there were  an increase of  at a time however when there was an increase of global population of  suggest that the apparent decline of catholic practice in the west is due to the general influence of secularism and liberalism on western societies rather than to developments within the catholic church attitudes of popes since the second vatican counciledit pope paul viedit following the introduction of the mass of paul vi in  the holy see granted a significant number of permissions for the use of the former liturgy for example elderly priests were not required to switch to celebrating the new form in england and wales occasional celebrations of the tridentine mass were allowed in virtue of what became known as the agatha christie indult however there was no general worldwide legal framework allowing for the celebration of the rite following the rise of the traditionalist catholic movement in the s pope paul vi reportedly declined to liberalise its use further on the grounds that it had become a politically charged symbol associated with opposition to his policies pope john paul iiedit in  the holy see sent a letter known as quattuor abhinc annos to the presidents of the worlds episcopal conferences this document empowered diocesan bishops to authorise on certain conditions celebrations of the tridentine mass for priests and laypeople who requested them in  following the excommunication of archbishop marcel lefebvre and four bishops that he had consecrated the pope issued a further document a motu proprio known as ecclesia dei which stated that respect must everywhere be shown for the feelings of all those who are attached to the latin liturgical tradition the pope urged bishops to give a wide and generous application to the provisions of quattuor abhinc annos and established the pontifical commission ecclesia dei to oversee relations between rome and traditionalist catholics the holy see itself granted authorisation to use the tridentine mass to a significant number of priests and priestly societies such as the priestly fraternity of st peter the institute of christ the king sovereign priest and the personal apostolic administration of saint john mary vianney some diocesan bishops however declined to authorise celebrations within their dioceses or did so only to a limited extent in some cases the difficulty was that those seeking the permission were hostile to the church authorities other refusals of permission were alleged to have stemmed from certain bishops disapproval in principle of celebrations of the tridentine liturgy pope benedict xviedit as a cardinal joseph ratzinger was regarded as having a particular interest in the liturgy and as being favourable towards the older rite of mass he famously criticized the erratic way in which contrary to official policy many priests celebrated the revised rite in september  the pontifical commission ecclesia dei established the institute of the good shepherd made up of former members of the society of st pius x in bordeaux france with permission to use the tridentine liturgy this step was met with some discontent from french clergy and thirty priests wrote an open letter to the pope consistently with its previous policy the society of st pius x rejected the move following repeated rumours that the use of the tridentine mass would be liberalised the pope issued a motu proprio called summorum pontificum on  july  together with an accompanying letter to the worlds bishops the pope declared that the roman missal promulgated by paul vi is the ordinary expression of the lex orandi law of prayer of the catholic church of the latin rite nevertheless the roman missal promulgated by st pius v and reissued by st john xxiii is to be considered as an extraordinary expression of that same lex orandi he further stated that the  missal  was never juridically abrogated he replaced with new rules those of quattuor abhinc annos on use of the older form essentially authorization for using the  form for parish masses and those celebrated on public occasions such as a wedding is devolved from the local bishop to the priest in charge of a church and any priest of the latin rite may use the  roman missal in masses celebrated without the people a term that does not exclude attendance by other worshippers lay or clergy while requests by groups of catholics wishing to use the tridentine liturgy in parish masses are to be dealt with by the parish priest or the rector of the church rather than as before by the local bishop the pope and cardinal darío castrillón have stated that the bishops authority is not thereby undermined present regulationsedit the regulations set out in summorum pontificum provide that in masses celebrated without the people every latin rite priest may use either the  roman missal or that of paul vi except during the easter triduum when masses without participation by the people are no longer allowed celebrations of mass in this form formerly referred to as private masses may as before be attended by laypeople who ask to be admitted in parish masses where there is a stable group of laypeople who adhere to the earlier liturgical tradition the parish priest should willingly accept their requests to be allowed to celebrate the mass according to the  missal and should ensure that their welfare harmonises with the ordinary pastoral care of the parish under the guidance of the bishop in accordance with canon  of the code of canon law avoiding discord and favouring the unity of the church mass may be celebrated using the  missal on working days while on sundays and feast days one such celebration may be held for priests and laypeople who request it the parish priest should allow celebrations of the  form on special occasions such as weddings funerals and pilgrimages communities belonging to institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life which wish to use the  missal for conventual or community celebration in their oratories may do so with letter  of  january  the pontifical council ecclesia dei responded positively to a question whether a parish priest pastor or another priest may on his own initiative publicly celebrate the extraordinary form along with the customary regular use of the new form so that the faithful both young and old can familiarize themselves with the old rites and benefit from their perceptible beauty and transcendence although the council accompanied this response with the observation that a stable group of the faithful attached to the older form has a right to assist at mass in the extraordinary form a website that published the response interpreted it as not requiring the existence of such a stable group present practiceedit the publication of summorum pontificum has led to an increase in the number of regularly scheduled public tridentine masses on  june  cardinal darío castrillón hoyos told a london press conference that pope benedict wants every parish to offer both the old and the new forms for sunday mass the cardinal said that the vatican was preparing to instruct seminaries to teach all students the tridentine form of the roman rite the complexity of the rubrics makes it difficult for priests accustomed to the simpler modern form to celebrate the tridentine form properly and it is unclear how many have the required knowledge some traditionalist catholic priests and organisations holding that no official permission is required to use any form of the tridentine mass celebrate it without regularizing their situation and sometimes using editions of the roman missal earlier than the  edition approved in summorum pontificum in order to provide for priests who celebrate the tridentine mass publishers have issued facsimiles or reprintings of old

i wanted to add something new to supplement those devotions this year something which would add elements of the mass as a lutheran it took a while to find the daily roman missal i am thoroughly enjoying this daily addition to my readings it is a beautiful book and i am very thankful that the church has produced such a wonderful treasure i hope to use this book the rest of my life date errors

found that the readings for  lenten season are not the ones used by the priest the ones for  seem to be the correct ones i find this a very bad error on your part in  i thought is was just my

fast and quick like a commercial carwash i would just use the missalet as the priest still alter the wording best uses daily masses not for sunday prayer book cons bulky lots of unnecessary pages pros gilded sides nice long ribbon markers nice pages turn easily very pleased by mike east alton il april   review i use the roman missal to follow the daily readings at morning mass and for prayer theres

its pure class the leather is soft and very well done the pages are beautifully gold leafed best uses daily use cons none pros exceptional item daily roman missal third addition by popeye new canaan ct february   review i ordered this missal to replace two very dated daily missals and one sunday missal it succeeds in consolidating all daily and weekend liturgies in one volume to that extent it is overall well done however it was described as having added the sixteen new saints in the churches calendar of feast days it has failed to do that by excluding st faustina what strikes me as disappointing about this is that a number of lesser known new saints are included in the new missal such as saints ansgar polycarp kateri tekakwitha and saint hedwig to name a few the publisher could not offer a good reason for st faustina not being included in the new missal suggesting only that it could be politics that is politics within the church hierarchy seems to me we have enough of that and it shouldnt be carried over to a daily missal cons left out st faustina pros consolidated prayers updated mass changes well organized very high quality by mary falls city ne february   review just what i needed to be able to attend mass everyday of the year pros attractive cover easily lies open easy to read font easy to use enough marking ribbons not heavy i like this missal but im still

back and forth with to demarcate sections clear directions for use wonderful illustrations just like my missal i used throughout the s and s best uses use it every day cons nonehave waited so long pros clear directions tabs easy to navigate and clea a useful tool in pursuing your faith by joe folsom nj january   review ive used st josephs missals prior which were easier to use than this but were not so comprehensive as to include both sunday daily and latin masses the only thing missing is the hymnal but that is a difficult order to fill besides this book is somewhat large already if you never used a missal before you may find this edition difficult to use at first you will overcome this after a few masses in summary i believe this is a perfect gift for yourself or a friend that you or they will be proud to own it will add to your mass experience to read the readings before you go and help you through the latin mass sections on ewtn worth the money best uses for all masses prep

this missal on my office desk as a way to prepare myself to celebrate the coming mass it helps me to enter more fully into the revised translation to reflect upon the richness of the new texts and so be able to celebrate the liturgy with devotion understanding and fervor it also enables me to look ahead at the readings in preparation for homilies also it is a wonderful resource for personal prayer and spiritual nourishment as a priest for thirty years i can say that the revised translation of the mass has renewed my own priestly spirituality and that we all now have a translation of the mass that truly expresses the depth of the sacred mysteries we celebrate in the liturgy this edition makes it all the more beautiful and fulfilling to enter into the celebration of the mass best uses

opinion should be refined in the area of locating pages to match the appropriate mass day and readings i believe that they should set up a better date schedule listing pages to coincide with the date

institutional investors “buy” on an ipo’s first day posted on november    leave a comment  has been a lackluster year for traditional ipos miniipos via rega is another story read here regardless institutional investors remain active in their appetite with just over half reporting them take a position on day one the amount of energy it takes to ipo is enormous – and for many companies it is a watershed event as explained in this video we execute hundreds of sec transactions each year be sure your “financial brand” is well established and ready to go live before you ring any bells ir room streamlined edgar and xbrl processes and a comprehensive shareholder communications strategy about the study initially launched in  the shareholder confidence  study is an ongoing survey targeted at two key constituents with whom public companies communicate institutional investors and individual investors it was the first study of its kind — directly asking investors how they consume investor relations content in  we published an updated study for this  iteration we have segmented and compared the results between institutional investors and individual investors to date we have accumulated over  responses from a pool of  buyside analysts  portfolio managers and from over  longterm holding retail investors there are  questions questions include how often do you visit ir websites why do you visit ir websites do you use twitter for stock research would a ceo video instill trust do you use earnings estimates the inbound response ratio is  wall street to main street all of the data is

celebrated by the appreciative notes our operations people receive each day from our clients we can’t not share the good news anonymized for privacy sales can offer you full named references here is just a handful of the week’s notes  kudos to our edgar team thank you all so much for all of your hard work  great job getting this done   kudos to our typesetting team we made today’s filing deadline with a couple minutes to spare well done everyone for the great teamwork to get this amendment done in an accurate and timely manner a sincere thank you  kudos to our edgar team our move from to vintage was simple and our first experience was one of confidence there were less errorscorrections than we had previously encountered w other firm and there was an attention to detail that i very much appreciated since that time we have been very pleased with our transactions and any changes we required were done in an incredibly timely fashion in our industry changes become necessary at the very last moment and vintage was able to accommodate the last minute stresses very well  kudos to our mutual funds team so much better thanks for being so proactive   kudos to our xbrl team we are finished with our first draft i have forwarded it to the accountants and attorney for comments   kudos to our print team great thanks to you guys’ outstanding work   kudos to our edgar team thanks everyone for another successful filing we appreciate all of the hard work and patience through our many changes   our rebrand was not just a logo change – it was a systemic and cultural reform throughout our operations our president liam power challenged his team to deliver the industry’s intelligent value measured as fast turns and spoton execution of services you can meet liam power on

posted on november    leave a comment greater transparency lower filing costs reduced risks and better data quality – these longpromised benefits of xbrl are finally becoming a reality as the xbrl landscape continues its swift evolution we discussed the latest developments with five experts – as well as with a representative of the sec vintage question  in your view what are the biggest challenges currently being tackled by filers when it comes to implementing xbrl jaret klekota  when it comes to implementing xbrl the main issue for registrants is coordinating and incorporating all of the qualitycontrol activities in their process the close of the financial statement and the sec submission process is already a busy time and they need to make sure that they understand the complexities and risks of xbrl a lot of clients use thirdparty xbrl creation providers and we help to make sure that these third parties are following all the necessary rules we want to be sure that our clients are comfortable that these tags truly represent what their financial statements are disclosing campbell pryde  one of the major issues currently is with extensions the main problem with extensions is that there are elements in a taxonomy which exist but are not being used and someone goes in and makes an extension for it instead our data quality committee of which vintage is a founding member has started addressing that issue with more comprehensive guidance on where and when you should use extensions a lot of that is just getting decent guidance out there i don’t think it’s fair to say that extensions are a bad thing however i think they are bad when used inappropriately and the main cases are when a company creates an extension with an element that already exists in the taxonomy or secondly they create an extension to differentiate an amount which is immaterial if it’s immaterial then why create it but that’s actually quite common it’s largely a matter of making people feel comfortable with that which i think will help drive the issue out of the systems pranav ghai  i agree with campbell – the custom tags are an issue the idea of these custom extensions is that your metric doesn’t quite fit what the taxonomy wanted it to so you create something special but the problem is that there’s no linking between the base taxonomy and that extension these things become stepchildren and it’s much more difficult to figure out the logic if you’re comparing three or four companies — let alone  or  — if a couple of them have extensions it becomes very difficult to compare them even if they are ostensibly the same thing one of the things calcbench has done is a lot of extension mapping ilya vadeiko  although we do not work on the filing side we observe a fair amount of variability and inconsistency in disclosure reporting some filers are clearly struggling with reporting their face financials consistently we believe that this usually results from the fact that the filers do not use or look at their own xbrl data from the point of view of investor relations or business analysis of their peers this feedback loop should help improve implementation and eliminate issues in meaningful choices of xbrl elements hudson hollister  the most difficult part has already been done by every company because xbrl is already mandatory but xrbl electronically expresses how all the numbers relate to each other so you’ve got to have somebody who knows how to do that some of the software products out there like the ones offered by vintage give you an interface to do that which makes it much easier you don’t need to be a data expert share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin leave a comment posted in xbrl ← older posts newer posts → follow compliance
