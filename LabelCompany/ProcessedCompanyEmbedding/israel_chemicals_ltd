directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

will receive proceeds from its sale of the ordinary shares directly to the underwriters and will receive proceeds from the forward counterparties if it enters into the forward sale agreements potash the potash market is characterized by a relatively small number of manufacturers some of which export jointly see risk factors—risks related to our business—our operations and sales are subject to the volatility of market supply and demand and we face significant competition from some of the worlds largest chemical companies the ability to compete in the market is dependent mainly on production costs and logistics moreover there are high entry barriers for new players the barriers to entry in the potash market are high due to the large investments required to establish production plants for the basic minerals and the relatively long time required to establish these plants in addition this industry requires appropriate concessions and proximity of production facilities to quarries the significant competitors of our fertilizers segment in international trade in the potash sector are potash corporation of saskatchewan canada belaruskali belarus mosaic canada and the united states uralkali russia ks germany agrium canada apc jordan and sqm chile although there is currently overcapacity in the industry various companies have announced plans to develop new mines and other companies have announced plans to expand their production capacity there is uncertainty in respect of realization of the production capacities as well as the timing for their achievement in addition a number of companies have announced their examination of the possibility of entering into the potash industry fertilizers and phosphates the phosphate fertilizer market is extremely competitive and is characterized by a relatively large number of competitors including international companies and governmentowned companies the main competitive factor in the field of fertilizers is the price the ability to compete in the market is dependent mainly on relative production costs and logistics for this reason companies located in proximity to sources of raw materials ports and customers benefit from competitive advantages additional factors that affect competition to a certain extent include product quality range of products service and the capacity to develop new products that provide unique solutions there are phosphate mines and production facilities in many countries including morocco china russia jordan the united states brazil saudi arabia and tunisia the main phosphate producers who compete with us are mosaic united states potash corporation of saskatchewan canada ocp morocco group chimique tunisienne tunisia vale brazil maaden saudi arabia the roullier group europe and various russian and chinese producers we believe a number of producers are approaching depletion of their higherquality reserves we believe our fertilizers segment benefits from the following competitive advantages • the low cost of potash production • an integrated value chain that allows our fertilizers segment to use the phosphate rock it manufactures for use in the production of its phosphate fertilizers rather than purchasing phosphate rock from third party suppliers • logistical advantages due to its geographical location access to nearby ports in israel and europe and relative proximity to its customers • we are the only producer with the ability to ship potash and phosphate together which reduces costs and • logistical synergies due to potash operations in israel where the hot and dry climate of the dead sea enables us to store at very low cost a large quantity of potash in an open area thereby allowing us to consistently produce at sodom at full capacity independent of fluctuations in global potash demand  our industrial products segment is the worlds leading producer of elemental bromine accounting for approximately a third of total international production of bromine according to internal assessments our industrial products segment estimates that it and its two main competitors albemarle and chemtura accounted in  for approximately  of the worldwide consumption of bromine and approximately  of the bromine compounds chinese production accounts for much of the remainder but the quantity of brine available for producing bromine in china continues to decline leading to lower production capacity chemtura and albemarle produce bromine primarily from underground brine sources in the united states albemarle also has a joint venture with a jordanian company to produce bromine and bromine compounds which started operations in november  and is located on the jordanian side of the dead sea with access to the same source of raw materials that we have in the beginning of  albemarle doubled the production capacity of bromine and expanded its production capacity of bromine compounds it produces at the site of its joint venture in jordan chemtura purchases bromine and some other bromine compounds from our industrial products segment under longterm contracts in january  chemtura and albemarle signed a longterm strategic agreement under the agreement albemarle supplies chemtura with a number of principal products including flame retardants and organic and inorganic brominebased compounds as of june   we did not expect this agreement to have a negative effect on our industrial products segment the main barrier to entry in the bromine and bromine compound market is access to an economically viable source of bromine in high enough concentration in addition the bromine business requires a complex logistics system based on special containers isotanks for transporting the bromine the need for the logistics system is a barrier to entry to competitors in the global trade in bromine the main competitors of our industrial products segment in the brominebased flame retardant market are albemarle and chemtura as well as a number of producers in china the relatively low production cost of bromine affords our industrial products segment a competitive advantage bromine production requires a complex logistical system based on a fleet of special containers isotanks specifically designed to transport bromine one of the advantages of our industrial products segment is having the largest fleet of isotanks in the world which enables it to transport relatively large quantities of bromine around the world our industrial products segment has contracted with a supplier of isotanks to expand its existing fleet during  all of the new isotanks were received from the manufacturer in addition our industrial products segment has a widespread worldwide marketing network and a range of highquality products combined with a technical support system that works closely with customers providing a good competitive position in its target markets in china for example our industrial products segments network includes three production facilities in china a sales site a bromine containers farm and sales and technical support networks in the netherlands our industrial products segment has a bromine compound production facility which gives it a competitive advantage in europe the phosphorusbased flame retardant and functional fluids production plants in the united states and europe are situated in close proximity to our industrial products segments principal customers in the phosphorusbased flame retardants market competition is mainly from chinese manufacturers operating in the local market and in markets outside china mainly europe and the united states access to a source of highquality lowcost phosphorus improves the capacity to compete in this market there are many competitors in the market for biocides for water treatment and entry barriers are mainly related to the process for obtaining a license to sell there are several competitors in the magnesium chloride industry the entry barrier to this market is low as any company with access to magnesium chloride can produce the solution there are a number of small competitors in the pure potash market pure potash is a highquality potash used mainly in the food and pharmaceutical industries the main entry barrier is access to potash and the technological knowledge required for its crystallization in part of the biocide industry the magnesia industry and the industry for other salts our industrial products segment has a leading position in certain niche products  our performance products segment has a leading position in the field of pure phosphoric acid and its downstream products our performance products segments competitors are large and midsize international chemical companies which have manufacturing and marketing presences in various countries as well as regional companies that reap the benefits of being local manufacturers in a regional marketplace in every field many companies compete with our performance products segment by offering similar or substitute products competition in our performance products segment centers on product characteristics price quality service and the ability to address customers needs the primary competitors of our performance products segment in each field are set forth below phosphatebased products • pure phosphoric acid phosphate salts and food additives our performance products segments main competitors are chemische fabrik budenheim kg innophos inc prayon potash corporation of saskatchewan adithya birla haifa chemicals ltd and various chinese producers • hygiene products the main competitors in central europe are ecolab inc diversey inc and hypred • ps our performance products segments main competitors are chemtrade logistics company in north america and italmatch chemicals in brazil and singapore other products • chemicals for water and paper the primary competitors of our performance products segment are basf ag herculesashlands water technologies which was sold to clayton dubilier  rice in  kemira oy ecolab inc ge water technologies and akzonobel • pharmaceuticals cosmetics and gypsum the primary competitors of our performance
