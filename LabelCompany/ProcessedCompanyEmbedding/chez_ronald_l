amended d for repligen aug    et from ronald l chez inc chicago aug   prnewswire  ronald l chez a private investor files an amended d for repligen and sent the following letter to the board of directors dear board of directors attention karen dawes and walter herlihy as you know i have been a repligen investor for many years  i have respected and valued the leadership efforts of walter herlihy however failed efforts the financial results of the company and the companys market performance have caused me to consult with other key investors in repligen as i indicated i would in my recent sec filing as a result i have discussed repligen with the holders of a significant percentage of the repligen outstanding stock  we are and have been longterm shareholders and i believe very patient as investors we have attempted on many occasions to constructively engage management with our views on the company and the opportunities available to improve the value of the company for all shareholders unfortunately despite everyones best intent these efforts have not delivered the results that we or you would have anticipated and we have a right to expect the reality is that repligen stock is trading at approximately the same price as it was five years ago  after my discussions with repligens larger shareholders we have a few suggestions that we believe can and should be acted on promptly by the board to help improve market perception of repligen and enhance the companys value for its shareholders first the board should immediately implement a policy that requires repligens directors and officers to be stockholders in the company  this will i believe more closely align the interests of repligens officers and directors with its investors   as investors i and other shareholders expect repligens officers and directors to be invested with their own hard money in repligen stock not just options i call on the board to enact compensation and governance standards for stock ownership for itself and the officers of the company these standards would be separate from the many grants of options to purchase stock at some future date that are currently held as an aside walter herlihys actual ownership of stock is consistent with my minimum expectations  there are many existing plans dealing with stock ownership for directors and officers that can serve as a guide to the implementation of a suitable plan for the company additionally the board should rescind the rights agreement dated march   the socalled poison pill whatever the market conditions and management concerns were in early  that caused the board at that time to approve a poison pill those issues are not relevant now as every investor knows the rights agreement creates the impression to the market of entrenching management and the board of directors whatever the good intentions might have been in  the existence of the rights agreement makes the company a materially less attractive investment in todays marketplace especially to institutional investors the other major investors i have spoken with agree conceptually with the aforesaid finally the board should retain a qualified investment banker to assist in evaluating the actions that are most likely to enhance shareholder value i have had discussions with qualified investment bankers that the board may wish to consider as we have spent time analyzing and discussing repligens opportunities i believe there needs to be a careful analysis of risk and reward regarding the highest and best use of the companys assets for example the bioprocessing assets may be more effectively monetized by another enterprise with a better sales infrastructure than that which currently exists at repligen the fact that the company owns bioprocessing assets should not require the company to build overhead and organization unless the board determines that the use of repligen resources for that purpose is the best path to enhance shareholder value which i would doubt the same critical review should apply to realizing value for rg  the investors i talked with and i agree however with repligens plan to seek partners for spinal muscular atrophy rg and freidreichs ataxia rg i wish to personally pursue a constructive discussion directly with the board regarding the matters discussed in this letter including various strategic alternatives that i believe are available to the company i am available to meet in person or by telephone as soon as possible sincerely ronald l chez office  source ronald l chez inc related links

  annex a ronald chez n astor stchicago il  repligen corporationattn karen dawes seyon streetbuilding  suite waltham ma  karen  as you know i have discussed with you and walter a significant checklist of issues that deal with repligen nasdaq rgen strategic and operating issues these issues if handled correctly have the potential to positively impact shareholder value which is certainly long overdue i have reviewed my concerns with significant repligen shareholders over the past several months and these owners of repligen have provided ideas and constructive debate in an effort to help achieve a more positive return on our investment there is one point that these shareholders and i can readily agree on we are all very dissatisfied with the performance of our stock rather than enumerating my concerns in this letter and rather than just talking with you and walter thank you for the time i would like to request a meeting with the entire board at the earliest possible time i have important concerns that need to be dealt with now i believe it is imperative to better align the interests of the board and senior management with the owners of the company as you are aware i have ideas as to how this can be accomplished in previous months i have asked you to consider retaining an investment banker to provide objective dispassionate commentary dealing with strategic alternatives that the entire board should evaluate i have provided you with the names of bankers who have experience and knowledge relevant to repligen and nothing has happened to the best of my knowledge in addition to large shareholders i have been reviewing alternatives with investment bankers i would like to have one of these bankers join me to meet with the board to consider a full range of actions on behalf of long term unrewarded investors our stock has recently traded at about  the approximate price of five years ago and  years as well our company needs now to improve on this obviously lackluster performance when all is said and done too much has been said without positive results and much too little has been done karen if you would provide me with a times when a meeting with the board can be held and please assure me that each member of the board will receive my letter ronald chez   contact ron chezrlchezrcncom source ronald l chez view table fullscreen view table fullscreen journalists

ceremony for the center for wounded veterans in higher education on ui campus in urbana on friday october   urbana — ron chez knows a wise investment when he sees one a successful financial management consultant with his own corporation the university of illinois graduate has advised a whos who of the fortune  — from jp morgan chase and motorola to apple and amazon but one of his latest investments is in people its an obligation i feel like its an obligation chez said of his  million donation that covered nearly half the cost of building the center for wounded veterans in higher education at his alma mater i always said if i was blessed with the opportunity if i could i would do things to benefit others i didnt come from a wealthy family at all at all theres nothing more important than providing services to the people who defend the country and put themselves at great risk a chicagoarea native chez enrolled at the ui in the late s as a physical education major on a baseball scholarship i played for a bit and i became a hasbeen said chez who switched his major to political science and in  graduated phi beta kappa in what he describes as a giant upset on a visit back to campus years later chez remembers looking for his name on the bronze tablets the list of graduates who earned university honors and discovering his was the only one out of order — not in a column separate from the others the only one and it looks like i snuck in there and put my name up there he said laughing i thought it was extraordinarily humorous after the ui chez enrolled on scholarship to northwestern universitys law school i went for three days and that was sufficient said chez who signed up for the army shortly thereafter it was at a time when hardly anybody was shooting anybody so that was a blessing he said after the military he started his own business in  focusing on consulting and venture capital generally involving the stock market and private deals today hes the president and sole owner of ronald l chez inc a financial management consulting corporation he is also the chairman of the board of epiworks a compound semiconductor materials company in champaign but he has a fun side too hes the executive producer of woody allens recent movies like magic in the moonlight and another thats being shot this year and stars steve carell among other hollywood notables we are friends yes chez said of allen but i dont do anything really but pay for the movie with another person he doesnt give scripts out chez said its not his best use of money and admits he wouldnt invest in anyone elses movies its just my regard for his special genius so i did it because its so wildly different from other stuff i do he said its fun to do it and there is a reasonable probability that i would not lose money on the philanthropic side hes a member of the wounded warriors board and formed the chez family foundation the latter funds the chez scholars program which pays the full college freight of academically gifted but economically disadvantaged chicago public schools graduates in its eighth year at the ui the program has funded about  students its a stunning record of performance by these young people chez said the idea behind the wounded veteran center donation came after chez read an article about the uis beckwith hall a residence center for students with disabilities and asked for a tour on visit to campus tanya gallagher the dean of the ui college of applied health sciences was his tour guide she mentioned plans for her big idea — to build a oneofakind onestopshop for disabled veterans attending school here almost immediately he said i want to help with that gallagher said chezs  million pledge was the lead gift in the fundraising project which was instrumental in moving the project forward gallagher said actually essential she pursued it vigorously chez said loads of people have ideas but she had a concept and made it happen its the people who come up with the idea and then doggedly pursue it so theyre the ones who deserve great credit here sections news businesstopics people university of illinois more business first buseys
