way through the bookbyboymomxon may  format paperbackverified purchasei got the kindle version of forsaken and i am glad i did not pay more than  for it it just was not worth it the books plot idea was captivating for the first half and then it died the author then slowly builds up another plot only to again end it really quickly it should have been two seperate books neither plot got a chance to become fully developed i also felt that some of the way the author dealt with faith issues were wishywashy at best and intially i would have rated this book a one but he redeemed himself in the end great ideas just a very disjointed ridecommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web address belowproduct not found only products offered on

we are left behind and have to go through the tribulation or simply to go through such an ordeal and to decide the fate of one of our children by either renounce our faith in god that there is no such a god or keep our faith and our child would live it makes one think deeply i have thought about these things before and have to remember that those kind of people would be very evil and therefore could not be trusted to let the child or whoever live we are to put our love in god first before our loved ones hard yes but we would be together in the end in a glorious place this story is well put together and is meant to make us think what would we do yes i would recommend this book to others i am now looking for another one from this authorcommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport

format paperbackverified purchaselet me start by telling you that i am not a reviewer i just love to read i only write a review if i think a book is an outstanding read and forsaken definitely fits that category it is actionpacked and moves quickly no slow spots you will not be able to put it down but you will also not be able to quit thinking about it afterwards in the book simon mason the televangelist has to make an agonizing decision i have asked myself everyday since reading it what i would have done if i had been in that situation i didnt want the book to end and i hope that jordan is leaving the door open for book an enjoyable book is one that you enjoy while leisurely reading it even though you know you probably wont remember a lot about it in a couple of months that is not forsaken it is outstanding it is my new favorite book and jordan is my new favorite author book lovers you will not be disappointed with forsakenps if you like forsaken read jordans first book

author of deadly aim and as good as dead with more twists and turns than a riproaring rollercoaster ride forsaken will keep you guessing right to final page youll find no easy answers here but many to consider  ken abraham new york times bestselling author dallasfort worth txwhat would it take for you to renounce your faith in christ author james david jordan confronts readers with this challenging question in his new book forsaken bh publishing group october  a unique love story wrapped in an action thriller forsaken is the first of a twobook series featuring taylor pasbury a beautiful but troubled former secret service agent hired by the worlds most famous televangelist after he receives terrorist threats even as a high school kid taylor pasbury knew that she was not like most other girls raised by a father who was a retired special forces officer she grew up knowing how to camp fish shoot and most of all take care of herself as a young adult she opens her own security agency following a controversial stint as the nations most celebrated secret service agent when simon mason the best known christian on the planet receives threats from muslim terrorists he hires taylor to take charge of his security though taylor is thrilled to receive the highprofile assignment she has no idea that simon already knows more about her than she could possibly imagine before taylors first day on the job is over the terrorists strike making a nightmarish demand that requires simon to choose between the two most important things in his life drawing on all of her hardknock toughness and training taylor must face deadly extremists and a dark past as she fights to save simon and his daughter along the way she discovers that she is not the only one who has done things she would like to forgetand she is not the only one who understands that some things are more important than living james david jordan is a successful business attorney in dallas texas though many lawyers have the urge to write few actually submit to the daunting task of slogging through the creation of a manuscript james however followed his aspirations to become an author taking five years to create his first book something that lasts which was wellreceived by both critics and the public forsaken is written with james same passionate purposeto entertain readers with pageturning stories while encouraging them to explore and grow in their faith i wanted to present readers with a spiritual dilemma that parents can only hope they will never face james says what if you had to choose between god and your own child would god really require you to prove your love by allowing your child to die with gripping authenticity james examines this thoughtprovoking subject of family and faith and skillfully draws readers into the crisis faced by simon mason will he forsake his faith in front of millions to save his daughters life would you  wirecom and on societyandreligioncom not your grandmas safe christian fiction taylor is a former secret service agent whos been called to protect the worlds most famous televangelist shes had a past that calls for her to take this job very seriously simon has received threats from terrorists telling him to step down from his ministry or else him and his family will be in harms way when the unthinkable happens simon has to make a choice that will change everyone who has been affected by him forever reading this book was like watching an episode of  in book format this book was heart thumping non stop action from the first page its very gritty not for the faint hearted i love how the main character is a female who doesnt need to rely on others to take care of herself reading about taylors past and how it affected her life and career choice was great buildup for the story this is honestly one of the best suspense novels i have ever read in both secular and christian fiction with plot twists and good character development this book was hard to put down the story is very realistic one could easily see the news headlines actually happening its actually scary to think that there could be someone out there who is plotting this exact scenario the choice that simon had to make was extremely difficult it is a situation that one hopes never to have to be in it really makes you think about what is the most important thing in your life and exactly how strong your faith really is the ending is rather interesting and im looking forward to seeing how that storyline is played out im highly anticipating the next book in the series this is one book that you could easily pass on to guys who claim to hate reading it will definitely grab their attention highly recommended booksmoviesandchinesefood blog christian fiction blog alliance and christian chicks blogs simon mason is not your average worldfamous evangelist a downtoearth everyman his rapid ascent to household name surprised him more than anyone else after being informed that his name is popping up in terrorist circles as a target he employs taylor pasbury  an unusual woman in her own right  to provide security services for him taylor is barely on the job when her past secret service training is called into action masons daughter kacey the jewel of his life has been kidnapped the terrorists demand forsake christ deny that he is the son of the living god then we will return your daughter placed in a situation that few of us will ever be called to face mason must make a lifeshattering decision that will change his life forever while forsaken sounds at first glance like a typical terroristsuspense novel it is so much more than what it seems well deserving of the suspense genre label it moves at an intense and engrossing pace through the first twothirds of the book only to slow into a more thoughtful reflective later portion readers are treated to what amounts to two stories within one cover skillfully blended a tale of nervewracking uncertainty and action combined with the story of one mans faith and spiritual journey jordans novel enthralled me forsaken possesses a special quality that refuses to let the reader set the book down for long far from being rote the story of kaceys capture and the difficult decision her father faced were captivating the characters are realistic flawed and uncommonly personable mason is true to life in his vulnerability failings and foibles pasbury a woman with a difficult tainted past is gritty wounded and loveable the author has succeeded in writing both male and female characters that resonate in the heart of the reader exploring far more than the themes of interreligious tensions and terrorism jordan dips his characters into loneliness evangelism love the bonds of family and gods grace a surprising depth is created through the drawing together of seemingly disparate threads of story  the lines between past and present jordan does introduce some threads that are left dangling by this storys end readers looking for a single title read may feel disappointed that these avenues have been left open those looking forward to future adventures with taylor pasbury will be delighted by the prospect of a sequel doublecross is scheduled for release in october  a balanced perspective on the actions of muslim terrorist groups is also woven into this novel far from condemning all followers of islam as dangerous radicals it is made clear that the purpose of such radicals is rarely religious but more often power based moderate followers of islam are treated with respect and dignity without minimizing the need to share the gospel with them certainly a wellwritten suspense novel forsaken is so much more than i expected deeper truer touching and surprising come for the thrill adrenaline and addictive compulsion to keep reading stay for the lingering reflection insight and first steps on the path to healing  httpquiverfullfamilycombookreviewforsakenbyjamesdavidjordan when terrorists kidnap simons daughter they make one demand deny christ and get your daughter back but doing so will have consequences far beyond the kidnapping for celebrity preacher simon his daughter kacey and simons security taylor the kidnapping is only the beginning of unfolding events and discoveries that lead taylor to discover that even christians are flawed but will she see beyond the mistakes to the savior simon serves beyond mysterysuspense forsaken probes the heart of man explores the meaning faith and takes us to the heart of a god of forgiveness and peace hard to put down  httpidealinhopecombookreviewsfictionhtml forsaken is told in first person by taylor pasbury daughter of special forces veteran and single father roger pasbury we learn that taylors mom fell apart and left for good when taylor was nine years old her dad taught her all about selfdefense shooting camping and fishing on her th birthday she and her dad embark on a camping trip but run into two strangers who want to have their way with taylor before they can taylors dad is murdered and taylor kills the two strangers several years later after a stint with the secret service which she left with both a decoration for bravery and a somewhat salty reputation taylor operates her own security business spending too many nights alone or drunk in the arms of strangers she is surprised by the invitation of the bestknown christian on the planet simon mason to meet with him about providing security since he has received death threats simon mason was just another ordinary working guy until he met god after his wife died when taylor catches up to him she is immediately at odds with his female advisor and spots several areas of need for providing protection very quickly after meeting him there is a car bomb used as a diversion and then a sudden ransom of sorts for simons kidnapped  year old daughter the ransom deny and denounce jesus christ as his lord and savior if simon does this his daughter will live and be released the conflict escalates at this point as the story begins to reflect the dilemma of peter christs disciple and his threepart denial of jesus what will simon mason do faced with the greatest challenge of his life the commentary rages from you cant deny christ to you must deny christhell know you dont mean it in your heart taylor vacillates between her professional inclinations and a growing attachment to simon fighting through her faintly romantic feelings for the older man she believes he will ultimately not deny christ to save his daughter not being a christian she cannot imagine allowing a daughter to be sacrificed instead of simply making a statement not really meant during the critical time before simon telecasts his decision she learns something about him which shocks her the wellwritten story weaves in and out of severe conflicts and takes a few unexpected twists with a majorbut satisfyingsurprise at the end taylor is an honest character one cant help but like shes lost hurting and vulnerable but still manages to be a skilled professional simon mason seems tested and full of his own kind of angst from the outset and he isnt the most likable guy neither is he particularly unlikable hes a character who elicited both sympathy and contempt the similar name comparison of simon mason to the biblical simon peter along with the choices he must make as a result of his decisions gives way to a unique conclusion i cant say definitively that i agree with what simon mason ultimately chose but the author tackled a difficult subject with clarity and thoughtfulness and inspired real circumspection from this reader while i appreciated the unique approach to this difficult theme and since the story clearly points to the differences in those who believe and those who dont i wouldve preferred a clearer reference to salvation in the final revelation from simon mason in the end one must ask who is truly forsaken in this story father this is a story about a choice i hope i never have to make because i want so much to have the courage to do the right thing in your eyes jesus give me the courage i need to make the gutwrenching decisions you have for me to make lord i ask you to bless james david jordan with more thoughtful stories to bring you glory bless his life choices and keep him obedient to your desires in the name of jesus amen  httphopeofglorytypepadcomintothefirewhoisforsakenhtml when simon mason the worlds bestknown
