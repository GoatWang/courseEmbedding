the influence of capital markets drawing upon the combined expertise of our securities private market real estate and research professionals we employ a valueoriented investment strategy designed to identify securities that we believe are underpriced relative to their peers overviewfootnotesxsl a word about risk the portfolio invests in reit securities the value of which can fall for a variety of reasons such as declines in rental income fluctuating interest rates poor property management environmental liabilities uninsured damage increased competition or changes in real estate tax laws the fund invests in a limited number of securities and as a result the funds performance may be more volatile than the performance of other funds holding more securities when interest rates rise the prices of fixedincome securities in the fund will generally fall conversely when interest rates fall the prices of fixedincome securities in the fund will generally rise at times the funds investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are interrelated or have common risks making it more susceptible to any economic political or regulatory developments or other risks affecting those
