which are medicines used to block nerve sensation anesthesia can be either local to one specific part of a body like a tooth or regional to block feeling to a larger portion of the body such as during an epidural for child birth it can also be more general to block sensation to the entire body resulting in unconsciousness anesthesiologists assist in surgery by determining how much anesthesia is necessary and by monitoring the patients level of responsiveness and vital signs throughout the procedure the anesthesia specialist will also bring the patient out of anesthesia and then continue to monitor his or her vital signs postoperation besides assisting in surgeries anesthesiologists may also treat patients suffering from chronic pain specialties anesthesiology schools university of missouri kansas city school of medicine languages english health insurance accepted data not available awards data not available hospital affiliations data not available information about group practices what is a group practice according to the medical group management association a group practice is any relationship between three or more physicians who share facilities expenses profits and other resources like support staff and equipment group practices tend to fall into two categories those that organize around a particular medical specialty and those that encompass several specialties like east boston neighborhood health that specializes in internal medicine why group practice as medicine became more complex in the twentieth century the need for group practices made more sense physicians found it impossible to know everything about the emerging drugs and technologies on the medical landscape in addition the cost of providing a full range of diagnostic services such as tests and xrays in one location became prohibitive to the individual practitioner hence doctors from various disciplines began to team together in order to provide more comprehensive care to their community of patients benefits of group practice access to doctors from various disciplines for referrals and advice better coverage on weekends and offhours onestop clinics for comprehensive care and testing
