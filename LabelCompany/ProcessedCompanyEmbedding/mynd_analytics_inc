cohort studies  n  more information on these studies can be found below ​peer product description peer online® is a clinical decision support database that uses a combination of software analytics and clinical outcomes to provide objective adjunctive medication response information to physicians treating patients with nonpsychotic behavioral disorders  peer reports™ represent the output of the psychiatric electroencephalography evaluation registry peer an outcome registry developed by physicians in order to build better evidence for prescribing in brain disorderspeer online uses a statistical analysis of eeg outputs and other patient information to generate a report that indicates the statistical likelihood of the patient’s responsiveness to classes of central nervous system cns medications ie antidepressants groups ie ssri and individual agents ie fluoxetine a discriminant analysis compares neurophysiologic abnormalities of the patient to patterns of abnormalities of known responders to cns drugs in the company’s outcomes database of symptomatic patients this provides a probability estimate of the similarity of the patient’s profile with the profile of groups of individuals constituting the normative and clinical symptomatic database which provides the treating physician guidance to which treatments the patient will most likely respond to and those treatments to which the patient is least likely to respond this is adjunctive information to be interpreted only within the context of the overall clinical assessment of the patient by the attending physician ​peer outcomes database peer online is based upon a database of patient outcomes that has been collected by physicians for over  years and physicians have been using this ‘practice based evidence’ data to help provide adjunctive information to guide the treatment of their patients the practice of utilizing practice based evidence pbe to guide treatment has been well documented horn et al  and utilized by multiple medical disciplines where solid evidence based guidelines were unavailable or inadequate ie pediatric oncology it is not surprising that physicians have taken the initiative to develop pbe databases to support the treatment of their patientsthe database initially developed by suffin and emory now contains data on over  patients with over  clinical endpoints representing known patient responses to over  commonly used psychotropic medications the database continues to grow as peer physicians add patient outcomes to treatment medications that are correlated to a patient’s qeeg  as more medication outcomes are added to the database by practicing physicians peer online will be able to provide even more predictive information to assist physicians in treating their patients with nonpsychotic behavioral disorders peer process procedurally peer online utilizes standard lead digital electroencephalographic equipment measuring the patient in a resting but awake state the recording generally takes  minutes patients are classified based upon the  variables calculated in the recording fdaapproved neurometric system and categorized based on the outcome history in treating patients with similar neurophysiologic outputs from these outputs and the correlation to the outcome database reports may indicate single or multiple medications based on the nature of the physiologic abnormality discovered the entire procedure is rapid noninvasive devoid of radiation or high strength magnetic fields and results in a report the peer outcome report that is easily used by clinicians given its similarity in format to antibiotic sensitivity testing the body of evidence for peer  medication response research using quantitative eeg since the ’s eeg recordings have been digitized and subjected to quantitative analysis qeeg which yields more information than can be appreciated by simple visual inspection qeeg extends eeg technology beyond qualitative identification of abnormality and allows for comparison of an individual patients eeg pattern with large public databases of age matched asymptomatic control group eeg values duffy et al  john et al   medicationinduced changes in eeg and qeeg data have been reported for a broad range of antidepressants benzodiazepines stimulants antipsychotics lithium salts and anticonvulsants herrmann et al  itil et al   saletu et al  small et al  struve  these drug changes are specific in regard to effects on distinct components of the eeg pattern and are dosedependent reversible upon medication withdrawal and measurable across psychiatric syndromes and in asymptomatic volunteersin those studies obtaining baseline medicationfree eegs investigators demonstrated unique qeeg features that could be used to aid in treatment guidance for example patients with major depressive illness with excess alpha wave magnitudes were retrospectively reported responsive to antidepressants that reduce alpha magnitude ohashi  similarly patients with obsessivecompulsive disorder with excess alpha wave activity responded best to antidepressants prichep et al  in contrast a subgroup of patients with obsessivecompulsive disorder with elevated theta wave activity did not respond favorably to antidepressants that are known to increase theta wave magnitudes and would therefore be predicted to exacerbate the symptoms of these patients prichep et al  finally patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder showed a general decrease in eeg patterns and were predicted to respond favorably to methylphenidate an agent that accelerates eeg frequencies satterfield et al subsequent work in depression led to a large multicenter trial n   leuchter et al  that examined “cordance”  a frontal qeeg index’s ability to predict response to the ssri escitalopram after one week of treatment subjects were subsequently randomized to remain on treatment or crossed over to alternative treatment seventyfive  subjects remained on escitalopram and  responded to therapy after  days in these subjects the qeeg pattern indicated response with a  accuracy demonstrating that changes in asymmetry composite eeg index one week into pharmacological treatment can be predictive of positive response to escitalopram at the end of treatmentthese studies found that there were significant eeg heterogeneities within neuropsychiatric disorders the existence of these subgroups suggests that different patients within the same neuropsychiatric disorder would differentially respond to medications and indicates that eeg patterns could predict the most effective pharmacotherapy for a specific patient peer evidencepeer online the successor to ‘referenced eeg’ or ‘reeg’ has been studied for over  years and the evidence supporting the effectiveness of using a physician based outcomes database to guide treatment is significant see ‘evidence table for peer online’ peer online is similar to a standard qeeg in that it uses qeeg output variables but differs from a standard qeeg in that it references the qeeg to a normative and then symptomatic database by comparing a given patient’s qeeg to a database of qeegs of subjects who have tried and responded to a specific medication peer online can provide useful information regarding the response of neurophysiologically similar patients to a wide number of medications peer online may thus have the advantage of providing physicians with useful information as to medication outcomes before a medication regime is started as important as the positive findings eg sensitive finding from peer online may be physician users have also reported that negative findings in which neurophysiologically similar patients reported resistant outcomes for certain medications can be extremely useful in reducing trial and error pharmacotherapy it has also been used to help select the medication that best matches the qeeg brainwave pattern regardless of “symptom clusters” currently used for diagnostic nomenclaturethe initial publication of results using the information from an eegbased database to guide treatment was the suffin and emory article in which they examined attentional and affective disorders and their association with pharmacotherapeutic outcomes suffin and emory  this was a retrospective analysis of treatment outcomes in sequential patients with attention deficit disorder and affective disorders one hundred medicationfree patients meeting dsmiiir criteria for attentional and affective disorders underwent pretreatment qeeg where the data was submitted to a normative database following the eeg attentiondisordered patients were first treated with a stimulant secondarily with an antidepressant and tertiarily with an anticonvulsant affectively disordered patients were treated initially with antidepressant and secondarily augmented with anticonvulsant or lithium tertiary treatment was a stimulant patients were assessed up to  months a clinical global improvement score was assigned similar neurometric subgroups were identified within both the attentional and the affectively disordered patients without regard to dsmiiir diagnosis there were robust correlations between neurometric subgroup membership responsivity to selected pharmacologic agent classes and clinical outcome resulting in an  response to antidepressants another subgroup was  responsive to stimulants and a third was  responsive to anticonvulsantslithium a fourth subgroup was  responsive to anticonvulsants patients with similar neurometric features responded to the same classes of psychopharmacologic agents despite their dsmiiir classificationother smaller preliminary studies have suggested a potential role in using this information for medication selection for depression to name just one psychiatric disorder a prospective randomized controlled week study at a veterans affairs hospital consisted of two groups of treatmentresistant depressed patients n control n experimental suffin et al  the trial used these quantitative eeg features to guide prescribing of psychotropic medications while the control group received treatment as usual the results indicated that six of seven subjects augmented with qeeg data received ratings of moderate to marked improvement on both the hamd and beck’s depression inventory only a single subject in the control group did this well when unblinded that same subject had been treated successfully with the medication that was consistent with the eeg patterns in the report pilot studies using these qeeg variables in eating disorders greenblatt et al  and substance abuse schiller shaffer etal  demonstrated similar promising resultsanother pilot study debattista et al  was conducted to compare this same methodology with the texas medication algorithm project tmap algorithm for patients with treatmentresistant depression this week study n found the data derived from the qeeg variables resulted in statistically greater change from baseline scores for the quick inventory of depressive symptomatologyself report qidssr and the quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaireshort form qlesqsf than tmapguided therapy it also found that five subjects in the tmap group received a successful tmap therapy that was identical to what would have been prescribed with the information obtained for the variables from the referencedeeg database debattista et al based on these earlier studies which suggested that using the information from shared outcomes based on qeeg patterns could assist clinicians in being cautious yet efficacious in their choice of medications especially for treatmentrefractory patients a larger trial was run in a multicenter randomized trial debattista found the referencedeeg database treatment group experimental was compared with an optimized treatment based on the sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression stard study guidelines control initially funded by the national institutes of health nih in patients with treatmentrefractory major depressive disorder debattista et al  the experimental group’s selection led to statistically better outcomes compared with the control group the improvement in the group guided by the qeeg data over the control group was significant as early as two weeks and the improvement continued throughout the week study and demonstrated significantly greater improvement on both primary endpoints qidssr and qlesqsf ie the same as in the stard study of p  compared with control as well as statistical superiority in nine of  secondary endpoints because there are innumerable combinations of therapies available from the databases’ report the debattista study was not intended to evaluate any one medication against another but to examine it as a tool to improve outcomes in this difficult populationin a recent retrospective chart review in the treatment of depression in eating disorders greenblatt reported on  patients with a year previous history to using the referencedeeg database to guide treatment and followed them for  years patients demonstrated significant decrease in depressive symptoms hamd severity of illness cgis and overall clinical global improvement cgii the group also had substantially fewer inpatients residential and partial hospitalization days within the year follow up period compared to the two years prior to the use of the report greenblatt et al  ﻿evidence for current treatment psychiatry is plagued by the lack of a clinically useful biomarker assessment system to guide treatment instead pharmacotherapy is typified by an inductive trial and error process resulting in significant additional morbidity mortality and costs due to failed medication trials despite extensive research resulting in more than  fdaapproved medications used in treating psychiatric disorders evidencebased guidance is largely lacking for selecting amongst these options to treat refractory patientslack of effectivenessin  the agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq an agency under the department of health and human services dhhs released a report on a systematic review they conducted on “comparative effectiveness of secondgeneration antidepressants in the pharmacologic treatment of adult depression” in this extensive review of  published articles ahrq noted almost  of patients did not respond to these treatment medications and that over  of the patients failed to achieve remission ahrq effective health care  executive summary  although not an impressive response rate the authors were encouraged by a new study that that was not included in their review due to its late publication the stard studystard rush  is the largest study to date evaluating pharmacotherapy for depression and was designed to provide guidance in selecting the best ‘nextstep’ treatment for the many patients who failed o get adequate relief from their initial ssri treatment by enrolling over  patients first treated with escitalopram stard ensured a sufficient number of treatment failures for its step   and  comparisons discouragingly there were no significant differences found in the five nextstep comparisons of eleven pharmacologically distinct treatments even though the n per each specific treatment ranged from  to  patients and was therefore more than sufficient to identify differences if any existed stard does document some of the negative consequences from failed medication trials see table below these include progressive stepbystepdecreasing remission and response ratesincreasing relapse rates andincreasing dropout rates despite stard’s exemplary free acute and continuing carein recent reanalyses of the stard data several studies have question the effectiveness of the treatments pigott et al  pigott  and certainly has brought into question the tolerability of the treatments given the relapse and dropout rates noted in the table above pigott notes that ‘in stark contrast to stard’s report of positive findings supporting antidepressants’ effectiveness only  of its  patients  had an acutecare remission and during the  months of continuing care these patients neither relapsed nor dropped out’in response to the stard reports showing limited efficacy for a variety of antidepressant strategies the nimh funded the recently published comed study rush et al  testing whether starting patients with several antidepressants at the same time would be associated with increased efficacy six hundred and sixtyfive  patients with mdd were randomized to a week acute treatment and participants who experienced substantial benefit in the acute phase were enrolled in an additional week continuation treatment there was no significant difference between the response or remission rates observed in the three arms in either the acute phase or the continuation phase  weeksclearly even in the most optimistic evaluation of available treatments for patients with any treatment resistant disorder an effective rate of  indicates that most medications are simply not sufficiently effective to alleviate the patient’s symptoms and most certainly are not providing a remission of disease this is particularly clear when it is reported that in antidepressant trials there is a placebo response rate of between    fava et al  therefore it can be convincingly argued that these treatments for antidepressants are no more effective than no medication at allrecent research raises doubts about the degree to which psychopharmacological treatment has kept pace with our advances in understanding the brain and psychiatric disorders there is a plethora of new psychiatric medications but there is growing recognition that these new generation medications may not hold significant advantages over older medications despite their higher costs it has been observed depaulo  that when viewed together the three major studies stard catie stroup  and stepbd goldberg  question whether or not modern pharmacological provide increased benefits for the additional costs while none of these studies stard catie and stepbd have focused primarily on comparing older and newer treatments such contrasts do not suggest any dramatic advantages for the newer medicationslow tolerabilityit is common in treating patients with mental disorders particularly patients who are treatment resistant they patients stop taking their medications for various reasons whether it is a lack of effectiveness or side effects of the medication this lack of adherence to the treatment can collectively be considered tolerability to the treatment and the evidence for low tolerability of these treatment medications is significantwith the stard study over  of the patients dropped out of the study prematurely even though they were provided the free care throughout the study and were managed at a level far higher than could be expected in the standard care of private practice whereas it is difficult to know if they dropped from the study due to the ineffectiveness of the treatment or due to side effects of the medication there is clear evidence that the side effect profile of these treatments is significant in the ahrq systematic review it was noted that  of the patients in the efficacy trials they reviewed had at least  adverse event further the same report notes that between  and  of severe adverse events was reported for the secondgeneration antidepressantsin the comed study although there were no significant differences in efficacy there was a significant difference in the side effect burden for the patients in the two polypharmacy arms the maximum side effect burden was between  and  in both the acute and continuation phases however in the single treatment arm the side effect burden was only  in the acute phase and  in the continuation phase this large well designed adequately powered study suggests that for a significant number of patients with mdd adding medication only adds to their side effects without an increase in efficacy thus increasing to the low rate of tolerabilitysummaryin  dr thomas insel made similar observations to those of depaulo noting that secondgeneration medications have consistently demonstrated no significant advantage compared with firstgeneration medication in multiple comparative effectiveness studies funded by the nimh insel  he also felt that current medication regimes help too few people improve from the perspective of side effects and a recent prospective study has now even called into question the widely held belief that secondgeneration antipsychotics produce a lower incidence of tardive dyskinesia woods it is increasingly clear that the reason there are so many treatment resistant patients patients who have failed on two or more medication trials is due to the lack of effectiveness of the medications andor the high side effect burden of the treatments the evidence points to a poor understanding of the underlying physiological causes of the symptoms of these disorders and therefore the ineffective diagnosis as the root cause of the ineffectiveness of the current medication treatments without objective physiologically based clinical evidence to support clinical decisions treating physicians can only respond to their patients in the best way possible trial and error of approved and unapproved treatments the case for neurometrics mental illness is a profound burden on the world’s health and productivity in fact it ranks second only to cardiovascular disease in established market economies murray  lopez   despite the magnitude of the problem the treatment of mental illness and more specifically the most prevalent behavioral disorders of depression anxiety bipolar disorder and adhd has been problematic the reasons are multifaceted first there are no objective decision support tools to support treatment unlike other areas of medicine psychiatry has lacked biomarkers that can help guide pharmacotherapy with similar reliability as bacterial assays that guide antibiotic treatment second the treatment guidelines most widely used for behavioral disorders like depression are based upon little or no clinical evidence insel   and finally diagnoses for behavioral disorders are based upon symptoms and not the underlying physiological etiology psychopharmacotherapy is inductive and assumes that certain behavioral symptoms respond to a specific medication class this selection process is highly subjectivewithout the objective physiologically tests available to other medical specialties or clinical decision support tools such as evidence based treatment guidelines to follow treating physicians can only rely upon personal experience or antidotal information in essence physicians must resort to a trial and error process where they try a treatment and wait and see if it is effective as noted by thomas insel md director national institute of mental health in the nimh director’s blog of august   “clinicians must often resort to trial and error before finding a treatment regimen that works often subjecting patients to weeks of ineffective treatments or adverse side effects in the process”as the term implies with trial and error it is not uncommon for the first second or even third treatment medication to not be sufficiently effective to provide significant improvement even with multiple medications administered sequentially many do not respond adequately to pharmacotherapy warden et al   the stard study rush et al  which included more than  subjects with depression observed a only a  response to the primary medication and for those patients who failed the primary treatment medication only an additional response of around  was observed when switched either to two other classes of antidepressants or cognitive behavior therapytherefore a significant percentage of patients with nonpsychotic behavioral disorders are considered ‘treatment resistant’ tr treatment resistant are those patients that fail to achieve a significant improvement on the initial andor subsequent treatment regimens the prevalence of tr patients varies within the different disorders but published data suggests that for patients with depression up to  did not respond to initial treatment for patients with bipolar disorders  of patients failed to achieve recovery nihmfunded stepbd best practice treatment pathway perlis   of anxiety patients do not respond to treatment and many more have residual symptoms bystritsky et al  and for patients with adhd between  of patients do not respond to repeated trails of medications doyle since the current standard of care for psychiatric patients is trial and error and because of this process many patients do not find significant improvement to their mental disorders treating physicians must resort to other methods to find relieve for their patients suffering more and more physicians are using multiple medications simultaneously a practice known as ‘polypharmacy’ in a study undertaken between  and  psychiatrists significantly increased their use of polypharmacy such that outpatient visits resulting in two or more prescribed psychotropic drugs increased from  in  to  in  and psychiatric visits resulting in three or more such drugs being prescribed doubled increasing from  to  mojtabai et al additionally physicians are frequently using off label medications to treat treatment resistant patients offlabel prescribing of psychopharmacology is common and perhaps necessary off label uses of psychotropic medications can be part of a good psychopharmacology practice this is not an unusual practice but he standard of care for psychiatry because of the evidence compared to the unmet needs of patients the difficulty is that there is little evidence supporting many of the treatments for particular disorders and these medications are powerful psychotropic medications that have a significant side effect profileas a result of the trial and error treatment process patients are prescribed different medications for weeks at a time the problem aside from the patient not receiving relief from their disease while trying to find the ‘right’ treatment is that the medications being prescribed both on and off label medications are powerful drugs that have significant side effect profiles including the potential increase of suicidality the side effect burden of these medications can be significant both medically and economicallywithout objective clinical decision support tools that are based upon evidence trial and error will continue to be the standard of care for psychiatric medicine as thomas insel md phd noted in his keynote address to the american psychiatric association at their annual meeting in  “we need to develop biomarkers including brain imaging to develop the validity of these disorders we need to develop treatments that go after the core pathology understood by imaging” treatment guidelines the current medical model for treating patients is based upon symptombased medical practice and pathophysiologic measurement psychiatry is unfortunately unique among medical specialties in its lack of such measurements this has hindered both the advancement of psychiatry in general and clinical practice in particular thus in the current therapeutic model for psychiatry and in particular of any treatment resistant disorder psychiatrists much choose treatment medications based upon patient symptoms response to previous treatment and behaviors significant limitations result because these illness features do not have a simple relationship with medication response without a defined pathologic abnormality to treat or a physiologic marker to guide treatment psychiatrists have been forced into the position of choosing between large numbers of psychotropic medications without ample evidence to support their choicesthis is particularly true for major depressive disorder mdd and specifically for treatment resistant depression trd whereas the same holds true for bipolar disorders and other psychotic disorders mdd is very representative of the issuesreimbursement and quality control for the treatment of depression by many payers in the us is guided bythe american psychiatric association apa treatment guidelines apa the texas medication algorithm project tmap treatment algorithm crismon results from the sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression stard study rush these guidelines and reports attempt to provide insight regarding the treatment of depression from the first line therapy through more complex scenarios involving trdthe apa guidelines document is a practical guide to the management of major depressive disorder for adults over the age of  and represents a synthesis of current scientific knowledge and rational clinical practice this guideline strives to be as free as possible of bias toward a theoretical posture and it aims to represent a practical approach to treatmentthe tmap is a treatment algorithm that constitutes the most extensive and comprehensive development and implementation to date of medication algorithms for persons with serious mental illness an algorithm is a rule or set of rules that is applied to solving a problem medication algorithms are a subset of practice guidelines they are distinguished by an exclusive focus on medications and by a more stepbystep approach to clinical decisions current projects address the treatment of schizophrenia bipolar disorder and major depression tmap was initiated by the texas department of mental health and mental retardation in collaboration with a consortium of texas academic medical centers the development of the tmap algorithms incorporated expert panels literature review and consensus conferences the texas implementation of medication algorithms tima is the practical cliniciantargeted implementation of tmapstard was set up to evaluate clinical strategies to improve outcomes for patients with trd determine the best nextstep treatments for depressed patients who do not respond satisfactorily to earlier treatment attempts and compare relative efficacy and patients’ acceptance of different treatment strategies to relieve depression focusing on the common clinical question of what to do next when patients fail to respond to a standard trial of treatment with antidepressant medication stard aimed a defining which subsequent treatment strategies in what order or sequence and in what combinations are both acceptable to patients and provide the best clinical results with the least side effectsoperationally those who did not respond to a line of treatment were then assigned to either a augmenting the first antidepressant with other medications or psychotherapy b changing to a different antidepressant or psychotherapy c adding psychotherapy or discontinuing the first antidepressant medication while switching to psychotherapy d switching to another antidepressant e augmenting the first antidepressant with other medications or f augmenting first antidepressant with other medications or switchingto another antidepressant so after failing the first line of therapy patients were randomized to the nextstep level  treatment strategies based upon the above options after indicating which options are or are not acceptable to them patients will be randomly assigned to a treatment option within those strategies that are deemed acceptable to and medically safe for them patients who did not have a satisfactory therapeutic response to their level  treatment were presented with additional treatment options as a third step level  again they were assigned randomly to one option which included medication switching and medication augmentation at level  of the treatment protocol similarly level  treatment options were provided for patients who did not respond satisfactorily to the level  of the treatment protocol stard reported level  and level  results in three trials two trials for level  and one trial for level fava  mcgrath  nierenberg  rush  level  and level  randomized controlled trials in stard referred to trials in patients who had previously failed two and three antidepressant medication trials respectivelywhereas all of these guidelines are valuable all are problematic while the apa guidelines provide evidence support for their first line treatment recommendations no evidence is provided for the trd treatment recommendations and did not reference any studies specifically evaluating trd tmap was primarily designed using expert panel consensus which is considered a lower level of evidence level  on the scale of evidence used by the centre for evidence based medicine cebm the remission rates in stard using hamiltond scores in all treatment arms in the three trials ranged between    these rates are relatively low as response rates in excess of  are often observed in placebo control treatment arms maes  this implies that the results for stard trials for level  and level  can be considered negative trialsother independent analyses of stard have highlighted the disappointing outcomes from the study particularly its low level of sustained improvement during the followup fava  ghaemi  pigott  pigott  unfortunately the overly favorable interpretations of the results of stard gaynes  have fostered further trial and error frequently with no solid clinical or scientific rationale offlabel prescribing without an effective physiological measurement to guide treatment of nonpsychotic behavioral disorders particularly treatment resistant disorders like treatment resistant depression and in light of the poor effectiveness of the approved medications for these disorders physicians have been forced to consider the utilization of offlabel medications to treat these disordersofflabel use of antipsychotic and anticonvulsant drugs for the treatment of depression and treatment resistant depression trd is well documented radley noted that thirtyone  of all psychotropic treatments prescribed are for offlabel indications and upon investigation  of the treatments lacked clinical evidence to support their use for the indications radley   the use of offlabel drugs is extensive despite the lack of appropriate evidence and among their use in mental health disorders offlabel drugs are used the most for depression the evidence provided for offlabel use of medications for augmentation on antidepressant treatment was overall supportive of the practice with these specific treatment modalities however yury et al noted that more  of the most popular classes of augmentation strategies and  of the most frequently prescribed combination of drugs for augmentation of depression have no published scientific support yury  the levels of evidence ranged from  see evidence table however the ‘level ’ evidence study which was a doubleblind rct evaluating the efficacy of risperidone in  patients with trd reported a remission rate of  but  of the patients relapsed another study with some notable evidence showed that only  of patients receiving olanzapine responded favorably in a chart reviewofflabel use of drugs for the treatment resistant disorders is significant enough that clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate and offer support for the offlabel use of these medications the practice of offlabel use of medications to treat treatment resistant disorders is so common that in  the agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq an agency under the department of health and human services dhhs released a report on a systematic review they conducted on “efficacy and comparative effectiveness of offlabel use of atypical antipsychotics” ahrq effective health care  executive summary  and a subsequent update on the report has been conductedalthough there is some supportive evidence for the use of these offlabel medications there is also a side effect burden that is very significant in the ahrq report they noted that the several of the side effects were more common in the atypical antipsychotics than with placebo which is not unexpected but also that although small there was a significant increased risk of mortality and cerebrovascular accidents in dementia patientseven though the use of offlabel medication is understandable in the void of effective approved medications for many mental disorders the side effect profile of many of these medications may cause the treatment and cost of the treatment to outweigh the benefit the continued trial and error process of onlabel and offlabel medications is expanding the cost of treatment for these patients without demonstrating any significant improvement in their clinical outcome polypharmacy although different authors have defined polypharmacy with different meaning most often the definition of polypharmacy is made with regard to the specific number of medication prescribed and most commonly it is the use of two or more medications to treat the same conditionthere has been a rapid increase in the use of polypharmacy in psychiatry the reasons may be multifactorial such as an increasing number of available medications targeting new and different symptoms and receptors or even the pressure on psychiatrists to focus on medication treatment regardless of the reasons the trend is clear with psychiatrists now frequently seeing patients presenting on multiple psychiatric medications hoffman polypharmacy of difficult psychiatric patients is rapidly becoming the norm in a study undertaken between  and  psychiatrists significantly increased their use of polypharmacy such that outpatients visits resulting in two or more prescribed psychotropic drugs increased from  in  to  in  and psychiatric visits resulting in three or more such drugs being prescribed almost doubled increasing from  to  mojtabai the rationale for polypharmacy or augmentation strategies to enhance retention or to increase remission rates is supported by findings from empirical research as noted by yury et al  most patients with unipolar depression do not remit with initial antidepressant monotherapy second no monotherapy medication is robustly different from others in achieving remission third the lack of response with antidepressant monotherapy leads to high dropout rates among depressed patients and fourth the emergence of adverse side effects eg agitation insomnia or persistence of some initial baseline symptoms eg anxiety insomnia may lead to premature discontinuation from monotherapyyury went on to note that there are significant limitations to the american psychiatric association apa guidelines to the use of augmentation to treat depression “first researchers have noted a lack of data to inform the sequence in which augmentation strategies should be implemented or for identifying the types of patients for whom specific strategies might be most helpful fava et al  further it appears that the majority of medications suggested as augmenting agents have no studies or few examining them as augmenting agents thase  thus it is an irony of current psychiatric practice that the most common augmentation strategies for the treatment of depression may be those with the least evidence of efficacy thase ” as emphasized in pigott et al  the apa’s continuation phase guideline is profoundly misguided because there is no apparent benefit for most patients from continued antidepressant drug treatment yet this practice unnecessarily exposes such patients to significant risksthe stard study was a large trail that included some augmentations in the trial patients who failed to respond to the step medication and agreed to be randomized to augmentation strategies received either  weeks of a step medication added to their step medication such augmentation resulted in a  remission rate but with a subsequent relapse of up to  subsequent augmentation had even lower remission and higher relapse rates as noted by yury et al “one might consider the results to be disappointing and reflect and unfavorable riskbenefit ratio given that about  of the patients experienced a serious adverse event from the first augmentation and that about  had to discontinue the study because of intolerance of side effects yury  even more concerning is that the stard study found that  of step patients reported an increase in suicide ideation during the acute phase treatment perlis  and in another report nierenberg    who had a remission during the acutecare treatment reported increased weight gain and  reported residual symptoms of sleep disturbance despite having received remission pigott although the practice of polypharmacy is growing and being institutionalized by the national committee for quality assurance ncqa and virtually mandated by the affordable care act of  there is a growing number of reports and metaanalyses that the practice of polypharmacy is lacking solid evidence of effectiveness and worse an increase side effect burden that would offset any benefit both hoffman and pigott have recently noted that patients either wash out or off medication may achieve similar benefit to those of polypharmacy hoffman  pigott  peer methodology eeg collection and z scoresthe first step of the assessment is to collect channel awake eyesclosed digital electroencephalographic eeg recordings on subjects who have either washed out their medications for five halflives or who are currently medication free the results are reviewed in raw form by an electroencephalographer to ensure that there are no abnormalities that would affect the data from going through the referencedeeg database the eeg is then screened to remove any “artifacts” that may exist in the eeg record these artifacts include such things as muscle twitches eye blinks and periods of drowsinessneurometric analysis involves computation of a series of measures that mathematically describe the eeg these measures are then compared with a database of “normal” eegs there are approximately  measures derived from the eeg component wavelengths and amplitudes these measures fall into four main categories ie power coherence symmetry phase and frequency power is the sum of the amplitudes of the wavelengths in each band computed on an absolute and relative basis relative power indicates the percentage of total power in each band coherence measures the synchronization of electrical activity between two channels in mathematical terms coherence is the phase shift between similar wavelengths at the two channels symmetry measure the ratio of power between a symmetrical pair of electrodes and lastly frequency measure the average frequency of the eeg component wavelengths with each bandmost neurometric features are highly nongaussian in their characteristics for this reason the neurometrics are logtransformed to make the distribution more normal gaussian in nature many quantitative eeg features also vary consistently with age to account for the difference between the age of the patient and the age of the subjects in the normative database these quantitative eeg features are ageregressed using a linear regression equation to yield a “standardage” quantitative eeg feature the comparison of the actual values of the neurometric variables with norms is expressed as a z score which is defined as                                                                             z   observed value  normative mean                                                                                               standard deviationdevelopment of pattern variablesneurometrics analysis outputs approximately  variables known as univariables that describe the eeg to make this data utilizable reference eeg transforms this data into a smaller set of multivariables or pattern variables these pattern variables preserve the information contained in the set of quantitative eeg univariables while retaining some degree of physical interpretation as such the data are not simply “mined” to come up with combinations of variables that are indicative of one state or another instead they are combined according to anatomical location in some cases factor analysis is employed to give a greater weight to those univariables that preserve the largest amount of total information of all the univariables in an anatomic group in other cases the univariables in an anatomic group are combined in a nonlinear fashion to increase the separation of observed clusters within the data at present there are  pattern variablescorrelation of pattern variables with patient outcomesthe referenced  eeg variables for historical subjects with known positive and negative clinical outcomes to various psychotropic medications are examined in order to develop a model that will allow the prospective determination of likely patient medication responsivity to these medications the variables are examined by stratifying the distribution according to the individual medication responsivities represented before utilizing this apparent relationship the appropriateness of the pattern variables are checked tests of skewness and kurtosis are conducted for each of the pattern variables to ensure that the original variable distribution is gaussian having ensured a gaussian distribution mathematics can be applied that provide a comparison of other subjects with similar patterns demonstrating whether the pattern variable value for the current test in question belongs to the distribution represented by a particular medication or belongs to the distribution defined by some other group the rest of the population this procedure is done for all medications represented in the database and for all of the pattern variables that serve as indicators for those medications the weightings then are averaged to calculate a “score” for each medicationcalibration against patient recordsthe final step is to calibrate this score against actual patient records to determine what level of score translates into a specified likelihood response to the medication for purposes of communication for the peer online service three levels of responsiveness were created the first is “sensitive” or “s” this level suggests that the indicated medication or group of medications produced a positive outcome to treatment in  or more of cases “intermediate” or “i” the second level indicates that the responsivity was in less than  of cases but more than  of cases the third level “resistive” or “r” indicates that a response to the medication is seen in fewer than  of cases in other terms if we formulate ho the null hypothesis in such a way that ho is true if the patient is not actually responsive to the medication then the model is calibrated to all for a type i error rate of no more that  in the region indicated as “s” and a type ii error rate of no more that  in the region designated as “r”to calibrate the report generator model against these standards the outcomes database is queried for all subjects’ responses that were not used in the construction of the actual model this dataset is known as the validation sample this sample is then divided into two subsets the first of which is known as the tuning sample and the second is the final validation sample to complete the model development the scoring model is run against the tuning sample and the resulting distribution of scores is compared against the known responses thresholds for scores are then empirically set to implement the standards of s i and r described above and which are common in such medical reports as for example antibiotic sensitivity results final validation of the model is made by running the processes complete with the thresholds that were set against the final validation sample in order to preserve the fully prospective nature of this validation no adjustment of the model parameters including the thresholds is made after this process if the results of this “run” meet the specifications for the previous clinical correlations the model is then ready to be used for a new patientthe peer methodology does not take into account the diagnosis of the patient when offering objective data on any specific medication response research has shown and industry experience corroborates that diagnosis is often an unreliable predictor of the treatment most likely to be successful for the individual patient this is one of the fundamental improvements that shared quantitative eeg features correlated to longterm clinical outcomes brings to the practice of psychiatrythis process can provide objective neurophysiologic data to assist in avoiding the unnecessary risk that comes with the practice of trial and error psychopharmacology which is also seen through the efficiency of treating a patient thus reducing suffering and medical costs the report is unique to each patient’s

uncertainties described below or in any of our other sec filings or any additional risks and uncertainties actually arise or occur our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose some or all of your investment   we will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations and we may be unable to raise such funds when needed and on acceptable terms   we had approximately  million in cash and cash equivalents at december   on average we expended approximately  of cash per month during the fiscal year ended september   cash used in operations for the year ended september   was approximately  million there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital after we exhaust our current cash   when we elect to raise additional funds or additional funds are required we may raise such funds from

be substantially harmed   if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities including in connection with this offering or pursuant to the purchase agreement our stockholders will experience dilution debt financing if available would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms such as liquidation and other preferences which are not favorable to us or our stockholders if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to

stock if we fail to meet these continued listing requirements our common stock may be subject to delisting if our common stock is delisted and we are not able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange we expect our securities would be quoted on an overthecounter market if this were to occur our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities in addition we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future even if our common stock is listed on the nasdaq capital market there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained after our initial listing            determination of the offering price   the public offering price of the common stock offered by this prospectus was determined by

compared to securities trading on a national securities exchange and iv the common stocks limited historical trading volume in considering and determining the price at which to offer common stock in this offering our management and our board of directors also considered the prices at which private investors had offered to purchase common stock from us over the past year finally our management and
