home become a patron slims new storejust click the cup  travel back to the s just watch the video latest update march  hey everyone just wanted to let everyone know that we are no longer associated with desert outfitters so if you need to get a hold of me and slim then just click the contact button at the top of the pageso cmon lets go  scroll down to get good deals on equipment and books plus prospecting tips first thing to remember about gold is that it is heavy really heavy it is  times heavier then water and about  times heavier then iron  black sand  knowing this makes finding it that much easierbecause of its weight gold will always sink to the lowest level possible as rain wind freezing and thawing and geologic disruptions move the earth around gold is freed up and is relocated to another low point where it will rest until moved again look for streaks of black sand  magnetite hematite  as this is a  good indicator of minerals in the area which may contain gold  learn how to use your gold pan with classifier and sample ares that look promising keep a log of your samples and keep track of there locations  ie gps topo maps photos ect  remember that gold will drop out in low pressure zones so learn how to read these areas  ie inside bends if rivers behind large rocks or fallen trees cracks in the bedrock gravel bars if you are looking for gold in desert areas then know that movement and placement of placer gold will be very erratic as a result of intermittent water flows that provide scant opportunity for effective sorting of the gravels or concentration of the golddesert placer can be located in arroyos hillsides and on top of mesas and mountains the best means for recovery is with either a metal detector or drywasher if you find a  patch  with a metal detector then go back later with a dry washer to the same area chances are that small gold that could not be detected was traveling with the larger nuggets if you are drywashing be sure to check your header pile  large rocks that are classified out of the hopper   with a vlf metal detector for nuggetssample old mine dumps for free mill placer gold check for any piles of hand stacked rocks near the shaft or portal to the mine these will most likely be high grade ore that never made it to the mill check on line first what the area you are searching was producing and what the ore looks like that contains the free mill gold so when you get there you will know what to look for make sure it is free mill gold and not sulfides or tellurides if you find good ore and want to sample it  then bring a mortar and pestle with you and crush the rock down and then screen it through a   classifier pan that material and check for small specs of gold with a jewelers loop you will know right away if you have gold in your rock always be on the look out for very red to almost black looking quartz rock take samples and keep track of themwhen checking hard pack  hard pan  layers always look for the contact zones of large round river rocks sitting on bedrock or a false bedrock like clay or the contact zones between the different layers this is where the gold will be if any red to orange dirt is a good sign of iron being present in the dirt when checking hill sides or valleys look for red gossans  iron caps  or different color changes in the dirt this is where the minerals will be and possibly gold sample the contact zones look for laterites  ie skarn limonite jarosite plumbojarosite  for they can contain zone of secondary enrichment  polymetallic replacement deposits super gene deposits  ect and can be very rich with  pure gold the are usually very red to almost black and are in epithermal and hydrothermal zones​they are mostly shallow zones and can sometimes be found at the contact zones of sedimentary and igneous intrusions  granite porphyry   remember gold is found mostly in igneous and metamorphic rock shale slate  schist gneiss in the foliations of the rock gold can be found either with or with out quartz as a host rock  iron pyrite  iron sulfide  oxidizes out to form limonite and leaves the free mill gold behind sample red rusty looking rocks that have iron pyrite in them the pyrite can be crushed and roasted with table salt  to release the sulfur  sulfur dioxide  hydrogen sulfide  and leave the iron and gold behind that can be panned out      jeff and slim​​​​​​​
