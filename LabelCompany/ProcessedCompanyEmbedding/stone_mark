stonemark granite from home depot if so would you please let me know if you are happy with your kichen countertop and if you had a good experience did the selling feature of not having to seal the counter for  years influence your choice were thinking of making this purchase please help thanks email commentbookmarklike comments  thank you for reporting this comment undo formulaross re would you please let me know if you are happy with your kichen countertop and if you had a good experience the experience is going to depend greatly on the local granite installer which obviously is going to vary from place to place imo you will get a better installation if you find and quote the job yourself and work directly with the fabricationinstallation people its in the communication and the details regarding the  year sealing guarantee i wouldnt base my decision on that it is sooooo easy to seal granite less than  minutes for our large kitchen that to seal it every year or even every  months is no problem my wife looks forward to doing it  like    bookmark     march   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo jambar papattylou did you end up going with stonemark we are looking at countertops and the salesperson at home depot was high on stonemark if you purchased it were you happy with it  like    bookmark     march   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo jubileej hi im usually hanging out in the kitchen forum so just now saw this post i went with the innovative stone and just love the granite a very designconscious friend came by a week ago and ran her hand immediately over the counter saying i had really gone high end my only distress is that the fabrication company had not cut an extension of the counter top into the dining room area so it was symmetrical and i didnt realize it because of the trim being off but the installation is perfect otherwise and the seams dont show so im not going to have them waste an entire piece of granite to refabricate it and am fairly certain they would refuse anyway i had given them signoff when the finished and they refuse to come out to fix the dishwasher faulty install which my gc ended up taking care of but i have to say that hd was excellent to work with throughout and as i said sent their own person out to check on the installation just wish either of us had caught the asymmetry at the time  like    bookmark     march   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo luckyducks we just got stonemark granite countertops installed by hd this past week and oh my are they beeeeayoootiful i cant stay away from them lol we did the kitchen and bathroom and i find myself walking by and staring a lot very classy and rich looking the whole process was so fast too and everyone was great to deal with as for hd they just take your money and do absolutely nothing else in fact if you can get in touch with the fabricators you might do better to bypass hd and see if you can deal with them directly somehow youll save nearly half the price i wish id known that before i went with hd  the template guy and the fabricators and the installers were all wonderful friendly people i could have had the installer do my job himself and saved a ton im getting an extra piece to make a table top hd wanted like  for a  round piece of granite i told them to take a hike so get the stonemark brand of granite but try to find out if you can skip having to go through hd somehow youll save a ton and be glad you cut out the middle man wish we had if you cant and have to go through hd make sure you go see your slabs at the granite yard before they fabricate and dont let them try to tell you that its not necessary because the style you select is one that doesnt need to be previewed do it anywaybesides its kinda fun oh yeah and make absolute certain that your cabinets are all perfectly level when you take off your existing countertops for the template guy they cant install granite on uneven cabinet tops because the granite will not lay flat which will cause it to crack dont shim the top either to get it level because when youre sitting at the kitchen table youll be able to see the gaps under the counter and it might just drive you crazy you have to jack them up from the floor and shim from the bottoms and add cove molding or something also bowed walls will not allow the back splash to fit tight against the wall and will have some gaps not much can be done about it either as they cant scribe granite the way they do formica countertops you just gotta live with it and caulk it or put some decorative trim across the top or tile the wall to the top of the granite backsplash to hide it just some helpful tips so you dont have any surprises anyway were still very happy with the whole experience even if we had to use hd it was  problemfree and done from start to finish in less than a month how about that  like    bookmark     march   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo luckyducks sorry for all the long read but if any info i can share helps anyone else then its worth it other things to share are if you plan on using an undermount sink dont go with cast iron because they are too heavy and granite already weighs like  lbs per square foot so you will need to have it supported with braces underneath which will cut into your storage space under your sink youll need to either already have or definitely know what sink youll be using when the template guy shows up to template if using undermount you need to have or know your faucets too same with any other appliances that require cutout like a cooktop if youre getting any new appliances dishwasher cooktop range get them before the template guy comes out to be sure it all fits properly another issue is seams and if you need more than  linear feet of granite you will be getting a seam like it or not slabs do not come more than about   feet might find one about  feet but not likely our seam is at the sink and you cannot even see it  they did such a fantastic job with that if they dont already cut for your sink or cooktop when they arrive with your countertops you better hang up some sheets in your kitchen doorways to the rest of the house and open windows because when they start cutting that rock in your house the white dust cloud that forms will cause a big mess also the installer said we would have to seal the granite every year and i asked well what about  year warranty and the advertising that it is the first granite not to need sealing  he said he would still recommend a sealer every year to protect from bacteria esp in those little pitting areas always found on any granite surface also if you are considering doing another room like the bathroom or a bar with granite price it all together if you go with hd they have a minimum  job charge so if your bathroom is only a  job and you do it later youll be paying minimum  or they wont do it good luck and enjoy if you go with stonemarki know yo will  like    bookmark     march   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo jubileej hi lucky  great advice  only somehow our fabricators scribed the countertop right up to the wall  and they had and uneven layout to work with i am told that the granite is soaked in a tub of sealant for  days and that this process absolutely takes care of the sealing longterm hope so  and so far so good will keep my eye on it though  like    bookmark     april   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo prescott has anyone seen the actual warranty there is no copy of the coverage anywhere on there website or the home depot web site unlike the corian and silestone please post a link if you have onethanks  like    bookmark     may   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo mklein they dont actually post the warranty even on the stonemark website everything below can be found on innovatives website the limited warranty states that the manufacturer not the fabricator or hd will work with customers on removing stains that may occur for  years this does not mean that they will replace the tops if the stain cannot be removed the warranty is only effective if the owner adheres to the following rules clean up spills immediately not using household cleaning products with acid and ammonia windex  etc will void the warranty using a specialized cleaner made and sold by stonemark on a daily basis not using liquid dish soap with lemon scents and abrasive cleaners protecting the countertop with trivets and coasters when food or drinks are placed on the surface look at the care and maintenance section of the stonemark website from innovative if you do not follow all of the steps in care and use you may not be able to fall back on any warranty  like    bookmark     may   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo graniteshop im sure that stonemark is a good product but i am hesitant to believe that they offer anything special or exclusive their product is simply natural stone which is available from many sources with a fancy sealer applied and some words on paper to back it up only time will tell if they offer anything superior to what is already available from other sources as a fabricator i have a couple problems they are building their reputation on a general misconception that all stone needs to be sealed there are many stones that do not need to be sealed and gain little if any benefit when one is applied there are some porous stones that should be sealed properly for stain protection few if any of the materials they offer are exclusive they have renamed many commonly available stones with their own names which only serves to further confuse people ie stonemark baltic rain is common baltic brown with their special sealer applied a product is only as good as the company behind it im not saying that stonemark isnt good but it is still relatively new in the market and has barely had a chance to endure the test of time here is a link that might be useful stonemark warranty  like    bookmark     october   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo marie does anybody know if

stone needs to be sealed their product doesnt need to be sealed at all im not surprised that industry people such as fabricators many of whom sell competing products to stonemark misinterpret the products benefits they dont use a sealer its a special treatment that is applied in their factories that works inside the stone not just on the surface thats how they give that  year guarantee  like    bookmark     december   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo angier to go around home depot ask who does their installs and call them i chose to buy my countertop from hd so i could finance it with the  month no interest special i was very worried because i had read so many negative comments about buying granite from home depot but i had also read that it really comes down to the fabricatorinstallers so i asked and found out that my hd uses one of my areas biggest and best fabricatorinstallers and felt much better that being said and my counter in i am very satisfied the  year warranty or the nonsealing feature really didnt matter to me it did help me justify the cost to my dh though be aware that home depot does not have samples or displays of all the granites that are available for order from stonemark i had already placed my order for one pattern tropic brown when i happened to be in a different store and saw vecchio oro venetian gold on display and liked the latter better and changed my order it was at this point that i went to the fabricators to see the full slabs and pick the exact one i wanted there were variations in slabs of the same pattern also know that stonemark has renamed the granite i love love love my new counters  like    bookmark     january   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo nodirthere i got a quote from hd and from a

bookmark     april   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo granitectopguy i got a quote from hd and from a local granite contractor the hd granite was twice as much stonemark consists of premium quality gradea handselected stones by certified stone inspectors the stones are also treated with permashield comparing stonemark to generic granite from slabyards is not a prudent or fair endeavor also the price is comparable so thats very odd if its true that the stone was found for double the price i would be very dubious of the quality of that stone i think sealing it once a year will be no big deal families who are concerned about potentially being exposed to harmful chemicals every year may disagree granite countertops with permashield protection are both nsf and greenguard certified for safety and they dont need to be sealed i like the idea of an established relationship that will be ongoing the point of buying countertops with permashieldprotection is that you wont need to establish any relationships with stone yards ultimately you get what you pay for if you like natural stone and want a safe and easy to clean countertop permashield is the way to go here is a

look color and feel of my countertops but my experience with our area installer has been very distressing one section of the countertop has a  inch by  inch chip and another section has a scratch in the middle of the island under a direct light the imperfections either were there when the granite was pulled from the truck or were incurred during installation when i went to sign off on the installation i noted that i was unhappy with the chip and the installer said that they would not replace the piece they only offered to refabricate i had him refill the chip twice with different colors and it still looks awful i can deal with the scratch being filled as it seems minor compared to the chip it has been  business days and no one at innovative stone will return my phone calls i have purchased k of cabinets flooring and countertops k of stonemark for my kitchen remodeling project from home depot and it all has been a fairly good experience up until this install innovative stone is not even responding to calls made from my home depot expeditor i am in ohio so it might just be my local installer but beware i realize that a chip is not covered by warranty but how can they install a countertop with such a large chip and consider it a good business practice does anyone know how the refabrication process works i am assuming that they will grind the stone where the chip is and feather it back into the edge of the piece the chip is on the front of the countertop where it meets another piece of granite i am concerned that if i agree to have them refabricate this piece it will look odd and then two pieces of the countertop are affected  like    bookmark     may   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo noviceremodeler i recommend stonemark and am very pleased

october   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo rosefolly i dont know anything about home depots product and i would imagine it is fine but we bought our granite directly from a stone vendor picking out the exact slabs we wanted actually we had a lot of fun doing that then the fabricator picked them up cut and finished them and installed them at our house under our gcs supervision i would guess that adding home depot to the equation would add to the cost  another layer of middleman perhaps if you lived in an area where there are no independent stone vendors they might offer a useful
