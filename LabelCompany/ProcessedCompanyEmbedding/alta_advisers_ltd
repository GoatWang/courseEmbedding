positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund

commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis

messenger close nick davies thursday  april   edt question mark they may argue that they did all this merely so that they could advise zirundium on the sale what is odd is that the letters we have seen never mention this indeed they never mention zirundium at all what is just as odd is that when bezant finally struck a deal with the owners of woolwich farm he consulted rausing and then wrote back to the owners undertaking to buy the farm still without pointing out that it would be zirundium who would make the deal and zirundiums directors who would have to approve it and he did this on wadhurst park ltd headed paper it was a week later before wadhurst park ltd contacted zirundium to bring them into the picture again none of this ultimately is clear but in the same way there is an earlier question mark over whether zirundium was being managed and controlled from the uk in november  when the board of wadhurst park ltd took a formal decision to reconstruct a semiderelict building heronden house it belonged to zirundium on the land at morghew farm wadhurst parks managing director wrote to hans rausing asking for £ for the project to be sent from zirundium and rausing simply went to the family finance advisers and asked for the money but where were the directors of zirundium who were supposed to be managing and controlling the use of their property however nothing is certain in tax law until the last court has ruled it is possible for example that the offshore directors had given him some kind of standing authority to make these decisions when the guardian interviewed him rausing himself casually referred to morghew as his farm however he insisted that he had always tried to follow the law and the rules i am certain  i hope at least  that everything has been handled correctly whether it was may yet be put to the test for those millionaires who unlike hans rausing are domiciled in the uk the offshore havens are also a potential boon although on the face of it the law obstructs them uk law says that a domiciled resident must declare any income or gain from offshore investments but those who are unscrupulous know they can hide their wealth with very little chance that the taxman will even suspect it is there and even less chance that he will penetrate offshore secrecy if he does begin to suspect and those who have clever advisers can engage in infinitely complex transactions in order to shift profits into the hands of offshore partners who owe no tax while domicile loopholes and offshore havens may seal off the rest of the world from the inland revenue the rich are still liable to pay tax on income or capital gains which arise within the uk but there is some fancy footwork here too watch how it enables the richest man in britain to end up receiving more from the treasury in rebates and grants than he pays in tax hans rausing has set up three uk businesses one of them is an investment company named alta advisers which oversees the movement of the rausing fortune around the globe and handles personal finance and insurance forhis family it is a flourishing business with an annual turnover of nearly £m able to pay its chief executive an annual bonus of up to £m since it started work in april  altas published accounts show a total taxable profit of £m however the treasury has not benefited from the hundreds of thousands of pounds which it would normally have received from such a business in corporation tax and income tax this has been achieved by entirely lawful means with graceful simplicity and with a neat poke in the eye for the inland revenue simply alta has donated all of its taxable profits to charity and that charity is  the marit and hans rausing charitable foundation marit is hans wife this charity was set up by hans and its trustees are all appointed byhim every year it receives according to its published accounts income in the form of a covenant equal to the taxable profits of alta advisers ltd the taxman receives no corporation tax he keeps no income tax the cash which might have been spent by the government according to the wishes of the elected government is instead spent by rausings trustees according to their own lawful wishes if the message to the inland revenue were not already clear the charity has donated some £ to rightwing political thinktanks which are campaigning among other things for lower taxes apart from alta advisers hans rausing has set up two other uk businesses he chairs the company which until recently ran morghew farm in kent where he was growing crops and rearing wild boar and freshwater crayfish he also has a deer farm which he runs in the grounds of his palace at wadhurst park neither of these businesses has ever paid a penny in tax for the simple reason that both of them have consistently made losses however in the hands of skilled advisers a business which makes a loss then becomes a taxsaving opportunity rausing may be entitled to pay no tax on his earnings in the rest of the world his three uk business may pay no tax but he does pay personal tax in the uk it appears but is not certain that each year he declares to the taxman the pension which he receives from tetra pak this comes to him from two sources part is from sweden where it is taxed so there is little or no extra tax to pay if he brings it into the uk the rest comes from switzerland where it is not taxed en route to the uk this swiss pension is worth £ a year in one year which we have examined    he paid tax as though as he had a uk income of £ paying tax at  he owed the taxman£ it is at once galling and fascinating to watch what happens next it starts with the deer farm in the grounds of the sussex palace which has become the physical equivalent of a legal loophole allowing rausing not simply to avoid tax but quite lawfully to claim money back from the inland revenue and also from customs and excise which is responsible for collecting vat when rausing originally bought the land for his palace in  he diverted its ownership to the same offshore company which was to own his farm across the border in kent apart from spending millions on the main house and five other houses on the estate he also landscaped the gardens and introduced seven different breeds of deer  of them by  however his tax adviser had suggested that for various tax reasons he should put the estate back into his own name and he should start to farm the deer there as his own personal business the inland revenue allow special tax breaks for individuals who personally carry on a trade like farmers if their farms lose money they are allowed to set the losses against any taxable income they may have from other sources hans rausings deer farm has repeatedly lost money  an average of £ a year since he declared it was his business in march  so in the first place since the farm has made no profit it has not had to pay any tax but because these losses are attached to his personal trade as a deer farmer rausing can legally delete some £ a year from any other income which he was declaring to the inland revenue paying tax at  he was saving himself £ which would have paid a teachers salary for example at one point rausing and his advisers were worried that the inland revenue would not be happy about their use of the deer farm in this way tax rules say that a farms losses can be set against income tax only if it is a trade with a view to the realisation of profits in december  rausings personal tax adviser phillip prettejohn wrote to him it is still open for the inland revenue to argue that the deer farming activity is not being carried on as a business with a view to profit should they do so the losses would not be allowable for tax purposes  i asked richard bezant rausings manager this question and he said it would be difficult to provide  a strong argument to counter such a challenge by the revenue the fact was that the deer farm never did make a profit when i asked rausing recently if he regarded the deer farm as a business he said no no no it does not pay its own costs i have to put in money every single year he said the farm was nothing of economical importance at all whether this all means that the farm was not being run with a view to making profit has never been decided the inland revenue allowed rausing to use the losses from his deer farm to cut his tax bill for five years the maximum allowed by law saving him a total of £ in tax even when the five years were over his tax adviser found the presence of the deer would still allow him to classify the farm as agricultural land which meant rausing could cut his income tax simply he was allowed to tot up a list of specified costs at the rausing estate  repairs insurance office administration and phone  and set them against his income in the familiar way this new tax break turned out to cut his tax bill by some £ a year  almost exactly the same as the one it was replacing now watch how rausings  tax bill started to shrink fragment as we said earlier for  for the fragment of the global earnings which he declared rausing started with a potential tax bill of £ possibly linked to the swiss part of his tetra pak pension by the time that his tax adviser had finished using accumulated losses from the deer in rausings pastures that bill had been cut by £ leaving hans with only £ to pay since he had overpaid his tax the previous year that was then reduced by a further £ and rausing ended up with a bill of only £ but in the strange world of uk tax there were still more gifts in the pipeline for the richest man in britain the same government that allows the nondomiciled rich to avoid paying tax to the state also allows them to set themselves up in business and claim money back from the state hans rausing did this simply by pulling the levers which the government offers any businessman he reached a point where in the year which we have studied the state gave him more than he gave to it first there is vat in the old days before the deer farm became his personal business he simply lived at wadhurst park and had to pay  vat like anybody else but as soon as the deer became a business he was allowed to reclaim from customs and excise any vat which he spent on supplies for them since the deer farm collected very little vat he started to receive regular cheques from customs and excise  even more so since vat has risen to  in the four years from april  for example the vat man gave hans rausing a total of £ in refunds for amounts spent in relation to his deer farm  about £ a year half an hour down the road in kent the government was providing rausing with the same vat bounty at morghew farm whose losses similarly allowed it to reclaim money from customs and excise between march   and may   his business at morghew farm claimed a total of £ in reclaimed vat  some £ a year he even applied for a government scheme to pay his electricity bills in advance to avoid vat rausing says he knows nothing about vat refunds he simply left this to his advisers finally the state offered rausing an array of grants to encourage him in his farming business drainage grants organic farming grants setaside grants woodland grants arable area grants in  alonehis business at morghew farm was given £ in government grants over the three years to may  these grants totalled nearly half a million pounds £   payments varying in size between £ and £ an average of more than £ a year in grant income from the state rausing suggested to me that it would have been immoral for his farming business not to have taken the grants if you are running a commercial farm business you run it commercially if not you shouldnt run it now come back to the financial year of  when as we have already seen he succeeded in cutting his income tax bill down to just under £ rausing can pay that in full in that same year however he and his businesses were paid refunds of £ in vat at the deer farm £ in vat at morghew farm and £ in grants at morghew farm a total income from the treasury of £ total surplus after deducting £ of income tax £ the man who started with a possible tax bill of many millions a year has paid no millions at all indeed the treasury gave him more than he gave them and the law let him do it rausing told me that he could not imagine that he had made a profit out of the treasury i definitely feel that this is a very very wrong conclusion he said he refuses to discuss what fraction of his global earnings he is paying uk tax on he claims that his family have given more in charitable donations than they could have paid in tax certainly it is true that in the last few years his family have been giving substantial amounts to universities art galleries and other causes which have caught their eye but the sum of hans rausings donations is nowhere the near the total which he might have paid in tax over his  years in england and which would have been distributed according to the wishes of the democratically elected government rausing claims that high taxes ultimately penalise the poor more than the rich because they undermine enterprise he says sweden was once the richest country in europe and is now close to the bottom to the table it is a fine example of what high taxation can achieve his bottom line is a cruder one i am paying high taxes here if england would change the tax system i would simply go away i am not going to allow the tax system to destroy our company i think england understands this perfectly well later he suggested that he had saved himself no money by being nondomiciled and therefore he would stay in england even if the rules were changed years ago the law lords pointed their judicial finger at the moral ambiguity of lawful tax avoidance lord simon declared of recent years much ingenuity has been expended in certain quarters in attempting to devise methods of disposition of income by which those who were prepared to adopt them might enjoy the benefits of residence in this country  without sharing in the appropriate burden of british taxation judicial dicta may be cited which point out that however elaborate and artificial such methods may be those who adopt them are entitled to do so there is of course no doubt that they are within their legal rights but that is no reason why their efforts or those of the professional gentlemen who assist them in the matter should be regarded as a commendable exercise of ingenuity or as a discharge of the duties of good citizenship on the contrary one result of such methods if they succeed is of course to increase pro tanto the load of tax on the shoulders of the great body of good citizens who do not desire or do not know how to adopt these manoeuvres from year to year the detail of hans rausings tax schemes may differ he may not always do so well he may bring in more income which is taxable he may pay tax on capital gains within the uk in principle he may do even better behind the shifting of his annual tax return the background picture has been clear payments to the treasury by him and his interests on income held in the rest of the world  no tax due on capital gains held in the rest of the world  no tax due london finance company  no tax due kent arable farm  no tax due sussex deer farm  no tax due on company pension and other income and gains imported into the uk some tax due receipts from the treasury by him and his interests sussex deer farm  £ a year from the inland revenue and £ a year from customs and excise
