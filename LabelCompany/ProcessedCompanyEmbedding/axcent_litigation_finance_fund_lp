sec finra or lexshares’ specific financing model   lexshares inc all rights reserved litigation finance   lexshares litigation finance  what is litigation finance at its most basic level litigation finance also called litigation funding is the practice where a third party unrelated to the lawsuit provides capital to a plaintiff involved in litigation in return for a portion of any financial recovery from the lawsuit litigation finance unlocks the value of legal claims by providing capital to plaintiffs before their cases are resolved this type of financing has existed for more than  years and is increasingly becoming a mainstream funding solution that helps equalize access to the legal system fortune  companies major universities and businesses of all sizes have benefited from litigation funding the capital provided by monetizing a legal claim may directly pay for some of the costs of litigation including attorneys’ fees expert witness fees and court expenses litigation finance may be used to fund working capital for companies involved in litigation or even help business owners pay for personal expenses unequal access to the legal system in much of the world access to justice requires abundant capital because litigation is expensive many factors contribute to the cost of litigation attorney fees research depositions interrogatories motions conferences witness preparation trials subpoenas appeals as well as expenses associated with court fees consultants and investigations all too often litigants who seek justice are unable to pursue their claims due to the high costs associated with lawsuits many plaintiffs who have a compelling case will choose to defer or ultimately abandon legal recourse a great imbalance of resources exists between average and wealthy litigants creating impediments to judicial access and a distortion of legal outcomes for the undercapitalized parties involved in litigation finance generally there are three principal participants in litigation funding – plaintiffs investors and attorneys plaintiffs plaintiffs are individuals or companies involved in commercial lawsuits that need to fund litigation expenses working capital or personal expenses for more information about how lexshares benefits plaintiffs click here investors investing in legal claims creates a new asset class out of disputes allowing investors to purchase portions of future proceeds from litigation for an upfront cash payment lexshares model helps connect accredited investors with prevetted investment opportunities for more information about how lexshares model enables investment in legal claims click here attorneys and law firms attorneys facilitate the case evaluation process by providing investors with information about claims in most funding transactions attorneys serve as custodians of funds for all of the lawsuit’s stakeholders and upon resolution distribute those funds to them for more information about how lexshares benefits attorneys and law firms click here litigation finance and the justice system as justice systems around the world seek to facilitate access to courts litigation finance is increasingly viewed as a critical tool for equalizing access and preventing distorted outcomes that favor wealthy litigants litigation finance improves the legal system by filtering out frivolous cases investors will not take on the risk of investing in these types of claims due to their lack of economic value in addition litigation finance can have the effect of encouraging settlement by depriving wealthy defendants of an unfair advantage even when cases do proceed in court the process becomes more streamlined because delay tactics no longer have their intended effect against the plaintiff this helps plaintiffs and attorneys achieve recoveries which are more closely aligned with the case merits and nature of their damages litigation finance offers a number of benefits litigation finance offers a number of important benefits to plaintiffs attorneys and investors plaintiffs helps undercapitalized plaintiffs further meritorious cases by financing litigation expenses provides capital injections for already filed cases that experience funding constraints reduces the risk of premature settlement for less than cases are worth unlocks liquidity for working capital provides  a cushion for personal expenses allows companies to manage how litigation costs affect their balance sheets enables greater access to top legal talent attorneys and law firms allows attorneys to accept cases from plaintiffs who otherwise could not afford their fees provides capital for all litigation expenses including expert witness fees reduces the risk that clients will run out of money during litigation enables attorneys to offer more flexible payment arrangements to prospective clients increases plaintiffs’ effectiveness by providing funding for working capital and personal expenses helps achieve recoveries that are more in line with case merits and damages investors access to new asset class investments in legal claims are uncorrelated to capital markets outsized historical returns compared with other alternative asset classes moderate time to liquidity versus other alternative investments attorneys and litigation finance most states have issued bar ethics opinions that permit litigation finance transactions provided attorneys fulfill certain disclosure requirements and avoid conflicts of interest for example attorneys are allowed to share information about cases with investors after receiving the client’s consent moreover they are allowed to honor a client’s written assignment or lien for a portion of the proceeds from a recovery the new york city bar association has recently recognized the growth of litigation funding and commented that it is a valuable means for paying the costs of pursuing a legal claim” so far twentynine jurisdictions have issued ethics opinions relating to litigation finance we have included ethics opinions from several states below california bar florida bar illinois bar los angeles county bar new york state bar  new york state bar  new york city bar  legal doctrines relating to litigation finance lexshares respects the legal issues and ethical considerations relating to investments in lawsuits several legal doctrines are frequently mentioned when discussing litigation finance in the united states they include the doctrines of maintenance champerty and barratry as well as attorneyclient privilege and work product immunity maintenance champerty and barratry maintenance involves an arrangement where a party supports another to enable him or her to further a legal claim champerty is a specific form of maintenance where an unrelated party strikes a bargain with a litigant to financially support the litigation in return for a share of the proceeds from that claim finally barratry entails the encouragement of another to bring or continue a claim these three medieval english doctrines historically prohibited thirdparty financing of lawsuits in the united states and most other common law countries today the modern view is to permit maintenance champerty and barratry as these doctrines are predominantly viewed by the courts as obsolete in medieval england maintenance and champerty was used by the powerful as a means of settling scores feudal lords and other privileged members of society would often support legal disputes of others against the supporter’s personal or political enemy most colonies that imported their laws from england – including many us states – passed laws designed to protect litigants from “officious intermeddling” and profiteering from the sale of legal claims to third parties over time as other means of controlling abuses of the legal system became more effective the need for the prohibitions on maintenance champerty and barratry became obsolete the american civil justice system increasingly recognized that access to justice depends upon the broad availability of legal representation for all socioeconomic levels the public policy for increasing access to the legal system for those that could least afford it overrode the concerns underlying these doctrines in many states according to the modern view widespread exceptions to these doctrines recognize that financial considerations often influence access to justice most states now permit maintenance champerty and barratry as they refuse to void contracts based on these outdated doctrines attorneyclient privilege and attorney work product immunity the attorneyclient privilege is a legal concept that protects certain communications between attorney and client from disclosure to the opposition in addition the workproduct immunity protects materials prepared by attorneys and third parties in anticipation of litigation from discovery these two concepts are actually two separate legal doctrines but frequently cited together recent cases support the view that litigation finance transactions preserve the protections afforded by both doctrines in mondis technology ltd v lg electronics inc  wl  ed tex a court refused to compel production of documents provided to investors more recently in devon it inc v ibm corp  wl  ed pa a court held that discussions with litigation investors are covered by the workproduct doctrine the judge in that case explained that since the investors and devon shared a common interest in the outcome of the case and had entered into the confidentiality agreement their communications were protected in a practical sense issues regarding the waiver of the attorneyclient privilege apply to only a small class of information the privilege clearly applies only to communications between a client and the attorney not just any communication about the lawsuit the client is free to tell a prospective funder anything other than what the client communicated to the attorney without waiving the privilege an investor can expect to receive substantial information from the plaintiff about the claim without ever creating waiver problems lexshares managing member and broker dealer wealthforge can evaluate the merits of cases without access to privileged information the case evaluation process generally focuses on the legal team’s assessment of the case as well as documents that are already subject to discovery additional resources with litigation finance becoming more pervasive a growing number of legal scholars have drawn attention to important considerations

shang es is the cofounder of legalist the first algorithmic litigation finance firm a graduate of silicon valley startup accelerator y combinator and funded by several top vc firms legalist funds small business litigation   ng as with the development of any new industry it can be difficult to gauge the size of the potential market what do you see as the addressable market for litigation finance jb there are two very different types of litigation finance providers consumer funders who service individuals with small personal injury claims and commercial funders like bentham imf who provide financing to plaintiffs in highstakes commercial litigations and to law firms with contingency case portfolios as awareness of commercial litigation funding grows it will become a financing option that virtually all commercial litigants will consider inhouse counsel and cfos will also increasingly employ it as a means for managing their legal budgets ab crowdjustice is engaged in a fairly unique space crowdfunding for litigation in our first  months in the uk more than  million was raised for cases through the platform we officially launched in the us on january   with a case that challenged the trump administration’s executive order barring immigration from seven countries and as we look at the us market we see the same factors present as in the uk a widening gulf with regard to access to justice a desire on the part of individuals to be involved in social change in a concrete way and a disconnect between legal cases and their potential broader communities of support the needs are significant but we see a real opportunity for crowdfunding to significantly grow the market by providing typically underequipped litigants a simple entry point through which to seek justice cdl the size of the market depends on what types of transactions are considered litigation finance we would estimate a market of at least  billion worth of demand from litigants in highvalue commercial lawsuits and arbitrations however the market increases to at least  billion when considering large judgment enforcements and asset recoveries claim portfolios financings offered directly to law firms and other service providers and other types of legal claims that would be handled primarily outside of courtarbitration ld as noted above the lower the cost of capital offered by a funder the more attractive the option of litigation finance will be for a business currently the litigation finance industry is in a price discovery period and participants in the market are pricing their capital conservatively or at least they should be the industry will likely be in this period for the immediate future but ultimately the cost of capital should reach a point where virtually every business utilizes litigation finance this is because litigation funders unlike businesses that hold an individual claim hold claim assets in a portfolio and so mitigate the idiosyncratic risk associated with any one potential loss i wrote a white paper on this topic es litigation finance is appropriate for any business and individual with a meritorious case who wishes to mitigate their risk there’s a misconception that the only contenders for litigation finance are cashstrapped however litigation is risky even businesses that have the resources to selffund their case can find litigation finance a useful way to mitigate downside risk and instead devote the money to growing their company legalist in particular specializes in small businesses who often only need a few hundred thousand to kick off their case in our book there’s no case too small ng in what circumstances do you think it is appropriate for a business or individual to turn to litigation finance jb in general individuals and companies seek funding in one of three circumstances  they lack sufficient resources to hire their preferred counsel and their preferred counsel is unable to offer an acceptable alternative fee arrangement  they would rather use their available capital for other purposes ie for operating capital andor  they would like to monetize part of their litigation asset ie they have a judgment that is on appeal ab crowdjustice exists to help bridge the access to justice gap we are open to all cases that need the financial support or the awareness raising of crowdfunding—or both we think it is appropriate for people to engage in crowdfunding through our platform when they have a viable legal case that has a public interest component or touches upon a community concern a local environmental or zoning regulation or an employment discrimination claim can be just as much of a matter of public interest as an executive order we provide a platform for raising funds at all stages of a litigation from the funds needed to initially file a case through to appealing a decision and everything in between because our approach reaches outside of traditional donor bases crowdjustice benefits organizations large and small seeking to garner support for their work and assists individuals in raising awareness and funding for their legal causes cdl litigation finance is appropriate for any individual or business that wants to pursue a meritorious legal claim for monetary damages and either cannot afford the legal fees and other costs associated with major commercial litigation or would simply prefer to shift the associated financial risk to a third party litigation finance makes sense even where a claimant has a  contingency fee billing arrangement in place with legal counsel as the claimant will typically still be required to pay for court costs thirdparty expert fees investigation costs etc most funders are willing to fund such costs provided that an appropriate arrangement can be reached with the claimant and its counsel regarding payment priority and other related matters ld any business with a meritorious legal claim should consider litigation finance the decision to use litigation finance should turn largely on a claimholder’s cost of capital vs the cost of capital that will be charged by the funder to illustrate if a litigation funder such as lake whillans were to offer to invest  million in a claim that was worth  million and was expected to last one year in exchange for  of the proceeds then it would make sense for most businesses to use litigation finance in that instance if the claim was successful the funder would be entitled to  profit the equivalent of a  return meanwhile the business could use the m that it did not have to use for the litigation to grow the business presumably by more than  in one year and also enjoy the benefit of not bearing the risk of loss in the litigation of course a funder may demand a larger portion of the proceeds in which case the business may have a more difficult decision the crux of the matter though rests in the cost of capital that is being charged ng how do you market your services to law firms and individuals who want to fund litigation jb we devote significant time and energy toward educating lawyers clients and judges about the salutary uses of funding while there has undoubtedly been an increased awareness of litigation funding a majority of lawyers and clients who would benefit from funding are either unaware of it altogether or misunderstand what it is and how it works to address this knowledge gap we give presentations at legal and business conferences and provide cle programs to law firms among other things  ab when it comes to firms we make sure they know that crowdfunding isn’t just for charities or pro bono work though it certainly can be a powerful tool for both but many valuable cases are being brought by firms—or could be brought by firms—that suffer for a lack of resources in those cases crowdfunding can be a great help because it raises funds draws together communities and generates an extended discussion related to issues we often reach out to individuals who have a case through their legal counsel this has the added benefit of ensuring that the lawyer is informed of and on board with the decision to crowdfund our model is premised on both the case owner usually the client and the lawyer supporting the decision to engage in a crowdfunding campaign cdl due to the high demand for litigation funding among individual claimants corporations law firms and other service providers and comparatively low level of supply from funders extensive marketing efforts are not essential to source funding opportunities while press releases paidfor press coverage and other traditional public relations and media efforts are used extensively by other firms in this space we find that the best opportunities come from organically building and maintaining mutually beneficial relationships with toptier law firms and other service providers as many relationships will lead to significant repeat business and thirdparty referrals delta’s goal is to be the funder of choice for the best firms rather than simply one option of many ng what types of disputes are best suited for litigation finance jb at bentham we focus on highdollar commercial disputes where the expected damages are likely to exceed  million and often far greater amounts and where the funding sought ranges from  million to  million or more these litigations may involve a wide variety of claims such as breach of contract antitrust patent infringement and theft of intellectual property to name just a few  ab at crowdjustice we think that crowdfunding is suitable for cases that are in the public interest—whether that is the interest of a local community in supporting one of its members or addressing environmental concerns or much larger national communities addressing issues of constitutional importance we are a neutral platform and we welcome people from all across the ideological spectrum to bring cases on issues of interest to them but the common denominator among those that succeed is that they tell a compelling story to galvanize others who want to see the litigation succeed cdl typical claims funded by commercial litigation funders include among others those arising out of commercial or corporate disputes investment and financing transactions intellectual property antitrust environmental matters and judgment and arbitral award enforcements these and other commercial claim types are wellsuited for litigation finance provided that the claimant is primarily seeking monetary damages rather than injunctions performance of nonmonetary aspects of a contract or other forms of relief that are not easily shared with a funder or readily able to be monetized es the better question is what type of dispute is best suited for each litigation financier legalist in particular specializes in small business disputes and our minimum investment size is only  one factor that many litigation financiers look for is litigation with a strong damagestoinvestment ratio which means that the amount at stake is significantly greater than the amount needed to litigate ng what are the different types of litigation finance products and how are they used jb at bentham we offer  singlecase funding involving a wide range of risksharing models  portfolio funding for law firms against a basket of matters with a contingency component and  working capital for plaintiffs that they can use for purposes other than the litigation itself singlecase funding is often used to enable lawyers and claimants to bridge different risk needs such as where the client wants a full contingency but the lawyer’s firm only allows for a modest hourly discount law firms use portfolio funding to smooth cash flow or to enable them to take on more contingency cases plaintiffs use operating capital to pursue other immediate needs that cannot wait until their matter is finally concluded ab crowdfunding is a tool that allows individuals to raise money from a distributed network of people to fund a given cause at crowdjustice we have optimized the crowdfunding model for litigation by building in unique safeguards to provide both case owners and backers confidence in the process and by developing expertise in shaping crowdfunding campaigns around legal cases our platform is used by individuals and organizations—often but not exclusively taxexempt organizations—who build a case page to tell their stories then use traditional press alongside new social media strategies to reach potential backers litigation because it has the potential to effect concrete change is a powerful market for crowdfunding cdl a large number of different products exist and vary from funder to funder but the most common form of litigation financing is the provision of nonrecourse funding for legal fees costs and expenses associated with a legal proceeding in return for a share of the proceeds of such proceedings funders also purchase judgments awards and claims directly from claimants fund appeals and enforcement proceedings and lend against claims in certain circumstances a rapidly growing area that several funders including delta are now focusing on involves the funding of portfolios of claims held by a law firm a liquidation estate a corporation or other party the structure of such portfolio fundings varies greatly by funder so law firms and other portfolio holders should be sure to shop around for the product that best suits their needs ng how can law firms use litigation finance to win more business and grow their practices jb litigation funding helps law firms win more business by among other things enabling them to offer prospective clients a wider variety of alternative fee options for instance companies that have suffered a wrong and have a good claim will nonetheless sometimes choose not to bring suit because they are unwilling or unable to increase their legal spend with litigation financing a law firm can offer its client the functional equivalent of a full contingency thereby allowing the company to pursue its claims without substantially impacting its bottom line ab for firms that might consider using crowdfunding whether to assist in aspects of pro bono efforts or as part of a paid representation the virality of the model is one of its most attractive aspects crowdfunding is social by its very nature which means that a crowdfunding campaign reaches new audiences who have an interest in the underlying work those might be potential clients partners or just interested parties who support the work cdl litigation finance allows a law firm to offer its clients alternative or discounted fee structures that would otherwise not be acceptable to the firm from a risk standpoint by being able to provide legal representation and also source the funding necessary for such representation a law firm is able to be a fullsolution provider for clients that have strong claims but lack the financing necessary to pursue major litigation this ability is especially important for practitioners working with small businesses individual investors bankruptcy and liquidation estates and other types of clients that commonly have claims against much larger wellfunded counterparties ld biglaw firms throughout the country have traditionally built highend business litigation practices by cultivating relationships with the largest corporations and their general counsel clients that generally were less financially constrained and thus more likely to accept the hourly rate billing structure over the long course of complex litigation with the advent of litigation finance and firms such as lake whillans entrepreneurial litigators at large firms have a new path to building sustainable highend litigation business rather than the more traditional focus on companies with relatively unconstrained litigation budgets and strong balance sheets entrepreneurial litigators at large firms have begun to realize that litigation financing affords them the opportunity to build practices by targeting companies with financial constraints but meritorious claims often against larger companies requiring complex and expensive litigation es one of the biggest constraining factors for law firms especially small firms and solos is the need for steady revenue often meritorious cases stall for lack of funding as lawyers choose instead to devote their time to cases that can pay on a monthly basis litigation finance allows lawyers to take on cases where clients seek contingency arrangements while still providing the law firm consistent monthly revenue ng what ethical issues should lawyers be aware of when approaching a funder jb lawyers exploring using litigation funding should be particularly careful to protect their client’s confidential material attorneys must avoid jeopardizing the attorneyclient privilege and work product doctrine they also need to be mindful not to violate applicable state laws regarding champerty or maintenance for these reason counsel should be careful to work only with established funders with a reputation for integrity and transparency ab crowdjustice is unique in being a crowdfunding platform for litigation our model is entirely contributionbased and money raised through our site is transferred directly to a lawyer’s client trust account to be held for the client as the beneficial owner or directly to a charity if a charity is the case owner among the benefits of this model for practitioners is that backers of the case do not have any financial interest in the underlying litigation there is no potential for crowdfunding to interfere in any way with the attorneyclient relationship cdl coverage on ethical issues affecting the funding relationship typically focuses on the prohibitions on maintenance and champerty the need to protect the attorneyclient and attorney work product privileges and other matters focused on protecting the client from any adverse affects from the introduction of a funder one issue that is often ignored is the conflict that can be created where a lawyer manages the process of sourcing litigation funding for a client on the assumption that the lawyer will be used to litigate the underlying claims these two distinct roles are not an issue where the client’s interest are given priority however a lawyer may be incentivized to structure the funding process so that the client is steered away from funders that prefer to use a different law firm for the lawsuit or that request attorney engagement terms that the lawyer dislikes for this reason it is very important that a lawyer be transparent with its client prior to and during the process of sourcing litigation financing as well as with potential funders ng what is likely to be the longterm impact of litigation finance on the legal system jb litigation finance has already begun to level the playing field for small and larger companies with meritorious claims the practice will expand greatly over time both for single cases and for law firm portfolios strong single cases will no longer be cheaply settled because the injured party cannot afford the cost of litigation or is unable to wait for a judgment larger law firms will have portfolios of shared risk in every major practice group with time far fewer defendants will employ a litigation strategy designed to “wear down” the other side it simply won’t make sense to do so in addition as clients increasingly demand alternatives to the hourly billing model for litigation they will develop a preference for litigation finance over other alternative fee arrangements offered by law firms largely due to the balance sheet benefits that funding provides for companies ab crowdfunding is a tool not just to raise funds but also to raise awareness and build communities the longterm sustained development of crowdfunding as a viable tool in a litigation context will result in more engaged groups and provide individuals with concrete ways to support causes about which they feel strongly it will also strengthen firms charities and individual practitioners who use it both by providing them increased resources to do meaningful work and by helping them broaden the base of support for their work cdl the biggest impact will be a revolution in how law firms and other service providers finance their businesses large and midsize law firms currently tend to be very riskaverse in large part due to the partnership model prohibitions on the sharing of legal fees with nonlawyers and difficulties in borrowing against prospective contingency fees however professional funders are beginning to offer new products to law firms that did not exist previously including debt and equity funding tied exclusively to profits generated by case portfolios and receivables financing for payments that are contingent on the outcome of an appeal or enforcement as the use of these products becomes more prevalent by law firms firms will be able to offer a wider array of alternative billing arrangements to clients take on larger shares of risk and reward in client engagements and generally become more flexible in meeting the evolving needs of clients ld our hope at lake whillans is that litigation finance can be a tool to help the legal system more efficiently administer justice we too often see large companies acting with impunity breaching contracts misappropriating trade secrets etc all without fear of reproach because their counterparty lacks the resources to mount a challenge in the legal system ultimately litigation finance will allow all companies with meritorious claims to efficiently access the legal system and protect their interests es at its root litigation finance creates access to justice especially focusing on small business disputes we see our mission at legalist as directly helping the little guy get access to the court system whether you’re a local ice cream manufacturer in massachusetts or an antique shop in santa barbara access to justice should not be constrained by capital the growth of litigation finance

against creditworthy opponents provided that   the amount of damages claimed comfortably exceeds the amount of finance required  and   you are able to put up adequate security    what do we mean by adequate security  in addition to gauging the strength of your litigation and its likely proceeds plus whether finance protection insurance will be available to you lenders will expect a charge over one or more of  a property unlikely if the property is your principal private residence  a debtor book  an investment account  any other adequate company owned or personal asset  a personal guarantee  litigation finance significantly reduces the ongoing commitment needed to pay your solicitor’s fees and disbursements throughout the legal dispute and you can make an application for finance at any point during the legal dispute   litigation finance and litigation funding are often confused finance is a loan made on a ‘recourse’ basis meaning that the loan capital and interest will be repayable regardless as to the outcome of your litigation litigation funding is where a funder takes a stake in your litigation and is paid out of your winnings only if the litigation is successful and the proceeds are sufficient if the litigation loses then the funder has to write off their investment and there is nothing to repay how ulp can help we have over  years’ experience arranging finance or

asked questions and answers but if your question is not listed do call or email us get in touch how much does litigation finance cost interest can be from c per month for the loan duration loan periods range typically from  to  months what can the loan be used for the loan can only be used to pay for your solicitor’s fees and any disbursements that are incurred in relation to your legal dispute eg expert’s costs barrister’s costs court fees etc the loan cannot be used to pay vat if you are vat registered and able to claim vat back from hmrc the loan also cannot be used to pay for your opponent’s costs or any award in favour of your opponent   how much can i borrow and how is it paid   the amount of money that you can borrow will be determined by the amount of security that you can provide and the affordability of the loan  both in terms of your ability to pay the interest payments and your ability to repay the loan in the event that the litigation proceeds andor any finance protection insurance are insufficient to fully repay the loan  the lender will agree a loan facility with you which you can use as your dispute progresses you will approve each request by your solicitor to draw money down from your loan facility approval means confirming based on your solicitor’s advice that your claim still has sufficient merits to continue and that your opponent still has the ability to compensate you more than adequately do i pay interest as i go along there are two types of interestonly loans available the usual position is where the loan interest is payable as your claim progresses and you will be required to maintain the ongoing payment of monthly loan interest failure to maintain the ongoing payment of loan interest could result in additional charges andor the lender recalling the loan alternatively it may be possible to defer ‘roll up’ interest and pay this upon conclusion of your legal dispute can i borrow more money if the amount i have borrowed is not sufficient to bring my legal dispute to conclusion it is important to make sure at the outset that you have enough money to see your legal dispute through to conclusion as if you discontinue due to insufficient finance then the original loan capital advance will need to be repaid in full your solicitor will prepare a costs budget for you and help you with this   if additional borrowing is nonetheless needed this will only be considered where additional adequate loan security can be offered in support of the new application and after a renewed enquiry into the affordability of the loan can i insure the loan yes we may be able to arrange finance protection insurance for you this is designed to repay the loan capital drawn down when  you have not been successful in the claim against your opponent  you have been successful in the claim against your opponent but you have not recovered enough from them to repay the loan capital in full  your opponent has become insolvent or bankrupt before you have recovered damages from them  some lenders will insist on a finance protection insurance policy in addition to the security you have offered them for the loan finance protection insurance may be purchased even if the lender does not require it as a condition of the loan what is after the event ate insurance an ate insurance policy will pay your opponents costs in the event your claim is unsuccessful often it is possible for ulp to arrange an ate policy with a deferred and conditional insurance premium meaning that the premium is only payable if and when you receive a successful outcome in your litigation   more information about ate insurance is available here do i need a barrister’s opinion if finance protection insurance andor ate insurance is required then a positive barrister’s opinion is more will be required in support of your application × lets talk about your requirements fund finance  services  dechert llp a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v

practice where a third party unrelated to the lawsuit provides capital to a plaintiff involved in litigation in return for a portion of any financial recovery from the lawsuit litigation finance unlocks the value of legal claims by providing capital to plaintiffs before their cases are resolved this type of financing has existed for more than  years and is increasingly becoming a mainstream funding solution that helps equalize access to the legal system fortune  companies major universities and businesses of all sizes have benefited from litigation funding the capital provided by monetizing a legal claim may directly pay for some of the costs of litigation including attorneys’ fees expert witness fees and court expenses litigation finance may be used to fund working capital for companies involved in litigation or even help business owners pay for personal expenses unequal access to the legal system in much of the world access to justice requires abundant capital because litigation is expensive many factors contribute to the cost of litigation attorney fees research depositions interrogatories motions conferences witness preparation trials subpoenas appeals as well as expenses associated with court fees consultants and investigations all too often litigants who seek justice are unable to pursue their claims due to the high costs associated with lawsuits many plaintiffs who have a compelling case will choose to defer or ultimately abandon legal recourse a great imbalance of resources exists between average and wealthy litigants creating impediments to judicial access and a distortion of legal outcomes for the undercapitalized parties involved in litigation finance generally there are three principal participants in litigation funding – plaintiffs investors and attorneys plaintiffs plaintiffs are individuals or companies involved in commercial lawsuits that need to fund litigation expenses working capital or personal expenses for more

litigation finance and the justice system as justice systems around the world seek to facilitate access to courts litigation finance is increasingly viewed as a critical tool for equalizing access and preventing distorted outcomes that favor wealthy litigants litigation finance improves the legal system by filtering out frivolous cases investors will not take on the risk of investing in these types of claims due to their lack of economic value in addition litigation finance can have the effect of encouraging settlement by depriving wealthy defendants of an unfair advantage even when cases do proceed in court the process becomes more streamlined because delay tactics no longer have their intended effect against the plaintiff this helps plaintiffs and attorneys achieve recoveries which are more closely aligned with the case merits and nature of their damages litigation finance offers a number of benefits litigation finance offers a number of important benefits to plaintiffs attorneys and investors plaintiffs helps undercapitalized plaintiffs further meritorious cases by financing litigation expenses provides capital injections for already filed cases that experience funding constraints reduces the risk of premature settlement for less than cases are worth unlocks liquidity for working capital provides  a cushion for personal expenses allows companies to manage how litigation costs affect their balance sheets enables greater access to top legal talent attorneys and law firms allows attorneys to accept cases from plaintiffs who otherwise could not afford their fees provides capital for all litigation expenses including expert witness fees reduces the risk that clients will run out of money during litigation enables attorneys to offer more flexible payment arrangements to prospective clients increases plaintiffs’ effectiveness by providing funding for working capital and personal expenses helps achieve recoveries that are more in line with case merits and damages investors access to new asset class investments in legal claims are uncorrelated to capital markets outsized historical returns compared with other alternative asset classes moderate time to liquidity versus other alternative investments attorneys and litigation finance most states have issued bar ethics opinions that permit litigation finance transactions provided attorneys fulfill certain disclosure requirements and avoid conflicts of interest for example attorneys are allowed to share information about cases with investors after receiving the client’s consent moreover they are allowed to honor a client’s written assignment or lien for a portion of the proceeds from a recovery the new york city bar association has recently recognized the growth of litigation funding and commented that it is a valuable means for paying the costs of pursuing a legal claim” so far twentynine jurisdictions have issued ethics opinions relating to litigation finance we have included ethics opinions from several states below california bar florida bar illinois bar los angeles county bar new york state bar  new york state bar  new york city bar  legal doctrines relating to litigation finance lexshares respects the legal issues and ethical considerations relating to investments in lawsuits several legal doctrines are frequently mentioned when discussing litigation finance in the united states they include the doctrines of maintenance champerty and barratry as well as attorneyclient privilege and work product immunity maintenance champerty and barratry maintenance involves an arrangement where a party supports another to enable him or her to further a legal claim champerty is a specific form of maintenance where an unrelated party strikes a bargain with a litigant to financially support the litigation in return for a share of the proceeds from that claim finally barratry entails the encouragement of another to bring or continue a claim these three medieval english doctrines historically prohibited thirdparty financing of lawsuits in the united states and most other common law countries today the modern view is to permit maintenance champerty and barratry as these doctrines are predominantly viewed by the courts as obsolete in medieval england maintenance and champerty was used by the powerful as a means of settling scores feudal lords and other privileged members of society would often support legal disputes of others against the supporter’s personal or political enemy most colonies that imported their laws from england – including many us states – passed laws designed to protect litigants from “officious intermeddling” and profiteering from the sale of legal claims to third parties over time as other means of controlling abuses of the legal system became more effective the need for the prohibitions on maintenance champerty and barratry became obsolete the american civil justice system increasingly recognized that access to justice depends upon the broad availability of legal representation for all socioeconomic levels the public policy for increasing access to the legal system for those that could least afford it overrode the concerns underlying these doctrines in many states according to the modern view widespread exceptions to these doctrines recognize that financial considerations often influence access to justice most states now permit maintenance champerty and barratry as they refuse to void contracts based on these outdated doctrines attorneyclient privilege and attorney work product immunity the attorneyclient privilege is a legal concept that protects certain communications between attorney and client from disclosure to the opposition in addition the workproduct immunity protects materials prepared by attorneys and third parties in anticipation of litigation from discovery these two concepts are actually two separate legal doctrines but frequently cited together recent cases support the view that litigation finance transactions preserve the protections afforded by both doctrines in mondis technology ltd v lg electronics inc  wl  ed tex a court refused to compel production of documents provided to investors more recently in devon it inc v ibm corp  wl  ed pa a court held that discussions with litigation investors are covered by the workproduct doctrine the judge in that case explained that since the investors and devon shared a common interest in the outcome of the case and had entered into the confidentiality agreement their communications were protected in a practical sense issues regarding the waiver of the attorneyclient privilege apply to only a small class of information the privilege clearly applies only to communications between a client and the attorney not just any communication about the lawsuit the client is free to tell a prospective funder anything other than what the client communicated to the attorney without waiving the privilege an investor can expect to receive substantial information from the plaintiff about the claim without ever creating waiver problems lexshares managing member and broker dealer wealthforge can evaluate the merits of cases without access to privileged information the case evaluation process generally focuses on the legal team’s assessment of the case as well as documents that are already subject to discovery additional resources with litigation finance becoming more pervasive a growing number of legal scholars have drawn attention to important considerations in this field we have included the most notable materials
