brand called fathom™ defining a new travel category it is calling social impact travel that will offer consumers authentic meaningful impact travel experiences to work alongside locals as they tackle community needs what sets fathom apart is the longterm systematic partnership approach with its partner countries paired with the unique business model that allows for sustained impact and lasting development fathoms scale and global vision reach beyond what the world has ever seen   the companys first destination will be the dominican republic a country known for its spectacular beauty but also a country where the average household income is approximately  usd a year and more than two million dominicans do not have access to piped water fathom will operate as a standalone brand the th global brand in the carnival corporation family beginning in april  fathom will embark on sevenday voyages from portmiami aboard the mv adonia a passenger vessel redeployed from carnival corporations po cruises uk for the startup of the new operation depending on their passions interests and skills travelers will have the opportunity to choose from a range of social impact activities and experiences both onboard and onshore travel that creates enduring transformative social impact  fathom will cater to a growing market of consumers who want to have a positive impact on peoples lives and arent always sure where to begin said arnold donald ceo of carnival corporation we believe travel is a meaningful way to allow for personal growth while making purposeful and engaging contributions to the world we are so pleased that fathom will give travelers a unique opportunity to work alongside local people as part of a larger scale effort that will demonstrably improve lives both our travelers and the local citizens will learn and benefit from the opportunity to serve together donald brought in a nontraditional social entrepreneur tara russell founder and chairman of create common good wwwcreatecommongoodorg a food production social enterprise to lead this effort russell will serve as president of fathom and as global impact lead for carnival corporation russell established and led the team that has been working on the design and business model for fathom since late  we created fathom to meet the real hunger in the world for purpose while at the same time tackling profound social issues through a sustainable business model said russell we harness the assets and resources of the worlds largest travel and leisure company and combine them with the talents and hearts of those working in social enterprises around the world travelers will work in partnership with proven trusted local organizations on the ground to amplify their missions for far greater sustained impact russell said because fathom will bring hundreds of travelers to a destination on a regular basis fathom can achieve focused and holistic collaborative contributions in a broad region of the country – allowing fathom travelers to make a collective transformative impact that they know will extend far beyond their involvement they also will know they played an important role in ensuring the region flourishes we are excited about making the puerto plata region of the dominican republic our first partner destination and we are optimistic about taking all that is being built in and through fathom to other global destinations and to the broader carnival corporate family according to russell the fathom team took an innovative designthinking approach to deeply understanding both its travelers as well as the needs identified by stakeholders across all parts of society in the dominican republic and will continue to leverage the unique approach  fathom will mobilize educate and equip up to  travelers on every trip allowing for thousands of impact activity days per week – and tens of thousands of travelers a year to communities of promise providing unprecedented scale for impact said russell fathom has been built differently having worked carefully to ensure any and all efforts fathom travelers engage with are authentically impactful scalable and sustainable fathoms scale allows the opportunity to continuously innovate in the social impact space while achieving holistic transformational societal contributions that will help a broad region flourish based on extensive market research fathom has identified a sizable and growing market of potential social impact travel consumers – approximately one million north americans who are strongly predisposed in addition to global travelers already pursuing serviceoriented travel experiences worldwide – who will be interested in this type of travel offering in addition the company believes fathom will attract a significant number of travelers who have never before cruised according to research nearly  percent of the individuals who will book a social impact trip on fathom might otherwise never have chosen to cruise according to russell fathom will attract people of all ages and from all walks of life but especially north american uk and australian citizens ages  to  years old who are eager to discover their individual gifts and unleash their personal passions and talents to improve the world the company expects to be particularly popular among millennials – people in their s and s looking to make a difference in the world parents seeking a way to open their childrens eyes to other parts of the world in a meaningful way approximately half of travelers are expected to be families and adults  years of age eager to find rewarding ways to help other people apart from writing a check during the past  years in countless conversations i have had with people eager to serve others and make meaningful societal contributions there has been a common theme – people struggle to know where they fit in and often people have challenges finding trusted easy ways to make a difference said russell fathom exists to address this desire and to create enduring lifechanging impact both in the communities where fathom operates and in the lives of the travelers who embark on one of our journeys allowing for unique impact experiences before during and after the trip dominican republic identified as fathoms first social impact partner destination the new brand selected the puerto plata region of the dominican republic as its first impact destination based on a number of factors genuine needs infrastructure to support social initiatives enthusiasm for the fathom concept by locals at all layers of society including country officials its location proximity to miami and amber cove the new dominican destination being launched by carnival corporation in october  its innate beauty the fathom team worked closely with local dominicans resident dominican business and educational leaders dominican government officials and leading nongovernmental organizations ngos in the country to fully understand the societal needs and determine the best way for fathom to participate in addressing those needs fathom has initially identified two lead impact partners in the dominican republic – entrena and the instituto dominicano de desarrollo integral inc iddi both organizations have deep roots in the country including longestablished programs and strong social connections in the northern dominican region fathom travelers will work alongside these organizations across the northern region to help entrena and iddi programs achieve much greater impact because fathom will regularly transport hundreds of travelers to the country the support will be significant and sustainable – fathom travelers will make longlasting contributions to the community a portion of every ticket purchase price will go directly to fathom partner organizations to cover ontheground activities in the dominican republic including supplies travel personnel to assist with the activities and funding to support the partner organizations overall missions this sustained partnership between fathom and its impact partners allows these organizations to have predictable revenue streams to even further amplify their missions   having led the dominican based nonprofit iddi for more than  years i have worked with a very large number of corporations ranging from energy sugar chocolate and cigar producers as well as tourism and freetrade zone companies said david luther founder and executive director of iddi a nonprofit organization with the mission to help alleviate poverty in rural and urban areas of the dominican republic i have always insisted on a horizontal relationship based on a winwin partnership but on many occasions it has taken a great deal of convincing on our part for these to understand the benefits to the private sector of improving the overall wellbeing of dominican society fathom and carnival corporation are without a doubt the exception they are making a strategic bet on contributing to the development of the dominican republic incorporating this initiative into their business plan which is to me a remarkable step for a corporation of their size this is not just corporate social responsibility but a vision of bringing people together as a catalyst for change be they passengers on a ship or members of lowincome communities – very very innovative in this fathom and carnival corporation are demonstrating they are willing and capable of creating experiences that transform lives entrena is excited about and committed to the fathom concept of impact travel for the north coast of the dominican republic said john seibel founder and president entrena an organization specializing in training education and social enterprise we believe this concept will enhance sustainable development efforts to foster widespread prosperity among these dominican communities by improving lives creating hope for the future and providing profound and meaningful experiences for fathom and for all carnival corporation passengers fathom experience focuses on education environment and economic development the fathom journey is a carefully designed holistic impact journey and will begin with one to two days at sea preparing hearts and minds for the ontheground experience including a wide variety of fun and engaging impactreadiness experiences ranging from an orientation to the dominican republic conversational spanish lessons impact activity training creative workshops personal enrichment and much more fathom travelers may build their own schedules and will have the flexibility each day to choose from a variety of social impact and recreational activities at launch the company will offer a selection of fun immersive and meaningful activities focused on education the environment and economic development along with all the incredible experiences the puerto plata region innately has to offer impact activities will vary in length from a few hours to multiple days depending on their passions and skills travelers may spend up to three days on causes they care about working alongside locals and fathom partner organizations on one or more projects suitable for a wide range of ages levels of skill and amounts of physical activity sample activities may include economic development  help cultivate cacao plants and organic fertilizer at a nursery and assist a local womens cooperative in producing artisan chocolates this activity is designed to produce highquality plants to increase farmers yields through sustainable practices and – importantly – create income opportunities for rural women  over time this activity will allow the cooperative to increase their workforce so the cooperative can achieve economic independence    educational  work side by side with dominican school teachers in classrooms to teach english skills and help boost students academic performance and participate in adultlearning programs to teach small groups of local community members conversational english to help improve their ability to qualify for jobs that provide a higher level of income environmental  provide handson support to craft and build water filters – using clay a natural resource found locally – and deliver those filters to families throughout the community to provide healthy drinking water with limited piped water supply this will make a meaningful difference in the quality of peoples lives throughout the region together we aim to help communities and travelers flourish by providing immersive lifechanging experiences for travelers and allowing our partner communities to prosper said russell when not participating in social impact activities travelers will enjoy exploring the beauty of the region experiencing the many dominican beaches and sites of interest or participating in any one of an array of different recreational activities available to the entire family of carnival corporation brands visiting amber cove and the puerto plata region the onboard experience will be customized to this unique travel market including specialized purposeful retail options and amenities as well as geographically inspired menus music and additional onboard cultural immersion while docked in the dominican republic the fathom ship will serve as a comfortable convenient homebase for travelers travelers may reserve travel on future fathom voyages travelers may reserve a spot on future fathom sailings by calling any travel agent or visiting wwwfathomorg or by calling fathom prices for the

cabins with a window exterior balcony cabins and suites additional recreational activities cabin upgrades and dining and beverage packages will be priced separately travelers may begin tailoring their trip in fall  eg impact activities selection cabin selections etc the future of social impact in carnival corporation in addition to leading the new fathom brand russell will work with carnival corporations nine other brands in her role as global impact lead on social impact strategies and opportunities with fathom we are building oneofakind collaborative community social impact models and experiences and a solid network of reputable local and global ngo partnerships that once established can be considered for replication across global regions and company brands said russell as fathom grows and evolves we will continue exploring additional fathom destinations and experiences and identify powerful brand partnerships we can establish both within the carnival corporate family and also more broadly outside the corporation with other likeminded impact brands in addition we will evaluate these unique fathom assets to determine which models can be scaled across other carnival brands as
