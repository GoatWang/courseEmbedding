transparency outofoffice coke executive moonlights as young adult novelist by jay moye  dec   share monica mcgurk’s grandfather – a theatrical frenchcanadian who was rarely without a joke story or song – helped her find her voice as a young writer decades later a “mini midlife crisis” helped her get it back storytelling is in mcgurk’s blood she started writing short stories and poetry when she was  years old and has surrounded herself with books all her life she even wrote a screenplay while working as an analyst early in her business career “it’s lost to the winds and sands of time” the vp of strategy and ecommerce at cocacola north america says laughing “probably saved on a floppy disk somewhere in our basement” mcgurk drifted away from writing as the demands of career and family took over but never strayed too far from her passion the mother of three started crafting elaborate bedtime stories that unfurl over many months and keep her kids clinging from one nightly cliffhanger to the next then in  a friend’s sudden death steered her back to writing “we weren’t super close” she says “but his death really shook me because we’d led parallel lives up until that point” monica mcgurk they were business school classmates and had been elected partner at mckinsey  co at the same time he even married the roommate of mcgurk’s best friend from college “it made me stop and think whether i was really doing what i wanted to and making the most of my life” she adds “i realized i was allin at work and as a mom and a wife but that i’d lost any space to do anything for myself” mcgurk decided to tap back into a creative outlet she could easily fit into her busy schedule mcgurk began writing on planes during her frequent business travels and at night after her kids went to bed she started reading young adult ya books to screen ageappropriate titles for her kids but quickly connected with the subject matter “many of these books address growing up and forming and exploring your own identity – rich themes that are easy to relate to whether you’re into high literature or pop culture” she explains “that’s why the genre appeals to a lot of adult women” around that time “fan fiction”– where amateur writers try their hand at prequels and alternate endings of their favorite novels and post them online for others to read and critique – had taken off following the success of the harry potter books the format provided a fun seamless way to ease back into the creative process using the pen name “consultant by day” she wrote an alt ending to the twilight series before breaking dawn was released posting sequential passages online to be critiqued by fellow fans “with fan faction you waive all rights to your work but have the opportunity to unleash your imagination on storylines and characters you’re fascinated with” mcgurk explains “it’s great for someone like me who thrives on feedback because you get immediate input the process is really helpful and it’s gratifying to know people are reading and engaged enough in your writing to respond” her novellength take on the twilight finale titled morning star was a hit with fans and even won the  twific fandom “undiscovered gem” award motivated by this recognition and encouraged by her husband mcgurk challenged herself to up the ante and try her hand at original fiction a lifelong advocate for women’s issues she began sketching out ideas for a novel centered around a kidnapping during the research process she became engrossed in the complex issue of human trafficking which hit close to home “i discovered statistics and facts about human trafficking – and disturbingly the child sex trade – around the world and specifically here in atlanta” she says “it’s hard to imagine this is going on right under our noses and happening to children in our own communities on one hand our connected world makes it easy to talk about it share news and rally to fight the problem but technology can also depersonalize the issue and make people feel removed from it” mcgurk describes the story as actionoriented and interspersed with current events but with romantic and mythological elements she gutchecked first drafts with her yearold daughter “i used her as my guinea pig because i wanted to make sure the book was appealing without overstepping the boundaries of scariness” mcgurk explains “and i thought my yearold son would consider it too ‘girly’ but it was fascinating to see how positively he responded we had very interesting conversations because his awareness of human trafficking and child abuse was heightened by reading the book” after selfpublishing the story as a twopart series on amazoncom in  mcgurk signed with an austin texasbased publisher –the greenleaf book group – in october  she worked with an editor via skype and email to combine the books into a single novel and enhance the plot with new chapters dark hope was released in august and mcgurk is almost done with a followup she plans to complete a trilogy with a third installmentmcgurk hopes readers will relate to hope carmichael the book’s strong female lead and be inspired to get involved  “many young adult books lean on the same plot devices – love triangles and young women who need rescuing” she explains “i wanted to have a female character who makes things happen through her own choices for better or for worse” she hopes her trilogy will leverage pop culture to heighten activism to end child sex trafficking a portion of proceeds from the sale of dark hope will go to nonprofits fighting local and global traffickingjoin the fight against child sex trafficking – or just delve into a fun fastpaced read – by purchasing or gifting dark hope today available for purchase online at amazoncom and

menu monica mcgurk dread and depression posted on march   by monica mcgurk dread it is one of the prevailing feelings suffusing dark before dawn  dread and depression are driving forces within dark rising and oh how hard it is to write of these things what is dread the thesaurus lists out varying alternative terms anxiety apprehension distress fright horror nervousness strain stress tension unease none really seem to capture the paralyzing sense of knowing what is happening of seeing what will happen — of all the pieces of a puzzle fitting together finally each one contributing to an inevitable outcome — and feeling powerless to stop it it is numbness it is acquiescence it is the weight upon your chest so heavy you cannot be sure whether you can draw that next breath it is to walk on a spring day but see only black and white the colors of the world sapped from existence it is anticipation so acute that it threatens to grinds one’s thought processes to a halt forcing one to move in a world of instinct  the fear is safely ensconced in bubble wrap the sounds of it muffled  one puts one foot in front of the other focusing on the immediacy of survival shutting out the doom that looms and lurks around the corner the fear may be founded or it may be a nameless faceless general anxiety but either way one sweats it through one’s pores it is your shadow walking with you unshakeable dread is real i write these words and i remember having these feelings myself i think of my friends and family who have — or who are dealing even now with depression in all its various and insidious forms and i think i see you i feel you dread and its twin depression are all around us this feeling of stone after stone stacked upon one’s breastbone — it is part of the human condition we don’t need a book to tell us that this is so but perhaps by acknowledging it we can pop the bubble of silence and let one another know we are not alone and we can remind ourselves that the stones will tumble after all and we will breathe one day the feeling will pass and we will walk in sunshine again seeing the technicolor and feeling the warmth of the beams as they hit our face why dread  depression matter especially in ya lit since i first drafted these words even more people in my circle of intimates have been touched by depression  most touching to me informing my writing is the prevalence of depression among teens in the us  i used to rail against the frequent dystopian and selfdestructive themes in young adult literature  but now i understand it differently  through the work of prophets crying in the wilderness — prophets such as my friend julie lythcotthaims — who point to the overwhelming pressure  and isolation facing some of our children — i see it more as an acknowledgment of the search for meaning and control in a world that seems out of control  i see it as an expression of the desperation that many of our young people feel but also an expression of the will to overcome to triumph  the will to live despite it all — to live another day and to feel the sun on our flesh after all guns  the gordian knot posted on december   by monica mcgurk guns  a few weeks ago i was sitting in a meeting when i received a text from my son mom there’s something wrong you are going to get an email from the school we established it was nothing to do with him but something was seriously amiss – something rumored something that scared him but that he had been told not to share after an interminable three hours i finally convinced my son to tell me himself what was wrong that morning someone had scrawled a threat in sharpie marker across a bathroom mirror in the high school – a warning that they planned to come in the next day with guns intent on a rampage targeting students when the email message from the administration finally arrived it promised us terrified parents that they had established there was no real threat and that school was on as usual the next day how they knew this they would not say needless to say most of us kept our children home the next day nothing happened the administration briefly threatened to charge each child with an unexcused absence until the howls of protest convinced them they were on a fool’s errand and we were left wondering like countless other people all over this country how this threat had insinuated itself into our comfortable lives how to keep our children safe  how things could go so wrong so quickly how do we square the circle of our right to bear arms with our need to live free of terror how should we think about guns  the gordian knot with which they present us in the spirit of transparency i acknowledge i write as someone who grew up in a family of hunters  we own guns now  but i hope i am writing as someone with a balanced point of view on this matter you can be the judge of that and hold me accountable  i know if nothing else this topic stimulates a lot of conversation and that my readers have very strong reasoned opinions themselves so i know i won’t have to ask twice the context our constitution did not enshrine access to weapons for recreational purposes it promised it for one reason – to ensure that in the event a corrupt government sought to oppress its own people we could fight back it is a promise made in a revolutionary era the promise made by people who had fought against overwhelming odds to overthrow such a government it was a brutal time where human life was perhaps not held as dearly as we hold it today in colonial times punishments were severe — brandings whippings banishments and death — focused on public shame and retribution more than humane treatment   the misuse of weapons was probably taken as a given in a brash emerging nation that was mostly untamed frontier and indeed  the first murder by gun  recorded — indeed the first murder punished by death in colonies — occurred in  when mayflower passenger john billington gunned down someone with whom he had held a longstanding quarrel while that may seem like a distant past to us one only need look around the world to see many sad cases of people terrorized by their own governments or quasigovernmental organizations whom could arguably have been better off if they had been able to fight to defend themselves despite all of  our freedoms what is happening around the world should give us pause and remind us we cannot take  those freedoms for granted that said those who enshrined that individual right never imagined the type of weaponry we have today they never conceived of machine guns and hand guns of a scope that could sight and target its prey from hundreds of yards away nor a chamber that could fire    and even more rpms the fact that governmental armed forces have access to these same high power weapons must be given some thought if the original purpose of the second amendment — protecting our ability to fight back against government oppression — remains relevant our right to bear arms does not preclude regulation indeed while a subject of debate some suggest the wording of the second amendment includes this explicitly and we do have a fair amount of it – from background checks to waiting periods to restrictions on types of weaponry but our regulation is failing to protect people from violence  whether it is due to loopholes poor enforcement or the natural tendency of bad people to evade the intent of good laws people are dying from gun violence  as defined and reported by mother jones over three decades there have been over  “mass shootings” in the us  in these cases over ths of the weapons used were obtained legally and about rd of them involved high capacity magazines and assault weapons and so people are dying not as many as in the past though in fact pew research center data as reported by washington post shows we are on the downside of a nearly two decade  decline in gun homicides per capita and an even steeper decline in the rate of injuries attributable to gun attacks  some would argue this coincides with an increase in gun ownership instead of the causes pointed to by pew  at the end of the day it is still too many and the mass attacks — now linked to terrorism though certainly not exclusively — are becoming too visible and frequent to bear something has to change when my teacher friends receive instruction on what to do in the event of an armed intrusion something has to change when my facebook feed includes an advertisement for bulletproof blankets to send into school with my kids something has to change do we arm everyone to the teeth do we throw our vast resources to better enforce the rules and regulations we already have in place do we try to address the root causes of this violence to begin with — the disaffection and economic marginalization of whole segments of our population or the hatred of radicalized populations who despise our very way of life  do we renew our efforts to bring down organized crime — the vast network of shadowy illicit arms trafficking that enables some of these horrible massacres bringing down with it at the same time the drug trade and sex trafficking that together act as the horsemen of the apocalypse bringing violence and despair everywhere they flourish  or do we keep trying to force new laws — poorly enforced though they  may be — even if doing so may fly in the face of our constitution  the fact is we do not actually know what to do — in part oddly enough due to lack of research funds available to study the root causes and prevention of gun violence it seems too complicated too futile to even try  but perhaps we can cut through the gordian knot with an act of supreme courage and commitment the courage to change the constitution yes the nra is a powerful lobby  but we have the greatest power available to us as a citizenry  we have the power to change the constitution  it has been done before — slavery prohibition voting rights — in times of need and great social change we have stood up as a people and led our nation to a dramatic shift in our constitutional framework to reflect our changing needs mores and times it is as simple and as profound as that those who wring their hands and say we cannot hope to win against the power of the nra are making excuses  if there is a groundswell of public support for this action there are certainly enough stakeholders and enough money to throw into a counter campaign to revoke the second amendment  take this issue to the people use the mechanisms we have to make the change  is is so simple i am surprised that we are not already talking about it that there is not already an internet petition and a changeorg campaign coupled by pledges from george soros and michael bloomberg to get this done  instead we are letting the issue get muddled in the debate over refugees the real issue lost in the faux debates that pass for critical thinking in the presidential debates yes it is harder than passing a new bill  yes it will force us to engage everyone in the conversation including the people dismissed as backwards the people from socalled “flyover states” the people who as the american president once said “love their guns”  why should it be otherwise  despite all the fear mongering that surrounds us logic and civil discourse can still hold sway in this country  the sweeping changes we have witnessed with respect to marriage law stand as testament to that doing anything less shows lack of vision  lack of faith let’s cut through the knot  together and if we can’t — if we cannot get the votes to revoke the second amendment — then let’s work together to find other better solutions that can exist in tandem with the constitution as it stands  for better or worse this document is ours — our sacred blueprint for individual rights  if we don’t treasure it every little bit of it even the inconvenient and exasperating parts nobody else will   full disclosure i gave up looking through all the listings on changeorg after several pages in i’d found only petitions in favor of preserving the second amendment…along with many other interesting appeals so it may be out there an interview from the antitrafficking frontlines posted on december   by monica mcgurk diana mao cofounder of nomi network nomi artisans at work totes with the “buy her bag not her body” label                           i am regularly lucky enough to encounter people who share my passion to prevent and end human trafficking i take such inspiration with them and want to share that inspiration with you so today i am bringing you an interview from the antitrafficking frontlines as i introduce you to nomi network and one of its incredible founders diana mao here is what she had to say about her work her passion and how we can help many of the themes — the role of poverty entrepreneurialism even the link to fashion — really resonated with me i hope you find the work of nomi network to be amazing and if you can share your support  q can you tell us a little bit about your organization and work a since  nomi network has been providing direct training to survivors and women at risk of human trafficking as well as capacity building and market access programs we specifically leverage the fashion industry to implement product design development and marketing strategies for slavefree products with our signature label “buy her bag not her body ®” we aim to raise awareness about this global humanitarian issue currently we are working in india and cambodia q how did you first learn about human trafficking and what drew you into your activism on this issue a  at the age of  i was a graduate student at nyu learning about issues such as poverty human trafficking and other pressing global issues stats being thrown around were truly meaningless to me until i witnessed the horrors of sex trafficking in cambodia first hand while conducting research for a microfinance bank  the research brought me to some of the poorest and most remote villages in cambodia it was there i met a single father with  children he offered his youngest daughter no more than  to one of my male colleagues as i looked into the father’s eyes i could tell that he was desperate and did not really want to give her up in cambodia some children are sold for brutal sex and others are chained to a sewing machine in a sweatshop this encounter left a lasting impression on me it is clear poverty is a breeding ground for traffickers to prey on young girls after coming back i was determined to do something and in  i cofounded nomi network q  what role does entrepreneurialism play in your efforts entrepreneurship plays a key role in our efforts and really is the spirit of our operations nomi network aims to build entrepreneur capacity in all of the women we work with and encourage them to take the skills they have learned and do more for example some of our women in india have become the first women tailors in their villages they have begun to produce petticoats on their own using the skills they gained at nomi network we were excited to hear that they are the most sought after producers because of their quality and customer service q from your experience what does it take to be a successful entrepreneurartisan it takes commitment and drive to change the circumstances you find yourself in many of our women live in poverty and have little to no education but with newfound skills they strive to take every opportunity they get we are now seeing these women making a better future for their children by sending them to school and by not marrying their daughters off at a young age q  how do you see trafficking affecting young people human trafficking doesn’t discriminate against age it knows no boundary lines and it can happen to anyone young people are targeted by traffickers and in demand especially for buyers of sex in the united states i’ve seen reports of young people being targeted through social media by traffickers and it’s the vulnerable kids coming from unstable households that fall victim the most hearing from survivors i’ve also learned about how abuse started young almost grooming them to become easy targets for trafficking it’s so important for young people to be educated about modern day slavery and to be made aware of the signs of trafficking q what single experience you have had in the field most profoundly affected your view of our ability to end slavery andor why that is important my life totally changed in  when i met a young  yearold survivor of sex trafficking by the name of nomi when i first got to the shelter with alissa moore nomi’s cofounder to our surprise a young girl ran to us and threw her arms around me she said “hello my name is nomi sister what is yours” as i walked through the shelter with the director i tried very hard to hold back the tears as he shared nomi’s story nomi was not only sexually exploited in her village by her stepfather but she was treated like an animal and literally locked up when she arrived at the shelter she was nonverbal did not have any grooming habits and did not know how to use the restroom she drooled all the time and was violent nomi is just one girl but after hearing her story i knew that if it was only for her sake i had to do something q what do you wish teens and young adults in the united states knew about human trafficking and modern slavery i believe that teens and young adults should not be sheltered from the truth that human trafficking is a  billion industry with  million slaves around the world it’s important for them to be aware of the impact they can make to either support or deter modern day slavery considering  of all raw materials such as cocoa coffee and cotton are produced by forced or child labor we need to be more aware of how our purchases affect those producing what we consume q if a teen wanted to get involved in the fight to end human trafficking what  or  things would you point them toward the first change you can make towards ending human trafficking is buying fair trade as much as you can for the holidays buy fair trade gifts for friends and family when you go to buy that latte make sure it’s made with fair trade espresso anna lappe said ‘every time you spend money you’re casting a vote for the kind of world you want’ another way to get involved is to learn more about the issue and raise awareness read articles that help you identify the red flags of human trafficking and keep and eye out in your own community q how can readers support nomi network buy her products and donate to help us provide more training and job opportunities get all your holiday gifts by shopping at

posted on november   by monica mcgurk syrian refugee jordan   i have found this week following the attacks of paris troubling i read the news accounts the facebook postings the play by plays dissected by pundits and i feel the whole debate has become strangely abstracted i want — no expect — our discussion of both the victims of the attacks and the vulnerable refugees whose future hangs on our collective decision to be grave and soulful conducted in hushed tones of respect instead it has become strident a political football i am disappointed angry fearful but i choose to be bigger than fear isis’s escalating violence or that of extreme islam in general seems too close it has taken the life of a colleague’s sister another friend has had to explain to his young children the murder of their favorite camp counselor in a terrorist attack it screamed from the headlines when i landed in australia earlier this year jolting me out of my jetlagged stupor another near miss it has swept through my uncle’s home country of lebanon and hangs a notsoshadowy threat over the lovely places in turkey in which i set my second book i counted gratefully as if marking the beads of a rosary as my friends and colleagues in paris let us know one by one that they were safe last week  even today as i face a flight back to atlanta the anonymous collective warns of a credible threat in my own hometown and my heart constricts i wonder if i should change my flight if there is any way to avoid this violence at all i cannot breathe from the fear and yet i know rationally i must be bigger than my fear we all must be we face less risk than many our geography some solace still in this global age the people whom we are reluctant to shelter in our nation are fleeing the very same horrors we fear to unwittingly unleash inside our borders isn’t the risk that one of them embraces terrorism as their only legitimate means of being heard greater if we turn them away in their hour of greatest need the vast majority of these refugees are children children like the innocent whose body drifted in the tide onto the beaches of turkey drowned capturing the world’s attention for a nanosecond just a few months ago how can these children who have known nothing but desperation and want threaten us if we open our nation and our generosity to them a society is judged based on how it treats the most vulnerable in its midst will we reject these helpless people because we doubt our own ability to sift through them to find the warriors of hate who may be in their midst we whose entire jurisprudence is based upon the idea that one is innocent until proven guilty getting caught up in a debate over who has the constitutional right to do what is missing the bigger point we are a nation of the people our elected officials are supposed to represent our views and interests so the question is what kind of a nation do we want to be a nation of fear running away from the very core of our identity as a global beacon of refuge and opportunity or the nation envisaged by our founding fathers the nation of freedom and hope celebrated every time our proud flag unfurls the nation whose statue of liberty has welcomed countless to its shores we can’t have it both ways i choose hope when did female ambition get such a bad rap posted on november   by monica mcgurk icarus falling last week i did something i have never done before somebody asked me what my career aspirations are and instead of my usual noncommittal dithering…”oh i don’t really have a goal i just want to keep learning and having fun…” i took a deep breath and then answered directly and to the point “i want to run a major pl and be a ceo” this was the first time i actually said those words out loud then the next day i turned around and did it again with apologies to the us president it felt audacious it was liberating and it made me wonder when did ambition get to be a dirty word  and when did female ambition get such a bad rap i am wondering this particularly today when my colleague wendy clark has announced her departure from cocacola to become of all things president and ceo of ddb north america for a really long time i have felt ambivalence about my own ambition aspiration seemed haughty  confidence seemed arrogant  and if i am truthful the hours weighty responsibilities and accountability appeared daunting  alphabet ceo ruth porat’s recipe of blending — not “balancing” — seemed unattainable  i kept disavowing my own ambition  and yet  for some reason it keeps creeping up on me to be female and say this out loud seems somehow wrong  why is that  do we still think that being ambitious is somehow selfish taking away from our responsibilities to our children putting ourselves above those customers consumers and colleagues we serve  do we think that setting high goals and standards for ourselves is somehow presumptuous  do we think like icarus we will fall dictionary definitions don’t seem all that bad as evidenced below  in fact i like them quite a bit  i choose to embrace zeal commitment purpose and most importantly dream  wendy was — is — all that and her example proves that ambition in a woman is not bad  it is something to be celebrated  congratulations wendy  we will miss you am·bi·tion amˈbishən noun a strong desire to do or to achieve something typically requiring determination
