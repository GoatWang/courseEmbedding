credit opinion axis capital holdings limited semiannual update credit opinion axis capital holdings limited semiannual update credit opinion axis capital holdings limited company profile axis capital holdings limited key facts and statistics   rating action moodys affirms axiss ratings following novae acquisition announcement outlook stable global credit research   jul  new york july    moodys investors service has affirmed the ratings of axis capital holdings limited nyse axs baahyb preferred stock and its subsidiaries including the guaranteed senior debt of its finance subsidiaries baa senior and the insurance financial strength of its operating subsidiaries a financial strength see complete ratings list below following the companys announcement that it has entered into an agreement to acquire novae group plc lse nva novae  not rated and its associated lloyds syndicates for  million in cash the rating outlook for axis is stable axis has agreed to acquire novae for gbp  per novae common share and the purchase price represents an approximately  premium to novaes closing price on  july  the consideration will consist of cash although axis has indicated that the company may consider partial debt financing if conditions are favorable the transaction is expected to close in q  subject to regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions ratings rationale in affirming axis ratings moodys said that the proposed acquisition of novae has strategic benefits for axis as it would significantly expand axis lloyds presence making axis a top  lloyds insurer novae has a good presence in specialty lines of business including marine hull and liability energy and cyber liability the acquisition will also incrementally boost axis profitability however moodys views the transaction overall as credit negative given expected increases in operational leverage coupled with higher catastrophe risk although we expect axis to reduce catastrophe exposure over time the acquisition also carries integration and execution risks and incrementally increases axiss goodwill and intangibles in addition margins in specialty insurance and catastrophe reinsurance and the lloyds market more broadly are expected to remain under pressure given heightened competition according to moodys axis ratings are based on the companys select underwriting strengths in a diversified mix of specialty insurance and reinsurance businesses historically solid operating returns the companys solid reserve position and high quality fixed income portfolio these strengths are tempered by cyclical and structural factors in the reinsurance market which have reduced axis excatastrophe returns exposure to specialty lines of business which inherently carry more risk compared to conventional insurance lines focus on professional liability and other casualty lines of business heightens vulnerability to reserve volatility and changes in the legal environment meaningful catastrophe exposure including terrorism risk and high dependence on three insurance brokers which exposes the company to distribution risks due to structural challenges in a highly competitive reinsurance sector an upgrade for axis is unlikely in the next  months the following factors could lead to a downgrade of axis ratings  long term ability to earn cost of capital is compromised  ebit coverage of fixed charges falls below x in consecutive years reflecting actual rather than normalized cat losses  debttocapital ratio consistently above  including  of preferred shares treated as debt  reduction in total shareholders equity by more than  over a rolling twelve month period due to share buybacks losses or any other reason or  unexpectedly large losses in proofofconcept or noncore
