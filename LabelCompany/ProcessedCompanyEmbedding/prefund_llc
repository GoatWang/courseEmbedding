reserve less a fee will then be returned upon receipt of payments from the thirdparty payer “ecg prefund was exactly what my company needed” said tim james from james foods  “we received several larger than normal orders thus causing us to require additional raw materials chicken and dough and were able to sell a few of our outstanding invoices to ecg and within a day we had all the cash we needed” founded in july  ecg’s mission is to help american business owners succeed by providing extremely convenient capital ecg has grown quickly by helping established small businesses get the
