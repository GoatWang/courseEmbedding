topped  in may the latest milestone in whats become a parabolic move higher consider these figures in the past month bitcoin is up  yeartodate its up  over the past year its up  and over the past two years its up  but as incredible as those moves have been the performance of one bitcoin fund makes them look paltry by comparison that fund is the bitcoin investment trust gbtc which has more than tripled in the past month alone while rising an eyepopping  over the past two years year returns for bitcoin and gbtc   the market value of the trust ballooned to as much as  billion in may compared with  million at the beginning of the year dangerous premium to nav gbtc is an openended trust and the first publicly traded bitcoin investment vehicle the fund made its debut on the otc market in may  and since then has been doing its best to track the price of bitcoin―with limited success indeed even though gbtc is a selfproclaimed openended trust and its sponsor grayscale has periodically created new shares its acted more like a closedend fund with huge premiums the norm the share price of gbtc was last trading at double the value of its underlying bitcoin holdings at  gbtcs premium to its net asset value is astronomical by any measure and close to the highest level its ever been for investors buying into the fund such large premiums are a disaster waiting to happen premiums are a fickle thing and can fluctuate wildly depending on the supply and demand for shares for example gbtcs premium has ranged from zero to  with an average of  since may       not an etf for investors used to buying exchangetraded funds such large premiums are almost unheard of in an etf large premiums and discounts are arbitraged away through the creationredemption mechanism when a premium becomes large authorized participants will buy up the underlying deliver it to the etf provider in exchange for etf shares and sell them for a profit pushing the etf market price back towards the funds nav but gbtc isnt an etf  it doesnt abide by the stringent regulations and disclosure requirements of the investment company act of  and currently its only ap is genesis global trading an affiliated company that has only offered shares to investors in private placement transactions according to spencer bogart managing director and head of research for blockchain capital up until early this year share creations for gbtc took place through private transactions with accredited investors those new shares were subject to a oneyear lockup period before they could be sold on the public market hindering the ability to arbitrage any premium above nav   after jan  grayscale completely stopped issuing shares in connection with an sec filing it made more on that later which means that what little ability to arbitrage the premium away before is now completely gone   meanwhile redemptions for gbtc have been completely suspended since  after the trust and its ap were found to be in violation of an sec rule put that all together and you have a product that cant be considered an etf even by the loosest definition grantor trusts  act funds  act commodity pools and even etns are often lumped together under the etf umbrella they all hold securities with a fluid unrestricted creation and redemption mechanism that serves to keep the traded price close to the underlying fair value gbtc fails that test not to mention it doesnt trade on an actual exchange  only game in town … for now even with its flaws clearly theres been a lot of demand for gbtc currently the trust has a market value of nearly  billion and even counts two etfs among its holders the ark web x etf arkw and the ark industrial innovation etf arkq for investors who dont want to go through the hassle and risk of buying bitcoin directly from a digital currency exchange and storing it themselves gbtc is in many ways the only game in town but it doesnt have to be the winklevoss bitcoin trust etf coin was rejected by the sec in march the commission didnt allow the etf to see the light of day because it was concerned about the lack of regulation in bitcoin markets which could harm investors yet coin would be vastly superior to the readily available gbtc which is likely to burn investors who buy at premium prices gbtcs sponsor grayscale is well aware of the deficiencies of its product in january the firm made a filing with the sec to do an initial public offering on the nyse grayscale also lined up three aps to replace its affiliate genesis if the filing is approved in other words the sponsor hopes to convert gbtc into a fully fledged etf thats probably a smart move if coin or another bitcoin etf comes to market and competes with gbtc in its current form the latter will likely see an exodus of assets as investors gravitate toward the superior etf structure indeed in march when it looked like the sec could greenlight the winklevoss etf gbtcs premium briefly dropped to zero as demand for the product waned stark choice for sec currently the sec is reviewing its disapproval of coin theres no timetable for when the commission will reach a decision the sec is also considering the grayscale filing to ipo gbtc shares on the nyse that decision will be reached by sept  theres plenty of skepticism about whether the sec will turn around and finally approve a bona fide bitcoin etf after already rejecting two along with coin the sec rejected the solidx bitcoin trust xbtc but as the massive inflows into bitcoin in general and gbtc in particular indicate investors are going to buy up the digital currency regardless of what the commission does the sec can either help investors by allowing a regulated etf that trades close to nav come to market or stand in the way and see those same investors hurt when they buy bitcoin directly from untested exchanges or through the flawed gbtc at the time of writing the author did not hold any positions in the securities mentioned

miners etf gdxj which tracks the mvis global junior gold miners index since early  assets in the fund ballooned from a little more than  billion to  billion currently some of that was due to rising share prices―gdxj nearly doubled from  at the start of  to  today an  gain thanks to the rebound in gold but a lot of it had to do with the enormous amount of new money that came into the fund since jan   inflows into the etf have totaled  billion for almost any etf thats a big amount but especially for one that targets a relatively niche area like junior gold miners gdxj assets under management source bloomberg giant stakes in underlying holdingsthe etf has gotten so big that it now owns giant stakes in its underlying holdings threequarters of which are canadian companies according to an analysis by scotiabank there are  canadian companies that the etf owns where its ownership percentage is more than  for six of those companies the percentage would be even greater but presumably the fund doesnt want to exceed the  level which under canadian rules would force the etf to automatically extend a takeover offer to all remaining shareholders at the same terms according to a scotiabank report the etf has also struggled to abide by us irs diversification requirements gdxj has intermittently been in jeopardy of losing its preferential tax treatment as a regulated investment company since last september because its portfolio often doesn’t comply with the diversification requirements of the us internal revenue code noted scotiabank   etf deviating from indexin an attempt to try to ameliorate the concentration issues it’s facing the etf now has five holdings that arent index constituents representing  of gdxjs portfolio according to bmo capital markets one of those holdings is the vaneck vectors gold miners etf gdx another product from the same issuer which focuses on much larger gold companies chris kwan mining specialist at bmo believes gdxj has simply gotten too big for its benchmark now that it is a  billion etf attempting to invest in a b gold universe in kwans view there are three ways forward for the etf it could continue with the status quo creating uncertain and volatile quarterly rebalances it could sell its nonindex gold stocks and increase its position in gdx or it could expand the allowable marketcap size of the etf moving beyond junior gold miner territory in a way the etf has already de facto expanded the average size of its holdings the nonindex names that it owns have the biggest weightings in the fund that includes gdx which has a weighted average market cap of  billion―well beyond smallcap junior miner territory perhaps the easiest fix for vaneck which also develops the underlying index for gdxj is to expand what it considers to be the junior gold miner universe something the issuer did in  when faced with a similar situation why hasnt this happened already that may be because the portfolio managers are holding out hope that at some point they can go back to employing a full replication strategy as scotiabank points out if vaneck expands the universe too much the market cap for some of the holdings in the etf would breach  billion a level often used to define smallcap stocks thats not necessarily a horrible thing but it would take the etf further away from offering the junior gold miner exposure that it promises vaneck wouldnt comment on its portfolio management decisions for this story but said that it continues to manage gdxj so it meets its investment objective even though there may be times when certain market and regulatory factors affect the ability of gdxj to own certain securities or own them in proportion to their index weightings   jnug tail wagging the gdxj dog of course if asset growth for gdxj remains strong the issuer may have little choice but to broaden the scope of the etf whats interesting is that much of gdxjs recent and perhaps future growth has come from an unlikely source the direxion daily junior gold miners index bull x shares jnug analysts at scotiabank believe that most of the growth in gdxj was due to inflows into jnug which offers x leveraged exposure to the same underlying index as gdxj since early last year jnug has seen its assets rise from  million to more than  billion currently the analysts pointed out that according to the latest daily holdings report from jnug nearly  of gdxj’s shares outstanding could be held as hedges against swaps that underlie the x levered product thats an interesting twist in this saga if jnug is the tail that’s wagging the gdxj dog bottom line for investors the bottom line is that the holdings of their favorite junior gold miner etf have gotten a little bit bigger on the marketcap spectrum its not necessarily a huge deal but for those aggressive investors looking for targeted exposure to the smallest most volatile gold miners perhaps thats something that turns them off from the fund and compels them to look elsewhere on the other hand gdxj is by far the most liquid and tradable name in the junior gold miner space and a marginal increase in its weighted average market cap isnt going to noticeably change
