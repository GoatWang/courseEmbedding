the fastest service we have been packing the gafl as soon as they come in and sending them to the warehouse one pallet at a time  please check your freezer space before placing an order we do not want to charge people the extra restocking fee and we do not want to have to start charging people up front  please honor the commitment you make when you place the order with us if more than one person is going in on an order please make certain each persons commitment is firm yet another good reason for individual instead of combined orders           is the meat fresh or frozenall of the meat will be delivered to you frozen in  pound clear plastic bags our meats are packed in dry ice for the trip to assure their integrity do i need to bring my own coolers yes please have your coolers cold before you put the meat in them please put loose ice into the cooler as you leave home when you arrive at the stop empty the ice and put your cold meat into a cold cooler the meat coming out of the dry ice is  degrees even if you have the air conditioning on in your car your cooler may only be  degrees and this wont do the frozen meat any favors if you live only an hour or so from the stop you may want to just put the meat in sleeping bags and bundle it up how does the pick up work you will receive an email  days prior to the delivery giving the time at which to meet us and confirming the meeting point we must receive a response to this email by reply or phone call you order will not be loaded onto the truck unless we have a confirmation from you we will get your cell phone numbers at that time as well as provide you with ours it is critical that you are there by that delivery time waiting on us  unless otherwise indicated we will pull into the semi parking area  we try to have our drop offs go as quickly as possible this is why it is so important for you to be there early if even one person is late it slows down the process for the rest of the people the rest of the day and is so unfair due to the large volume the tampa stop is especially busy and chaotic it is much less so if everyone is there on time waiting for their bags please do not park blocking the back of the truck the unloading area so that everyone may have easy and fast access to the trailers deck if several people are coming for the same order please have only one vehicle park up close to the truck  we need to get the meat unloaded quickly into your coolers fast and the truck sealed back up asap the minute we remove the meat from the dry ice it has no refrigeration and we will start unloading just as soon as we arrive at the drop off locations we will not wait for everyone to get there first so if you arent there when the truck door opens your meat will set out until you do arrive  once there you will receive a sheet of paper with your name on it telling how many bags you are to receive and the bag numbers you are responsible for checking the name tags on each bag to make sure it is your bag and keeping track of the numbers once you have received all of your bags sign the bottom of the sheet and give it back to us and you are ready to leave where are the delivery stopsplease make sure you know where the stop is prior to the trip and be there waiting when we get there if you are unsure where your stop is please call us prior to the delivery date late customers affect everyone by slowing down every subsequent delivery be sure that we have your current cell phone numbers and we will call if there are any substantial delays on our end orders that are not picked up on time will be

bring extra meat on the gafl deliveriesa we do not carry any extra product only what has been orderedq why do i have to order so early for road tripsa there are many different factors that we must consider several weeks before each trip keep in mind that we are compiling thousands of pounds of products for these trips to provide you with the freshest products we must know far enough in advance to have the appropriate number of animals processed remember all of our beef is aged at least  days for the best flavor so the animals are taken weeks in advance of the trip  it also takes quite a
