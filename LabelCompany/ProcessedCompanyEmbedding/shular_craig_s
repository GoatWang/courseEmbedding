behind staid steel a percolating boardroom drama by david gelles january    am january    am photonathan milikowsky was ousted from the board of graftechcredit michael falco for the new york times updated  pm  when craig s shular the chief executive of a small steel company called graftech international retired on tuesday it looked like just another management changeover at a midmarket industrial company but behind the scenes a complex corporate governance battle was playing out pitting mr shular and a clubby board of directors against an outsider who joined the board as part of an acquisition three years ago and even though mr shular’s departure as chief executive was effective immediately the fight for control of the  billion company is not over yet the story of graftech replete with accusations of mismanagement and suspicions of leaked confidential information illustrates the complex dynamics when relations between directors and management turn sour it also highlights the increased sensitivity inside the boardroom in an era of activist investors and insider trading photocraig shular center at the new york stock exchange in  he retired from graftech international on tuesdaycredit alyssa ringlernyse euronext via associated press the complications that have ensnared graftech began in  when it acquired two companies controlled by nathan milikowsky a smalltime player in the big world of industrial steel graftech paid about  million for the carbide graphite group which made a crucial piece of equipment for steel manufacturing called a graphite electrode and seadrift coke which made the raw material needed to produce the electrodes for mr milikowsky the deal was a windfall in  he had bought the assets of carbide graphite out of bankruptcy for about  million and turned the company around in  he acquired seadrift coke allowing him to integrate an important supplier and ramp up revenue at both companies cashing out to graftech made mr milikowsky his investors and dozens of his employees wealthy and as part of the sale agreement mr milikowsky was guaranteed a seat on the graftech board as long as he and his associates held at least  million of the company’s shares less than three years later however mr milikowsky was pushed off the board — after management accused him of leaking material nonpublic information to a hedge fund — even though he still held  million shares mr milikowsky maintains he was not the source of any leaks and that management and other directors ousted him because he was criticizing them and mr shular as graftech’s share price plunged in recent weeks mr milikowsky was preparing to nominate a new slate of directors before the company’s annual meeting setting up a showdown between an entrepreneur who contends he was improperly ousted and a company that says it is simply protecting itself but mr shular’s abrupt resignation on tuesday threw mr milikowsky’s plans into disarray in stepping down mr shular said he made “the personal decision to retire from daytoday management in order to spend more time with my family” he will stay on through the year as executive chairman mr milikowsky’s camp however says it believes mr shular may have retired to avoid a public fight this month mr milikowsky signaled he was on the verge of taking his nominees to graftech’s shareholders whether mr milikowsky proceeds with his plan to nominate new directors remains to be seen on wednesday he applauded the resignation of mr shular and called the promotion of joel l hawthorne to chief executive “a good first step in the fundamental turnaround that is necessary to save the company and increase shareholder value” but mr milikowsky maintains that he deserves to be a director and he vowed to continue to fight for a seat on the board neither side expected the dispute when mr milikowsky joined the graftech board in  he was respected in the steel industry and initially on good terms with mr shular and his fellow directors after mr milikowsky spent a year on the board however his opinion of management and his fellow board members plunged he thought the company was underperforming spending too much on overhead and making poor strategic choices “this has been my only public company experience and i was amazed” he said in a recent interview “the ceo knew something about graphite electrodes but the rest of the directors don’t know anything about the business” some of his discontent can be chalked up to an entrepreneur’s discomfort with outsiders managing a business he built and graftech did underperform its peers but the last few years were going to be rough for graftech regardless of management choices as demand for its products waned in the wake of the financial crisis since mr milikowsky joined the board graftech shares have fallen  percent “i wouldn’t say it’s primarily on management why they’ve had poor performance” said michael gambardella a jpmorgan chase analyst who covers graftech “it’s the market” nonetheless mr milikowsky said the company should have been doing better “by late  i had come to a distressing preliminary conclusion things aren’t as rosy as people say they are” he said “we’re turning down orders that we should be taking so we’re losing market share the inventory is ballooning” in early  mr milikowsky began meeting with other directors to make his case at least one was openly supportive he said and another was sympathetic to his concerns but wary of confronting management without a majority of board members aligned yet before mr milikowsky’s campaign could gain traction inquiries from a hedge fund samlyn capital put the company on edge the hedge fund which had been a passive investor in graftech for years began asking pointed questions in may  about the company’s operations correspondence reviewed by the new york times indicated that management and other directors believed that samlyn appeared to have confidential information about the company including details that were known only by a small circle of insiders including the board graftech management was worried that there could be insider trading in the stock or that samlyn could be using the information to make its case for change and to mr shular and some members of the board samlyn’s criticisms of the company sounded uncannily like those presented by mr milikowsky the correspondence did not cite any specific examples of graftech insiders giving the hedge fund information samlyn which no longer holds any graftech stock has not been accused of any wrongdoing samlyn declined to comment undaunted mr milikowsky pressed to replace mr shular in a letter addressed to graftech’s lead director mary b cranston a retired chairman of the big law firm pillsbury winthrop shaw pittman who is also a director at visa but by late  ms cranston and others inside the company had become convinced that mr milikowsky was the source of the leaks samlyn had contacted mr milikowsky’s brother daniel who is also a graftech shareholder and despite mr milikowsky’s denials he was pinned as the culprit graftech contends it referred the matter to the securities and exchange commission meanwhile it granted mr shular whistleblower status protecting him from any related litigation the sec appears never to have pursued the matter “they dreamed up this whistleblower nonsense as a total sham excuse to protect shular and they dreamed up this leak as an excuse to force me off the board” mr milikowsky said at last year’s annual meeting mr milikowsky was not nominated for reelection and was subsequently removed from the board since then he has been working with law firms to make his case to the company that he was improperly ousted stephen fraidin a top lawyer at kirkland  ellis took on his cause last year adding legal firepower to the dispute but graftech has not budged so far in letters to mr milikowsky’s lawyers graftech contends that mr milikowsky violated the company’s corporate governance guidelines and did not return confidential information after his board service ended the company declined to answer questions about mr milikowsky or the board after nearly a year away from the company mr milikowsky concedes he may never return to the board and expressed disillusionment about his experience as a director “it really gets to the heart of american capitalism” he said “you have this amazing business and then you have management playing these games if all public companies are like this that is horrifying to me” whats next

 privacy statement  craig shular helped graftech international take hard steps toward growth  smart business magazine smart business magazine linkedin facebook twitter google youtube rss search for cleveland craig shular helped graftech international take hard steps toward growth by mark scott  am edt may   craig shular chairman president and ceo graftech international ltd craig shular is an upbeat guy but even he accepts that things had gotten pretty ugly at graftech international ltd in the early s debt had surged to more than  billion despite net sales in the million range shareholders couldn’t flee the publicly owned company fast enough “most people had written us off” says shular chairman president and ceo at the manufacturer of carbon and graphite products “the banks had frozen all our facilities suppliers were making us pay cash on delivery it was that kind of environment” big problems often require big cutbacks and this situation was no different the company ended up going from  graphite electrode plants to five and reduced its employee count from  to about  benefit programs had to be completely redone “brutal” says shular when asked to describe the steps that had to be taken at the company’s low point “a very tough process” the challenge for shular was that in the midst of all this turmoil he had to find a way to get the employees who remained at graftech to buy into his plan to get the company back on its feet he had a vision he hoped reflected an optimistic view of the company’s future but he had no way of really knowing if it could be fulfilled it was something to work toward and so it was up to him to take that optimism and build off of it “unless you have a very clear picture at the senior management level and you can articulate that to all your teammates everywhere around the world you’re going to have a tough time propelling the team forward” shular says “the team is not going to be able to embrace the types of changes you’re asking them to make that very clear vision that is very wellarticulated to every team member is fundamental to enabling and embracing the type of changes that have to happen” shular firmly latched onto that optimism and hoped his employees who he prefers to call teammates would join with him and do the same lay it all out there shular needed to make it clear to his leadership team how deep the company had sunk and he had to do that before he could move forward with his recovery plan in that situation you really can’t afford to sugarcoat the truth “do not hold anything back” shular says “give the team the exact blunt clear picture of your current reality here’s where your customers are here’s the quality of the product here’s what the balance sheet looks like here’s what your cash flow looks like all the various metrics you use to drive your business here’s what we look like today and make very clear how that’s just not going to be able to continue it’s not going to allow us to be successful” shular didn’t stop at his leadership team he wanted employees throughout the company and around the world to understand that the leadership team was not in denial about the need for change at graftech “so when someone in south africa or france or brazil goes home at night and their spouse says ‘gee what was your day like what’s going on in the company’ that individual can articulate the current reality’” shular says “here’s what it looks like” as the cuts were announced the climate at graftech was quite bleak it was a necessary condition but not one that shular wanted to persist for too long he needed to act with compassion but also with a bit of urgency “if you continue to roll those out over a period of time you’re going to get a team that is constantly looking over their shoulders” shular says “what’s going to happen next when is it me when is it my family so another very important part of any turnaround is to the maximum extent possible lay out your plan and roll it out all at once” shular wanted people to understand where the company was and the steps he was now forced to take but he also wanted them to see a picture of where he felt the company could get to in its recovery “what we told everyone was that this was what we have to get done” shular says “if we can get this done and it will take months and in some cases a couple years to execute on all these then we have a very good shot of getting to our vision” when you’re in a situation where you’re making significant cuts you’ve got to keep the plan in everyone’s mind the idea that they might lose their job doesn’t fade easily from the mind of your employees “you’re going to have to continue to overarticulate the vision and articulate where you are on the milestones” shular says “having some shortterm milestones where the team can be successful and acknowledging them highlighting them and celebrating them will help the team toward more of a view forward” it’s those little victories that can start the momentum you need to achieve bigger victories or at least instill a little more confidence in your people “preferably they are some shorterterm milestones where the team can start to see two months from kickoff ‘oh look what we did’” shular says “so you’ve got to have some nearterm successes that you believe you can knock off early in that game to continue to build the confidence in the team then you have to celebrate the hell out of those successes highlight them celebrate them have fun if you don’t have fun in a turnaround you’re going to lose a lot of people” get in front of people shular couldn’t meet with every one of his employees around the world in the time period he needed to so he had to make the visits he could make really count and then rely on technology to fill in the gaps to ensure everybody had a clear idea of the direction he wanted to take to that end it wasn’t just meeting with top management at each location and having a catered lunch in the executive conference room when shular arrived in town he wanted to interact with as many people as he could at the locations he visited even it took all day and night “don’t go in and just meet the day shift” shular says “there are two other shifts the other two shifts are going to get the message with or without you and i think it’s much better if they hear the message directly from the ceo i have found that there is nothing more powerful than being on the third shift as the ceo is on the plant floor conducting a town hall” if you don’t have second and third shifts the philosophy still applies you’ve got to meet with people from throughout your company if you want them to believe that you value their place in the organization “walk the plant floor and spend time with the operators the men and women who actually make the products and provide services to the customer” shular says take the time to field questions and do it with an attitude of patience not one that conveys a feeling of being late for your next appointment “it gives you some direct feedback on maybe how the message is not coming through clearly or is not playing clearly in these countries” shular says “they misinterpreted it it lets you see that and get it rectified” one aspect that you might overlook in delivering information to your people is the mode of travel that you use to get to those meetings at a time when someone’s good friend at the plant or in the office has been laid off firstclass airfare and fancy rental cars can easily become an example of insensitivity on your part “everybody flies economy” shular says “when you’re in a facility asking them and challenging them to drive continuous improvement every day whether it’s productivity quality ontime delivery inventory turns it’s important that not only the ceo but the entire leadership team walk that talk so for the ceo to pull up in a big fullsize rental car that doesn’t work for us i’m going to be in the cheapest smallest car i can get i’m going to arrive in economy you’d be surprised how clear those messages trickle through the entire team” to help drive that message home shular instituted a policy where no one himself included would fly anything other than economy no matter how far or long their flight might be “because of our global network and all the travel we have for us that was over a  million savings a year to get everybody in economy” says shular who says he flies about  miles a year if you’re trying to balance the cost of travel with the importance of facetoface communication shular says look at what you’re trying to gain from the trip and think about the message you want to convey to your people you can’t be ruled by cost but you also can’t be limited by it if it could help your business it’s often a tricky line to navigate “are we growing customers are we taking care of customers are we penetrating new markets is it going to allow us to be more successful in the future is it going to drive cash flow and profitability” shular says “as a business person we would weigh those kinds of decisions all the time we are very careful not to get to a place where we’re so driven by cost that we lose the view and drive toward what is propelling growth propelling profitable growth is our no  mission so the day that we let cost become the decider or the overriding decider we won’t be in a good place” focus on family shular hoped to instill optimism with his people at the same time he was delivering bad news through his approach particularly with pay cuts “we cut salaries but what we did was all that money that was cut we put it into our global bonus plan” shular says “what we said to the team was if we hit  ½ times target for that year’s goals we’ll pay out all the bonus money plus all the salary money that had been cut in addition we said all the officers’ salaries which were cut  percent they can never get that money back that will go into the pool and it will be paid out to all the other teammates if we hit  ½ times target” shular wanted to show people that he wasn’t just slashing to reach a number and that things would never be the same again he wanted to provide a sense of hope that if people worked hard they would be rewarded for it he also wanted to show a sense of understanding that a recession and cutbacks are generally tougher on employees than they are on management “significant portions of the management team cannot get any bonus unless the people get a bonus” shular says “we don’t have a situation where the senior management team made a pretty nice bonus and the rest of the team got nothing or a very meager bonus we all sit in exactly the same bonus pool and we all have the same metrics and we’re very much aligned having the right wellaligned incentive compensation program is very important to driving teamwork” as it turned out his people did work hard and did earn that money back “the team that year hit  times target” shular says “all that money including the officers’ money got paid out to all the teammates” if you show yourself to be an ally of entrylevel employees and middle management as well as top management and the leadership team you’ll fare a lot better earning support for the things you want to do and you’ll probably find the results are better too shular recalls something one of the employees said at a meeting he had with the third shift at a plant that graftech had acquired as part of its turnaround “he stands up and says ‘gee craig do you think we could get our fishing competition back’” shular says “and i say ‘fishing competition how is that work what’s that all about’” shular discovered that employees at this location at one time had an annual redfish competition that had become a company event the previous owner had let the event fade away and shular was being asked if he could help get it back on the calendar “i said ‘as long as you invite me’” shular said with a chuckle “and so we reorganized and reinstituted it it was last october we have  teammates at that site and  joined the competition over a weekend … it’s important that leadership drive fun work should be a fun process when you think about it we spend a majority of our time at work in my view the only reason we all work is for our families if you don’t believe that look at any individual that gets a promotion or a success at work or accomplishes a hardfought goal the first person they call is somebody back home so we’re all here because of our family” keep driving forward one area that wasn’t touched during the company’s recovery was research and development “in fact we grew rd” shular says “it was so paramount to us that we would have to invest in rd and spend a lot of time on innovation that we moved our global headquarters here to parma to be right next door and under the same roof as our rd operation” the relocation of headquarters along with the acquisition of several companies that broadened the expertise and capability of graftech was evidence that the company wasn’t just looking to recover but that it was looking to continue growing graftech had made some significant strides the banks were looking at the company much more fondly and the company’s market cap had jumped to  billion but shular was already thinking about the next downturn and what could be done to lessen the blow it and keep the growth momentum going “we knew a recession was going to come eventually they always do” shular says “i don’t think anyone knew when but one of our mantras each day was ‘we’re a day closer to the next recession’ so we didn’t want complacency to fall into the company we had done a great turnaround and everyone was patting us on the back we didn’t want to fall into the usual trap of ‘hey we’re pretty good’ so we kept a mantra that we need more new product development more patents more innovation and continued relentless drive on cost structure and productivity” the next recession did come of course and it was a big one net sales took a dive from  billion in  to  million in  but sales got back over the  billion mark in  and graftech reached  billion in  with a market cap of  billion  the company is also back up to  employees “today we sit with almost  patents and patentpending operations one of the largest in our space” shular says “so that’s the turnaround that’s building a spectacular balance sheet and that’s having a great balance sheet and a great team that is very very nimble in the trough and can still play offense so we expect as these economies continue to recover to emerge with a bigger better and stronger business model and be the clear lowcost producer in our industry with a lot more science technology and patents than when we entered this recession” how to reach graftech international ltd   or wwwgraftechcom takeaways be honest about your problems consider costs always prepare for the next recession leave a reply cancel reply your
