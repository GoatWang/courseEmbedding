historical characters  fiction steampunk read an excerpt louis awoke to the clatter of bontemps his valet putting away his folding bed as he did every morning a frigid wind blustered in through the open windows of his bedchamber and louis greeted it with none of his former pleasure once it would have invigorated him now he imagined the wind as deaths frustrated caressanother metallic click a sigh and he heard bontemps retreating louis arranged in his mind the day to come the order in his days was his only remaining comfort he had made versailles into a great and precise clock and though he was king he was carried along by its mechanisms as surely as his lowliest servant or courtier more certainly in fact since a servant might slip briefly away and steal a private moment encounter a mistress take a nap this was his only private moment in bed pretending to be asleep it gave him time to think and to rememberthe persian elixir had given him new life and a body that felt younger than it had in thirty years but it had robbed him of everything else gone were his brother phillipe his son monseigneur his grandson the duke of burgundy and his wife the duchess marieadelaide whose death had broken his heart it was as if god were sweeping clean the line of louis xiv the dust had also claimed almost all of his old friends and companions but worst of all was the loss of his wife maintenonnow he had only france and france was a restless thankless mistress he knewthough his ministers tried to keep it from himthat there were whispers against him now as the years passed and he grew stronger and more full of health those who had hidden their wishes that he would die and make way for a new regime were allowing themselves snide asides they were plotting there were even some who whispered that the real louis was dead and he the devils proxyhe had returned to versailles to show them he was king and to restore the image of glory to accompany his renewed healthin the antechamber outside he now heard the subdued chatter of the everpresent courtiers awaiting their chance to see him he heard footsteps entering and he knew without opening his eyes that the portebuchon du roi had come in to light the fire in the fireplacethe gears of versailles creaked on more footsteps as the royal watchmaker entered the room wound louis watch and departedyes he had been right to return to versailles five years ago when he was dying his chateau of marlycomfortable pleasant intimate marlyhad seemed the place to spend the remainder of his days versailles was drafty it was an instrument of torture that cost a sizable fraction of the treasury each year to maintain but versailles was splendid a fit dwelling for apollo the nation needed him herea shuffling from the side door was his wig maker bringing his dressing wig and the wig of the daythat meant he had a few more moments beneath the covers he stretched and was gratified to feel muscles respond to his commands since his brush with death his body felt fresh and alive all his old appetites were returning to him all of them and some would not be denied gratification much longerwhy then if his body was again sound did a feeling of dread still hound him why did his dreams grow persistently darker why did he fear being alonethe clock struck eight awaken sire bontemps said your day has begunlouis snapped his eyes open good morning bontemps he said attempting a smile he shook his head gazing at the lean fiftyish face looking down at himare you ready your majesty he askedindeed bontemps he said you may admit whom you wishthe morning lever continued his doctors came in and inquired about his health when the chamberlain admitted the first of the courtiersthe ones who had earned invitations to the grande entree through diligencelouis found himself dreading their presence their fawning submission their requestshe felt that way until he saw adrienne de mornay de montchevreuil among themmademoiselle he exclaimed reaching to embrace her to what do i owe this exquisite pleasureadrienne returned his embrace and then curtsied i am well as i always am in your presence sire her smile was as flawless as a perfect ruby i hope your majesty is wellof course my dear he smiled and cast his eyes over the remainder of the courtiers all young men all with that hopeful light in their eyes all wondering what advantage they might be able to extract from this dear girladrienne wore the uniform of saint cyr the simple gown with black ribbons that showed she had achieved that schools highest rankjust as she had always dressed when she was his late wifes secretary louis generally disapproved of such informal dress demanding that the ladies wear the grand habit but adriennes clothing suited her as the clothing of the court ladies did not it matched her thoughtful features and wide intelligent eyes she wore the uniform he suspected as a badge a quiet proclamation that she had attended the school and had passed all of its tests it meant that she was as educated as any woman in france and more so than most louis was suddenly suspicious that she wore the gown also to remind him of how dear she had been to his wife what was she about this young womanit is good to see you he said your letters comforted me greatly after the queens death that would let her know that he had been reminded and she would now press the advantage she believed she hadadrienne continued to smile a faint grin not unlike that on the mona lisa which hung across from his bed as you know sire i have taken up residence at the academy of sciences serving the philosophers thereah yes paris how do you find ither smile broadened as you do sire stifling but the work of your magi is most fascinating of course i understand little of what they do and say but nonethelessi too find their theories incomprehensible yet their results are to my liking they are a great resource to franceas are those who serve themshe bowed her head i shall not waste your majestys precious time but i will tell you that i did not come to ask a boon for myself there is a member of your academy a certain fatio de duillier a most remarkable mannear to your heart louis asked a trifle coldlyno sire adrienne replied quite strongly i would never bother you on such an accountand what does this young man desireadrienne caught his shifting mood his growing impatience he has tried for many months to receive an audience with your majesty and failed she said he wished only that you receive a letter from him she paused and looked him in the eye something that few dared to do it is a short letter she finishedhe considered her for a moment i will receive this letter he said at last this young man should know how fortunate he is to have your favorthank you sire she curtsied once more understanding that she was dismissed a sudden thought struck louis and he summoned her backmademoiselle he said i am planning a small entertainment on the grand canal several afternoons hence i would be pleased if you would join my company on the bargeadriennes eyes widened slightly and an expression he could not identify crossed her face i would be pleased to siregood someone will instruct you in your attirehe then turned to the other courtiers listening politely while they each expressed some sentiment and asked some favor when they were all dismissed he stepped out of bed preparing to dress to keep his appointments but he paused to receive the letter that adrienne had passed to bontemps he broke its seal it was as the demoiselle had promised brief most reverent majestymy name is nicolaus fatio de duillier i am a member of your academy and a former student of sir isaac newton himself i tell you in all sincerity that if you speak with me but a moment i can tell you how to win the war against england with great finalityyour humble and most unfortunate servantn f de duillierwhy have i never heard of this de duillier louis complained to his chancellor the duke of villeroyvilleroys face was drawn beneath his plumed hat the powder on his face did little to hide his surprise at louis statementsirei have a note from him he is one of my philosophersyes sire villeroy replied i know of himhas he approached you as wellthis de duillier has radical unworkable ideas sire i did not want you bothered with themlouis gazed down at villeroy and the other ministers intentionally letting the silence expand to fill the gallery then he said his voice quite low where is marlborough nowa general murmur arose among the other ministers villeroy cleared his throat news came late last night that he has taken lillewhat of our fervefactum how can an army take a fortress defended by a weapon that boils its bloodthe fervefactum has grievously short range majesty and is too massive to transport the alliance uses longrange shells many of which have been taught magically to seek their targets in fact they have instructed such shells to seek our fervefactum when they are in operation they also he grimaced at lille they used a new weapon a cannonball that rendered the fortress walls into glassglass louis shoutedyes sire transmuting the wall and shattering it simultaneouslywhat does this mean for the future of the warvilleroy paused obviously pained our finances are strained he began softly the people suffer from taxation and hunger they are weary of this war and now the tide has finally turned against us in three years we have scarcely won a battle and now marlborough is moving toward versailles and i fear we cannot stop himso my chancellor and minister of war has no proposal for staving off our imminent defeatvilleroy looked down at the table no sire he whispered shaking his headwell louis exclaimed have any of my other ministers any suggestionsmuttering died to silence before the marquis de torcy the minister of foreign affairs voiced what they were all thinkinghave we given no thought to a treatylouis nodded as all of you know i have thrice entreated the alliance against us to conclude a peace and have each time been cruelly rebuffedeven when i came perilously close to betraying my grandson and surrendering spain these people do not want peace with france they want to destroy france they fear our might and they fear our command of the new sciences did you know that two members of my academy of science have been assassinated in the past year for that reason i stationed a company of special corps to protect them i will now move them to versailles paris is too dangerouswhat of tsar peter of russia asked phelypeaux secretary of the royal household he has defeated sweden and the turk securing his own power quite beyond question could we not entice him into an alliancethe tsar has more to gain by watching europe weaken itself than by taking sides accepting his aid would be allying with the wolf to battle the hound our enemies are at least civilized nations if we were to ally with peter we would soon find dancing bears occupying my gardens worse we would have to join with him against the turk and the turk is our best weapon against viennavilleroy grimaced tightly and yet peter stands only just behind you in the numbers of philosophers he employs when gottfried von leibniz flocked to peters standard many followedlouis waved that away i wish to summarize what has been said here today rather than to discuss tsar peter we are losing the war for want of proper weapons you villeroy have just pointed out that i have the greatest philosophers in europe under my command and yet england annually produces more effective artillery how can this bevilleroy straightened his hat a bit your majesty england has newton and his students we have more philosophers it is trueand yet louis allowed his voice to rise we have one of newtons students here who tells me in a letter that he had to smuggle to me that he has the means to bring us victory and no one thought i should be troubled with this he swept his glance about the room monsieurs i am not myself an adept and i do not read widely i am the king and it is mine to judge the fate of our nation i want to see this fatio de duillier and i want to see him tomorrow in the cabinet des perruquesplumed hats nodded like a field of poppies in the windfatio was a nervous pinchedlooking man in his midfifties his face was dominated by a nose like the upturned keel of a boat behind which lurked evasive light brown eyes his lips were continually pursed as if he had just tasted something bad louis regarded him for a moment and then took his seat in an armchairlet us come to the point quickly monsieur louis stated i want only to ask you a question or two before hearing what you have to say about the audacious letter you sent meyes sire de duilliers voice was unexpectedly pleasant if a bit high fatio was awed in the presence of the king and entirely at a loss for what to do or say that was good louis feltyou are i take it by your accent swissindeed sireand you were a student of isaac newtonstudent and confidant your majesty i have brought my correspondence with him to confirm thiswhat i chiefly want to know is why are you no longer his confidantwe had fatio drew what seemed to louis a shaky breath a falling out sir newton is not an easy man he is prone to harm his friendsharm themyes sire he can be quite harsh and when his favor is withdrawn from you it is gone foreveri see so newton cast you outnot for any lack of scholarly ability your majesty his correspondence shows quite clearly that he had nothing but admiration for my skill as a mathematiciando not presume monsieur de duillier to try to guess at my intentionsforgive me sirewas your quarrel with him of proportions sufficient for you to betray him for are you not here to offer to pit some magical weapon of yours against hisbeads of sweat stood clearly on fatios head as he answered majesty i care not what happens or does not happen to england but upon sir isaac newton i wish revenge the weapon i will detail for you will accomplish both your aims and my own in prevailing over england i will also show newton that he was wrong to shun metell me of this weapon louis commandedfatio cleared his throat and drew forth a sheet of paper that he unfolded with trembling fingers well the principle is rather simple but the mathematics have still to be worked out he said it involves merely the creation of a certain set of affinities but as your highness may know the proofs required to actualize suchlouis leaned forward frowning this is not what a king wants to hear he whispered kings do not care where your ideas come from they want only to know what your work will dooh  well he paused and lowered his voice it will destroy london majesty or any other city you care to namelouis stared at him dumstruckwhat do you mean he asked finally destroyas if it never was not one brick shall remainlouis regarded him for a long moment careful to keep his mask in placehow he asked softlyfatio told him and the kings eyes widened then he stood and went to the window staring out at his gardens for one quarter of an hour before turning back to where the man awaited twisting his paper in his hands monsieur de duillier you are a scientific man perhaps you can tell me this why do the shadows lie so long in my garden though the sun stands at noonit is winter sire fatio replied the earth has tilted such that the angle of the sun is from the south in the summer the shadows will scarcely be seenlet us hope then monsieur de duillier that god grants us another summer for i mislike this long light as of tomorrow you have my leave to pursue this your budget will triple and i will place a staff at your disposalfatio fought to keep his features under control but failedgo with my blessing louis saidfatio left clearly on the very edge of flight nearly tripping on his own shoe buckles show
