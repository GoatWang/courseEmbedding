additional shares in full from the sale of the shares of common stock offered by us in this offering after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us the principal purposes of this offering are to make significant investments in research and development and clinical activities related to gemcabene and for working capital and other general corporate purposes as well as to establish a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets we anticipate that we will use the net proceeds of this offering together with our cash and cash equivalents for the following purposes  approximately  million to fund development costs associated with our three late stage clinical trials of gemcabene for our target indications and for costs associated with our planned end of phase  eop meetings with the fda  approximately  million to fund manufacturingrelated activities for gemcabene  approximately  million to fund development costs associated with preclinical studies and related activities for gemcabene and  the balance for general corporate purposes including working capital general administrative costs potential acquisition or inlicensing costs and the prosecution and maintenance of our intellectual property we may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to advance the development of any acquired or inlicensed product candidate however we have no current commitments or obligations to acquire or inlicense any product candidate we expect to have our eop meetings with the fda in the first half of  based upon our currently anticipated clinical trials we will need to raise additional capital to continue to fund the further development of gemcabene and our other operations the amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors including our ability to gain access to additional financing and the relative success and cost of our research preclinical and clinical development programs we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong however and we could use our cash resources sooner than we expect additionally the process of advancing earlystage product candidates and testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly and the timing of progress in these clinical trials is uncertain our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and business condition which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve the amounts and timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors including our ability to access additional financing the relative success and cost of our research preclinical and clinical development programs whether we are able to enter into future licensing arrangements and the other factors described under risk factors in this prospectus in addition we might decide to postpone or not pursue clinical trials or preclinical activities if the net proceeds from this offering and any other sources of cash are less than expected pending their use we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short and intermediateterm interestbearing obligations investmentgrade instruments certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed

clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of dyslipidemia a serious medical condition that increases the risk of life threatening cardiovascular disease dyslipidemia is generally characterized by an elevation of lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc or bad cholesterol triglycerides or fat in the blood or both we are developing our product candidate gemcabene ci a novel oncedaily oral therapy for patients who are unable to achieve normal levels of ldlc or triglycerides with currently approved therapies primarily statin therapy gemcabenes mechanism of action is designed to enhance the clearance of very lowdensity lipoproteins vldls in the plasma and inhibit the production of fatty acids and cholesterol in the liver gemcabene is liverdirected and inhibits apolipoprotein ciii apociii protein in the liver and may inhibit acetylcoa carboxylase acc in the liver gemcabene has been tested as monotherapy and in combination with statins and other drugs in  subjects which we define as healthy volunteers and patients across  phase  and phase  clinical trials and has demonstrated promising evidence of efficacy safety and tolerability cardiovascular disease is a major health concern causing more deaths globally than any other disease dyslipidemia is generally viewed as an important predictor of cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke and a cause of cardiovascular disease it comprises one of the largest therapeutic areas with annual worldwide drug sales of approximately  billion in  we estimate more than  of americans have ldlc or triglycerides or both above a normal range statins such as lipitor marketed by pfizer inc pfizer and crestor marketed by astrazeneca pharmaceuticals lp astrazeneca among others are standard of care for ldlc lowering while fibrates prescription fish oils and niacin are standard of care for triglyceride lowering although these drugs are highly prescribed and capable of reducing ldlc and triglyceride levels many patients are unable to effectively manage their dyslipidemia with currently approved therapies and are in need of better treatment alternatives for example approximately  of patients on statins are unable to meet their ldlc lowering goal and doubling a statin dose has shown to incrementally lower ldlc levels by a nominal percentage approximately  based on historical evidence while increasing safety and tolerability concerns an even higher percentage of patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia do not achieve triglyceride levels low enough to reduce the risk of developing comorbidities such as pancreatitis we believe gemcabene possesses a differentiated product profile compared to other therapies in the market and in clinical development key attributes of our product candidate include the following  costeffective oncedaily oral therapy gemcabene is a small molecule formulated as a tablet and is cost effective to manufacture as a oncedaily oral therapy gemcabene if approved would be more convenient than other nonstatin therapies many of which require frequent injections or multiple daily doses we expect to take a valuebased approach to pricing across the target indications  promising safety and tolerability gemcabene was observed to be well tolerated in  subjects across  phase  and phase  trials both as monotherapy and in combination with statins no subjects died and no subjects experienced a serious adverse event sae that was considered to be related to gemcabene adverse events aes reported were generally mild to moderate in intensity gemcabene did not appear to increase the reporting of myalgia muscle pain when added to statin therapy and no treatment related events of myalgia were reported in any gemcabene monotherapy arm in the dyslipidemia trials  significant lipidlowering of ldlc highsensitivity creactive protein hscrp and triglycerides in phase  trials patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with gemcabene as monotherapy were observed to have significantly lowered ldlc by approximately  from baseline and significantly lowered hscrp by approximately  from baseline in addition patients with hypertriglyceridemia † mgdl were observed to have significantly lowered triglycerides by approximately  and based on posthoc analysis gemcabene was observed to lower triglycerides by up to  in patients with severe triglyceride levels † mgdl our product candidates ability to meaningfully lower levels of multiple key lipids attributable to cardiovascular disease may expand its use across multiple indications within the dyslipidemia market  additive effect in combination with statins in a phase  trial in patients with uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia while on stable statin therapy gemcabene was observed to significantly lower ldlc by an additional  to  from baseline this data indicates that gemcabene may better treat a large population of patients who are unable to reach their lipid goal with statins and other currently prescribed therapies  no drugdrug interactions when combined with highintensity statin doses in two phase  trials gemcabene was tested in combination with highintensity statin doses  mg simvastatin and  mg atorvastatin no clinically relevant drugdrug interactions were observed in addition gemcabene has been formulated as a fixeddose combination tablet with various atorvastatin doses which may offer additional convenience and compliance to patients we are initially pursuing gemcabene in the following four indications representing approximately  million addressable patients in the united states as a treatment in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy the maximum dose tolerated by each patient for patients who are unable to reach their lipidlowering goals  homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia hofh a rare genetic lipid disorder which results in elevated ldlc usually due to mutations in both alleles a pair of genes on a chromosome responsible for a specific trait of the ldlreceptor gene  heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia hefh a more prevalent genetic lipid condition which results in elevated ldlc usually due to a mutation in one allele of the ldlreceptor gene  atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascvd patients with hypercholesterolemia or patients with elevated ldlc who have had or are at risk for a cardiovascular event such as heart attack or stroke and  severe hypertriglyceridemia shtg in which patients with elevated triglycerides are at an increased risk of developing comorbidities such as pancreatitis we are pursuing hofh given that gemcabene has recently received orphan drug designation for this indication we believe we can design an efficient development plan to provide a new treatment alternative for those patients furthermore we believe that gemcabenes potential ability to treat patients in the most severe segment of the dyslipidemia market hofh will enhance brand awareness among key thought leaders and physicians we are developing gemcabene for hefh ascvd and shtg given gemcabenes  promising clinical data in these indications  costeffective manufacturing process  convenient oral dosing  viability as adjunct combination therapy and  large commercial potential by the end of  we expect to initiate three late stage clinical trials for gemcabene in hofh hypercholesterolemia including hefh and ascvd patients on maximally tolerated statins and shtg we believe it is unlikely the fda will require us to initiate a cardiovascular outcomes trial for our target indications the fda has not required the initiation or completion of cardiovascular outcomes trials for recent approvals of certain dyslipidemia therapies including nonstatin therapies targeting ldlc for the treatment of hofh hefh and ascvd and triglyceride lowering for treatment of shtg  we were formed in michigan as michigan life therapeutics llc mlt in november  in october  we
