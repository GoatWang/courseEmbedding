wonderful and she sees skincare as a passion and a craft after one visit and her skillful extractions my skin literally looked like a new canvas and it keeps getting better with everyday after karens skincare is holistic in a way that i have never experienced before she had me bring my skincare regime products and makeup so she could take a look not to see what she could push product wise but to really investigate and provide recommendations as necessary she also followed up a couple days after just to check how my skin was doing postfacial two people at work asked for karens information when

to try her out for myself  and let me tell you  shes really as good as everyone claims the past couple of months my skin started to change and become more sensitive ive always had pretty decent skin and had no idea how to handle this new norm even before my appointment miss karen took the time to reach out and introduce herself she asked that i bring all of my skincare products with me to the appointment so that she could see what i was using and what ingredients i might be missing once i arrived miss karen talked to me about my pain points goals skincare  lifestyle routines and did a thorough assessment of my skins current condition and what products i was using she provided amazing information and was so great about explaining her recommendations throughout the facial she lets you know whats going on and at no time did i ever feel uneasy or rushed i even added on a lash tint while in the middle of my treatment which i now believe i am thoroughly addicted to it makes a world of difference if you have light eyelashes afterwards miss karen recommended i try a few of her high quality products  which i did and they are incredible  but the great thing is that she doesnt make you feel forced to buy everything at once she even advises that you finish out the products you have as long as theyre not detrimental to your skin so that you dont waste your money the day after my

years ago i saw karen for a skin products consultation karen was very knowledgeable and really looked at all of my makeup and skin care products i was using and made recommendations on ingredients i should avoid and ingredients i should look for i ended up buying a few products that she recommenced for me that day and really appreciated that she didnt pressure me and was conscious of my budget she threw in a sample of her foaming facial refiner scrub and i fell in love i would recommend it to anyone and ive been using it for over two years i havent found a scrub like it that actually really gets everything off and doesnt leave my sensitive skin red and irritated the granules are super concentrated and fine which is hard to find in products of the same price range definitely worth the money and thank god she ships from austin i discovered miss karen via yelp after googling blackhead extraction austin made my appointment via her website  went in hoping i would come out feeling as

me  modified my routine list yes i actually follow a product list daily i left with zero blackheads on my nose which was a stark contrast to when i walked in the next day my skin was glowing its been over a week and my nose still is clean  blackhead free note her services are not cheap im sure there are less expensive facial options out there but in the case of skin you really get what you pay for ive had a handful of cheaper facials that left me blackhead freefor a few days miss karen really works some magic because my face still looks just as clean  glowy as the day of my service her services

for texas she does the best facial in austin  and for the loyals in los angles we have her once a month i have been seeing karen for  years now i have gone to many specialists but no one has elevated to her level of perfection i believe its because she is a registered nurse and worked with top dermatologists this certainly gave her a very unique angle to get in deep and understand your skin i have suffered from rosacea breakouts that started in my adult years i started seeing miss karen to help ease the mini flares and skin maintenance to prevent future flares her microdermabrasion facials are awesome and have truly kept my skin happy healthy  vibrant i also  must mention how adorably nerdy she is especially when she does her blackhead removal you walk out of her studio smiling with seriously glowing dewy perfect skin obviously i am a huge fan so i finally had to sit down and make the time to write this review i usually dont write reviews but this one is worth reading  ive gotten facials in several spas in the austin area and not one of them compares to the one i got from miss karen her facials actually give me results my skin looks amazing and believe me im very hard to please highly highly highly recommend her services miss karen is the best esthetician  best facialist ive ever been to i only had the pleasure of meeting her in person once i was referred to her by a close friend i left her table glowing and her office with the best skincare products i had ever used they were nearly half the cost of the department store products i was buying and sooo much better for the health of my skin the results were far more advanced than the super expensive products  plus they come with a knowledgeable aesthetic registered nurse who knows her stuff  miss karen we now live in separate states but over the last  years i have stayed in contact with her through email because she takes the stress out of skincare i seriously feel like a deer in headlights when it comes to this stuff  the market is saturated and i can tell you that miss karens products work i trust her to curate the most bang for my buck and she does a fantastic job plus theres no more guesswork of whether im using products correctly  if i have a question after a purchase i just shoot an email to her and problem solved thank you miss karen for helping me develop my skincare regimen you are loved  miss karen gives one of the best facials ever she is knowledgable thorough and extremely helpful in giving advice about diet skin care routine and products shes very easy going and creates such a relaxed environment for her clients i am so happy that i discovered her awesomeness stop scrolling through looking for the best skin technician in austin youve found her i had my first facial with karen last weekend and it was the best facial i have ever had she is a consummate professional she really knows her stuff she is a pro and im very glad i found her you will not waste a penny on your skin if you put it in karens hands thanks karen ive been going to miss karen for years and im so glad i found her for facials microdermabrasian chemical peels botox dermaplaningreally anything she in incredible karen knows skin and takes time to discuss what results you want what the best procedure would be for you and makes your skin look amazing i have been seeing miss karen for over ten years and that should tell you how amazing she is her treatments are top flight and wonderful she really knows what shes doing i even have before and after photos of when i lived in nyc for a time and the rough weather really took a toll on my skin she brought my skin back to health and a youthful glow i was so grateful her work is impeccable she knows skin better than anyone ive ever been to which is why ive stayed so long she has an extensive knowledge of skin and beauty products as well and doesnt hesitate to give you a recommendation opinion or suggestion if you need it she uses high quality products and has her own skincare line which is spectacular im now using a few of her own products and i love them i live in los angeles and have been to some of the best skincare centers here frequented by movie stars and the like so ive been around the skincare world for a long time and there is no one like karen besides her knowledge and expertise shes a really personable caring professional easy with a laugh and a good joke shes really a gem and if youre lucky enough to find her dont let go i sure wont she is simply the best in her field ive been going to kk for  years she has always been a pleasure to receive professional skincare from she is always honest yet positive recently i had my first experience with filler and i knew i was in good hands since karen is one of the best estheticians ive ever had my experience was very positive and i feel so beautiful cannot leave enough stars for karen i have tried countless treatments to improve my skin and never experienced the type of drastic results as i did from the microneedling with prp aka vampire facial after only one treatment my skin is so much brighter and smoother karen is extremely thorough and texted me a few days later to check on my results as long as shes in austin ill never go to anyone else amazing facial experience with the one and only miss karen everything was perfect from the ease of scheduling with her by phone to the postfacial checkin email i have found my favorite facialist in austin and will definitely be back just some of the amazing aspects of my experience best microdermabrasion facial best extractions great parking high quality products and a tranquil facial room thank you miss karen for making my skin glow i had my first microdermabrasion facial and blackhead extractions ever here and it was amazing my primary concerns were blackheads and karen was able to work her magic on my troubled skin shes super sweet and accommodating to my needs i cant wait for my next appointment highly recommend  i dont typically write reviews but miss karens is one of the first and only places that made me feel so inclined to spread the good word about her this was hands down the best facial experience ive ever had the salon is easy to find tons of parking so clutch in downtown austin and such a comfortable and private space karen will escort you upstairs away from the noise of the hair salon in the most peaceful little airy room we sat down and chatted about my skincare health habits beauty routine for close to  minutes she is so easy to talk to and and makes you feel so comfortable i came in desperate for a really good deep cleaning and pore extraction and thats exactly what she gave me and more i walked out with glowing skin several amazing free samples of her products and some really smart tips on how i can optimize my beauty routine so far i am obsessed with her exfoliator product the moisturizer with spf and foundation she gave me as samples best of all she sent me a follow up note thanking me and checking in on how i was doing post facial i will  be coming back for more facials and more products miss karen is amazing i went for an acne peel which was awesome she was very knowledgable and gave me a lot of helpful information about how i should be taking care of my skin and what products to use or try even after my appointment she would check up on my progress i highly recommend her and will definitely go again myself karen is awesome not only is she extremely talented at what she does but her funny positive attitude is what made the experience that much better she treats you as if you were a good friend she has known for years when you combine that type customer service and straight up talent its a nobrainier i will recommend all my family and friends to her thanks karen you rock oh miss karen queen of all things beauty ill give you the long story short and the short story long for those who are interested miss karen is amazing at what she does she is extremely knowledgeable about the ingredients that go into skin care and make up products as well as the roots of all your skin problems not only that she is a delight the whole experience is like being taking care of by a best friend she is upbeat and genuinely interested in her clients needs she is one of a kind also most painless brazilian wax ever she is magic the products she sells are no scam they are the best i have ever used i honestly see a difference in my skin i feel so beautiful more story if you want it i met miss karen when she worked in los angeles and from day one knew i was in the best hands like i said most painless wax of my life she is always cheery she has helped me solve skin issues try new products talk through break ups all the things now that she is in austin i dont get to see her but she is the best because she emails me and answers all my detailed questions with detailed answersat no cost she always seems just happy to help and answer any questions to me it seems she loves being involved in the process with her clients the skin care line she uses has done wonderful things for my skin i dont even have bad skin to start off with but after using her products my skin looked and felt more even and healthy she knows what she is talking about and isnt out to rip you off or take your money she honestly loves what she does and you can tell ignore all the crap in the magazines ladies and just go to miss karen i even strayed and tried a different brand alas it sucked and i went back to miss karen and she welcomed me with open arms if youre ready to stop the exhausting search for the right products miss karen is your girl after only seeing miss karen once for a facial i can easily say that i will likely follow this woman until the ends of the earth for my skin she is a life changer i found karen through yelp in a skin situation i typically have great skin but in the past couple weeks prior i had broken out like never before a visit to a different facialist in the area made it even worse and they didnt even bother to do extractions having physicians as parents i know a little bit more than your average person about health skincare etc and i knew that my face simply needed extractions and extractions by the best of the best i can unequivocally say that the best of the best is karen karens demeanor is wonderful and she sees skincare as a passion and a craft after one visit and her skillful extractions my skin literally looked like a new canvas and it keeps getting better with everyday after karens skincare is holistic in a way that i have never experienced before she had me bring my skincare regime products and makeup so she could take a look not to see what she could push product wise but to really investigate and provide recommendations as necessary she also followed up a couple days after just to check how my skin was doing postfacial two people at work asked for karens information when i got to the office the next day and people keep commenting about the freshness of my skin lately while karen isnt inexpensive she is worth absolutely every penny and i cannot wait to go back to see her albeit hopefully not in a  situation thank you karen ahmazing  miss karen will not let you down she took the time to understand the specifics of what i was looking for and what my skin needs then delivered a skilled and thorough treatment that left my skin feeling awesome i will be back  miss karen is my new facial goto after reading all of the incredible reviews miss karen has received i had to try her out for myself  and let me tell you  shes really as good as everyone claims the past couple of months my skin started to change and become more sensitive ive always had pretty decent skin and had no idea how to handle this new norm even before my appointment miss karen took the time to reach out and introduce herself she asked that i bring all of my skincare products with me to the appointment so that she could see what i was using and what ingredients i might be missing once i arrived miss karen talked to me about my pain points goals skincare  lifestyle routines and did a thorough assessment of my skins current condition and what products i was using she provided amazing information and was so great about explaining her recommendations throughout the facial she lets you know whats going on and at no time did i ever feel uneasy or rushed i even added on a lash tint while in the middle of my treatment which i now believe i am thoroughly addicted to it makes a world of difference if you have light eyelashes afterwards miss karen recommended i try a few of her high quality products  which i did and they are incredible  but the great thing is that she doesnt make you feel forced to buy everything at once she even advises that you finish out the products you have as long as theyre not detrimental to your skin so that you dont waste your money the day after my facial my skin was glowing and felt super soft im now postfacial  days and my skin literally just keeps getting better overall miss karen is top notch and i highly recommend her to anyone looking for a knowledgeable talented beauty guru believe the hype shes totally worth it and im so thankful to all the other yelp reviewers who helped me find her  i know ive just become a client for life a few years ago i saw karen for a skin products consultation karen was very knowledgeable and really looked at all of my makeup and skin care products i was using and made recommendations on ingredients i should avoid and ingredients i should look for i ended up buying a few products that she recommenced for me that day and really appreciated that she didnt pressure me and was conscious of my budget she threw in a sample of her foaming facial refiner scrub and i fell in love i would recommend it to anyone and ive been using it for over two years i havent found a scrub like it that actually really gets everything off and doesnt leave my sensitive skin red and irritated the granules are super concentrated and fine which is hard to find in products of the same price range definitely worth the money and thank god she ships from austin i discovered miss karen via yelp after googling blackhead extraction austin made my appointment via her website  went in hoping i would come out feeling as awesome as previous reviewers and i did she really took her time explaining every step as she cleansed prepped and worked her magic on my skin she also went through my products which i brought in with me  modified my routine list yes i actually follow a product list daily i left with zero blackheads on my nose which was a stark contrast to when i walked in the next day my skin was glowing its been over a week and my nose still is clean  blackhead free note her services are not cheap im sure there are less expensive facial options out there but in the case of skin you really get what you pay for ive had a handful of cheaper facials that left me blackhead freefor a few days miss karen really works some magic because my face still looks just as clean  glowy as the day of my service her services are worth every single penny not once did i think damn that wasnt really worth it i will definitely be going back to her for my future facials  services if youre on the fence its worth it to give her

austin tx  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow eliza c stop following eliza c  after only seeing miss karen once for a facial i can easily say that i will likely follow this woman until the ends of the earth for my skin she is a life changeri found karen through yelp in a skin situation i typically have great skin but in the past couple weeks prior i had broken out like never before a visit to a different facialist in the area made it even worse and they didnt even bother to do extractions having physicians as parents i know a little bit more than your average person about health skincare etc and i knew that my face simply needed extractions and extractions by the best of the best i can unequivocally say that the best of the best is karenkarens demeanor is wonderful and she sees skincare as a passion and a craft after one visit and her skillful extractions my skin literally looked like a new canvas and it keeps getting better with everyday after karens skincare is holistic in a way that i have never experienced before she had me bring my skincare regime products and makeup so she could take a look not to see what she could push product wise but to really investigate and provide recommendations as necessary she also followed up a couple days after just to check how my skin was doing postfacialtwo people at work asked for karens information when i got to the office the next day and people keep commenting about the freshness of my skin lately while karen isnt inexpensive she is worth absolutely every penny and i cannot wait to

to try her out for myself  and let me tell you  shes really as good as everyone claims the past couple of months my skin started to change and become more sensitive ive always had pretty decent skin and had no idea how to handle this new norm even before my appointment miss karen took the time to reach out and introduce herself she asked that i bring all of my skincare products with me to the appointment so that she could see what i was using and what ingredients i might be missing once i arrived miss karen talked to me about my pain points goals skincare  lifestyle routines and did a thorough assessment of my skins current condition and what products i was using she provided amazing information and was so great about explaining her recommendations throughout the facial she lets you know whats going on and at no time did i ever feel uneasy or rushed i even added on a lash tint while in the middle of my treatment which i now believe i am thoroughly addicted to it makes a world of difference if you have light eyelashes afterwards miss karen recommended i try a few of her high quality products  which i did and they are incredible  but the great thing is that she doesnt make you feel forced to buy everything at once she even advises that you finish out the products you have as long as theyre not detrimental to your skin so that you dont waste your money the day after my facial my skin was glowing and felt super soft im now postfacial  days and my skin literally just keeps getting betteroverall miss karen is top notch and i highly recommend her to anyone looking for a

karen for a skin products consultation karen was very knowledgeable and really looked at all of my makeup and skin care products i was using and made recommendations on ingredients i should avoid and ingredients i should look for i ended up buying a few products that she recommenced for me that day and really appreciated that she didnt pressure me and was conscious of my budget she threw in a sample of her foaming facial refiner scrub and i fell in love Â i would recommend it to anyone and ive been using it for over two years i havent found a scrub like it that actually really gets everything off and doesnt leave my sensitive skin red and irritated the granules are super concentrated and fine which is hard to find in products of the same price range definitely worth the money
