davidson scott scott davidson thanks andreas good morning and thank you all for joining us today as we previously have communicated in detail in the investor presentation available on the rait website we’re in the midst of transitioning rate to a streamlined business model that’s focused on our core commercial real estate lending business we began implementing the strategy in  and will continue to pursue through  as we transform rate into a pure play commercial real estate lender our transformational strategy remains focused on divesting our legacy reo portfolio and ultimately minimizing our reo holdings opportunistically divesting our property management operations optimizing our capital structure and reducing our outstanding indebtedness reducing our total expense base and most importantly reallocating capital into and growing our core middlemarket cre lending activities once the transformation is complete we’re confident we will be better positioned to grow shareholder value we’re looking forward to delivering stable and repeatable returns with a significantly lower expense base that matches our lending focused strategy to an appropriate capital structure with lower levels of debt during the first quarter we continue to make significant progress executing on our transformative business strategy first we closed  million worth of senior floatingrate loans during the quarter our lending pipeline continues to be strong and we’re seeing consistent quality in our originations on our first lien middle market focused loan product we are in the process of aggregating loans for our seventh rait sponsored floatingrate securitization second our nonlending asset dispositions remain on track during the quarter we sold six properties for  million and divested out of five industrial properties part of a  property industrial portfolio which paul will discuss shortly discussions around the disposition of our commercial real estate focused property manager urban retail continue in our ongoing third as the balance sheet transitioning contracts during  our overall debt levels are also decreasing during the quarter rait’s total indebtedness based on principal amount declined by a  million to  billion and since january st of  our total indebtedness have declined by about  million as of this call total recourse debt excluding our secured credit facilities declined by  million since the beginning of the year and since january st of  our total recourse debt declined by about  million we currently have no recourse debt maturities due in  other than our secured warehouse facilities and fourth as we execute on our plan base compensation and ga expenses continue to trend down first quarter expenses of  million were  lower than the previous quarter and when annualized represent approximately  decrease in compensation ga from the year ended  lastly as we alluded to on our prior – on our yearend earnings call the board declared a  dividend in our common shares for the first quarter before turning the call over to paul i’d like to remind everyone that  is a transitional year for rait and the cumulative nearterm effects of our strategy will cause rait’s cad to compress throughout the year we do expect cad will rebound in  at this time i’d like to turn the call over to paul kopsky our chief financial officer to report on our financial results paul kopsky thanks scott rait reported a net – a gaap net loss of  and cad of  per share for the first quarter as scott highlighted we are in the midst of our transformation to a pure play commercial real estate lender the process of reducing and deleveraging the balance sheet through asset sales debt paydowns and loan payoffs continues as we take time this year to unlock capital to reinvest over time as a result of this process cad was lower this quarter the result of successfully unlocking capital this quarter we originated  million of new loans which compares favorably to the  million of loan originations for all of  as scott mentioned we’re in the working on our seventh floatingrate nonrecourse securitization which we expect to complete in the near future our loan portfolio stands at  billion as of march  demonstrating net loan growth of  million from yearend the loan portfolio did experience levels of loan payoffs consistent with the credit quality we expect to achieve in our floatingrate portfolios as strong borrowers are taking advantage of the healthy real estate markets to either sell or refinance with longerterm rait financing loan repayments were approximately  million in q compared to  million in the fourth quarter  the combination of loan repayments and an increase in our cost of funds from ongoing deleveraging during the quarter caused our net interest margin or nim to decline from the previous quarter from a credit perspective all of our post financial crisis originated loans continue to perform as expected our nonaccrual loans declined from the yearend to  million down from  million all relating to the same precrisis loans we recorded a provision for loan loss of  million relating to two legacy loans the commercial loan portfolio ended the quarter with an allowance for loan loss of  million we continue to make good progress in divesting out the real estate portfolio that we have during the quarter the gross portfolio declined by  million to  million we generated a gaap gain relating to the property sales of  million and also record a  million impairment the impairment relates to four properties in the portfolio which are in varying stages of the selling process additionally the gaap loss this quarter reflects a  million or  per share noncash item which we reflected in as loss on deconsolidation properties in our statement of operations as described in our earnings release the source of this noncash loss which is expected to reverse in future periods relates to a legacy portfolio of  industrial properties acquired in  through rate exercising its rights in its investment of nonperforming mezzanine loan by  million the portfolio was encumbered by a thirdparty crosscollateralized nonrecourse senior debt late in the first quarter the senior lender began divesting to an auction process of approximately half of the assets generating a noncash loss to our financials a gain is expected to be recognized in the future periods which will offset this loss from the remaining five properties in the portfolio are fully divested we continue to actively work on divesting and monetizing remained properties in our real estate portfolio as efficiently and prudently as possible we’re using the proceeds from our real estate sales to reduce our overall leverage and reinvest in our lending activities our overall indebtedness declined by a  million in the first quarter and total recourse debt excluding warehouse lines was reduced by  million in the first quarter and an additional  million was reduced in april since january   we – as scott mentioned we reduced our recourse debt excluding excluding warehouse lines by  million we have no more corporate recourse debt maturities remaining in  excluding our warehouse lines and are now focused on our  obligations our cash balance remains strong at  million at march  even after the progress we’ve made to the corporate debt paydowns overall the transformation is ongoing we’re well on our way to fully implementing our strategic plan i look forward as new cfo to completing this process with the team simplifying our financials and continuing to enhance transparency of our new vision for our stakeholders that concludes the financial report scott back to you scott davidson thanks paul operator at this time i’d like to open up the call for any questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from jessica leviribner with fbr your line is open tim hayes hey guys this is tim for jessica thanks for taking my questions scott davidson hey tim tim hayes hey so you had mentioned that you expect cad to rebound in  and as you think about earnings power at that point once you’re largely through these strategic initiatives do you expect to cover the current dividend on a cad basis at that point if so are you comfortable maintaining that dividend as you under earned over the next few quarters potentially scott davidson sure well as the board thinks about setting the dividend the three metrics that it uses are one cad current cad second asset sales and gains associated with losses but gains associated with those as well as if you highlighted the future earnings power of the firm what we’re looking forward to is selling all of the assets that we have unlocking that capital and setting the dividend based on where we are at that point so we know that dividends are important to our shareholders the board feels that very strongly we care about shareholder returns and we look forward to discussing on our next earnings call what our dividend policy and setting is at that point in time tim hayes okay great and then as it stands today what is your capacity to make or to originate loans at this point and what type of liquidity do you have on hand and kind of what assumptions you use in terms of expected loan repayments there and then the type of leverage you put on that scott davidson sure bunch of questions there and if i don’t hit all of them please remind me but i think that as you know we ended the quarter with about  million or so of cash what we’re striving to do is make sure we’re a consistent originator consistently in the markets throughout the year and not be in a period where we originate a lot of loans and then are not able to access and deal with our borrowers for other periods so we’re very much in the process of timing our cash on hand with the loans that we want to make in doing that as i said throughout the year as we previously disclosed we have plans to make about  million worth of loans this year anywhere from  to  we’ve got capital on hand and our miles tell us to give in the loan repayments we see for the balance of the year and the cash that will return to us that we should be able to do that as well as meet some of our targets around debt repayments so we’ve got a balance between both of those uses of cash and as a general rule we’ve kind of targeted about a  equity target for the company as we’ve disclosed it maybe  or maybe  but we think about it somewhere between that  to  which is why when you look at our floatingrate securitizations you’ll see that that’s about the amount of equity we keep in each of those transactions which matches our longterm goals tim hayes got it thanks for the color scott davidson you’re welcome operator and your next question comes from steve delaney with jmp securities your line is open steve delaney good morning and thanks for taking the question so i’d like to ask a series of questions if i may about urban retail i believe that you have commented in the past that that operation as it exists today with respect to the property management contracts and the headcount i believe i’ve heard you describe it as being a drag on current results and current earnings that’s why you’re looking to dispose it but can you estimate for us the – is there a way to estimate what the negative impact was to cad in the first quarter from the urban retail operation scott davidson sure well steve i’ll turn it over to paul to talk about some of that but just so we’re all on the same page steve delaney yes scott davidson urban has been a great benefit to the firm as its managed properties that we’ve owned as we’re selling those properties we no longer need that expertise i think it provided us significant benefits in the early days and it’s… steve delaney right scott davidson …reduced i think we disclosed in our last earnings call it was a little bit closer to breakeven and then of course there are financing i said breakeven i think about it from a top line perspective paul thinks about it from a gaap perspective and so i’ll let him talk about that steve delaney okay thanks paul kopsky on a standalone basis steve the company did have better than breakeven numbers on a standalone basis as they continue to work on our properties obviously you have their consolidation of revenues and expenses come into play but overall the business has on a standalone basis is making money for us scott davidson on a gaap basis paul kopsky on a gaap basis steve delaney okay got it thanks okay thank you for clarifying that i’m sorry if i misstated it initially is there a formal process in place where you’ve engaged advisors to attempt to sell this or are you doing it more from a networking standpoint paul kopsky we are – we have a number of interested parties that we have done on our own… steve delaney okay paul kopsky …that that we’re working with and we look forward to trying to finalizing that here in the very near future steve delaney okay and could you estimate the – if it were to be sold what the headcount reduction would be to your end possibly the expense i know you’re trying to lower expenses so if you could comment on headcount reductions and expenses if you were successful in selling it that would be helpful paul kopsky well the urban team has about plus people in the overall group so that would be the overall headcount reduction i think we’ve been laying out this  million to  million of revenues and expense would be also eliminating other as well steve delaney okay great that’s very helpful okay and then a final thing if i may so good continued progress for plan in terms of selling the – selling off the legacy and real estate looks like we’re down to somemillion do you have – can you share any type of timeframe for – or let’s put it this way because i know this is sort of a best efforts thing do you have a goal that you have in mind for being able to complete the full disposition of that or how much over the next one to two years might we see in additional sales or dispositions thanks scott davidson well yes no as you know we identified the specific portfolio and classified them as available for sale at the end of the year we expect all of those assets or we’re intending all of those assets that we sold in this calendar year in terms of our goal my view would be at rather sell everything at an appropriate price as quickly as possible so we’re going to continue on the assets that that we can to accelerate that process as much as possible i think our first quarter production in terms of selling assets was representative of sort of a normal quarter i’m hopeful that it’s a little bit higher in the second quarter and that we can continue that progress into the third and fourth quarter but it is an active process we’re engaging with lots of buyers we’ve got contracts signed and we’re working in hard we do feel very good about the progress there are a couple of assets that have some – the reason we have identified every asset to sellers there’s a couple not only do we feel there are some significant upside in but there are also a couple of that for various contractual reasons we can’t sell as quickly as we would like and once those contractual reasons end we will move forward in selling them steve delaney right i believe you’ve got one project i believe you described it is in redevelopment so obviously that’s something you’re trying to do some valueadd work to i guess before you try to liquidate of the  million can you remind me what the actual amount that you had classified as available for sale is currently do you have that figure handy paul kopsky all of it steve delaney oh all of it scott davidson no it dose not there was originally  million right steve delaney okay scott davidson of that  million we reduced it by a  million this quarter correct paul kopsky correct scott davidson so it’s  million… steve delaney okay wonderful okay well guys thank you for the time this morning that’s helpful scott davidson you’re welcome operator and your next question comes from george bahamondes with deutsche bank your line is open george bahamondes hi good morning i’m just wondering if you could provide additional detail both including terms location at the use of proceeds if any color you can provide on the five loans you’ve originated in the first quarter scott davidson yes glenn riis who is here and head of our credit department i have never called him before talking to one of these calls so glenn you want to give us some highlevel discussions i’d say with the loans glenn riis well yes we like i said we had a pretty decent quarter this first quarter and i look forward to continuing the rest of the year one of the larger asset there we did was a portfolio of highquality real estate assets here in philadelphia in our backyard the  million loan on a combination of seven properties combination of retail office and small multifamily component and it’s for a repeat bar for us for all three properties so that that’s kind of at a highlevel of the largest asset that we did george bahamondes okay glenn riis and then we had four other assets that kind of have any like multiple speakers scott davidson they’re all quite consistent with our transitional loan product glenn riis right scott davidson all in good markets a large variety of asset classes that are within our core product types so there’s no outlier there was no new market for us very very consistent when you see fl you’ll see those loans in there and i think fl the perspectives that put forward with that transaction with new dramatic detail ph associated with each loan will do a good job of highlighting that for you george bahamondes okay that… glenn riis go ahead george bahamondes so that was there i’m sorry if i cut you off there glenn riis okay and i just wanted to refine that steve’s comment made earlier about what was remaining in the  million we do reflect that in page  of our supplement reflecting  million in held for available for sale and  million in held for investment representing that  million remaining in the real estate portfolio george bahamondes okay i think that was it for me thanks guys operator and i’m showing no further questions i would now like to turn the call back to scott davidson for any further remarks scott davidson thank you all for joining and we look forward to talking to you next quarter have a wonderful day

yorkershopsign inlink your subscriptionamy davidson sorkinscott pruitt the epa and the republicans’ bargain with trumpby amy davidson sorkinfebruary  almost no one in the gop seems to question the wisdom of putting scott pruitt who doubts the reality of climate change in charge of the environmental agency most associated with efforts to combat itphotograph by zach gibson  afp  gettygiven that a cache of documents that might show whether scott pruitt president donald trump’s choice to run the environmental protection agency ought to get the job is due to be released next tuesday why did senate republicans insist over democratic protests on holding a confirmation vote on friday since there was only a holiday weekend in between not much time would have been lost and the documents including emails on the contacts that pruitt had with oil and gas companies in oklahoma during a period in which as that state’s attorney general he repeatedly sued the epa and sought to block policies designed to address climate change are directly relevant as elizabeth kolbert has written the existing paper trail is already pretty damning this wasn’t some fishing expedition into an obscure or longclosed chapter of pruitt’s life nor was it a lastminute one a judge in oklahoma ordered that the state produce the papers in response to a longstalled freedomofinformation request from a citizens’ group first filed in  before anyone thought that trump might win the election senator jeff merkley an oregon democrat who introduced the measure that would have delayed the vote called the unwillingness to examine the emails “an egregious coverup” and it might well have been just that the emails could show a conflict between pruitt’s private ties to an industry whose activities he would help regulate and his duty to the publicbut the republicans it turned out weren’t interested in any of that after a session in which they mostly complained that the democrats didn’t seem to like anyone whom president trump had come up with they pushed the vote through and pruitt was confirmed fiftytwo to fortysix only one republican susan collins of maine voted against him two democrats—joe manchin of west virginia and heidi heitkamp of north dakota—voted yes presumably for reasons related to their states’ fossilfuel industries and the tough reëlection campaigns that they face next year john mccain missed the vote because he was travelling no one else in the republican party seemed to question the wisdom of putting a man who has openly doubted the reality of climate change in charge of the agency most associated with efforts to combat it why notthere are two answers to the question of why republicans rushed pruitt through not mutually exclusive one is that this is just another instance of something that has been seen repeatedly in the weeks since donald trump took office the republicans’ floppy pose of deference to trump they have let him do what he wants for the most part unless a shocking “oprah” tape from the past comes back to haunt an already unfit nominee as william finnegan has written in that case involving andrew puzder the failed labor secretary nominee the tape only stopped the senators when combined with his illegal household help and his crudely expressed disdain for working americans they hadn’t stood up to trump on his executive order barring entry to people from seven countries and to all refugees despite the direct risk it posed to many residents of red states not to mention to the constitution speaker of the house paul ryan hadn’t managed to say much more than that “regrettably the rollout was confusing” as if he might have erased the insult to american values with a powerpoint presentation and a cando smile their hurt speeches on friday morning about how the democrats didn’t respect trump’s choices came less than twentyfour hours after their president spoke casually about blowing russian boats out of the water accused his opponents of staging fake antisemitic attacks questioned the legitimacy of the electoral system the courts and the media and asked a black journalist april ryan if the legislators in the congressional black caucus were “friends” of hers and if she could maybe set them up with a meeting with himthis is a weak answer in part because of what is at stake not only america’s air and water and its children’s health but the future of the planet pruitt is so shameless a choice that former epa employees who have served under presidents from both parties sent a letter to the senate expressing concern about his appointment noting his demonstrated lack of interest in enforcing environmental laws his stance on climate change and his failure to demonstrate that he would “put the public’s welfare ahead of private interests”then again why would this republican party want to block pruitt this is the other answer the senators pushed him through because they wanted to for their own nontrump reasons he is in many ways more typical of where many congressional republicans stand than trump is though pruitt might express his views more crudely and with fewer circumlocutions than some his ties to industry are in many cases their ties to industry too jane mayer has covered the influence of the koch brothers for example in this regard when ryan talks about dismantling the regulatory state he is not far from pruitt indeed when asked about the influence of human activity on climate change ryan has said that he just didn’t know what it all added up to “and i don’t think science does either” in a statement that ryan issued in december  he accused certain scientists who did recognize the effect of using “statistical tricks to distort their findings and intentionally mislead the public on the issue of climate change” he added that any rules restricting american industry in the name of fighting climate change would be a “tough sell” in wisconsin “where much of the state is buried under snow” similarly mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader tends to deal with climate change by saying that he is not a scientist in the opportunistic calculations of the congressional republicans pruitt may not even count as a price they have to pay or a trumpian burden to bear to the contrary he is their rewardmost popularryan lizzaanthony scaramucci called me to unload about white house

excuses electric harleydavidson motorcycle and they did everything else in the marketplace out there feels like a twowheel golf cart — without the golf club carrying capacity” enlarge harleydavidson inc ceo matt levatich scott paulus levatich spoke enthusiastically about the electric motorcycle at the milwaukee business journals power breakfast june  at the pfister hotel “i would say it’s the most exciting automotive two or fourwheel product that i’ve ever experienced he told the crowd we were very excited about it and we are very excited about it” levatich said the company is working on a fiveyear plan with livewire expected to arrive before the end of the decade but there is technology that still needs to be developed to find the right balance for its cost and its range per battery charge “we’ve had about  demo rides around the world and the feedback is tremendous” he said “basically it is this is perfect i want it now when can i get it then we ask practical things like how far do you need it to go and they say things like double the distance it will go and we ask how much do you need it to cost and they say things like half as much as it would cost and this is just the reality of the technology at this stage — battery energy density primarily that we needed to have evolve so we can get closer to where that sweet spot is for price and range it’s evolving” despite the goal of having it arrive by  the priority is more on getting it right than meeting any selfimposed deadlines “product development is an uncertain business” he said “we need technology to develop we’re expecting things to sort of be there when we need them and we’re not going to launch a compromised product we have to deliver all the things that customers want for a no excuses electric harley and when we do it’s going to be awesome” related content related content harleydavidson could be looking to buy ducati report nine wisconsin companies make fortune  list milwaukee wi manufacturing news
