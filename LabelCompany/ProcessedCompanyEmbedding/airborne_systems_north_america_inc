solr™ oxygen mask overview specificationsspec sheetsrelated products overview the solr™ oxygen mask builds on the reliability and strong features of its predecessor the airborne systems’ phaos oxygen mask the current reference for the parachutist oxygen masks used by military units worldwide the solr™ oxygen mask is compatible with the new solr™ and legacy phaos bailout bottles it is also compatible with the phantom bailout bottle the solr™ oxygen mask provides the same performance and time proven reliability as the phaos oxygen mask with the added benefit of new features developed based on input received from experiences collected over the years from the military free fall community the solr™ oxygen mask features a new nondilution oxygen demand regulator which delivers  oxygen during inhalation both during prebreathing and during the actual jump and descent under canopy  this ensures that the jumper is never breathing a mix of gas and mitigates the risk of hypoxia drastically increasing the safety of operation  this breakthrough innovation is made possible thanks to the very high service pressure of airborne systems’ latest bailout bottles allowing them to contain significantly more oxygen than traditional bailout bottles key features lightweight on demand regulator no dilution  o modular dilution module optional compatible with solr  phaos  phantom
