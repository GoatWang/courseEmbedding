operatives had come from washington to see whether diana l taylor would consider running for the united states senate it did not take much proddingms taylor the companion of mayor michael r bloomberg was not only intrigued by the idea but also eager to delve into the details of a potential campaign and future career in the senate she mused about how much influence she could have as a freshman republican in a democraticcontrolled congress and the kind of relationship she would have with the state’s senior senator charles e schumer“she was very serious about it” said bill paxon a republican former congressman from new york who participated in the previously undisclosed meeting in march at the ritzcarlton hotel in manhattanms taylor  a woman known best not for what she has done but for whom she lives with is beginning to make unmistakable forays into new york politics shedding her reputation as a glamorous sidekick and becoming closely watched in her own right her actions suggest that as mr bloomberg enters the twilight of his mayoralty the heir to his political legacy may be the woman he has dated for a decade “if she wants it she has a political future” said john j faso the republican candidate for governor in  advertisement continue reading the main story not everyone was enthusiastic about the senate idea mr bloomberg expressed reservations about her running according

reading the main story ms taylor ultimately decided to forgo the campaign against senator kirsten e gillibrand though she intensely debated it with friends and advisers and quietly traveled to

oust an year incumbent congresswoman carolyn b maloney who represents the upper east siderepublican lawmakers consultants and operatives continue to describe ms taylor — a former investment banker and state banking regulator — as a “perfect candidate” a “grandslam home run” and a “shooin” for offices ranging from governor to mayor of new yorktheir enthusiasm as overheated as it may seem can be traced to her eclectic résumé and a personal warmth that seems to stand out all the more against mr bloomberg’s sometimes chilly demeanor even now the mayor seems to recognize her popularity as a humanizing force to demonstrate how safe city parks had become under his leadership he told reporters this week “my girlfriend goes and walks the dogs at  in the morning” in central parkthe daughter of a biochemist who grew up in old greenwich conn ms taylor attended milton academy in massachusetts dartmouth college and columbia university started her career as an investment banker at smith

her group in ghana the rock star and human rights activist bono once cooed “diana you know how i feel about you but don’t tell the mayor”despite her ties to wall street she emerged as an exacting watchdog as banking superintendent many of her crusades now seem prescient she vigorously opposed a  decision that allowed banks like j p morgan and hsbc holdings to escape state supervision her argument was that local authorities could spot abuses that their federal counterparts missed advertisement continue reading the main story in  two years before the housing market imploded ms taylor

insiders both candidates who sought the party’s  nomination for governor mr faso and william f weld confirmed in recent interviews that they separately asked her to be their running mate that same year the bush administration considered nominating her to lead the federal deposit insurance corporationshe left the pataki administration in  but her credibility with regulators has helped her navigate a new role she took on last july as a member of the board of directors at citigroup where she has helped repair the bank’s relationship with fdic officialsneither ms taylor nor mr bloomberg agreed to comment for this article and details of her flirtation with a senate run have remained hiddenit began according to those involved in the discussions around the end of february when susan molinari a republican former congresswoman from new york raised the idea during a telephone call to ms taylor photo diana l taylor and michael r bloomberg at a benefit in may credit stephen lovekingetty images washington republicans were convinced that ms gillibrand who was appointed to the senate by gov david a paterson was vulnerable and they were determined to recruit a formidable challenger ms molinari the wife of mr paxon had no doubt ms taylor could win she had seen her work the crowds at parades in brooklyn and staten island and charm the city’s biggest donors at the mayor’s town house advertisement continue reading the main story ms taylor agreed to travel to washington to meet with senator cornyn the chairman of the national republican senatorial committee and mr mcconnell the senate minority leader both senators encouraged her to run pointing to her background in finance and her experience as a banking regulatorrepublicansponsored polling revealed her potential attraction to both new york’s upstate conservatives and its downstate liberals and her place at the top of the city’s social pyramid seemed to bode well for fundraisingback in new york in march ms taylor arranged to speak with mr paxon and his former chief of staff michael hook now a republican political consultant she impressed them with her command of the state’s byzantine political system rattling off the names of local party officials and farflung flyspeck towns “this wasn’t a situation where you would have to introduce her to that world” mr paxon saidhe recalled assuring her that if elected she would immediately become a national republican figureultimately however ms taylor decided that it was not the right time she was not ready to disentangle herself from a long list of corporate and nonprofit roles to crisscross the state campaigning nonstop for months or to expose herself to the unforgiving scrutiny of the national news media which would surely descend on the raceand there was the bloomberg factor the two have dated since before he became mayor and though friends say they have no plans to marry ms taylor lives with him at his upper east side town house and travels with him regularly to his retreats in places like bermuda and paristhe mayor expressed misgivings about her running according to two people who have spoken with the couple and who discussed the matter on the condition of anonymity because the conversations were intended to be private a spokesman for the mayor declined to comment but those close to the couple say that having a mayor of new york romantically involved with a senator who could influence the flow of billions of dollars to the city would create a potentially problematic situationfurthermore the mayor who prides himself on his political independence might suddenly find himself asked about matters like his companion’s policy positions and whether her campaign donors were seeking to influence city government a registered republican ms taylor embraces a philosophy that closely mirrors that of the mayor she is socially progressive and fiscally conservative she is fond of invoking abraham lincoln on the role of government which she has paraphrased as “to do for those who cannot do so well for themselves” and she is infuriated by those who complain about washington but do not have the stomach to become involved in public lifeshe also shares mr bloomberg’s suspicions of career politicians she has privately grumbled that some members of congress have been in place too long and have “forgotten why they are there” according to a colleague who speaks with her on a regular basis that complaint seemed to spill into public view when she endorsed ms maloney’s opponent ms saujani and wrote her a  campaign check this spring — ms taylor’s first donation to a candidate since then she has spoken regularly with ms saujani about economic policy and campaign strategy advertisement continue reading the main story her advice “don’t be a politician be a leader” the candidate said in an interviewfriends suspect she will eventually take her own advice mr bloomberg is scheduled to leave office in three years

cardwellfeb   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story she has been the other half of new yorks ultimate power couple by day she regulates thousands of institutions in the nations financial capital while he owns a multibilliondollar business and runs a worldclass city by night she is his muchphotographed partner in the glittering social swirl and during crises like a transit strike she too hunkers down in the citys emergency command centerif new york prides itself on being an american city unlike any other its de facto first lady diana l taylor embodies that spirit a powerful woman with her own litany of accomplishments she breaks the mold of more traditional political couples with her unconventional longterm relationship with mayor michael r bloombergand recently ms taylor who is the states banking superintendent has found herself in an uncomfortable spotlight chosen by the white house to lead the federal deposit insurance corporation she had made it through several layers of scrutiny when her nomination collapsed for reasons that remain mysterious to this daybut if that episode created private difficulties for ms taylor it also highlighted the singular position she holds in the life of the city advertisement continue reading the main story we all have friends and know important people whose spouses or significant others are not as important as they are and this is a slightly sticky social wicket said the gossip columnist liz smith noting how people in polite society do not want to make a fuss over the famous one and ignore the other one continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story but she doesnt produce that effect because she seems so secure in her own right she continued shes not the little woman looking up at him  its not like nancy and ronniea woman who is far more animated discussing the arcana of the assessment of fees for her departments services than her famous relationship ms taylor is indeed secure in her own right with a privileged old greenwich conn upbringing she already holds a few ivy league degrees and is on her way to another this one in public health beginning on wall street she has built a highprofile career that includes according to her peers an overhaul of a oncemoribund state banking departmentshes smart and that always helps shes a hard worker she understands financial transactions and she understands priorities said robert m morgenthau the manhattan district attorney who has worked with ms taylor to prosecute fraudulent checkcashing businessesat the same time her relationship with the mayor is something of a novelty in government circles blending the rituals of a traditional political spouse with the contemporary realities of a postfeminist postsexualrevolution erashe is a frequent presence at mr bloombergs official and social events welcoming guests to his upper east side town house when he runs late hovering in the background at weekend news conferences and hopping from one stop to another throughout the city during campaign seasonits wonderful watching somebody whos so good at what he does do his thing she said in an interview last week adding that she gets to meet interesting people that way too im really proud of him and i love being part of itstill the question arises after nearly six years of dating and with all they have in common why have the two who are both divorced not married although mr bloomberg who declined to comment for this article has been known in private to make take my girlfriend please type remarks joking for instance that gov george e pataki should move the banking department to buffalo in public he appears devoted to his significant other last week he told reporters that he was skipping a white house banquet to celebrate ms taylors st birthday saying that has to be a very high priority on my list of things to do advertisement continue reading the main story for ms taylors part a mention of the mword causes her to purse her lips as if she had just swallowed cough syrup its been five and half years its great she said grimacing at saying even that muchms taylor is much livelier when speaking of just about anything else like her work bringing banks to lowincome neighborhoods that have none or the problems consumers face when banks without notice cover customers overdrafts but then charge usurious surprise feesor when she discusses her past like how when she was  she ignored her fathers warning and her boat capsized in frigid january waters her father refused to sail with her again for a decade she said laughing or when she discusses her regrets about not having children of her owni have two wonderful nephews she said showing a

to wharton business school her father worked as a biochemist at union carbide in new york settling the family in connecticutms taylor the oldest of three siblings grew up with many of the trappings of oldmoney privilege she began skiing at  raced sailboats rowed crew and played tennis and lacrosse she attended a steady stream of prestigious institutions including greenwich country day school the milton academy greenwich high school dartmouth and columbia and she went straight to work on wall street first at smith barney after completing her masters in business administrationbut she did not limit herself to the financial world in business school she worked part time at lutheran medical center in brooklyn and she is now on track to complete a masters at columbia in public health a field she plans to work in somedayshe also has worked for the long island power authority and keyspan energy and sits on several boards of nonprofit institutionsms taylors current employer the banking department regulates the mortgage industry credit unions and money service businesses like checkcashers and money transfer agents in addition to banks advertisement continue reading the main story since being appointed superintendent by governor pataki in  she has increased the policing of the money service businesses which can become outlets for tax evasion money laundering and the financing of terrorshe has also worked to educate consumers about the perils lurking in those businesses especially in communities across the state where they frequently are used in place of banksyoure really looking at a clientele that is for the most part not wealthy theyre living in areas that are underbanked they are probably immigrants she said theyre the most vulnerable of the population and these institutions provide a needed service and so its up to us to make sure that the services that are provided are what they think theyre gettingwhen mr pataki appointed her to the banking position there were rumblings that it was a political move prompted by her bloomberg connection but she has by most accounts proven her ability to do the jobbut for all her work in the banking field it is her relationship with the mayor that gets the most attention and that association has made her a frequent presence on the society pages the fashion world has taken note of her tooi had always been intrigued by her style and her poise and her intelligence said anna wintour who featured ms taylor in vogue after getting to know her through another mother at spence where ms wintours daughter attended often when you see women in political office or similar kinds of roles they feel like they always have to wear a boring suit or a pants suit nothing thats going to rock the boat she obviously doesnt have that fear of fashioneven though both ms taylor and mr bloomberg avoid discussing their relationship the picture she keeps of them on her office desk faces her not her visitors it has played out in public from the beginning they met when diana fortuna president of the citizens budget commission a businessbacked policy group seated the two next to each other at an eventand while the mayor has said that he is philosophically opposed to a second marriage he is willing to make the occasional significant gesture signaling the depth of their relationship this year it was ms taylor who sat in the front row at his inauguration in  it was susan bloomberg whom he divorced in indeed ms taylor does not shy away from the spotlight although the attention is not necessarily always welcome as her nomination to the fdic fizzled and became fodder for speculation that anger at mr bloomberg from interests like the national rifle association or the tobacco lobby had killed it she addressed it publicly only to a pointshe clearly preferred to let it go and move on fueled by a kind of optimistic fatalism that she sees even in the frustrations of learning to golf advertisement continue
