rated  out of  by bigdaddy from have you heard the one about the horse and the chicken this product is only sold on line most of the brooms i bought at my local home depot are very poor quality some of the thin metal handles have collapsed the plastic parts seem thin and crack easily and the bristles become distorted after normal usage i had high hopes for rubbermaid commercial products and the angle broom with aluminum handle yes the handle is good quality and will not collapse with use but the head is made of cheap plastic rubbermaid had decided to team up a work horse and a chicken the horse is too big for picking up worms and bugs the chicken will break its neck andor damage its feathers when forced to plow the field several of these broom heads broke at the thin plastic screw connection for the handle the bristles become distorted too soon especially when the broom is not hung up off the floor this broom head is good for cleaning fine dust and debris so the less expensive model with the thin wooden handle is a better value when the cheap plastic broom head breaks in the costly commercial model the handles can be reused and are great for painting that is why it gets a fair rating nevertheless it is not suited for commercial use as advertised date published  y m d h bvseobulk prodbvrr vnbulkhotfix cp bvpage cohasreviews tv tr loc sid prod sortsortentryorderrelevance
