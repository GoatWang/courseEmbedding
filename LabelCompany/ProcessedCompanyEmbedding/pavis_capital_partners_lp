the guarantees of the notes will be secured by a firstpriority lien on all of the fixed assets that secure the partnerships obligations under its secured hedge agreements and will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by most of the partnerships existing subsidiaries that guarantee obligations under its revolving credit facility and certain of the partnerships future subsidiaries  the partnership expects to use net proceeds from the offering to reduce outstanding borrowings under the partnerships revolving credit facility to terminate or cash collateralize certain of the partnerships existing hedging obligations and for general partnership purposes  the offering is expected to close on april   subject to customary closing conditions announced suspension in the

were from operating surplus   effect of a distribution from capital surplus  our partnership agreement treats a distribution of capital surplus as the repayment of the initial unit price from this initial public offering which is a return of capital the initial public offering price less any distributions of capital surplus per unit is referred to as the unrecovered initial unit price each time a distribution of capital surplus is made the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reduced in the same proportion as the corresponding reduction in the unrecovered initial unit price because distributions of capital surplus will reduce the minimum quarterly distribution after any of these distributions are made it may be easier for the general partner to receive incentive distributions and for the subordinated units to convert into common units however any distribution of capital surplus before the unrecovered initial unit price is reduced to zero cannot be applied to the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution or any arrearages   once we distribute capital surplus on a unit issued in our initial public offering in an amount equal to the initial unit price our partnership agreement specifies that the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reduced to zero our partnership agreement specifies that we then make all future distributions from operating surplus with  being paid to the holders of units and  to the general partner the percentage interests shown for our general partner include its  general partner interest and assume the general partner has not transferred the incentive distribution rights   excerpts on this pagek  sectionsmar  k  sectionsmar  kfeb  kmar  related topics for
