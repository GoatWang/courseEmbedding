services – bare metal standard request a quote get started request a quote name phone email company zip  postal code job description franchise opportunities call us  frequently asked questions about our serviceshome frequently asked questions about our services request job estimate question  why is cleaning the entire kitchen exhaust system importantanswer  cleaning the entire system is important because flammable substances like grease can contaminate ductwork throughout the system maintaining a clean kitchen exhaust system free of grease is a risk mitigation strategy exhaust systems are designed to contain a fire for  –  hours depending on the size of the building and local fire codes thus the amount of grease buildup that is acceptable and not considered a major fire safety hazard can be traced back to the amount of time it would take the grease buildup to burn off throughout the entire system the national fire protection association nfpa standard  is the governing body for kitchen exhaust cleaning frequencies and provides a guide for determining the acceptable number of days a system can go between cleanings the bare metal standard® kitchen exhaust cleaning service process sets each of your systems on a predictable rotating cleaning schedule upon the completion of each service cleaning the risk is thus mitigated cleaned consult your local bare metal standard® office to receive additional information on your kitchen exhaust system and how we can help keep it up to code and fire safe question  what exactly do you clean during a typical jobanswer the bare metal standard® cleaning process is specially designed to clean grease out of the interior of exhaust systems this includes the vent hoods from the filter tray up to the plenum and into the connecting ductwork some systems have minimal amounts of ductwork creating a simple system to service however the exact same hood installed in a different building could have extensive lengths of ductwork in both cases the complete system would be the hood all connecting ductwork included and the fan the pricing would then be different due to the large difference in connecting ductwork the most challenging prospect when investigating a system one which we are specially trained to discover and explain is the complexity of an exhaust system usually hidden from view after all when standing in two example kitchens they can have identical canopies hoods and identical cooking equipment under them but have vastly different duct lengths everyone can agree that cleaning one foot duct is very different from cleaning one foot duct with multiple twists and turns question  how often does my system need to be cleanedanswer there are  influencers to this question insurance requirements guidance from nfpa  chapter  authority having jurisdiction ahj enforcement procedures guidance from portions of nfpa  that have been adopted by the ahj’s type of cooking equipment your menu and cooking times design of the grease exhaust system the key to answering this question is to work closely with your bare metal standard® service professionals as a guideline for the minimum cleaning frequencies you can reference nfpa  table  schedule of inspection for grease buildup table  schedule of inspection for grease buildup type or volume of cooking inspection frequency systems serving solid fuel cooking operations monthly systems serving highvolume cooking operations such as hour cooking charbroiling or wok cooking quarterly systems serving lowvolume cooking operations semiannually systems serving lowvolume cooking operations such as churches day camps seasonal businesses or senior lefts annually in kitchens with multiple and independent kitchen exhaust systems it is common to have each system on its own cleaning schedule for example a steam hood will have a different rotation than a broiler however a solid fuel broiler will have a different rotation than a gas fired broiler if your kitchen exhaust service company is not asking you questions about your menu kitchen design and insurance requirements you may not be getting the coverage necessary to remain in compliance with the ahj andor your insurance carrier don’t let noncompliance result in fines andor uncovered losses question  will i need to schedule each appointment for cleaninganswer we know that our customers have a business to run so we’ve invested in developing scheduling software that allows our bare metal standard® professionals to proactively contact each customer prior to their recurring service dates this means that your bare metal standard® service professionals are notified of upcoming cleaning dates and we will contact you – prior to the due date – to setup an acceptable time for service additionally our scheduling software records your service history for you you can always request this information from your bare metal standard® service professional and then give it to your insurance company andor your ahj below you’ll find the recommended cleaning schedule according nfpa  table  schedule of inspection for grease buildup type or volume of cooking inspection frequency systems serving solid fuel cooking operations monthly systems serving highvolume cooking operations such as hour cooking charbroiling or wok cooking quarterly systems serving lowvolume cooking operations semiannually systems serving lowvolume cooking operations such as churches day camps seasonal businesses or senior lefts annually question  will the rest of my kitchen be left cleananswer your kitchen will be returned to you in the condition we received it our bare metal standard® service professionals will be trained and provided with the tools necessary to contain all of our cleaning activity our policy is to cover up all of your work surfaces mop our footprints out and leave filters in the negotiated location filters may or may not be cleaned depending on the sow agreement between the bare metal standard®

for our services is intensely and increasingly competitive and subject to rapidly changing cleaning technology and evolving standards in addition many companies in our target market are offering or may soon offer products and services that may compete with our services our current primary competitors generally fall into two categories large companies and small one man operations we expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the market as customer requirements evolve and as new products and cleaning technologies are introduced many of our competitors particularly large companies have longer operating histories significantly greater financial technical marketing distribution professional services or other resources and greater name recognition than we do in addition many of our competitors have strong relationships with our potential customers and extensive knowledge of the industry as a result they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging customers and changes in customer requirements increased competition may lead to price cuts alternative pricing structures or the introduction of products and services available for free or a nominal price we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and our business results of operations and financial condition will be harmed if we fail to meet these competitive pressures our ability to compete successfully in our market depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control some of these factors include ease and speed of service deployment and use an performance and scalability the quality and reliability of our customer service and support total cost of ownership return on investment for the customer any failure by us to compete successfully in any one of these or other areas will adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition moreover current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others by doing so these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers in addition our prospective indirect sales channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our competitors company description bare metal standard was incorporated in the state
