western zone table  these latest results continue to outline a broad zone of near surface shallow mineralization over a strike length of at least  metres and over a width of at least  metres which lies immediately west of the current designed pit perimeter figure   the western zone has two broad higher grade and structurally controlled stockwork quartz zones internally with grades above the  g t mill cutoff grade and is believed to have higher grade potential at depth  it appears the western zone remains open to the south west and at depth and is an immediate followup drill target for further potential resource expansion click to enlarge figure  map showing new western zone drill hole locations corvus gold inc    march   nr continued       jeff pontius president and ceo of corvus said the followup results from our drilling on the western zone have been encouraging and are outlining what appears to be a potential expansion of the main deposit to the west under shallow gravel cover  as this zone is still open in many directions its impact on any potential resource expansion is unconstrained at this point  for the past  weeks corvus has been testing our first group of new discovery targets away from the main deposit area and we are encouraged by the strength and size of the alteration systems we have been intersecting with initial results expected in the next few weeks  we are of the view that the more we work and drill on the north bullfrog project the more potential emerges for a major discovery table  phase ii drill results  western zones reported drill
