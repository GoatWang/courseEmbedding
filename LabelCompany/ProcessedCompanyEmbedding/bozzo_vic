work that you michael and do on behalf of pareteum and our stakeholders we appreciate you very much so thank you so good afternoon to everyone in the us and good evening for those who’re joining us from europe or asia i want to thank you for joining our call today for our q quarterly analyst and business update it’s really only been a few weeks since our townhall conference call and in my subsequent shareholder letter update but during that time we have made extremely notable progress and there are number of updates that we have for you today so with me on the call today are vic bozzo our ceo and ted o’donnell our cfo and following our remarks both vic and ted will join me in our qa session and it’s during that time that you’ll hear them comment on relevant points regarding our progress as we address your questions and provide our answers you have all hopefully had an opportunity to see the earnings release and the filed q so i’m not going to read that to you other than just noting a few what we think are important highlights we will offer additional comments during that qa session and we will invite your questions at that time so let’s get started as we entered in the first quarter of  following the what i consider to be very significant progress in our restructuring turnaround the refinements and improvements to pareteum are very much ongoing we expect to always be in a move that we refer to as make it better mindset i’m not surely what our derives from the pareto principle where we always focus on the small number of things that yield the greatest results much of the foundational work requires the focus on sales and growth within the business have been achieved in the quarter the business performed as expected this performance is the result of our efforts to solidify and streamline our financial foundation and continued a very highly disciplined financial stewardship at the company during the first quarter we focus significant efforts on software development and this was part of our software as a service or saas platform for global mobility and managed service platforms the new capabilities that were developed and are now being commercially offer were for services like g broadband and have been thought by our longtime customer vodafone and now because of that development become available on a global basis this is a meaningful opportunity for us we’ve also added advanced messaging to our capabilities by developing extremely powerful api capabilities that’s application programming interfaces these support the vast opportunities that we call the internet of things this simply means that the application and solution integrators in the world as well as developers can now use our software to build endtoend turnkey solutions you may know that this is how uber and whatsapp that’s just to name a few of the better known examples developed their business we intend to use our resources to identify and find that next future wave whether it’s a smart connected car or a smart home and the list really goes on and on and on it’s a great great opportunity to have in front of us as we execute on our mission of being value creators and we take this very seriously versus being the evisceration of value what we have seen in our company in the past it is this growing market of all things connected where billions of devices will require capabilities to communicate to meter that data usage to charge the data usage to build for that data usage and to report on what’s been monitored we call this service suite our applications exchange and development platform it is for the very broadly defined iot market and some of those vertical segments that i just mentioned who will use this service make no mistake this is a very vibrant new growth area for the company and then one that we’re very very excited about vic’s going to speak about this and some of the sales progress that we’re making with a number of our customer deployments and that will come up in a few minutes as noted in their earnings release the first quarter reflects results of our efforts to clean up our balance sheet this includes  million payment that was made to our senior secured lender atalaya a new agreement was reached with atalaya to make a very positive series of amendments to the existing debt arrangements we’ve also executed a number of transactions designed to simplify our capital structure and reduce or eliminate a number of the very complicated variable instruments that have been on our balance sheet for quite some time we’re building a business that we expect to better reflect its inherent and potential value and to deliver sustained results sustainability and dramatic growth requires more than just the leading edge technology that we’re very fortunate to have it requires talent leaders it requires strong leadership and strong relationships in the first quarter and into early april we were able to significantly bolster our executive and sales teams i’m very gratified that each of these individuals see our vision they see it as we build it and they’re helping build it these individuals recognize the potential ahead of us and they’ve chosen to join our company freely and willingly on this journey i’d like to now turn to some of our financial highlights and briefly touch upon a couple of things we reported in q  revenue of approximately  million that was compared to  million last year same quarter this decrease resulted from our sale of validsoft and our customers retail subscribers a seasonal churn our gross margins which are expressed as a percent of revenue increased from  to  and this is due to the direct reduction of cost during  our operating expenses were  million for the quarter decreasing  from the  million same quarter last year as a result of the companywide restructuring program implemented throughout  our loss from operations improved by  to a negative  million for the quarter compared to a negative  million loss in  our net loss per weighted common share average share was  and this was a fairly dramatic improvement by  from the  per share in  our adjusted ebitda in the quarter was a negative  and reflecting a  improvement from the negative ebitda of the negative  million reported last year collectively the atalaya amendments that i referred to earlier provide our company with significant flexibility to not only run and operate our business but starting in the second quarter significantly enhancing our cash flow by reducing our debt surfacing needs throughout  and  it’s our goal to continue to make demonstrable and operational progress and to maximize the value of this additional cash flow to further support the growth of the business i want to especially thank ted dan rios who’s our controller alex korff who’s our general counsel and our whole financial and corporate team for their continued hard work toward the success of our business which on their watch is underpinned by diligent financial and legal stewardship it is greatly appreciated by all of us gentlemen ted will have some comments during our qa as he address some of your questions now i have some very exciting news to announce and it is my great pleasure to speak about something that i think is a major milestone for us particularly when you look back over the last four years we’re acutely aware that you can’t cost reduce and expense save your way to growth and prosperity although i do think our team has done an extraordinary job in preserving the business through our actions to restructure and conserve cash but we all know we must sell things we must grow our top line revenue and that is why we’re especially excited by our first major new sales success the following headline will appear in a press release that will be issued before market opens tomorrow and i will read this to you pareteum enters brazilian mobile services market with sevenyear virtual network enabler agreement new services platform deployment to support the launch of multiple wireless brands and services ladies and gentlemen we’ve entered into an agreement with a very well established brazilian financial services and marketing company to provide mobile networking connectivity and subscriber management services which will support their plans to provide mobile connectivity and iot applications to retail and enterprise customers this is a major mobile virtual network enablement sale it is a major managed services platform sale in fact as we vic and i looked at this week i think it’s the first one since  this comes with significant longterm growth potential and this is forecasted by our new customer tomorrow’s press release is going to highlight the paid upfront service establishment fees and guaranteed recurring monthly service revenues that has a minimum total contract value up to  million approximately this upfront money is very important to us because it offsets the expenses related to installing and implementing our managed services in vne platform which again is the mobile virtual network enablement the more important element is this customer’s projection which we have examined and validated in our minds for future business and what this platform could unleash for pareteum in the future beyond our guaranteed minimum total contract value tcv our customer expects that over a threeyear period that we will be managing and collecting monthly recurring revenue for as many as  million subscribers and supported connected devices these customer forecasted subscriber volumes have revenue generating potential that gets to the eight figure dollar range that’s very significant to us this clearly has the potential to move our top line performance dramatically also we’ve been active in brazil as many of you may know for quite a while we’ve been working with an array of partners and potential customers we view this newly executed agreement and the implementation of our managed services platform in brazil as the milestone event that will let us leverage these past relationships we expect this newly opened opportunity to facilitate those relationships that have been established and potentially create incremental new growth in future revenues this is why we’re so very encouraged and why we have reasons to be optimistic not only about brazil but what this will mean throughout the rest of the world as we compete in the eyes of other major global carriers we will scale over the course of this agreement many of these relationships i specifically want to acknowledge the perseverance of vic rob mumby indiscernible and our whole spain based team that supported this transaction they know that we’re all in sales and these guys are sales warriors that includes nick and chris you know who you are and we’ve proven once again that it only takes a small number of real professionals to get the job done expertly so vic thank you and thanks to the team it doesn’t take  plus persons to do the job so this time i would like to now yield to vic bozzo for his brief comments on our recent business developments and then vic and ted and i will take your questions vic over to you vic bozzo thank you hal quite an exciting time inside pareteum as we continue to focus on our three sales initiatives which i’ll speak about our development and deployment teams have been hard at work as you recall we took on two new projects with vodafone in my experience after analyzing these requirements we delivered what amounted to be a oneyear project by all standards in less than four months and i’m happy to say our vodafone roaming project began loading new sims this month and our broadband project which you may have read about with vodafone’s recent press release and announcement will go live this month while we await the ramp of subscribers delivering this project on time and faster than industry norms is a great testament to our focus and a barometer of good things to come we’re making good progress on a global cloud mobility initiatives and moving to deploy live pronto sol and our latest internet of things customer themes on these sales initiatives i think the most important comment is the caliber of the people who have joined the company from industry leaders such as telio verizon british telecom and others the global connectivity cloud brings us into new markets as hal described we have a robust pipeline and i hope to be able to share even more news like brazil in the not too distant future thanks hal hal turner vic thank you so much and ladies and gentlemen with that we would like to open up for any questions or comments that you might have steve steve gersten operator can you queue through please questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and we will take our first question from lisa thompson of zack investment research lisa thompson so let’s talk about brazil in the morning when the press release comes out will we know some of the customers hal turner lisa we will not be announcing the customer’s name and i’ll tell you why it’s our experience that when we name the customer it makes them a target for competition and even though we have named in the past vodafone i wish i could have taken that name away in some degree so we will not be naming the customer because of the competitive sensitivity but i can tell you it’s a wellestablished financial services organization who has a number of subscribers and they’re leveraging their capabilities now to go fully into the mobile space lisa thompson so when you said they have subscribers what subscribers for what hal turner financial services covers a broad array of things so i don’t want to comment too much further than that but it goes everywhere from validation of transactions for payment systems to authorization also to security of financial and mobile payments they’re ideal for us quite frankly lisa thompson so does that mean they have customers reporting over to you or is this mv ph start up service that they’re going to offer that they never did as well hal turner it’s a new service for them but it does come with their existing relationship of pretty dramatically important city automation which is in the iot space it also comes with their relationship that has to do with churches and ecumenical offerings throughout brazil so we have expectation that the subscribers are going to follow rather quickly i would like to have vic place a comment on that simply because he’s been spending more time on this than i recently although i did spend some time in brazil vic would you like to further adders lisa’s question on this vic bozzo sure so the market is pretty explosive down there but the key is that very few people have connectivity to the actual operator who can provide the wireless service and we’re working with someone who’s connected the number one wireless company there so it’s a very strong group for us and it also enables us to bring all of our previous discussions into a beachhead platform for us so we’ll have full accessibility throughout brazil to bring any of our existing relationship as well lisa thompson i remember those traditionally from a few years ago i thought it was some there you’re going to have like the dioceses is going to use it for all their employees all the churches is that the same thing because you said financial services it sounds like it’s a don’t hal turner so goes ahead vic vic bozzo okay i was going to say that we’re seeing in the industry a blowing of the lines between what’s a subscriber so it could be everything from a point of sale machine that’s sitting inside of taxi cab all the way to a smartphone user who’s looking for a lower cost of service or looking to add broadband service so we’re seeing a wide range of opportunity there but we expect already have identified three to four mvnos let’s call brand specific mvno’s that are already ready to begin porting into the platform the key is getting the platform deployed lisa thompson okay great and could you give us an update like vodafone is able ph in the roaming business how are they doing vic bozzo sure actually business is quite strong what i referred to earlier in my comments was that this week vodafone announced that lowi as you know we powered lowi that lowi had added broadband services to the platform and that opens up the entire kind of what we would refer to here in the us is kind of the convergence of cable and mobile so it’s quite an exciting advancement and so we’re seeing opportunity there as well as multiple new mvnos that have come up hal turner and vic i think it’s fair to say for lisa that last week you and i spent the whole week in spain and with vodafone and the strategic meetings we had and was showing us their plans relative to not only the mvnos that they support off the platform that we power but the marketing programs for their brand certainly spell just basic increase in business that it’s expected this year and certainly into next year from vodafone as well as the vodafone roaming services application which go outside of spain lisa thompson thank you and maybe there has been indiscernible to be a q out yet and you said in the review that balance sheet on the press release can you talk a little bit about your current state of financing and if you see any more need for raising cash and then also vaguely what’s the full diluted share count out there now hal turner okay i’ll address topically the raised money cash questions and then i’ll yield to ted for the more specific answers we certainly have in our disclosure of both the k and q that we expect to raise more money in  our plan is certainly coming together so that we believe that the value of our company will be better recognized so we have no immediate plans for raising capital but we will at some point during this year be in the market based upon reflection of our higher value and based upon these sales i would also say that the austerity programs that we put in place as well as the accommodations that have been reached with atalaya give us much more runway with our cash and therefore give us some comfort in this as it relates to the specific share count it’s just under  million i think it’s like  and ted you want to expand on this and clarify any of the points that i might have inadvertently misstated ted o’donnell lisa also going to  asked whether technical difficulty  million and little bit below and that technical difficulty point out in relation to the cash and cash equivalent that you all have out there you go ahead and clear some of the cash technical difficulty balance lisa thompson right got it ted o’donnell as  million ph lisa thompson so you’re saying it’s  million shares fully diluted that’s like the all in number ted o’donnell that’s the whole lisa thompson okay and  million is the treasury stock or something hal turner issued and outstanding lisa thompson issued okay pronto shares though all right i guess that’s it is there anything you ought to know hal turner stay tuned lisa that sales pipeline is looking pretty robust according to vic and team and i’m pretty excited about it so we look forward to your future comments and questions thank you steve operator absolutely our next question will come from george indiscernible a private investor unidentified analyst hal and team so obviously congratulations on this deal in brazil obviously this is the first deal that saw the significant as it were i have a couple of questions about the deal which you would expect i would imagine you did state you’re getting some cash upfront as is the norm did i hear that correct if so how much is that please hal turner we’re getting cash up front and that amount is  and that comes to us in an initial partial payment and then as the system is churned up which is expected to be over four to six month balance of the cash comes and then the contract calls or minimum billing which escalates over a sixmonth period and that’s where the  million minimum contract value expectation comes from unidentified analyst thanks great deal congratulations again hal turner thank you unidentified analyst this deal seems to be very exciting not because of the size although that is exciting clearly but it sounds like it’s the first deal whereby it’s a genuine hybrid of some of our more traditional offerings and also the burgeoning and exciting world of iot am i thinking about that are they still in indiscernible here am i framing that correctly hal turner you’re george and if you would like for us to get vic to expand on that a bit we can but you’re absolutely thinking about it in the right way unidentified analyst okay all right so to me one of the reasons i’m an investor is because of the differentiation that the company offers encompassing more traditional areas plus the new burgeoning of iot so it sounds like this deal is a personification is an example of that my assessment is this is fairly accurate would you say on that hal turner it is accurate and you’ve touched upon a key element there which is the competitive differentiation and our ability to take that core basic software forward so the biggest differentiation is that we own and control the software and therefore we can open it up and create these application programming interfaces for developers and for solution integrators and that’s what leads it into the iot spaces smart cars connected car smart city smart meter smart and it goes on and on and on and so you’re absolutely thinking about it the right way and it is because we have virtualized this for cloud delivery that we can also offer the big platform like we’re doing in brazil but we can offer smaller versions of that and access on cloud basis at a greatly reduced price which will expand our market unidentified analyst okay very good just a couple more questions and i’ll jump back in the queue clearly the differentiating factor that the fact that the company owns its own ip for this is clearly very attractive so how should we be thinking about the existing and new pipeline of qualified opportunities this deal in brazil i’m sure it wasn’t overnight i know you and vic have worked your magic with mr mumby i’m sure i can smell some of the twilio activity there as it were how these new deals in the pipeline i’m guessing they take four to six even up to nine months how would you characterize the existing opportunities that are in the pipeline in terms of how long you’ve been at it i’m not looking for a forecast here and you do that internally i’m sure but i’m just trying to understand what the mix of those deals are are they similar  this brazil deal whereby it’s a mix of iot and traditional or some standalone iot it is very exciting for me i’m just trying to get my arms around it i’m trying to understand the pipeline does that make sense hal turner it does george so the first response is that there are several large deals in the pipeline that are of the same magnitude or similar magnitude for brazilian deal these larger deals are also of magnitude that could equate if not surpass over a few year period what we’re currently doing with vodafone so those are large managed services platform you’re correct that most of deals would take anywhere from six to month sales period the very good news is that the people we’ve recruited and including vic and his team came with some level of relationship rolodex and known opportunities has allowed us to leapfrog forward what could have been expected to be six to month period so therefore for the balance of the year we see at least another one large deal over the course of next couple months and i would say the balance of q and certainly into early q lot of dependencies on that but that’s what we’re aiming toward and we have visibility that could produce that result for the balance of the year beyond that we certainly see the opportunity for at least another one or possibly two large deals now beyond that we’ve got a number of what we call the global mobility cloud deals which cover the smaller operators you’ll remember names that we’ve announced such as sol mobile and pronto which are now beginning to come online they’re a lot more of those types out there as well as a generous mix of iot opportunities as characterized by the taxi cab application themes so it is a combination however the predominance of revenue will come from the managed service of the large platform for the balance of this year and in  we’ll begin to see the global cloud revenue show up in a percentile basis and certainly then followed by iot vic anything you want to add to that that i might have missed vic bozzo no i think it’s pretty comprehensive we do see that in each of these large mvno deals like brazil we do see as you point out george a combination of iot and traditional lowi type business on them and i think it’s safe to say that almost every mvne type managed service provider is going to go after all  comes all types of those businesses and what makes us very unique is that we enable them to do that from the same software platform so what we’re hearing is that they may have an mvne platform today but to add iot they got to go buy a different one and in our case the same one works for both unidentified analyst beautiful okay guys i’ll jump back into the queue i just want to say congratulations on the turnaround and it sounds like you guys are now having fun which makes me feel good as a shareholders so thank you for that thank you operator operator and our next question will come from brian cowell ph of rf indiscernible unidentified analyst so i wanted to i guess get an idea how this deal relates to your prior effort in the region and if that’s enhanced them at all and if you guys see sort of more fruition coming from those as well to this deal hal turner the answer bottom line is yes in all the ways i’m going to ask vic to expand upon that but clearly our former discussions with churches our former discussions with various integrator partners and companies such as cleartech and others will now be enhanced because of this vic do you want to put some color to that please vic bozzo yes so what i would say is interesting it’s probably the same across the world there is always a neck of the funnel pardon the pun there is always a place where everybody comes together even if they’re a marketing company or they’re network company and that is you need wireless access in the us we know there is very few people who can actually provide you with wireless access the same goes for brazil so in order for us to get many of those companies to have a place to bring their subscribers we first needed to work and sell our technology to a group that had access to the wireless network and that’s what this deal is really about it enables us to bring all of those other subscribers to the network unidentified analyst so it would be fair to call this sort of like hub and spoke model and is that fair to say you’re going to report this in other countries in that particular vein hal turner yes bottom line and deporting comes through the cloud which takes the price of access down dramatically vic bozzo and what i think also adds to the exciting nature of this is now that taxi cab that wanted  that has taxis not only in the us and singapore but also in brazil has a place to actually aggregate that same wireless connectivity and a platform to do it from so in a way we’re helping our customers as well to find more customers unidentified analyst and to your point out there you kind of just flipped in there that it creates sort of lower cost of access do you view i guess each person who access that sort of cloud or each data point to the cloud is that incremental margin to you i guess indiscernible hal turner yes absolutely in fact those will be the most profitable in terms of margins you’ll note from our financials that our margins increased from  to  as we’ve add more of these cloud deals those margins will actually go into the high s and could even go on the software portion up to into the s so it’s a real margin driver and it’s all incremental the basic is already been deployed by the way  go ahead vic bozzo this is effectively once you get the hub from that point on everything that you add which obviously makes the process a lot easier to all those folks that you start adding and all the sort of surrounding constellations ph around it are going to be significantly more profitable for the company so really you’re sort of sunk cost trying to find that hub where it’s going to be breakevenmoneylower margin but getting that anchor lead to significantly  margin on everything else hal turner absolutely spot on i was just going to make a comment one of the most amazing things in my mind is that thyngs thyngs customer the las vegas taxi cab that’s being served out of the netherlands our cloud pop out of netherlands so that’s a vivid example of the power of the cloud and what vic is referring to as a point where we can aggregate the wireless traffic unidentified analyst that’s added an amazing point actually i appreciate it guys and then congratulations again looking forward to following your continued success operator and our next question will come from dennis dolin ph private investor unidentified analyst and congratulations on everything you’ve done so far have been a longterm investor and i’m finally glad to see some positive things and management onboard my question really relates to the restructuring and the restructuring cost it looks like the cost have come down can you just give us an update as to where you stand in that process hal turner yes absolutely i’m going to ask ted to primarily comment on this but i would just simply say that the vast majority of the changes we have taken have already been done and the cost absorbed so the things we do at this point forward refinements so we don’t expect a significant amount of going forward restructuring cost ted you want to add some color to that and maybe a little more flavour for dennis ted o’donnell yes the largest pieces completing q if you go back and look at those financial statements you’ll go ahead and see the  all the technical difficulty part of that’s goodwill and intangibles all those things were written off and impairment technical difficulty in the fourth quarter technical difficulty see these things as they have technical difficulty grew through the third quarter technical difficulty add back the first technical difficulty you can see as far as how that’s going to end on technical difficulty for maximum share of value technical difficulty unidentified analyst great thanks very much hal turner thank you dennis by the way one analyst published last year referred to everything but the kitchen sink went into restructuring cost in write down so i think we’ve got most of it taken care of operator operator instructions our next question will come from greg randall a private investor greg randall i just had two clarifying questions the baseline revenue for that particular deal  million would that be over of seven years hal turner that is a minimum over seven years and that’s the combination of the upfront fees and the monthly minimums so let me just give you a point of fact those monthly minimums are very synonymous to the same monthly minimums that we experienced with vodafone when we started and with zain when we started and in every case there is a threshold that will be reached in reasonably near time with the subscribers and the monthly billing for to support of those subscribers will began to far outweigh the monthly minimums that’s why we’re so bullish on the upside of the contract versus focusing just on the  million total contract minimum value greg randall thank you the q is not out and i’m just wondering was there any deferred revenue component in your q and if there was was it any different from basically q ted o’donnell there was some deferred revenue in q we had net revenues in excess of billing which is a little bit different from deferred revenue deferred revenue is we go ahead and see cash ahead of technical difficulty so as far as difference there technical difficulty and receive some indiscernible folks from vodafone and technical difficulty greg randall that was q correct ted o’donnell technical difficulty greg randall very good thank you gentlemen appreciated operator and our next question will come from howard weinberg private investor howard weinberg congratulations particularly to vic i guess on this new deal in brazil my question is i don’t believe it was answered in the other narratives but why is it important for you to global business global cloud business and not just sell to them mobile virtual network enablers customers if you will hal turner vic you want to handle that one please vic bozzo sure i’ll take it thank you so there’s many types of wireless applications as we know hal has mentioned in connected cars wifi hotspots atms taxis interactive billboard all of these devices have a wireless sim just like your phones those wireless sims must have connectivity but they also need someone to meter it bill it monitor it and charge on behalf of the carrier that’s really what we do as i said before it’s same software that we use for both but by adding the cloud version of our platform it enables us to prospect as hal said anywhere in the world and whereas in the past we had to affectively find and build operate and transfer a full package every time we identify the customer in this case we can literally turn them on from wherever they are in the world there’s more of those that type of applications than there are of the brazil mvne applications but generally they’re faster time to make and when you cascade them together you get massive amounts of subscribers as well so every time we bring up one of these mvne situations like brazil we also open of opportunity to anybody in the world who might have an application that needs to run in brazil hal turner vic howard can i just one brief analogy it’s like the mvne platform in brazil that’s like going to savile row it’s whole cloth it’s cut made to order many custom the global cloud is alterations off the rack and it’s a lot less expensive and allows us to get to a lot more people that’s the primary difference howard weinberg got it so the second part renewed so how do we see the percentage of business between the two in the future indiscernible and the mvne hal turner almost  of our revenue this year slightly less will come from the mobile virtual network enablement platform that’s the vodafone’s and the brazil’s and those applications as we move into the fourth quarter this year you’ll begin to see the pronto’s and the sol mobile’s began to come on board it will not be materially meaningful to the total revenue this year but as a percent next year we’re hoping to get that into the  to  range we would like to see the iot revenue certainly in the  to  range our overall goal over the coming three years would be to take the global mobility cloud up to at least  to  of the total revenue and that will also have the effect of taking the revenue concentration that dependency that we’ve got on vodafone and zain at this point so the best of all worlds in news is that vodafone is buying more from us the challenge for that is we’ve got to outsell the vodafone revenue growth with iot and global mobility to make sure that investors understand that we’re managing the risk in the business howard weinberg got it thank you operator and our next question will come from tom cruise ph of dawson jane ph unidentified analyst congratulations on the brazil deal that sounds very exciting my question is actually about the thyngs deals here in the us and could you give us more on that deal and what your expectations are hal turner absolutely and i’m going to let vic go through it but i think you’re going to be very impress to understand that we’re powering those screens in the back of taxi cab and with our technology we’re going to be able to put wifi in there too so vic you want to talk about it vic bozzo so you can imagine when you get in the car number one i would say that when you think about las vegas for example that’s one area that this opportunity is global in nature and its global in nature because it’s a similar concept it’s a similar company and the company and the company is already actually providing these services in other places the main key and the main challenge for anybody who’s doing this kind of global business is that the need to negotiate individual beholds ph every time they go to a different country right so they may offer the same platform the same screen the same point of sale machine which is when you put your card in that machine and that charges you you need metering and billing and you also need wireless access so you can imagine if they do that in more than one place they need a network that can do that for them and that’s really the importance of building the network connectivity of having someone in brazil as an example that allows us to allow that company to go into the market so in general we’re providing a platform and we’re also providing the wireless connectivity similar to the way we do for speakup in netherlands as an example and the advantage of the call is that we can run it from anywhere and so we were able to leverage our capex that we spent to build that platform out in the netherlands already unidentified analyst so you could see this not only in the us this could go worldwide with the taxi cab industry though vic bozzo absolutely it’s already in progress unidentified analyst well that sounds like it’s bigger than uber though hal turner well it could be vic bozzo well the opportunity yes unidentified analyst if you think about it vic bozzo yes the opportunity the levers that across other industries is really what makes us exciting and part of these are i view these as they’re case examples of what’s going on potentially in mass transit what’s going on in the smart city what’s going on with the bank who has to monitor all their atms as an example anything you can think of that has wireless device is going to need someone like us to make that metering and charging happen and bridge that for some of the service providers as well unidentified analyst great thanks very much hal turner tom thank you steve i think we’ve got time for one more question before we have our wrap up comments operator and our final question will come from john philip a private investor john philip can you hear me hal turner yes john it’s hal how are you john philip i’m good hal thank you i want to thank you guys you have a great vision for this business obviously for setting that vision that’s our first that what gives us shoot for my question is more basic and it’s  while i admire the vision on the rate ph bar survival and i’m just going to ask about the sequential revenue change where it looks like we lost  in quarterly revenue from q to q and if you could share with us what we lost what type of business did we lose from q to q for that revenue growth hal turner okay so very straight forward the revenue drop is due to two factors but the sequential is really focused on the retail customers of our customer vodafone in spain so during the holiday portion of the year there is always a fair significant end of year promotion where they’re giving special deals to add a line special deals for data packages special deals for voice packages and this is in anticipation that people are calling more relatives throughout the world this sort of thing so it is a loss of that on a seasonal basis that has had some impact on that sequential quarteroverquarter loss but there is a more fundamental piece to this and that fundamental piece is the simple fact that both lowi which is the second brand of vodafone as well as some of the vodafone mvnos that operate in spain notably lebara and others clearly they did not experience growth as they had in the past it is this broadband product set that will reignite the growth in lowi and that’s what i vaguely refer to as some of the expansion forecast that vodafone has provided us also lebara who is really an ethnic focused market operator in spain they have been able to negotiate through vodafone and gotten some additional product capability and speed capability and pricing capability that will allow them to grow again they have notified us of a large marketing promotional event that they will start in the summer run throughout the third quarter so those are the two primary reasons one is the seasonal loss of retail customer revenue because of the promotions and second the slowing of growth of those operators that i mentioned who operate also with our platform but now we believe the renewed vigoring growth that’s coming from a number of initiatives including our product and also pricing that vodafone is offering vic you want to add to that vic vic bozzo no i think that’s very  kind of sums it up but we also are working very hard with them as they launch new initiatives and candidly the vodafone roaming service is a global mvno nature so gives us lot more access to lot more subscribers john philip so i guess so to the best of your knowledge there is no  it’s nothing to do with pareteum or the service that was  have led to the reduction in rev it’s more of vic bozzo no in fact our service levels actually have exceeded our previous year in terms of our their acknowledgement of our kpis john philip great okay thanks guys appreciated operator and ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today’s questionandanswer session i would like to turn the call back over to mr turner for any additional remarks mr tuner you may proceed steve gersten indiscernible we lost hal operator he’s still connected i’m showing steve gersten hal are you there vic bozzo steve would you like to me to give the final closing steve gersten yes vic bozzo okay so my final thoughts we’ve spoken at length in the past about the many ways we’re working to build our company your company as we see it certainly some of these things like our latest contract are more visible and immediately identifiable than others the actions we’re taking will contribute to the success and breakthrough i also want to reaffirm my pledge to you that the entire organization is fully committed and supportive of the go forward plan and attaining demonstrable result and sustained growth realization of our vision includes sustaining our competitive advantage and creating great value it is the longterm we’re focused on it is especially comforting and encouraging to know that many of our most important customers and partners including vodafone and atalaya are fully committed and standing with us we continue to advance our business and we’re making progress in the nearly every important metric kpis as we call it we can track but beyond hard numbers we shouldn’t overlook some of the intangibles for example why are customers like vodafone committed to our business why are they choosing to grow with us why our new customers both established operators and entrepreneurial companies such as thyngs indiscernible fox ph looking to us as a key enabler of their business why are we able to attract the kind of industry talent we have and that we expect to join our company as we grow to us the answer is clear the markets we’re addressing are vast and is a state of fundamental change and pareteum brings together the vision all things connected the technology built almost wholly on our own software and the ability to deliver value people solutions pricing service quality services roadmap to the markets and customers that we serve our goal now is to continue to move the business forward maintaining a disciplined approach to business management capitalizing on the global trends driving a connected world as we succeed we’re confident in our ability to create value for all of our stakeholders and realize our vision any connected device communicating anytime anywhere on demand thank you hal turner vic don’t conclude yet i’m back i’m sorry i got cut off but ladies and gentlemen you just heard the best example of team mates and team work period because i cut off and without missing a beat vic build in so thank you very much this does conclude our call we very much appreciate it look forward to hearing from you and we intend to have another chairman’s letter out somewhere toward the end of june sort of midquarter update on how we’re doing in the meantime look forward to your support thank you very much operator and once again ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today’s conference we thank you all for your participation

the call over to mr hal turner executive chairman of pareteum hal turner vivian thank you very much and good morning to everyone thank you all for your time and your interest in our company as mentioned with me on this call today are vic bozzo our chief executive officer and ted odonnell chief financial officer and following our remarks both vic and ted will join me in our qa session  was the year dedicated to executing our restructuring plans and turning around the business for what we think is sustained profitability and growth its clear to us that based on recent developments and the continued positive momentum building for our company that we have made materially significant progress in  we now are entering  with a more stable and robust platform and its one that is well positioned to capitalize on the major trends that are now impacting global communications and thinking about  and our outlook and as we look toward  we acknowledge the apparent disconnect among with the market the opportunities we see for our company and our well thought out plans to execute on these opportunities and the recent market movements while we share all of our frustrations our frustrations are amplified given the potential that we know exists that which we understand is addressable and upon which we are executing as resources permit us to the management team and board of pareteum are continuing to operate with a sense of urgency to execute and to deliver we remain deeply committed to creating values for continued vision execution of our plans to achieve what we see as sustainable accretive operating and financial results we are on that pathway that ive described just as we said we would be at this juncture in our businesses turnaround in  we believe that we have turned the page our business is going where it needs to be going vic will very soon elaborate on our further progress but let me provide you with just a couple of highlights first of all we have new logos and new brands that are positioned to come onboard these are not just the organic growth from our two largest customers we have nearly tripled the sales pipeline with extremely well qualified opportunities so since vic joined the company in mid q of  and began building the professional sales team i believe its impressive performance in just four months secondly weve opened up attractive new service segments that we are assertively addressing these include the internet of things iot these include enterprises and these include a broader population of communication service providers and it is our carrier customers that are driving us in this direction thirdly we led continued development in implementation progress on our announced transactions these included partnerships for brands for advertising or lte technology and geographic market segments these things will drive revenue finally weve recently announced four new sales agreements we had a key carrier customer to give us a global roaming enablement to you we had an important addition of content streaming media capability to a major carrier mvne customer we had an allimportant iot technology enablement transaction and we had a focused subscriber and a multicountry network enablement agreement between india and the uk its  vic and his team have performed exceedingly well despite having almost no resources available to fuel our growth vic i want to thank you and i mostly want to thank all of our spain based netherlands based uk based and middle east based team members who continue to perform well as we recover our business as i think about the growth strategy that were on for  thats a hard of all of these activities its the growth strategy that will take us in the  and well beyond on our third quarter call weve talked about this as a three prong strategy and were leveraging this as our software service platform to address the back office for every one itq now very well understand back office means to us metering charging and billing and this is leverage that platform for the mobile virtual network enablement needs of three very distinct segments number one the communication service providers these are carriers like vodafone of which there are almost  throughout the world these communication service providers are in great need of our managed services platform which is tailored to meet their specific needs secondly these are global mobility cloud platform service this is bringing turnkey solutions to the enterprises and smaller communication service providers and finally strategy is addressing the application and exchange platform service these are folks towards what we see as thousands of service providers application developers solution integrators who are providing application integration opportunities for other mobile virtual network operators iots and enterprises i wanted to press ph for just a moment because this is where the market opportunity explodes in our viewpoint and this is where we will likely see the replication of those who are using our services of the strategies that have created companies like uber these are companies that have great potential however the uberization if you will of telecomm and new market services will extend it to virtually every facet of our lives this will come about and will likely be the cause of all things being connected and the fundamental need for this metering charging and billing capability which is uniquely meet by our refined software its more than just connected cars which we all hear about its ecosystems that has millions of individual components of seamlessly communicated act think about connected villages think about smart cities think about smart ports smart campuses smart hospitals smart anything thats where were taking this business as we look at all of these strategies we have different sales cycles and the sales cycles for us is nothing more than the pathway to revenue generation from our subscribers and this can vary anywhere from  months down to  months for the larger managed services deals and again these are sold to global carriers to just a few months with our global cloud services mobility platform and this is sold to the smaller carriers and the enterprises vic and i believe that the holy grail of our plans include ondemand selfservices completely from a web interface using our global cloud services mobility platform for application and exchange services again this is where were driving the business it is these strategies with their differing sales cycles which deliver for us a balanced approach for profitable sales growth and most importantly for forecasting our ability for attaining reasonable and sustainable predictable wins as we look at our pipeline for  we have reasonable visibility and pretty good expectation for new sales transactions to close in the near to midterm and for us that means the next one to three quarters this visibility and transparency is balanced against several variables and the most important of those is the size of some of these customers therefore as we think about targeting the exact timing of signing an agreement its always both past and present and very challenging exercise to do that at best so we choose not to compromise our negotiating position or our competitive position by any perceived need to prematurely announce any particular deal with our growth strategy taking route and our sales prospects very positively increasing weve added a new independent director to our board luis jimeneztuñon luis is a very highly qualified senior executive who comes from within our industry he has first  knowledge of pareteum and where were taking this business the addition of luis has already had positive impact for us particularly in europe and the middle east we also intend to add new senior sales operational product and financial staff we believe that these new additions indicate that those who are closest to the marketplace and to the industry fully realize the opportunity and the longterm potential that we are set to realize and the immediate transactions which we have before us in coming months in addition the executive management team and board of pareteum have also put our skin in the game ph the executive management team including ted vic and i plus two of our independent directors yves van sante and indiscernible participated in a private offmarket transaction to acquire an agreement  shares of common stock at the presplit price of  which is a postsplit price of  this was a conscious decision on our part despite the somewhat predictable and custom area market behaviors that often follow a reverse split or a widely marketed public offer ph our team also intends to acquire additional shares of company stock subject to sec in new york stock exchange regulations so at this point with this brief overview id like to yield to vic who is going to give you additional color on the market opportunity and a more granular view of our managed services our global mobility and our application exchange platforms vic over to you please vic bozzo thank you hal and good morning to all we have a large market opportunity in front of us ive watched the telecommunications industry reinvent itself over and over for the last  plus years i joined this company specifically because the market is making it change again with the advent of voiceoverip and new applications that we now use to communicate via voice and text the business has revolutionized again its clear that in the future wireless eats everything everything simply must be connected and every time these connections occur they must be metered charged reported and built there will only be a few companies like ours who can capitalize on this based on their technology the people the global reach industry knowledge and most of all timing in the last four months ive had the opportunity to analyze the technology and see it virtualize very quickly and port it to the cloud therefore im proud to cooperate here a solid contender for the market leadership position on the back of our technology and services platform weve been able to track new people to the company who have successful backgrounds in the wireless internet and retail telecommunications industry we recently made announcements bringing in top talent from the likes of vodafone verizon and bt and more to come these people share our vision and see our opportunities weve also seen new customers join the cloud and we see new partners seek to join us in the endeavor of connecting our technology and our partners networks to more and more subscribers whether they are mobile phones or simply just a wireless device its in fact hard to think of anything that is not connected wirelessly anymore this goes from industrial applications supply chain home car even the grocery store and a taxi cab were expanding our sales force globally and touching all points of the world now we recently participated in the mobile world congress which was attended by over a  delegates which shows the strength of the mobile industry and we have several new exciting events coming up around the globe this quarter we believe we can not only drive our thought leadership but also product and service leadership in fact right now were participating in  new proposals and rps around the globe as we continue to invest in our sales force well be able to attack more and more of those opportunities remember our business is aggregating subscribers onto our platform on the heels of two additional contracts we signed with our largest customer last quarter our optimism as we shift to the growth space is shared amongst the whole company and we truly are a global company we believe new partnerships with folks like air fox which seeks to monetize data usage through advertising new cloud customers who can access our platform from anywhere in the world very rapidly and new emerging markets which seek to capital on the trending upside of mobile virtual networks are all within our site we look forward to providing you with updates on the progress as we make it in and let me turn the call now over to ted for a review of  results and operating activities ted odonnell thank you vic good morning everyone  was the year in which we worked to transfer the business operationally and financially putting us on a path for stable growth in the future here are our  financial highlights q  performance yielded revenue for the fourth quarter for the year ended  totaling  million and  million respectively compared with  million and  million for the same periods previously much of the quarteroverquarter and fourth quarter decrease in revenues attributable to divesture a balance off after sales in q  however revenue for the quarter of  million is  above our earlier expectations of q of  million a revenue run rate now  million decrease in yearoveryear revenues primarily attributable to the loss of the ucl ph contract including the forward lease deferred revenue  million in  and as well compensation paid by ucl ph in june  for the termination of the contract at the end of fourth quarter  and  annualized revenue per employee was  to and  respectively with fulltime equivalents for  and  up  and  respectively gross margins have increased on a quarterly basis from q  through q  from  and q  to    and  respectively cost of sales and product development sales and marketing were reduced during  by  million from comparable  expenses restructuring cost todate totaled  million or  and  for  and  respectively actual reported expense savings during  and  totaled  million adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter was  positive versus previous losses in the first three quarters of  after the crossover from breakeven at the end of the third quarter with the saleabouts adjusted ebitda increases have also sequentially on a quarterly basis increased from q  through q  over the last four quarters or five quarters rather we have increased from quarterly losses of  million to  million to  million to  then  in q of  as a result of our restructuring efforts of note weve completed all the reductions in overhead without materially impacting customer services support levels in fact our services level has actually improved with our customers and their kpis during the course of  turning to our balance sheet cash and cash equivalents on hand december  were  customer payments existing cash and restricted cash held by our senior secured lender should be sufficient to meet our senior secured lender requirement of  million in both march  and june  and we could have the required liquidity to pay our debt service requirements near term up to and through the q principal repayments we will continue to go ahead negotiate favorable terms with our lenders and preferred shareholders who have continued to work with us in the spirit of solving the challenges that mutually impact our company we make great progress in cleaning our capital structure this activity so far is expected to continue in  as we work through overhangs in the indiscernible in both q of  and q of  we converted preferred and convertible notes in the common shares expected to seeing this process through  to simplify our capital structure during  the company restructure cost first increased margins reduced cash burn attained adjusted ebitda positive in q  and set the upper trend line towards ebitda positive in  we look forward to continue these efforts relating to finetuning our cost structure while we reorganize our balance sheet with that let me turn the call back over to hal hal turner ted thank you very much and were now ready to take a few questions operator if you would open the call to questions please questionandanswer session operator operator instructions well take our first question from peter ph with dawson james please go ahead unidentified analyst hey hal operator yes sir your line is open unidentified analyst can you hear me operator yes sir please go ahead hal turner yes we can hear you unidentified analyst good im looking at the breakdown of the payments to lia ph you had a  million at the end of this month which is pretty much showing and you got another  million at the end of june and you got another  million at the end of it this  million is raised as far as im concerned ridiculous prices but does that cover pretty much the end of the year or we didnt have to raise more money hal turner ted over to you ted odonnell what were going ahead within looking at  like i went ahead and just said  is we continue to look at our existing cash and restricted cash held by our senior secured lender would that be sufficient to go ahead and meet the requirements there well have the required liquidity to pay our debt service for now and into the future we will always go ahead were a growth company youll always go ahead and opportunities presented to us and are looking forward to growing the company primarily this year and while continuing to go ahead and clean up our balance sheet with that id like to go ahead and thank everyone for dialing in and turn it over for final comments to hal if he would like to go ahead and make any final comments hal turner okay thank you no more questions i presume then all right thanks a lot ted in closing i just want to leave you with a couple final thoughts weve substantially completed our restructuring and advanced the turn around we demonstrated that by these reported results the capital infusion the amended debt agreement which is well under way and the inclusion of new industry leaders as a board member new management and sales executives plus the growing roster of clients and prospective clients and partners attaining the adjusted ebitda breakeven at the end of q  was a specially hardfought battle for many reasons the situation from q  was much more deteriorated and had been immediately evident our team work tirelessly on behalf of all stakeholders to carry forward witness progression of this ebitda thats been noted by ted operating q in a modest adjusted ebitda positive level was equally challenging for many reasons during  we intend to invest in growth to capture what we think is the continued vibrant market opportunity thats available to us this may likely cause both positive and negative adjusted ebitda results during individual months and quarters but we persevered from q  through  to literally save this company and we will continue to do so as we move forward weve brought on these new and highly experienced team members expanded our board because they are committed to our success and have invested in our business with us were fortunate to have the executive leadership of vic bozzo in every respect hes a great partner and i certainly honor that hes a cofounder of this new business pareteum and that together along with our boards full endorsement vic and i recruited ted odonnell as our cfo and business partner we have good people and strong teams in this company thats in madrid indiscernible the netherlands uk and the middle east  others will join and we think this is the beginning of our movement where team spirits are high as thats been noted we continue to receive the clear support of our largest client vodafone who have demonstrated their commitment to our platform as a key enabler for their future growth and strategy however we can never take this for granted the right to be a partner with vodafone and all of our customers frankly has to be earned everyday through development delivery support of quality services and the demonstration of our companys financial stability and sustainability this is especially where our stakeholders and shareholders are key to the future success of pareteum we believe our global cloud services bring immediate value to our customers our customers want what we are selling the market opportunity is expanding vic and i will look at this in detail and we see a potential for a total available market  a tam if you will  of  billion by  subscribers are no longer just people subscribers are both people and devices that we want to bring on to our network all things connected any device anytime anywhere this is where our brave new world of pareteum is taking us in opportunity building on this progress that weve made from november  which was a low starting point in carrying forward to  were confident in our ability to
