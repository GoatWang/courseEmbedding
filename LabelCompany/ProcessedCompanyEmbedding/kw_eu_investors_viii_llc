with each other and consult with the grc scientists in problemsolving and teambuilding activities the program allowed kws to engage with the community in a way that was exciting and meaningful for kws professionals both in st louis and via teleconference in einbeck not only did this program meet the needs of   and yearolds looking for realworld experience in the science industry it also engaged kws
