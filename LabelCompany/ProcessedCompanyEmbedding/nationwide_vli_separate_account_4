section b applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section b of the  act exempting them from the provisions of section a of the  act to the extent necessary to permit them to

knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company pursuant to section a of the act the section b applicants may be considered affiliates of one or more of the portfolios involved in the substitutions because the substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and subsequent purchases of shares and by means of inkind transactions the substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates  section b of the act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a if the evidence establishes that the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the act and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act  based on the facts presented above section b applicants submit that the terms of the inkind transactions including the consideration to be paid and received are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching because i the contractowners contract values will not be adversely impacted or diluted and ii section b applicants agree to carry out the inkind transactions in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a and the procedures adopted thereunder except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash thus section b applicants conclude that the purposes intended by implementation of the rule are met by the terms of the inkind transactions  in support of this position section b applicants assert that the proposed inkind transactions will be effected based upon the independent current market price of the portfolio start printed page securities as specified in rule ab and will include only securities for which market quotations are readily available on the substitution date in accordance with rule ac section b applicants assert that the proposed inkind transactions will be consistent with the policy of each registered investment company and separate series thereof participating in the inkind transactions as recited in the relevant registered investment companys registration statement and reports as specified in rule ad the application states that no brokerage commission fee except for any customary transfer fees or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the proposed inkind transactions likewise section b applicants represent that trusts board of trustees has adopted and implemented the fund governance and oversight procedures as required by rule ae and f the application also states “pursuant to rule ae during the calendar quarter following the quarter in which any inkind transactions occur the trusts board of trustees will review reports submitted by nfa in respect of such inkind transactions in order to determine that all such inkind transactions made during the preceding quarter were effected in accordance with the representations stated herein” finally applicants represent that a written record of the procedures

to legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of its business the companys legal and regulatory matters include proceedings specific to the company and other proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which the company operates these matters are subject to many uncertainties and given their complexity and scope their outcomes cannot be predicted regulatory proceedings could also affect the outcome of one or more of the companys litigation matters furthermore it is often not possible to determine the ultimate outcomes of the pending regulatory investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty some matters including certain of those referred to below are in very preliminary stages and the company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs claims for liability or damages in some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions the court has not yet decided whether a class will be certified or in the event of certification the size of the class and class period in many of the cases the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief including punitive damages and equitable remedies which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available the company believes however that based on currently known information the ultimate outcome of all pending legal and regulatory matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the companys condensed consolidated financial position nonetheless given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that such outcomes could materially affect the companys condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or annual period the various businesses conducted by the
