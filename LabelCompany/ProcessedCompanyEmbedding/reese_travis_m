of orange leaf frozen yogurt “america’s frozen yogurt” by franchise chatter on august   in executive profile franchise chatter exclusive frozen yogurt franchises q  a interview before you even consider investing in a frozen yogurt franchise take the time to learn what it really takes to succeed in this business  click here ambrosio’s note  orange leaf frozen yogurt is a fairly recent discovery of mine  while doing some research on the ‘net i stumbled upon a personal blog that had a comprehensive list of frozen yogurt franchises both national and regional  i was very impressed with what i read about orange leaf so i wrote about them in a blog post which turned out to be very popular from day one sensing a lot of interest for more information on orange leaf i reached out to the company and thankfully their ceo reese travis accepted my invitation to do an exclusive interview with franchise chatter  i must say that orange leaf is one of the most professional and responsive franchises i’ve worked with for these interviews and to me that speaks volumes this is a terrific interview worth your time and i hope you all enjoy it curious about orange leaf frozen yogurt’s revenue potential item  fdd  click here reese travis has five years of medical sales experience at depuy orthopedics johnson and johnson’s orthopedics implant company where he was recognized for sales excellence two years involvement with private equity and hedge fund groups and one year as an orange leaf franchisee  in  reese and a group of investors bought out the original owners of orange leaf and have since the grown the chain from  stores to  and counting reese travis ceo of orange leaf frozen yogurt   what made you decide to purchase orange leaf frozen yogurt it all started in  when my fatherinlaw took me to an orange leaf store in edmond oklahoma i remember him saying “it’s a great atmosphere great product it’s appealing to the masses let’s buy it” we did our research and the more we learned the more intrigued we were so a group of friends and family put some money together and we were off as franchisees we quickly opened one store in norman and another in lawton with others not far behind my partners and i could see the industry growing before us so we approached the owners about buying the entire company we knew we were buying a great product that was extremely competitive in the marketplace and we have been expanding our presence nationally ever since when we started orange leaf had  stores and now just a year later we are up to  stores in over  states with  more coming soon   why should someone interested in owning his or her own business consider a frozen yogurt franchise in this economy people aren’t taking as many vacations or spending a lot of money on entertainment but they’re still going out as families to enjoy time together over frozen yogurt it’s an affordable treat and it’s not going anywhere any time soon for franchisees that means a reliable business and an investment they can feel good about my partners and i chose orange leaf because we saw the value in teaming up with a group that was selling a proprietary product in a fastgrowing market franchising in general is a great option for investors because the hard work has been done for you corporate has already put in the time and effort to do solid market research test what works and what doesn’t and most importantly build a good company track record all you have to worry about is executing a successful business model being an orange leaf franchisee is great because it allows you to be a part of a brand that’s bigger than yourself you get to represent both the brand and the community by having a direct impact on the market without sacrificing customer interaction   what sets orange leaf frozen yogurt apart from your competitors in the frozen yogurt industry we don’t just call ourselves america’s frozen yogurt — we are america’s frozen yogurt we’ve got flavors people recognize and our proprietary product has the same smooth and creamy texture we have all come to expect in an american frozen dairy treat it’s a healthier dessert alternative that reaches across all demographics and satisfies every sweet tooth   what qualities do you look for in a prospective franchisee we screen our potential franchisees very carefully we are looking for franchisees with a real interest in being handson owners who are enthusiastic and communitydriven they have to be passionate about our brand and committed to maintaining its integrity   can you describe the ideal territory and neighborhood for an orange leaf frozen yogurt franchise orange leaf is a communityminded familyfocused establishment that strives to be a positive addition to every neighborhood we serve we have yet to find a location where people don’t want a fun friendly place to spend time with each other — without spending a lot of money the selfserve yogurt industry is trendy but it’s not a fleeting craze we’ve created a sustainable business model and superior product that is sure to outlast the competition in any market we enter   based on your observations what concrete steps do your most successful franchisees take in order to build and grow their businesses the most successful franchisees are motivated by their customers’ positive experience they see their business as a way to reach out and serve the community more than just frozen yogurt orange leaf is particularly focused on providing franchisees a model for hosting charity events and fundraisers to boost local morale i love this company but it would be for nothing if we didn’t use it to better the communities we serve we’ve had so many franchisees doing great things we even started a blog to keep track and spread the word in joplin they passed out free yogurt to storm victims volunteers and emergency response teams in bossier city they set up a donation for a tragically ill yearold girl and her family we are proud of our franchisees for taking initiative and representing orange leaf in such a positive way   what kind of ongoing support do you extend to your franchisees to help them become more successful we partner with our franchisees from the onset making ourselves readily available for anything they may need to be successful once they’re through the application process we bring out potential franchisees to oklahoma for “discovery day” where they meet the corporate staff and get a feel for how we do things we want them to become selfsufficient business operators but that doesn’t mean they have to be experienced from the start at orange leaf we focus on the overall experience so what we’re really looking for is someone who places as much value on the customer as we do we can teach the spreadsheets and business end of it as a franchisor i get to help franchisees achieve their dreams of business ownership and financial security in a familyfriendly environment i am a businessman at heart and have great expectations for my company not the least of which is providing franchisees the tools to become selfsufficient business owners and operators i relate to their position i understand their wants and needs it’s more than a company — it’s people i do everything i can to be available for them and provide the necessary tools for success because i want nothing more than for each franchisee to feel confident and accomplished   what would you tell a prospective franchisee who wants to know about the profit potential of an orange leaf frozen yogurt franchise orange leaf continues to stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly growing selfserve frozen yogurt industry we have established a great product strategic business model and positive brand recognition consumer demand means franchisees have plenty of opportunity to grow their own business and our support system puts them in the best possible position to succeed   can you describe your typical day as ceo of orange leaf frozen yogurt what do you enjoy most about your job the majority of my work day is spent focused on our franchisees whether it’s a prospect inquiring about the company or an existing owner looking for guidance i truly enjoy interacting and forming relationships the most satisfying part of my job is watching franchisees fulfill their potential as successful business operators   is there anything else that you’d like to share with us about orange leaf frozen yogurt in five years we want to be the absolute leader in selfserve frozen yogurt  we have new stores opening almost every week

travis ceo orange leaf frozen yogurt oklahoma city published on sunday  july  written by lisa white contributing editor reese travis and his business partners were looking for a unique food concept that they could bring to oklahoma after considering creating a new chain travis went back to one that had already impressed him a group of investors i work with tested the competition we looked at starting our own concept but kept coming back to orange leaf frozen yogurt travis says we felt it had the best product and after evaluating the price points offered the best value a year after travis opened orange leaf shops in wichita falls texas and in norman and lawton okla in  he approached the chains two owners about purchasing the company the deal was done on april   and travis and his partners moved orange leafs headquarters from san francisco to oklahoma city at that time the chain consisted of  stores just two years later orange leaf has  locations with two sites in australia at press time there were  locations under construction all locations are franchised and there are  corporateaffiliated stores the plan is to have  stores open in the next few years we will continue building it out and taking it to the next level travis says orange leaf was listed among the top  fastestgrowing yogurt operations under  million in technomics top  report sales were  million in  a  percent increase from  sales which were  million fes spoke with travis who discussed orange leafs concept equipment requirements and unique approach to the frozen dessert segment fes describe your concept rt we are a selfserve frozen yogurt concept the majority of our stores have eight machines with two separate flavors for a total of  varieties customers determine the portion size dispense the yogurt themselves then move on to the toppings bar to choose from fruit candy sprinkles etc when its time to check out we weigh the cup with the yogurt and toppings inside customers are charged by the ounce fes what makes your operation unique rt there are a couple other selfserve concepts and some fullserve yogurt shops but we have embraced our model customers can get exactly what they want and make the yogurt how they want it fes describe your locations rt orange leaf stores are between  and  square feet  to  feet wide and  to  feet deep there is custom orange leaf seating in the front of the store the selfserve area is located in the back where there are cup stands with  and ounce containers this flows to the wall which contains custom yogurt machines adjacent to this area is the toppings bar which is right by the checkout area the back of house is small only  to  square feet it includes worktables and blenders since we do a lot of prep work we fill and clean the yogurt machines from inside the kitchen shelves along the wall store ingredients we also have a threecompartment sink and three fourdoor refrigerators in addition to a freezer stores have between eight and  employees who work two sixhour shifts we are open seven days a week from  am to  pm fes what do you look for when purchasing equipment rt we are always looking for ways to become more efficient and encourage franchisees to look for good service providers we provide listings of specd equipment its important to build relationships and find support mechanisms even with something as simple as buying a refrigerator fes what do you predict for the frozen yogurt segment in the years ahead rt were in this first wave and there is room for more selfserve yogurt concepts its a land run in terms of who can get the best location our franchise model allows us to use people in their local market they know traffic and consumer patterns and can get us great locations for our concepts our franchisees
