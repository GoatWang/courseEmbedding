this type of project the importance really needs to be placed on removal of the old glue and any contaminates such as wax or oils being an inside job the type of glue then would depend on how long you

some white gluei use for my wood projects reply inaccurate tom k on may   purchased on apr   what should i use to remove the old glue reply  bonnie c on may   that really is dependent on the type and condition of the glue if it is antique the glue is most likely hyde glue and you could use hot water or a hair drier to loosen and remove other types usually will give up to a paint scraper or chisel thats not too sharp or even a broad screwdriver the most difficult would be a  part epoxy and you can only hope that its hold on the wood is not too strong or have a lot of coarse grade sandpaper

strong but just recently i found out how strong it is on a small project i had glued some rdquo diameter rare earth magnets into shallow holes so that they would act as retainers to another piece of wood that had the same size magnets likewise glued into shallow holes some time later months nbspi discovered that one of the magnets was installed with the wrong polarity facing outward to correct this error i have to pry out the magnet and reverse it and reglue it back in the magnet was really bonded in well after a bit of work i was able to get it out after getting it free i noticed that it looked odd on the glued side a closer look reveled that the thin nickel plating had pulled free of the back side of the magnet and was still stuck to the bottom of the hole where the magnet had been these magnets have a shiny polished exterior so there was noting for the titebond iii to really ldquogriprdquo but it still managed to hold on to the plating well enough to strip it off the side of the magnet in my opinion thatrsquos bonding power was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate december   robert c was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate titebond glue
