dividend payments and powerful brandsjul  about stanley black swk simply safe dividends dividend investing dividend growth investing longterm horizon research analystsimply safe dividendsstanley black  decker nyseswk has paid dividends for  consecutive years and increased its payout for the past  consecutive years next year stanley black  decker will join the exclusive dividend kings list which consists of companies that have raised their dividend for at least  straight years these businesses are rare and typically possess numerous competitive advantages stanley black  decker is no exception lets take a closer look at this impressive industrial business that offers dividend growth investors the potential for doubledigit payout growth for many years to come business overview stanley black  decker was founded in  and has grown into a diversified global provider of power and hand tools products and services for various industrial applications and security systems the company sells over  products including power drills saws toolboxes wrenches fasteners measuring tools compressors nail guns outdoor power equipment sanders lamps mowers vacuums workbenches polishers grinders cordless tools air tools and more some of the companys biggest brands are stanley dewalt blackdecker porter cable bostitch and the newly acquired irwin lenox and craftsman brands stanley black  deckers largest end markets by  revenue are residentialrepairdiy  new residential construction  nonresidential construction  industrialelectronics  automotive production  and retail  by segment stanley black  decker generated  of its  revenue from tools  storage  from security and  from industrial by geography the company generated  of its  revenue from the us  from europe  from emerging markets and  from the rest of the world business analysis stanley black  deckers primary competitive advantages are its wellknown brands product innovation global distribution channels and a strong management team stanley black  deckers brands and reputation for quality were established a long time ago the company obtained the worlds first patent for a portable power tool in  and has since amassed an unparalleled family of brands products and industry expertise before going further its worth mentioning that stanley works acquired black  decker in early  to create the biggest toolmaker in the us this deal combined the leader in consumer and industrial hand tools and security with the leader in power tools today stanley black  decker has over  active global patents and introduces about  new tool products per year including many of the worlds first each year the company has noted that new products drive over  of its organic growth and npd data recognized the company for receiving the th most patents in the world from  to  in october  the company made its biggest global product launch in its  year history the dewalt flexvolt battery system delivered over  million of revenue in its first four months on the market underscoring the companys success at launching new products innovation is a clear driver for the business and stanley black  decker is able to leverage its brand equity into adjacent product categories for easy expansion most of its markets are extremely large and fragmented because they require so many different types of products eg a home remodeling project could require saws measuring tools nail guns vacuums tools drills and more stanley black  decker can develop or acquire new products where it has gaps and market them under its famous brands the company invested over  billion in acquisitions since  to advance its growth opportunities and i expect more of the same to continue over the next decade as it continues consolidating its markets however during  stanley black  decker placed a moratorium on acquisitions to focus on nearterm priorities of operational improvement and deleveraging the company succeeded in improving its operating model and organizational capacity as well as driving organic growth and profitability during this time today the company is back to being focused on growth with acquisitions expected to consume about half of incremental cash flow and contribute  billion to  billion in incremental revenue helping the firm get closer to its objective of roughly doubling in size over the next six years source stanley black  decker investor presentation in october  stanley black  decker signed a definitive agreement to purchase the newell tools business including its irwin and lenox brands for  billion in cash this was followed by the purchase of craftsman brand from sears holdings nasdaqshld in january  these two companies will add around  billion to the firms total revenue and are expected to be accretive to the companys earnings while positioning stanley black  decker to gain additional market share with an even broader product portfolio stanley black  deckers extensive distribution channels and shelf space are also major competitive advantages its products are in practically every home center and mass merchandise retailer because they have loyal customers cover the broadest number of applications and are proven to sell as a result stanley black  decker has the number one global market share positions across tools and storage and is number two in commercial electronic security services with leading market share positions stanley black  deckers scale also helps it manufacture products at competitive costs although the company typically focuses on the higher end of the market where there is less price competition in the companys security  of sales and industrial  segments stanley black  deckers business benefits from a partial recurring revenue model it is tied to several large automotive companies that have selected stanley black  deckers highly engineered fasteners for their models for example and around  of the security segments revenue is recurring in the form of software and monitoring services the companys stanley fulfillment system sfs was quite successful in enhancing stanley black  deckers operating discipline sfs has five primary elements that work together breakthrough innovation digital excellence commercial excellence core sfs and functional transformation stanley black  decker develops business processes and systems to reduce costs and improve the companys return on capital through sfs  the next generation of sfs the company has achieved even more success by further driving growth cost efficiency digital transformation improved working capital performance and the successful global launch of flexvolt as an example stanley black  decker achieved a significant milestone at the end of  recording  working capital turns for the first time in its history a goal it had established almost a decade ago its free cash flow conversion rate stood at  of net income as well which helps ensure that there is plenty of cash that can be used for acquisitions or returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividend increases over the long term stanley black  decker targets  organic sales growth and  total revenue growth with continued margin expansion and operating leverage stanley black  decker expects earnings to grow by  per year key risks with strong brands and a welldiversified portfolio of products in slowchanging markets its no surprise that stanley black  decker has successfully been in business for more than  years in my opinion most of the risks faced by the company are shortterm in nature and related to currency fluctuations and macroeconomic trends construction and remodeling projects are two major business drivers which tend to move in cycles for example in the us existing home sales hit a year high earlier this year which suggests some of stanley black  deckers business has been benefiting from unusually strong economic tailwinds should the housing market unexpectedly roll over there could be a buying opportunity for longterm investors stanley black  deckers earnings could be negatively impacted in a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment as well for example the company faced significant foreign exchange headwinds in  with the us dollar appreciating against almost all major currencies around the world however i dont see any secular themes playing out that would necessarily challenge longterm demand for stanley black  deckers product offerings if anything the companys capital allocation decisions are possibly its greatest risk after taking several years off from major ma to fix an underperforming security business improve operational efficiency and deleverage stanley black  decker has resumed its highly acquisitive strategy earmarking half of its cash for deals if management makes an untimely deal takes on too much debt buys a bad company or unfavorably alters the companys business strategy the stock could suffer for example stanley black  decker acquired european security company niscayah in  the business started losing customers throughout the integration process and forced stanley black  decker to later miss earnings guidance but the company has more often than not been quite successful in integrating the various businesses it has acquired over the years otherwise stanley black  deckers continued branding and product innovation investments seem likely to continue serving it well across its large and fragmented markets its also worth monitoring that customers could begin switching to lowerpriced products especially in emerging markets but brand loyalty seems to be pretty high across most of stanley black  deckers product categories stanley black  deckers dividend safety we analyze  years of dividend data and  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend our dividend safety score answers the question is the current dividend payment safe we look at some of the most important financial factors such as current and historical eps and fcf payout ratios debt levels free cash flow generation industry cyclicality roic trends and more dividend safety scores range from  to  and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least  since tracking the data companies cutting their dividends had an average dividend safety score below  at the time of their dividend reduction announcements source simply safe dividends we wrote a detailed analysis reviewing how dividend safety scores are calculated what their realtime track record has been and how to use them for your portfolio stanley black  deckers dividend safety score of  indicates that the companys payout is very safe with such an impressive streak of paying dividends this should not come as a surprise over the last four quarters stanley black  deckers dividend has consumed  of its earnings and  of its free cash flow looking further back the companys payout ratios have generally remained between  and  over the last decade which is in line with managements  to  target this is a relatively low payout ratio that provides plenty of dividend safety even if stanley black  deckers cash flow was unexpectedly cut in half it would still be more than enough to cover the dividend observing a companys performance during the last recession is also helpful when it comes to evaluating the safety of a dividend we can see that stanley black  deckers sales fell by  in  and its earnings were down nearly  the company clearly has some sensitivity to the broader economy which isnt too surprising given its exposure to construction markets however given healthy construction markets in the us and a relatively stable europe overall sales growth has started to improve stanley black  deckers economic sensitivity isnt as big of a risk to the dividend payment because the companys payout ratios are relatively low and it has been a free cash flow machine over the last decade as seen below stanley black  decker has generated positive and stable free cash flow each of the last  fiscal years the sign of a very healthy business the business also generates a decent return on invested capital which helps gauge the profitability and efficiency of a business companies with competitive advantages will generally earn returns in excess of  prior to the financial crisis and its acquisition of blackdecker in  which brought down stanley black  deckers return on invested capital because it added substantial goodwill to the balance sheet the company earned doubledigit returns with continued productivity improvements stanley black  decker will likely be back to doubledigit returns on capital soon enough really the only strike against the safety of stanley black  deckers dividend is the companys balance sheet while stanley black  decker does have an a credit rating from sp it has about  billion in debt compared to  million in cash on hand sufficient to cover the amount of dividends it paid last fiscal year however the companys track record of cash generation has been excellent even after three recent acquisitions the company has maintained a decent cash balance its continued focus on operational execution and the sfs  program have also contributed towards strong free cash flow generation stanley black  deckers relatively low payout ratios consistent free cash flow generation and firm commitment to paying its dividend make it one of the safest payments available in the market while i wouldnt mind seeing some deleveraging stanley black  decker is still very healthy financially stanley black  deckers dividend growth our dividend growth score answers the question how fast is the dividend likely to grow it considers many of the same fundamental factors as the safety score but places more weight on growthcentric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios scores of  are average  or higher is very good and  or lower is considered weak stanley black  deckers dividend growth score of  is above average and suggests that the company should be able to deliver solid dividend growth for many years to come with  straight years of dividend increases and dividend aristocrat status this probably comes as no surprise dividend growth has consistently averaged around  annually in recent years but stanley black  deckers  payout ratio plans for strong growth over the next decade and solid free cash flow generation provide plenty of room for continued increases since the company has a target payout ratio of  to  which is roughly where the ratio stands today future dividend growth will likely track growth in earnings and free cash flow if management hits its growth target swks dividend could reasonably grow at a high single digit to low double digit annual rate in the years ahead the company most recently hiked its payout by  which is about in line with this expectation valuation swk trades at about x forward earnings a premium to the markets  forward pe ratio and has a dividend yield of  which is slightly lower than its fiveyear average dividend yield of  management believes stanley black  deckers earnings can grow at an ambitious rate of  to  per year over the long term which is one reason why the stock commands a premium valuation multiple i think at least an uppersingledigit annual earnings growth rate is reasonable to expect over the long term considering the size of the companys markets its many opportunities to leverage its brands and distribution channels and managements acquisitive growth plans in fact stanley black  decker has a target to become a diversified industrial giant with  billion in revenue by  from  billion now under this scenario the stocks valuation while certainly not a bargain looks more reasonable and appears to offer high single to low double digit annual total return potential  dividend yield plus  to  annual earnings growth likely continuing its impressive track record of outperforming most of its peers source stanley black  decker investor presentation conclusion stanley black  decker has one of the best dividend track records an income investor will find few companies have existed for  years much less paid a dividend for  consecutive years with continued product innovation and brand investment stanley black  deckers products seem likely to be in demand for many years to come the company will face its ups and downs depending on currency exchange rates and macro trends in key markets such as construction but its profits will likely continue marching higher over long periods of time while managements rather aggressive acquisition plans pose some risks over the next five years the company has earned the benefit of the doubt given its longterm prospects stanley black  decker appears to be a reasonable holding in a diversified dividend growth portfolio investors seeking more yield should review some of the top high dividend stocks here

flights from turkeyblack  deckers computer generated toolÂ autodeskfortune a computer designed stanley black  deckerâs new tooljonathan vanianjun  stanley black  decker has enlisted an algorithms help to redesign a tool for electricians marking a big shift from relying on humans to do the jobfor the past several months the industrial and household tool giant has been experimenting with cuttingedge technologies to produce the tool which is used to fix hanging electrical and telephones lines but the heavy toolsâsome are nearly  poundsâput a big strain on workers making coming up with a lighter version a possible hit productto reduce the toolâs weight stanley black  decker consulted with the design and architecture software firm autodesk to come up with a more workerfriendly tool known as a crimper the project involved tapping software that uses a technique called generative design to dream up new creationsmany companies are experimenting with using computers to design products because it may one day cut the cost of human designers and speed up the process of product development businesses are also hoping that the technology can do a better job than humans by coming up with designs that would otherwise never be consideredget data sheet fortuneâs technology newsletterin creating a new chair for example manufacturers can tell the computer they wants a new design that meets certain criteria like a having certain weight and dimensions the machine then tries to create designs that take into account those requirementsfrank desantis stanley black  deckerâs swk vice president of breakthrough innovation said his company chose to focus on a crimper as its first computerdesigned tool because of its relative obscurity in effect if the project failed it wouldnt be as big of a problem if they dud was a commonly used hammerrelatedfortune apple faces lawsuit over âwhat did he sayâ featurefortune apple faces lawsuit over âwhat did he sayâ featuremore specifically stanley black  decker focused its attention on a small metal attachment weighing around  pounds that helps the crimper clamp onto wires its an important element because when electrical wires come undone workers must clamp them together to repair themafter setting criteria like the attachmentâs weight size and cost of manufacturing desantis team let autodeskâs software crunch the numbers after a week or two the computer generated about  designs which desantis sifted through to pick the ones he thought were the bestsome of the computergenerated designs his team passed on would cost too much to make or the computer predicted they wouldnt be as sturdy as the team would likedesantis said his team chose a final design that was the best compromise in terms of weight and manufacturing costs the company is now testing the designs durabilityultimately the computer came up with an attachment that weighs a little over two pounds is threetofour inches long and resembles the letter âcâ held together by a lattice that looks like a collection of toothpicks desantis said to produce it the team used a d printer that took about  hours to recreate the design in realitylimitations in d printing technology like the sometimes long amount of time it takes to print something means that stanley black  decker will be unable to produce as many of its new crimper attachments as with more traditional manufacturing tools but because the crimper attachment isnât a big seller âeven if we print a couple hundred a month it can help usâ said desantisalthough generative design is gaining some traction there are still challenges with using it for one thing it requires heavyduty computing power which makes it expensiveadditionally stanley black  decker is intentionally using the technology to design something relatively small and easy to make a computergenerated power drill thats able to be d printed is likely many years awayfor more about technology and finance watch autodesk is trying to improve its algorithms so that its costs less to crunch the data explained greg fallon autodesks vice president of its simulation product group and then theres the risk that the redesigned crimp attachment isnt durable enoughdesantis said there are many skeptics within stanley black  decker who believe that computergenerated design may end up coming up with dud products that fail stress tests but he is confident that the attachment designed in his companys experiment will survive the pounding and that stanley black  decker will debut more computer generative designed products and parts in the next yearwe are going to prove them wrong desantis said about the doubterscustomer servicesite mapprivacy policyadvertisingad choicesterms of useyour
