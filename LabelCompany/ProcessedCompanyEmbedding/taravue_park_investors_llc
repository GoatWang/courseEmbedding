covington place in september  and met with keyounia and she showed us two units and we chose the one on the main floor we moved within a few weeks and loved the location and our new apartment as with any new place we started to find something’s that needed to be fixed and the maintenance staff while not the quickest did a good job and took care of all the issues going through this bad winter the staff was always out making sure the sidewalks and roads where as cleared as possible we have met many people in our building and we have not had any issues with other tenants fighting or loitering like others have posted we did have some young guys move in above us and we can hear them moving around but that happens in an apartment we have had to ask them to turn down the music a few times but they have always said they are sorry and turned it down right away you just have to treat people with respect and you will get back in return we have never had any issue with our car being damaged or kids hanging around where they should not be we have used the dog park for our dogs and it is an old tennis court but it has been completely mulched over and there are a few things for the dogs in it but it is just a good place for them to run around and get some exercisepark val apartmentsmacdaxon ratedafter living here for a year id have to say there are definite pros and cons the pros are the neighbors and maintenance staff are friendly and it is very centrally located that is pretty much the end of the pros the management has a snotty attitude and poor communication skills havent seen her here until recently and i am thoroughly unimpressed by the way she presents herself they present any issue as all encompassing and leave threatening letters on your door when you have not committed the offense under the reasoning that it is required by the doh the floors and ceilings are thin and you hear pretty much everything through the oven and bathroom ventilation they will tell you the appliances are fully updated once again not the case maybe in some apartments but it wasnt so in mine the floors in my hallway are uneven the doors have a half inch of space open on the bottom the entrance into the building is secured but you dont get a code just a keybob and must let any visitors in by walking to the door it is quite the pain when ordering delivery my neighbors are sorry to see me go i was sorry to go until i had a conversation with management today about having to go like i said very snotty with a poor attitude my advice find somewhere else to livekinswood apartmentssteven e rateda few months back during  days of heavy rain my bedroom ceiling collapsed wet insulation plaster and water all over my bed and floor it happened on a sunday afternoon so luck was on my side this didnt happen in the middle of the night seeing there is no manager or maintenance person on site there was nothing i could do until monday morning maintenance was pretty quick to fix iti thought tonight heavy rain again the ceiling sprung a leak just to the right where it had collapsed before being a late friday night i fear nothing can be done until monday i also do not want to chance sleeping in there until its fixed no telling how bad it is i have to make this my last lease here i cant take this much longer i have lived here for a long long time and would have rated this place much higher when i first moved here its been a slow decline ever since having no manager or maintenance on site is inexcusable and is my main reason i cannot renew my leasemerchandise mart apartmentsari d ratedi wish their was all carpet the walls are tooooooooo thin the sinks in the  bedroom apartmentslofts are from the high school years the water in the shower gets cold after  minutes its okay the people living here are afraid of their own shadow horrible location the bus to soulard market has to go down washington ave towards tucker and around the city instead of directly to soulard coming from the west coast i hate it here we can only get direct tv and only att but it would be much better with charter and dish if their was fans in the bathrooms in the apartments it would be much much better takes  days to get a new water filter in the fridgefreezer and it was put in  week and  days before they did something about it they said that i never told them on saturday to fix my problems in the loft and they said it was called in monday but i told them saturday i had to get my parents to call in from another state to get the order done ugh lucas and hunt villagefelicia

not the worst place out there and its cheap as dirt honestly the best bang for the buck within  miles if you can deal with the conswest pointe apartmentsgooddoer ratednice and cheap friendly atmospnice and cheap friendly atmosphere only bad thing is maintenance comes in almost every month then if your lucky you will catch them in your apartment saying that you sent them there to check on something that is fine they come when they want or when they think you are not around a lot of people work during the day so keep the place clean and if your missing something there is no proof that you didnt loose ithidden park apartmentssandy h ratedmanagementgreati moved in in  at first it was ok after i signed my first lease renewal things changed i was not going to sign aother leasein  a new
