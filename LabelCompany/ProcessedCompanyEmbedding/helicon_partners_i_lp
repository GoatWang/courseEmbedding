entities on behalf of the estate and  for leave to amend its complaint to substitute ngf and another nondebtor entity for john doe defendants the court commenced an evidentiary hearing and placed the burden of sustaining the attachment order on helicon consistent with the farbenblum certification helicon advanced two theories  ngf was an alter ego of the debtor and  ngf received fraudulent conveyances from the debtor on the third day of trial ngf moved the court to decide certain threshold issues regarding the propriety of the attachment order ngf contended that the attachment order should be vacated as a matter of law because  helicon had failed to move to confirm the attachment order within the requisite five days after the levy and  the validity of the of the attachment order rose or fell based upon the motion papers submitted to the state court which ngf argued were insufficient and helicon could not thereafter supplement its proof to sustain an order issued on insufficient papers the court directed the parties to brief the issues and on the return date raised two additional questions  does the debtor have an attachable interest in fraudulently transferred property or property owned by an alter ego and  assuming that the debtor has an attachable interest could helicon attach the interest without naming the alleged fraudulent transferee or alter ego here ngf as a defendant in the lawsuit the parties also submitted supplemental briefs on these issues although the court decided the first two issues from the bench this opinion will incorporate those dispositions so that the resolution of all of issues is set forth in one decision one final note on december   the new jersey bankruptcy court converted the debtors case to a case under chapter  order

a introduction attachments under new york law are governed by article  of new yorks civil practice law and rules cplr attachment is a provisional remedy that gives a prejudgment creditor the ability to secure a defendants property pending the entry of a final judgment hotel  mezz lender llc v falor  ned   ny  koehler v bank of bermuda ltd  ned   ny  a plaintiff may attachany debt or property against which a money judgment can be enforced cplr §  including debts owed to the defendant cplr § a or property the debtor could assign or transfer cplr § b bass v bass  nysd   ny app div  to obtain an order of attachment a plaintiff must establish four elements by affidavit or other written evidence  it has stated a claim for a money judgment  it has a probability of success on the merits  at least one of the five attachment grounds listed in cplr  has been satisfied and  the amount demanded from the defendant is greater than the amount of all counterclaims known to plaintiff cplr §§ a  ford motor credit co v hickey ford sales inc  ned   ny  attachment is considered a harsh remedy and courts have strictly construed the statute in favor of those against whom it is employed kornblum v kornblum  nysd   ny app div  the order of attachment must direct the sheriff to levy within his jurisdiction at any time before final judgment upon such property in which the defendant has an interest and upon such debts owing to the defendant     cplr § a to levy on personal property the sheriff may simply serve the order of attachment on the debtordefendant or on a garnishee and thereby take constructive possession or custody of the property cplr § a however a levy by service on a garnishee is effective only if at the time of service such person owes a debt to the defendant or such person is in the possession or custody of property in which such person knows or has reason to believe the defendant has an interest cplr § b alternatively the sheriff may levy on the property by seizing it and taking the property into his actual custody cplr §  a plaintiff may obtain an order of attachment with or without notice if the plaintiff obtains an order of attachment without notice ie ex parte it must move on notice to the defendant the garnishee and the sheriff to confirm the ex parte order within five days of the levy cplr § b the burden of proving the necessity and grounds for the attachment at the hearing to confirm an ex parte order of attachment rests with the plaintiff cplr § b incorporating cplr § b which provides that the plaintiff shall have the burden of establishing the grounds for the attachment the need for continuing the levy and the probability that he will succeed on the merits the garnishee is not required to take any affirmative steps by way of motion to vacate the order of attachment bd of educ of the city of new york v treyball  nysd   ny app div  if the order of attachment is confirmed or the plaintiff obtains the order on notice any person with an interest in the attached property may seek to have the order of attachment vacated or modified if it was improperly issued or has become unnecessary to secure the plaintiffs claim cplr § a finally if the garnishee fails to deliver the attached property or debt to the sheriff after the levy the plaintiff may commence a special proceeding against the garnishee to compel the payment or delivery of the property or the debt to the sheriff cplr § d smith v amherst acres inc  nysd   ny app div  the garnishee may assert any defense or counterclaim that it could have asserted had the plaintiff sued

determine the rights of adverse claimants to the property or debt cplr §  b the failure to move to confirm the award ngf contends that the attachment order should be vacated because helicon failed to move to confirm it within five days after the levy as required under cplr b the sheriff levied on ngfs account on april   and helicon faced a may th deadline to move to confirm the attachment however the debtor filed its chapter  petition on may   staying helicons action against the debtor  usc § a helicon could not move to confirm the award without violating the automatic stay and consequently bankruptcy code § c tolled the five day period until thirty days after the notice of termination or expiration of the automatic stay the court has still not yet ruled on helicons motion and the stay remains in effect furthermore helicon immediately filed an emergency motion on may nd for relief from the stay—its only option given the bankruptcy—which served the same purpose as a motion to confirm the attachment order accordingly cplr b has been satisfied c the record supporting the attachment order to sustain a warrant of attachment a case must be presented against the non party whose assets are attached as if it had been sued separately packer v caesars world inc  nysd   ny app div  citing zenith bathing pavilion inc v fair oaks steamship corp  ne   ny  accord ford motor credit co  ned at  i agree with ngf that the application presented to the state court action which has been removed to me does not support the attachment of ngfs property the verified amended complaint did not mention ngf it alleged that the debtor fraudulently conveyed all of its assets and business to fancy foods the only mention of ngf appeared in the last paragraph of the mr farbenblums affirmation that it appears that the debtor is utilizing bank accounts in the name of ngf the court is not however limited to the record presented to the state court on the initial application in deciding whether to vacate the attachment order absent prejudice to a substantial right the court may consider the papers and evidentiary facts submitted by the plaintiff in opposition to the motion to vacate am jerex co v universal aluminum extrusions inc  fsupp   edny  worldwide carriers ltd v aris steamship co ltd  fsupp   sdny  alex v grande  nysd   ny app div  and give the plaintiff a reasonable opportunity to correct any defect cprl § a see also b nycplr §  practice commentaries by vincent alexander at  mckinney the reference in cplr § a to the courts discretionary authority to give the plaintiff an opportunity to correct any defect was intended to address shortcomings in plaintiffs showing as required by cplr § a that he has a sufficient cause of action the court may also grant the plaintiff leave to amend a legally insufficient complaint without vacating the order of attachment where the plaintiffs proof establishes that it may have a cause of action that will support the order of attachment see raimondi v fedeli  nysd   ny app div  accord great lakes carbon corp v fontana  nysd   ny app div  ngf makes two other arguments that require comment regarding whether helicon should be allowed to cure any defects by filing an amended complaint first ngf contends that any amendment would be futile because helicon lacks standing to assert the estates alter ego and fraudulent transfer claims supplemental brief in reply to helicon partner llcs opposition against nonparty ngf incs emergency motion to vacate or modify attachment order dated jan   sic at  not filed on ecf this argument however has been mooted by the substitution of the trustee as partyplaintiff the trustee has standing to assert these claims second ngf contends that it will suffer substantial prejudice if the attachment order is not vacated—even if helicon is allowed to replead—because it will lose the right to sue for damages based on a wrongful attachment id at  in essence ngf seeks to deny helicon or the trustee a right which the law permits to cure the insufficiency because the exercise of that right may uphold attachment order and thereby prejudice ngfs argument that the attachment order was wrongful this is like a party arguing that a court should not receive relevant evidence because the evidence is harmful to the partys position d the debtors interest in ngfs bank account as is evident from the foregoing discussion the plaintiff can only attach or levy upon property in which the defendant has an interest see cplr §§ a the order shall direct the sheriff to levy    upon such property in which the defendant has an interest a the sheriff shall levy upon any interest of the defendant in personal property b a levy by service of an order of attachment upon a person other than the defendant is effective only if at the time of service such person    is in the possession or custody of property in which such person knows or has reason to believe the defendant has an interest     bank of new york v nickel  nysd   ny app div  it is beyond cavil that attachment will only lie against the property of the debtor and that the right to attach the property is only the same as the defendants own interest in it internal quotation marks omitted see generally david d siegel new york practice §  th ed  helicon has attached ngfs bank account on the theory that it contains funds the debtor fraudulently transferred to ngf or that ngf is the debtors alter ego  fraudulently transferred property at first glance it would appear that a defendanttransferor does not retain any interest in fraudulently transferred property the transferee enjoys title and possession and under new york law the transferor lacks standing to avoid its own fraudulent transfer eberhard v marcu  fd   d cir  moreover although not determinative of the state law question raised by these proceedings fraudulently transferred property does not become property of the bankruptcy estate until it is recovered see  usc § a nevertheless it is well settled under new york law dating back more than  years that a plaintiff may attach fraudulently transferred property see hess v hess  ne   ny  rinchey v stryker  ny    mandl v mandl  nysd   ny sup ct  the right is now codified in new yorks debtor and creditor law dcl §  which states in pertinent part  where a conveyance or obligation is fraudulent as to a creditor such creditor when his claim has matured may as against any person except a purchaser for fair consideration without knowledge of the fraud at the time of the purchase or one who has derived title immediately or mediately from such a purchaser a have the conveyance set aside or obligation annulled to the extent necessary to satisfy his claim or b disregard the conveyance and attach or levy execution upon the property conveyed dcl §  emphasis added accord glassman v glassman  ned   ny  fuld j title to fraudulently transferred property is only ostensibly lodged in the fraudulent transferee and the creditor is entitled to treat that property as belonging to the debtordefendant thus helicon is entitled to ignore the transfer to ngf and treat the transferred property embodied in the debt owed by ngfs bank to ngf as belonging to the debtor ngfs contrary arguments lack merit  property held by an alter ego the question of whether a debtor has an interest in property putatively owned by its alter ego is more straightforward and easier to answer alter egos own a pool of common assets and creditors may look to the assets of one to satisfy claims against the other see wm passalacqua builders inc v resnick developers s inc  fd   d cir  walkovszky v carlton  ned   ny  fuld j bailon v guane coach corp  nysd   ny app div  hence the creditor of one alter ego can attach the assets held in the name of the other alter ego see eg allstate ins co v tmr medibill inc cv cps  wl  at  edny july   allowing attachment of nonpartys assets because plaintiffs made sufficient showing regarding its reverse corporate veil piercing claim worldwide carriers ltd  fsupp   sdny  allowing attachment of property held by third party on the basis of an alter ego theory because plaintiff made out at least a prima facie case e was helicon required to join ngf as a party in the underlying action the conclusion that a plaintiff may attach fraudulently transferred property or property titled in the name of the defendants alter ego does not end the inquiry ngf is not a party to the action and helicon has not asserted a fraudulent transfer or alter ego claim against it ngf contends that a creditor cannot attach or levy upon property in the custody of a third party under alter ego or fraudulent conveyance theories without actually bringing those claims against the third party in a plenary action the relevant law does not however impose that requirement prior to levying on the nonpartys property to the contrary the case law recognizes the plaintiffs right to levy on property held by a nonparty garnishee pursuant to an order of attachment eg allstate ins  wl  at  gala enters inc v hewlett packard co  fsupp   sdny  ks norman agathe v sea trade  constr ltd  fsupp   sdny  am jerex co  f supp at  great lakes carbon corp  nysd at  mandl  nysd at  exchange nat bank of tulsa v washington  nysd   ny sup ct  furthermore cplr § d recognizes that the plaintiff may attach the property or a debt in the possession of a nonparty and makes no exception for fraudulently transferred property or property held in the name of an alter ego ngfs contention nevertheless highlights the due process concerns implicated when a plaintiff levies on property or a debt in the possession of and ostensibly owned by a nonparty if the garnishee contests the attachment or asserts its own interest in the property or debt article  offers several alternatives that provide the nonparty garnishee the opportunity to litigate its rights initially if the order of attachment was issued ex parte the plaintiff must move to confirm the order within five days on notice to the debtor the sheriff and the garnishee cplr § b the plaintiff bears the burden of proof and the garnishee can compel the plaintiff to establish its right to the order of attachment as noted helicons emergency motion satisfied this requirement and along with ngfs own motion triggered the hearing that was interrupted by ngfs motion to vacate the attachment order on purely legal grounds the garnishee may also move as ngf did here to vacate the order of attachment cplr § a in considering the motion the court can engage in any inquiry necessary to the determination of the movants claim  weinstein korn  miller ¶  at  if the garnishee fails or refuses to deliver the property or pay the debt to the sheriff the plaintiff may commence a special proceeding against the garnishee to compel the turn over cplr § d and the garnishee may assert any defense or counterclaim that it could have asserted if it had been made a party to the lawsuit  weinstein korn  miller ¶  at  in addition any other nonparty claiming an interest in the attached property or debt may commence a special proceeding in the nature of an interpleader to determine the adverse interests in the property or debt cplr §  here there is no due process concern ngf filed a motion to vacate the attachment order and has had ample opportunity to contest it the trial halted after three days at ngfs choice to afford it an opportunity to brief its contention that the attachment order should be vacated as a matter of law that motion has now been denied and the hearing can continue nevertheless the conversion of the case and the appointment of the trustee highlight the unusual nature of this matter helicons right under state law to interfere with the debtors property interests through the attachment order ended with the commencement of the bankruptcy case this is why helicon moved for stay relief in addition several of the claims asserted in the verified amended complaint belong to the estate these include the fraudulent conveyance claims against fancy foods and the claims sounding in breach of fiduciary duty they may also include aiding and abetting the kims breach of fiduciary duty if the adverse interest exception applies to preclude the application of in pari delicto those claims as well as any claims alleging that ngf is a fraudulent transferee or alter ego of the debtor must be pressed by the trustee as the estate representative kalb voorhis  co v american fin corp  fd  d cir  st paul fire and marine ins co v pepsico inc  fd   d cir  keene corp  br at  corman v lafountain  nysd   ny app div  this is why helicon crossmoved for authority to prosecute those claims as the estate representative at the time the case was still pending under chapter  and the kims were not going to sue themselves or their affiliates the conversion of the case and the appointment of the trustee make the situation clearer the trustee will be substituted as the plaintiff and if he intends to pursue this matter he should file an amended complaint that eliminates helicons direct claims and asserts the estates claims against the kims ngf and any other appropriate defendant if the trustee asserts a fraudulent transfer or alter ego claim against ngf the hearing on the motion to vacate the attachment order will continue if the trustee does not amend the verified amended complaint to assert a claim that will support the attachment order the order will be vacated accordingly the trustee is directed to file any amended pleading within thirty days of this order consistent with this opinion unless the court extends the deadline for cause shown if the trustee does not file and serve an amended pleading by the original or any extended deadline ngf may settle a proposed order vacating the attachment order on notice to the trustee helicon any other parties to the adversary proceeding and any other garnishees of which it is aware so
