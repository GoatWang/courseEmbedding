ultimate guide to convertible bond strategy etfs may  7 am nasdaqfcvt while we expect equity markets to continue strengthening with improving economic conditions we do see potential risks the geopolitical environment monetary policy upcoming changes to the us federal reserve the fed regime and the ability of the trump administration to get policy passed in dc all pose threats to markets these threats can cause shifts in market sentiment and volatility which can have negative impacts to investors despite improving conditions strategies that offer investors some continued upside potential but may protect more in a down market should be considered one asset class we tend to favor in this type of environment is convertible bonds convertibles bonds are hybrid securities combining characteristics of both equities and traditional bonds as each convertible bond is exchangeable for equity shares as equity prices move upward the value of the convertible bond moves up to a degree based on its conversion feature this can lead to a healthy degree of equity sensitivity as equities move higher however as equities sell off the convertible bond will fall but generally will find support to the downside as it begins to be valued for its fixed income characteristics such as the return of principal and interest payment as the chart above demonstrates a convertible bond may go through different phases during its life depending on the underlying equity price and the conversion feature when the underlying equity price is below the conversion price the convertible will tend to act more like a debt security rather than equity as the equity price increases the bond’s value will also increase due to the conversion feature as the underlying equity price converges with the conversion price the investor enters a sweet spot where they are participating more in the equity upside while also collecting interest payments as the equity price continues to rise more equity sensitivity is experienced however as equity prices fall the bond finds support again as it reenters the middle or defensive range where it is supported by the convertible’s fixed income features recently we have seen improving fundamentals and believe we will continue to see gdp growth in 7 job creation remains on a positive trajectory as we have seen continued strength in jobless claims and income levels this strength should lend support to consumer sentiment and spending business sentiment is also optimistic the conference boards’ us leading index continues to improve and we are seeing continued growth in production while all these factors should support equity markets we remain concerned with volatility and downward pressure from several areas geopolitical risks are high as the us has changed tone with the new administration on number of fronts for example recent strikes in syria by the us have strained us and russian relations further north korea continues to be problematic and the world will be adjusting to new trade negotiations which could create tensions domestically we are starting an internal battle between fiscal and monetary policy as the fed raises rates and plans the suspension of reinvesting proceeds from maturing bonds thus reducing the size of their balance sheet furthermore there is uncertainty in the future of fed policy as we prepare for a fed regime change with the end of janet yellen’s term next february also there is uncertainty surrounding the passing and timing of many fiscal policies aimed at supporting further us economic growth through tax cuts infrastructure spending and the roll back of tedious regulations walking a fine line between giving up potential equity upside from a strengthening economy and managing downside risks and volatility is challenging we believe incorporating asset classes that offer some upside with a downside protection mechanism such as convertible bonds can be beneficial in this environment there are several etf options in the space for investors looking to incorporate convertible bonds into their portfolio the ishares convertible bond etf icvt tracks the bloomberg barclay’s us convertible
