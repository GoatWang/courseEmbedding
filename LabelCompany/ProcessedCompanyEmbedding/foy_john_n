imperative to your physical and financial wellbeing to consult an attorney no matter what even when dealing with your own insurance company our founder john m foy always says call an attorney first call an attorney right away we cant undo what has been donestep   do not settle with the insurance company without speaking to an atlanta injury attorney firstwe understand that the insurance companies are going to offer you hundreds if not thousands of dollars to settle the claim and get you to surrender your rights we also understand that that money can sure come in handy right now to cover medical bills rent and other living expenses however you as an unrepresented individual are extremely vulnerable to settling quickly and for not enough money we know youre honest and expect the best from everyone but all i told them was the truth is something we hear all the time of course we want you to tell the truth but we want to protect and represent you first any insurance companys first obligation is to itself not you even the smartest most educated person is no match for the legions of attorneys dedicated to protecting the companys interestremember that insurance companies are very large and very sophisticated they all share data and they have hundreds of attorneys in different departments they will tell you anything and everything to settle quickly foy says “no one should ever give a recorded statement to an insurance company even their own insurance company without consulting an attorney first” listen to what our customers have to say my legs and my back were hurt and
