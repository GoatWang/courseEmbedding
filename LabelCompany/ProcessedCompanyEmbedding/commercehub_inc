mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a

also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

stocks the interactive group which in  was renamed the qvc group and the ventures group for the purpose of creating greater transparency for the assets and liabilities attributed to each group among other reasons our company is currently attributed to the ventures group for a description of these tracking stocks see the spinoffbackground for the spinoff although the public markets have responded favorably to these two tracking stocks liberty believes that a meaningful trading discount continues to apply to the underlying value of the businesses and assets attributed to its ventures group liberty believes that the spinoff will result in a higher aggregate trading value for our common stock and the liberty ventures common stock as compared to the trading price of liberty ventures common stock in the absence of the spinoff the assetbacked nature of our stock is expected to provide greater transparency for investors with respect to our business commercehub which should result in greater focus and attention by the investment community on this business and highlight its value the spinoff is also expected to allow for more targeted capital raising in the future to enhance our ability to issue equity for strategic acquisitions and other business combinations by creating a more efficiently priced equity security to enable us to more effectively tailor equity incentives for our management and employees with less dilution to public stockholders and to provide our management team with greater flexibility and independence in making commercial decisions that benefit our

most material however there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic business competitive regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our businesses past

and uncertainties please refer to the section entitled cautionary statements concerning forwardlooking statements on page  of this prospectus in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described below          for purposes of these risk factors unless the context otherwise indicates we have assumed that the spinoff has occurred factors relating to our corporate history and structure          the consolidated financial information of our company included in this prospectus is not necessarily representative of our companys future financial position future results of operations or future cash flows nor does it reflect what our companys financial position results of operations or cash flows would have been as a standalone publicly traded company during the periods presented         because the historical consolidated financial information of our company included in this prospectus includes the results of the historical commercehub business as conducted by liberty prior to the spinoff it is not representative of ch parents future financial position future results of operations or future cash flows nor does it reflect what ch parents financial position results of operations or cash flows would have been as a standalone publicly traded company pursuing independent strategies during the periods presented factors relating to our business          we are dependent upon consumers continued willingness to use the internet and other currently available technology for commerce a downturn in the ecommerce market or failure of the ecommerce market to grow or to grow as rapidly as we expect could adversely affect the demand for our ecommerce solutions         our success depends upon the general publics continued willingness to use the internet whether through a computer smart phone tablet or other internetenabled device as a means to purchase goods and conduct and research commercial transactions the internet must continue to be accepted and widely used for selling merchandise for our existing customers and potential customers to be willing to subscribe to our solutions as ecommerce continues to evolve regulation by federal state or foreign agencies may increase any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchanged over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet which could harm our business if consumers became unwilling or less willing to use the internet or other current technology for commerce for any reason or if we fail to adapt to technology changes or industry standards our business could be materially adversely affected         in addition if consumer utilization of ecommerce channels experiences a downturn does not grow or grows more slowly than we expect demand for our solutions would be adversely affected our  table of contents revenue would be negatively impacted and our ability to pursue our growth strategy would be compromised          our business is substantially dependent upon the continued acceptance of softwareasaservice saas solutions as a viable option for providing information technology services a rejection reluctance or inability of the marketplace to utilize saas solutions could cause our revenue to decline and impair our ability to become profitable         we derive and expect to continue to derive a substantial amount of our revenue from the sale of our solutions and related revenue sources which are delivered under a saas or saasplus model as a result continued widespread use and acceptance of this business model is critical to our future growth and success with the increasing concerns around cybersecurity and access to data some companies are predisposed to maintaining control of their information technology systems and infrastructure and there may be increased resistance from our customers to accessing software functionality that involves transmission of their sensitive data through a service provided by a third party in addition customers may seek to build and utilize inhouse software and service solutions for their ecommerce programs where they believe they can do so more effectively or where they seek to reduce longterm dependence on thirdparty services for these programs existing and new market participants may also introduce new types of solutions and different approaches to enable organizations to address their needs if the market for our saas solutions fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate demand for our solutions and our revenue gross margin and other operating results could be negatively impacted          consolidation or simplification of the ecommerce industry could diminish demand for our solutions         the ecommerce industry is currently a complex and fragmented industry and our solutions are designed to help customers navigate these disparate online channels although the number and variety of online channels available to retailers and manufacturers have been increasing at the same time the share of online sales made through a small number of larger channels particularly amazon has also been increasing if the trend toward consolidation around a few large online channels accelerates the difficulties faced by retailers and manufacturers could decline this may allow more companies to maintain these solutions inhouse or through onpremises software solutions they manage if our solutions become less important to retailers and manufacturers this may reduce demand for our solutions and cause our sales and opportunities for growth to decline          government and industry regulation of the internet is evolving and could directly restrict our business or indirectly affect our business by limiting the growth of ecommerce unfavorable changes in government regulation or our failure to comply with such regulations could cause our solutions to become less attractive reduce the number of transactions processed through our platform cause our revenue to decline and otherwise harm our business and operating results         as ecommerce evolves federal state and foreign agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt regulations covering issues that affect our business and ecommerce in general government regulations could limit the market for our products and services or impose burdensome requirements that render our business unprofitable for example although current us supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales an increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to require outofstate retailers to collect sales taxes on their behalf in addition legislation currently being considered by the us senate and the us house of representatives called the marketplace fairness act would override the supreme court rulings and enable states to require that our online retailer customers collect sales tax from the states residents this is a rapidly evolving area and we cannot predict whether this or other similar legislation will ultimately be adopted or what form it might take if  table of contents adopted if the states or congress are successful in these attempts to require our online retailer customers to collect state or local income taxes on outofstate purchases this could cause ecommerce to decline which would in turn hurt the business of our customers and potentially make our solutions and services less attractive and cause the number of transactions processed through our platform and ultimately our revenue to decline similar issues exist outside of the united states where the application of valueadded tax or other indirect taxes on online retailers and companies like ours that facilitate ecommerce is uncertain and evolving         although many regulations might not apply to our business directly we expect that laws regulating the solicitation collection or processing of personal and consumer information could affect our customers or our ability to use and share data potentially reducing demand for our solutions and services moreover if future laws and regulations limit or overly burden our customers ability to use and share consumer data or our ability to store process and share data with our customers over the internet demand for our solutions could decrease our costs could increase our profits may decline and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed         in addition taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed any regulation imposing greater fees for internet usage or the services we provide or restricting information exchanged over the internet could result in a decline in the use and viability of internetbased services including ours which could harm our business and operating results          our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure failure to adequately manage our growth could adversely affect our customers satisfaction with our solutions and have a negative impact on our business and operating results         as our customer base and the amount and types of information shared on our platform continue to grow we must be able to increase our technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to satisfy the growing needs of our customers if we fail to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands our reputation could be negatively affected         we have experienced and may continue to experience significant growth in our business our growth has placed and may continue to place a significant strain on our managerial administrative operational financial and other resources we intend to expand our overall business customer base headcount and operations both domestically and internationally with no assurance that our business or revenue will continue to grow         we have also experienced significant growth in the number of users transactions and data that our infrastructure supports we seek to maintain adequate excess capacity in our infrastructure to be sufficiently flexible and scalable to meet the needs of all of our customers we also seek to maintain excess capacity to facilitate the rapid provision of new customer deployments and the expansion of existing customer deployments and to handle spikes in usage however the provision of new network infrastructure requires significant lead time if we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements particularly during periods of increased traffic or if customer traffic patterns significantly change our customers could experience service outages that may subject us to financial penalties and financial liabilities and result in customer losses if our cloud network infrastructure capacity fails to keep pace with increased sales and customer expansion customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenue growth         our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage growth effectively if we do not effectively manage our growth the quality of our solutions and services may suffer which could negatively affect our reputation and demand for our solutions which would negatively impact our business and operating results  table of contents          we use a limited number of data centers to deliver a significant portion of our services any disruption of service at these facilities could harm our business         we manage our services and serve our customers from a limited number of data center facilities we engineer and architect the computer and storage systems upon which our platform runs and own and operate our primary data center in albany new york         we also lease redundant or backup data center colocation facilities in albany new york and greater chicago illinois and we do not control the physical operation of these backup facilities the owners of these backup data facilities have no obligation to renew their lease agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms we may be required to locate alternative backup facilities and we may incur significant costs and temporary loss of highavailability or disaster recovery services in connection with doing so         any interruptions of service operational failures or security breaches errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses interruptions in our services might reduce our revenue subject us to potential liability and cause customers to terminate their subscriptions or harm our renewal rates         the data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error intentional bad acts earthquakes hurricanes floods fires war terrorist attacks labor strikes health epidemics power losses hardware failures systems failures telecommunications failures cyber attacks and similar events the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism vandalism or other misconduct a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our solutions or impair their functionality because we operate a multitenant saas environment shared by many large customers such an event if it occurred would not be confined to a single customer or small number of customers but instead would impact a significant portion of our customer base collectively our business growth prospects and operating results would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers are not confident that our solutions are reliable          we plan to expand our use of thirdparty cloudbased offerings to deliver a portion of our services any disruption of service at these thirdparty providers could harm our business         we are moving portions of our service offerings away from traditional data centers to cloudbased offerings provided by thirdparty providers these offerings have defined service boundaries in which they operate and we have minimal if any ability to manage how those services are provided the services and features provided by these thirdparty providers may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to maintain the right to use these services or are unable to upgrade our arrangements with these providers to accommodate the scalability of our business our customers could experience delays or be unable to access features within our solutions until we can obtain and integrate a functionally equivalent replacement technology any available alternatives could be more difficult or costly than currently available third partyofferings in addition integration of such alternatives into our platform could require significant work and substantial time and resources any delays or failures associated with integrating such alternatives into our platform could injure our reputation with customers and potential customers which would result in an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition  table of contents          we rely in part on a pricing model under which transactionbased fees we receive from customers vary based on the volume of transactions that those customers process through our platform declines in the number of transactions that our customers process through our services or the elimination of a large demand channel on which these transactions are conducted could adversely affect our financial results         we rely on relationships with demand channels which may include retailer internet websites mediabased shopping networks online marketplaces search engines and other platforms through which goods are sold to consumers to generate revenue from sellers and in many cases the demand channels directly a significant portion of our revenue is derived from ecommerce orders processed through our solution between a seller and a demand channel historical annual growth rates will vary from year to year based on individual demand channel trends including the addition or attrition of individual demand channels when a demand channel customer leaves our platform this also results in the loss of revenue from other customers that have trading partner connections associated with that particular demand channel consequently the loss of a large demand channel would adversely affect our revenue and growth         service outages at our demand channel customers or other online channels on which our customers rely could prevent or severely disrupt the ability for consumers to make purchases on those demand channels in such a scenario the order volume and associated transaction fee revenue we would have anticipated receiving from those demand channels would decrease significantly or cease altogether         some of our customers and the demand channels they utilize have experienced financial difficulties in the past insolvency credit problems or other financial difficulties confronting our customers and the demand channels they utilize could expose us to financial risk additionally if our customers reduce the volume or size of the ecommerce sales they process or generate through our platform for example as a result of declines in our customers overall sales or greater reliance on fulfillment methods that do not utilize our services our revenue operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected          we derive a portion of our revenue from retailers choosing dropship delivery as a way to expand the assortment of products they offer to consumers if more retailers elect not to rely on dropship delivery as a means to expand their product assortments demand for our solutions could decline which in turn could cause our revenue and operating results to be negatively impacted         we derive and expect to continue to derive a substantial amount of our revenue from the sale of our solutions to enable retailers to increase product offerings through dropship solutions in which products ship directly from a manufacturer or distributor while the market trend has been to increase the use of dropship solutions as a means to offer more products without assuming associated inventory risk use of dropship delivery requires retailers to entrust order fulfillment and delivery of products to the network of thirdparty suppliers that ship on the retailers behalf if more retailers elect instead to expand their own warehouses and inventory to assume greater control over order fulfillment rather than employing dropshipping solutions or if other methods of fulfillment emerge that are perceived as more effective than dropshipping demand for our solutions could decline which would cause our revenue and other operating results to be negatively impacted          our lengthy sales and implementation cycles make it difficult to predict our future revenue and cause variability in our operating results         our sales cycle can vary substantially from customer to customer depending on the size and complexity of the opportunity a number of factors influence the length and variability of our sales and implementation cycles including for example  the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our solutions  table of contents  the commitment customers make in their agreements with us  the discretionary nature of potential customers purchasing and budget cycles and decisions  the competitive nature of potential customers evaluation and purchasing processes  evolving ecommerce needs and functionality demands of potential customers  announcements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors  lengthy purchasing approval processes of potential customers and  the complexity of the implementations and integrations with customer and thirdparty systems         in addition with larger enterprise customers we face greater costs longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales the customers decision to use our service may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our solutions         lengthy sales and implementation cycles make it difficult to predict the quarter in which revenue from a new customer may first be recognized further our potential customers frequently need to obtain approvals from multiple decision makers before making purchase decisions delays in our sales or implementation cycles could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period          if we are unable to retain our existing customers our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected         our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after their subscription period expires and these subscriptions may not be renewed on the same or on more profitable terms as a result our ability to grow depends in part on subscription renewals and our ability to meet or exceed our customers expectations in addition many of our contracts are nonexclusive and revenue is based on the volume of transactions the customer completes using our platform it is possible that our customers could send fewer transactions through our platform at any time during the contract term resulting in lower revenue to us we may not be able to accurately predict future trends in customer renewals and our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors including the cost of our services dissatisfaction with our services the cost of services offered by our competitors and reductions in our customers spending levels if our customers do not renew their subscriptions renew on less favorable terms complete fewer transactions or fail to grow their business using our platform or do not purchase additional offerings to complement their existing services our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our profitability and gross margins may be adversely affected          our business and revenue may be impacted by the seasonality of our customers businesses         the ecommerce marketplace is affected by the same seasonality as the traditional brickandmortar marketplace many of our customers typically realize a significant portion of their sales in the fourth quarter of each calendar year our customer base is diversified among different retail segments including general merchandise home improvement office supplies toys electronics furniture and perishables as such our revenue does not closely track seasonality trends for any one specific retail segment although the customers that we currently serve do not all experience the same seasonal variation and some customers may have seasonal peaks that occur in periods other than the fourth quarter the seasonality of our customers businesses may become more concentrated as we continue to expand our solutions to more customers if our customer base changes to include more customers that experience more concentrated seasonal variation our revenue may fluctuate significantly among quarters  table of contents          if we fail to develop our brand in a costeffective manner our business may suffer         we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of our brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future solutions and is an important element in attracting new customers furthermore we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and even if they do any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts and our business could suffer          we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors         the market for ecommerce solutions applications and services is very competitive while no single competitor currently offers all of the solutions that we offer we do have competitors with longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we have increased competition may result in reduced pricing for our solutions longer sales cycles or a decrease in our market share any of which could negatively affect our revenue and future operating results and our ability to grow our business         a number of competitive factors could cause us to lose potential sales or to sell our solutions at lower prices or at reduced margins including among others  current and potential customers may choose to develop applications or continue using applications developed inhouse rather than pay for our solutions  marketplaces and other demand channels which typically offer software tools often for free that allow retailers and manufacturers to connect to them may decide to compete more vigorously with us or make it easier for our customers to selfservice their omnichannel strategy rather than relying on our offerings to assist their efforts  competitors may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer more attractive sales terms adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customer requirements and devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services than we can  current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and expand their markets and consolidation in our industry is likely to intensify  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share  current and potential competitors may offer technology or services that address one or more ecommerce needs at a lower price point or with greater depth than our solutions and may be able to devote greater resources to those solutions than we can and  software vendors could bundle ecommerce solutions with other solutions or offer such products and services at a lower price as part of a larger product sale         in addition if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic partners or other  table of contents parties with whom we or our customers or prospects have relationships thereby limiting our ability to promote our solutions disruptions in our business caused by these events could reduce our revenue         competition in our industry may intensify as our competitors raise additional capital and enter into business combinations or alliances and as established companies in other market segments or geographic markets expand into our market segments or geographic markets if we cannot compete successfully against our competitors our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected          our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties         we anticipate that we will continue to depend on our relationships with various third parties including marketplaces and other technology providers in order to grow our business identifying negotiating and documenting relationships with third parties requires significant time and resources as does integrating thirdparty content and technology with our solutions if the thirdparty content or technology integrated with our solutions is not well received by our customers our brand and reputation could be negatively affected our agreements with thirdparty business partners are typically nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing services if and to the extent that any of these third parties compete with us it could hurt our growth prospects         in addition a significant portion of the transactions that our customers process through our platform is derived from merchandise sold on marketplaces with which we have strategic relationships in many cases these marketplaces and the other channels with which our solutions are integrated have no obligation to do business with us or to allow us or our customers access to their systems and they may decide at any time and for any reason to significantly curtail or inhibit our ability to integrate our solutions with their channels additionally these marketplaces may decide to make significant changes to their respective business models policies systems or plans and those changes could impair or inhibit our customers ability to use our solutions to sell their products on those channels or may adversely affect the number of transactions that our customers can sell on those channels or reduce the desirability of selling on those channels further these marketplaces could decide to compete with us any of these results could cause our customers to reevaluate the value of our products and services and potentially terminate their relationships with us which could significantly reduce our revenue         if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with certain of these third parties our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results would suffer even if we are successful we cannot assure our stockholders that these relationships will result in improved operating results          the ecommerce market changes rapidly and our inability to respond to changes in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability         the ecommerce market can change rapidly in multiple ways through frequent new product and service introductions frequent changes in rules specifications and other requirements and evolving industry standards our ability to attract new customers and retain and increase revenue from existing customers is dependent on our ability to understand the changes that are affecting the ecommerce marketplace and to adapt our solutions at a rapid pace to address those changing market conditions to achieve market acceptance for our solutions we must effectively anticipate and offer solutions that meet changing customer demands and thirdparty requirements in a timely manner customers and the ecommerce channels that they utilize may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have if we fail to develop solutions that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and costeffective manner our ability to renew our contracts with existing customers and our ability to create or increase demand for our solutions will be impaired  table of contents         we may experience difficulties with software development industry standards design or marketing that could delay or prevent our development introduction or implementation of new solutions and enhancements the introduction of new solutions by competitors the emergence of new industry standards or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could render our existing or future solutions obsolete         additionally as the ecommerce industry continues to evolve and becomes more fragmented new demand channels and new technologies will emerge to offer consumers new ways to purchase products we monitor these new demand channels and technologies and attempt to predict which channels are likely to be successful to select projects we anticipate will generate a positive return on our development investment our customers may expect us to support a broader array of demand channels than may be commercially feasible especially emerging channels that are considered likely to be successful by popular opinion the media and other industry experts we may therefore be compelled to invest heavily in development resources to enhance our offerings to support new channels that fail to attract consumer usage take an unexpectedly long time to attract consumer usage or are successful for our customers and consumers but are disproportionately costly for us to maintain and support we may devote resources to advancements that are ultimately unsuccessful at the expense of other projects that may be more successful incurring significant opportunity cost to do so further if we were to deploy significant resources to particular platforms that ultimately failed to attract market participants or materialize as anticipated we may incur costs that we may never recover if we fail to realize returns on such development initiatives or if our customers require that we service technologies that are too costly to maintain this could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition         if we are unable to successfully develop or acquire new capabilities and functionality enhance our existing solutions to anticipate and meet customer preferences and rapidly evolving industry requirements or sell our solutions into new markets our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected          we may experience service failures or interruptions due to defects in the hardware software infrastructure thirdparty components or processes that comprise our existing or new solutions any of which could adversely affect our business         our solutions are complex and may contain undetected defects in the hardware software infrastructure thirdparty components or processes that are part of such solutions if these defects lead to service failures we could experience delays or lost revenue diversion of software engineering resources material nonmonetary concessions negative media attention or increased service costs as a result of performance claims during the period required to correct the cause of any such defects we cannot be certain that defects will not be found in new solutions or upgraded solutions resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition         our solutions are designed to automate various order fulfillment and product listing functions across multiple online channels for large volumes of our customers sales as well as to ensure that their sales comply with the policies of each channel and sometimes to dynamically determine or communicate product pricing at any given moment in the event that our solutions do not function properly errors could occur including that our customers might sell more inventory than they have in stock make sales that violate channel policies or underprice or overprice their offerings overselling their inventory could force our customers to cancel orders at rates that violate channel policies underpricing could result in lost revenue or material losses to our customers and overpricing could result in lost sales any of these results or other errors could reduce demand for our solutions and hurt our business reputation  table of contents         any defect in or disruption to our solutions or any error in execution could cause our customers to seek recourse against us for losses or cancel their contracts with us discourage potential customers from joining our network and harm our reputation although most of our contracts with our customers limit our liability for these defects disruptions or errors we nonetheless could be subject to litigation for actual or alleged losses to our customers businesses where a particular defect is replicated across multiple large customers as may conceivably occur in the context of a multitenant saas hosting environment individual contractual liability caps may be aggregated across multiple claimants to create a much larger exposure defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert managements attention and could cause our business to suffer         the insurers under our existing liability insurance policies could deny coverage of claims resulting from an error or defect in our technology or a resulting disruption in our solutions or our existing liability insurance might not be adequate to cover all of the damages and other costs of such a claim moreover we cannot assure you that our current liability insurance coverage will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all the successful assertion against us of one or more large claims that exceeds our insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our liability insurance policy including an increase in premiums or imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results          cybersecurity incidents could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results         our business involves the collection and use of confidential and otherwise sensitive information of our customers and their trading partners including for example customer shipping information and purchasing habits the collection and use of this information sometimes requires our access to our customers information systems as well as to systems operated by our thirdparty technology providers we serve as a conduit for transmitting information between our customers and their trading partners as well as the thirdparty platforms they use for ecommerce transactions in addition given our critical role as a service provider to the retail industry we believe that we are an attractive target for such attacks if third parties seek to gain unauthorized access to our system as a means to access systems operated by our customers or our thirdparty providers this would impair our customers trust in our security practices         we cannot assure you that our efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of information we process or control will always be successful our security measures may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error or misconduct malfeasance or otherwise and may result in one or more third parties obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential or other sensitive information or our it systems additionally we may be subject to social engineering or other tactics that attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data or our data or it systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures malicious parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services or our customers websites         if our information security efforts are compromised or if we fail to detect and appropriately respond to a data security breach we could be subject to legal claims including shareholder derivative suits class actions or other direct claims by customers or other injured parties and governmental action a data security breach may also adversely affect our reputation increase our insurance costs or result in loss of coverage and we may need to incur other significant costs to protect against information security breaches in the future each of which could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects in addition because of the critical nature of data security any  table of contents perceived breach of our security measures or harm to our reputation could cause existing or potential customers not to use our solutions         in addition our customers or our partners online and other sales may be significantly impacted by cybersecurity incidents for example our customers or partners may experience denialofservice type attacks that could make all or portions of such customers or partners websites unavailable for periods of time because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transactions effected on or through our customers and partners websites operational disruptions such as these could cause our revenue to decline          as our customers continue to scrutinize and refine their own data security practices the security and confidentiality obligations they seek to impose on their saas and ecommerce providers are becoming increasingly onerous failure to meet expectations may hurt our business         many of our customers and potential customers are prominent merchants and retailers that process large volumes of sensitive consumer and business data as such they are increasingly targeted for cybersecurity attacks as highly publicized cybersecurity incidents within the retail and consumer goods sector are occurring with greater frequency our customers and potential customers are increasingly seeking to shift these risks by pursuing more onerous contractual terms in their agreements this may include requests for contractual commitments to burdensome security procedures reporting notification and audit rights additional warranties guarantees and other contractual assurances indemnification provisions specialized remedies and liability limitation exclusions our customers may also seek to require our adherence to customerspecific operational protocols and procedures that may compromise our ability to operate our business efficiently or that may be unworkable such obligations require that we continue to enhance our security programs and incur increased compliance costs to provide current and potential customers with protections they now expect such requirements also make it more difficult to obtain new customers as we experience longer sales cycles to negotiate mutually acceptable terms and increase the cost and complexity of our compliance procedures if we are unsuccessful in our attempts to negotiate acceptable outcomes or meet expectations in this area this could also lead to customer erosion or impede our ability to grow our sales and attract new customers          our business is subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations that are continuously evolving including those related to privacy data security and data protection due to our collection processing and use of personal information and other user data         we are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection data security data retention consumer protection advertising electronic commerce intellectual property manufacturing antibribery and anticorruption and economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws         in particular there are numerous us federal state and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection sharing use processing disclosure and protection of personal information and other user data the scope of which is changing subject to differing interpretations and is inconsistent among different jurisdictions we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy data security and data protection however given that the scope interpretation and application of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be conflicting it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices any failure or perceived failure to comply with our privacy or  table of contents security policies or privacyrelated legal obligations by us or thirdparty service providers or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation or negative publicity and could have an adverse effect on our brand and operating results          we are subject to disparate and complex regulatory and contractual restrictions regarding our rights to use data that we process or produce through our systems if we fail to fully understand or comply with these restrictions we may be subject to liability and increased compliance costs which may harm our business and negatively impact our financial results         we are subject to complex and differing regulatory and contractual restrictions governing our use of data that we process or produce through our systems this includes contractual provisions with our customers our vendors and other third parties we work with as well as our privacy policy and other internal policies and applicable privacy and data security legislation to which we are subject we rely on data we process and information derived from it to provide services to customers develop new offerings and where appropriate and permissible to report on industry trends and elsewhere in our marketing efforts although we monitor these restrictions and have procedures in place to maintain compliance with these requirements there can be no assurance that our compliance efforts will always be effective to ensure compliance and third parties may seek to assert claims that our use of such data in a particular manner is unauthorized         future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves or to determine the scope enforceability and validity of such restrictions or to establish our proprietary rights claimants may have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to sustain the costs of complex litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could regardless of whether such claims have any merit these claims are timeconsuming and costly to evaluate and defend and could  hurt our reputation  adversely affect our relationships with our current or future customers  cause delays or stoppages in providing our services or developing new services  divert managements attention and resources  require technology changes to our software or business practices that would cause us to incur substantial costs  subject us to significant liabilities and  require us to cease some or all of our activities         in addition to liability for monetary damages against us which may be unlimited by contract or regulation and which may include attorneys fees or governmental fines we may be prohibited from operating portions of our business or operating in jurisdictions that are dependent on obtaining such data use rights unless we obtain licenses from and pay royalties to the holders of such rights which may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all if we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any such other actions as a result of misappropriation claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers or other third parties for such claims such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial results          we could incur substantial costs in protecting our intellectual property from infringement and any failure to protect our intellectual property could impair our business         we regard the protection of our intellectual property which includes trade secrets copyrights trademarks and domain names as critical to our success we strive to protect our intellectual property  table of contents rights by relying on federal state and common law rights as well as contractual restrictions we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure and use of our proprietary information however these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others         we have sought protection for some of our technologies and currently have registered trademarks in the commercehub name and several of our product names we also have copyright protection with respect to our software code and protect trade secrets through nondisclosure agreements and employee confidentiality training effective intellectual property protection is expensive to develop and maintain both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights we may be required to protect our intellectual property in an increasing number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions a process that is expensive and may not be successful or which we may not pursue in every location we may over time increase our investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional means including patent and other filings which could be expensive and timeconsuming         despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly and our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property further we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could be costly timeconsuming and distracting to management result in a diversion of resources the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property and have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights these steps may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our solutions and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use copying transfer and disclosure of our licensed solutions may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries further the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states to the extent we expand our international activities our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our solutions and proprietary information may increase         there can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology if we fail to meaningfully protect our intellectual property then our business brand operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed          we have expanded and may expand in the future by acquiring or investing in other companies which may divert our managements attention result in dilution to our stockholders and consume significant resources         our business strategy has included and may include in the future acquiring complementary services solutions technologies or businesses for example in january  we acquired mercent corporation  mercent  in order to expand our demand channel offerings and capabilities we also have  table of contents entered into and may enter into in the future relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in other companies negotiating these transactions can be timeconsuming difficult and expensive and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to conditions or approvals that are beyond our control consequently these transactions even if undertaken and announced may not close         current or future acquisitions investments or new business relationships may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in particular we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired companies particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us the companys software is not easily adapted to work with ours or we have difficulty retaining the customers or partners of any acquired business due to changes in management or otherwise acquisitions may also disrupt our business divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business moreover the anticipated benefits of any acquisition investment or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown liabilities any acquisition or investment may require us to use significant amounts of cash issue potentially dilutive equity securities or incur indebtedness which could be on terms unfavorable to us or that we could be unable to repay in addition acquisitions involve numerous risks any of which could harm our business including  difficulties in integrating the operations technologies services and personnel of acquired businesses especially if those businesses operate outside of our core competency of providing ecommerce saas and saasplus solutions  cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from acquired businesses into our organization  ineffectiveness or incompatibility of acquired technologies or services  failure to successfully further develop the acquired technology in order to recoup our investment  potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses  inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of acquired businesses  diversion of managements attention from other business concerns  litigation for activities of acquired businesses including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties  in the case of foreign acquisitions the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic currency political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries  costs necessary to establish and maintain effective internal controls or other procedures and policies for acquired businesses  increased fixed costs and  adverse tax consequences substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges         any of these risks could harm our business and operating results  table of contents          our longterm success depends in part on our ability to expand the sales of our ecommerce solutions to customers located outside of the united states and thus our business is susceptible to risks associated with international sales and operations         outside of the united states we currently maintain offices and have sales personnel in the united kingdom and service customers in canada as part of our longterm strategy we intend to continue to expand our international operations any international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful in addition conducting international operations in new markets will require considerable management attention and resources is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages cultures customs taxation systems alternative dispute systems regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures and will subject us to additional risks that we have not generally faced in the united states including risks associated with  disparate government regulations from multiple nations relating to ecommerce and other services electronic devices and competition and restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs nationalization and restrictions on foreign ownership  limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure  lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the us  localization of our solutions including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for regulatory requirements and local practices  lack of familiarity and the burdens of complying with applicable foreign laws and legal practices  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements taxes trade laws tariffs export quotas custom duties or other trade restrictions  differing technology standards  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and differing employeremployee relationships including recruiting and retaining employees in foreign countries  fluctuations in exchange rates that may increase the volatility of our foreign based revenue  compliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions in which we conduct business potential double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences including the complexities of foreign value added tax or other tax systems or due to changes in applicable us and foreign tax laws and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  increased costs to establish and maintain effective controls at foreign locations the greater potential for corruption and bribery and compliance with antibribery and anticorruption laws  uncertain political and economic climates  reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and  overall higher costs of doing business internationally         these factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs any negative impact from our international business efforts could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition as a whole further there is no guarantee that the financial performance of our operations in international markets will be similar to our historical operations in the united states and canada a variety of factors including different pricing models and  table of contents costs related to building out additional operational infrastructure in international markets could result in lower gross margins operating margins or cash flow          the loss of key personnel including our chief executive officer or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel may adversely affect our business and limit our ability to implement our business plan successfully         our future success is dependent in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial technical and sales personnel we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous technology and ecommerce companies which may be able to offer more competitive compensation packages our headquarters have been located in albany new york since  and although we have been successful in attracting and retaining highquality managerial technical and sales personnel the pool of available local talent with the specialized skills required for our business is smaller than in larger cities and we may struggle to find adequate replacements if any of our key personnel were to leave although we also have operations seattle washington the competition for talent in seattle is intense due to the increasing number of other technology and ecommerce companies with a large or growing presence in seattle and we cannot be certain we can attract assimilate or retain such personnel in the future in such a competitive environment         the replacement of any key employee likely would involve significant time and costs and the loss of any key employee may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives our inability to attract and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition          conditions in the global economy the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition         our business is sensitive to general economic conditions since  the effects of the global financial crisis have adversely impacted the global economy slower global economic growth the credit market crisis and european debt crisis uncertainty relating to the euro high levels of unemployment globally reduced levels of capital expenditures changes in government fiscal and monetary policies government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration other austerity measures and other challenges affecting the global economy adversely affect us and our customers including having the effect of  reducing demand for our products and services limiting the financing available to our customers and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies  increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  increasing price competition in our served markets  increasing the risk that we could be required to record charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and  increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which in addition to increasing the risks identified above could result in preference actions against us         improvement in the global economy remains uneven and uncertain if slower growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve continues for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  table of contents factors relating to the spinoff          the spinoff could result in a significant tax liability to liberty and its stockholders         it is a condition to the spinoff that liberty receive the opinion of baker botts in form and substance reasonably acceptable to liberty to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff will qualify as a taxfree transaction to liberty and its stockholders under section  of the code except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares         the opinion of baker botts will be based on the law in effect as of the date of the spinoff and will rely upon certain assumptions as well as statements representations and certain undertakings made by officers of liberty and ch parent and john c malone these assumptions statements representations and undertakings are expected to relate to among other things libertys business reasons for engaging in the spinoff the conduct of certain business activities by liberty and ch parent and the plans and intentions of liberty and ch parent to continue conducting those business activities and not to materially modify their ownership or capital structure following the spinoff if any of those statements representations or assumptions is incorrect or untrue in any material respect or any of those undertakings is not complied with or if the facts upon which the opinion is based are materially different from the facts that prevail at the time of the spinoff the conclusions reached in such opinion could be adversely affected         liberty does not intend to seek a ruling from the irs as to the us federal income tax treatment of the spinoff the opinion of baker botts will not be binding on the irs or a court and there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion or that a court would not sustain such a challenge         even if the spinoff otherwise qualifies under section  of the code the spinoff would result in a significant us federal income tax liability to liberty but not to liberty stockholders under section e of the code if one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly a percent or greater interest measured by vote or value in the stock of liberty or in the stock of ch parent excluding for this purpose the acquisition of ch parent common stock by liberty stockholders in the spinoff as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the spinoff any acquisition of the stock of liberty or ch parent or any predecessor or successor corporation within two years before or after the spinoff would be presumed to be part of a plan that includes the spinoff although the parties may be able to rebut that presumption under certain circumstances the process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case notwithstanding the opinion of baker botts described above liberty or ch parent might inadvertently cause or permit a prohibited change in ownership of liberty or ch parent thereby triggering tax liability to liberty which could have a material adverse effect         if for any reason it is subsequently determined that the spinoff does not qualify for taxfree treatment except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock liberty andor its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities determined in the manner described in material us federal income tax consequences

related persons for taxes and losses resulting from the failure of the spinoff to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section  of the code to the extent that such taxes and losses i result primarily from individually or in the aggregate the breach of certain covenants made by our company applicable to actions or failures to act by ch parent and its subsidiaries following the completion of the spinoff or ii result from the application of section e of the code to the spinoff as a result of the treatment of the spinoff as part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to

sharing agreement          we may determine to forgo certain transactions in order to avoid the risk of incurring significant taxrelated liabilities         under the tax sharing agreement we will covenant not to take any action or fail to take any action following the spinoff which action or failure to act is inconsistent with the spinoff qualifying for taxfree treatment under section  of the code further the tax sharing agreement will require that we generally indemnify liberty for any taxes or losses incurred by liberty or its subsidiaries resulting from breaches of such covenants or resulting from the application of section e of the code to the spinoff as a result of the treatment of the spinoff as part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more

forgo certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous         in particular we might determine to continue to operate certain of our business operations for the foreseeable future even if a sale or discontinuance of such business might otherwise be advantageous moreover in light of the requirements of section e of the code we might determine to forgo certain transactions including share repurchases stock issuances certain asset dispositions and other strategic transactions for some period of time following the spinoff in addition our indemnity obligation under the tax sharing agreement might discourage delay or prevent our entering into a change of control transaction for some period of time following the spinoff          we may incur material costs as a result of our separation from liberty         we will incur costs and expenses not previously incurred as a result of our separation from liberty these increased costs and expenses may arise from various sources including financial reporting costs associated with complying with the federal securities laws including compliance with the sarbanesoxley act of  tax administration and human resourcesrelated functions although liberty media will continue to provide certain of these services for us under the services agreement we cannot assure you that the services agreement will continue or that these costs will not be material to our business  table of contents          prior to the spinoff we will not have been an independent public company and we may be unable to make on a timely or costeffective basis the changes necessary to operate as an independent public company         prior to the spinoff our business was operated by liberty as part of its broader corporate organization rather than as an independent company libertys senior management oversaw the strategic direction of our businesses and liberty directly and through its services agreement with liberty media performed various corporate functions for us including but not limited to  selected human resources related functions  tax administration  selected legal functions including compliance with the sarbanesoxley act of  as well as external reporting  treasury administration investor relations internal audit and insurance functions and  selected information technology and telecommunications services         following the spinoff neither liberty nor liberty media will have any obligation to provide these functions to us other than those services that will be provided by liberty media pursuant to the services agreement between us and liberty media if once our services agreement terminates we do not have in place our own systems and business functions we do not have agreements with other providers of these services or we are not able to make these changes cost effectively we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline if liberty media does not continue to perform the services to be provided to us under the services agreement we may not be able to operate our business effectively after the spinoff          we may not realize the potential benefits from the spinoff in the near term or at all         in this prospectus we have described anticipated strategic and financial benefits we expect to realize as a result of our separation from liberty see the spinoffreasons for the spinoff in particular we believe that the spinoff will better position us to take advantage of business opportunities strategic alliances and other acquisitions through ch parents enhanced acquisition currency as well as provide our management team with greater flexibility and independence in making commercial decisions that benefit our company we also expect the spinoff to enable ch parent to provide its employees with more attractive equity incentive awards however no assurance can be given that the market will react favorably to the spinoff or that the current discount applied by the market to the liberty ventures common stock will not be applied to ch parents common stock thereby causing ch parents equity to not be as attractive to its employees and any potential acquisition counterparties in addition no assurance can be given that any investment acquisition or other strategic opportunities will become available following the spinoff on terms that ch parent finds favorable or at all given the added costs associated with the completion of the spinoff including the separate accounting legal and other compliance costs of being a separate public company our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the spinoff in the near term or at all could adversely affect our company          our intercompany agreements are being negotiated while we are a subsidiary of liberty         we are entering into a number of intercompany agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by liberty for our business in addition we are entering into a services agreement with liberty media pursuant to which it will provide to us certain management administrative financial treasury accounting tax legal and other services for which we will reimburse them on a fixedfee basis the terms of all of these agreements specifically the reorganization and tax sharing agreements are being established while we are a  table of contents subsidiary of liberty and therefore may not be the result of armslength negotiations although we believe that the negotiations with liberty media regarding the services and facilities sharing agreements will be at armslength the persons negotiating on behalf of liberty media also serve as officers of liberty as described above we believe that the terms of these intercompany agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances however conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements after the spinoff see certain relationships and related party transactions          libertys board of directors may abandon the spinoff at any time and its board of directors may determine to amend the terms of any agreement we enter into relating to the spinoff         no assurance can be given that the spinoff will occur or if it occurs that it will occur on the terms described in this prospectus in addition to the conditions to the spinoff described herein certain of which may be waived by the liberty board of directors in its sole discretion the liberty board of directors may abandon the spinoff at any time prior to the distribution date for any reason or for no reason in addition the agreements to be entered into by ch parent with

the liberty ventures common stock held by a stockholder after the spinoff will be less than equal to or greater than the market value of a share of the corresponding series of liberty ventures common stock held by such stockholder prior to the spinoff         the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates  the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and  domestic and foreign economic conditions          transactions in our common stock by our directors officers and employees could depress the market price of our common stock         following the spinoff our directors officers and employees will own shares of and equity incentive awards with respect to our common stock sales of or other transactions relating to shares of our common stock by our directors officers or employees could cause a perception in the marketplace that our stock price has peaked or that adverse events or trends have occurred or may be occurring at our company this perception can result notwithstanding any personal financial motivation for these  table of contents insider transactions as a result insider transactions could depress the market price for shares of one or more series of our common stock in addition in connection with the spinoff outstanding equity incentive awards with respect to commercehubs existing common stock will be converted into options to acquire shares of our series c common stock some of these awards have fully vested while others remain subject to vesting conditions we cannot predict the frequency or magnitude of any option exercises following the spinoff we will implement a brokerassisted option settlement program which will allow our optionholders to exercise their awards

periodically reviews with management the strategic goals and prospects of its various businesses equity affiliates and other investments in  liberty recapitalized its common stock into two new tracking stocks the interactive group which in  was renamed the qvc group and the ventures group for the purpose of creating greater transparency for the assets and liabilities attributed to each group among other reasons our company is currently attributed to the ventures group having previously been attributed to the qvc group the qvc group common stock and liberty ventures common stock are intended to track and reflect the economic performance of the qvc group and the ventures group respectively tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or track the economic performance of a particular business or group rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole while the qvc group and the ventures group have separate collections of businesses assets and liabilities attributed to them no group is a separate legal entity and therefore no group can own assets issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements holders of tracking stocks have no direct claim to the groups assets and are not represented by separate boards of directors instead holders of tracking stock are stockholders of the parent corporation with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation the ventures group is comprised primarily of libertys operating subsidiaries bodybuilding and commercehub and libertys interests in expedia ftd interval and lendingtree along with investments in twx and twc cash certain liabilities related to exchangeable debentures of liberty llc and certain deferred tax liabilities the qvc group is primarily focused on libertys merchandisefocused televisedshopping programs internet and mobile application businesses and has attributed to it libertys operating subsidiaries qvc and zulily and libertys interest in hsn along with cash and certain liabilities that reside with qvc and the other attributed entities as well as outstanding senior notes and one series of liberty llcs exchangeable debentures and certain deferred tax liabilities at present liberty intends to pursue a plan to spinoff a newly formed company liberty expedia holdings inc comprised of among other things its entire ownership interest in expedia and its subsidiary bodybuilding in the event such spinoff occurs libertys interest in expedia and bodybuilding will no longer be attributed to the ventures group similarly upon completion of the spinoff commercehub will no longer be attributed to the ventures group         although the public markets have responded favorably to these two tracking stocks liberty believes that the public markets continue to apply a meaningful discount to the underlying value of the businesses and assets attributed to the ventures group in establishing the trading value of the liberty ventures common stock due to the interrelationships of the businesses of liberty the multiple layers of financial reporting and uncertainty with respect to the allocation of corporate opportunities and capital resources among libertys tracking stock groups accordingly in the fall of  the liberty board of directors determined to pursue the spinoff as described in more detail below         our company is currently a subsidiary of liberty following the spinoff our principal business assets and liabilities will consist of commercehub such business and assets as well as any related liabilities the ch parent assets and liabilities  to accomplish the spinoff following the internal restructuring as described below liberty will effect the distribution whereby holders of lvnta and lvntb will receive by means of a dividend shares of our series a common stock and series c common stock and shares of our series b common stock and series c common stock respectively holders of qvca and qvcb will not receive shares of our common stock in the spinoff following the spinoff liberty will cease to own any equity interest in our company and we will be an independent publicly traded company no vote of libertys stockholders is required or being sought in connection with the spinoff and holders of liberty ventures common stock will have no appraisal rights in connection with the spinoff  table of contents reasons for the spinoff         in determining to approve the spinoff liberty believed that the spinoff would result in the creation of stockholder value because it believed the aggregate trading value of our common stock and the liberty ventures common stock would exceed the aggregate trading value of the liberty ventures common stock in the absence of the spinoff the liberty board of directors took into account a number of factors in approving the spinoff including the following  the creation of a more traditional assetbacked security in our common stock is expected to provide greater transparency for investors with respect to our business resulting in more focus and attention by the investment community on our business and better highlighting our value  the spinoff is expected to provide greater flexibility and independence for our management team to make quick and decisive commercial decisions that would benefit our company as our companys management team is currently required to gain approval from liberty for key strategic decisions  the spinoff is expected to provide our company with a more attractive equity currency to use to fund strategic acquisitions and opportunities we believe that our independent publicly traded stock following the spinoff should be more efficiently valued as compared to the value the market currently assigns to our company as a subsidiary of liberty further we believe that the reduced complexity of our capital structure following the spinoff as compared to liberty as well as our ability to offer a pureplay equity currency will allow us to make more competitive acquisition offers consisting of consideration that is more attractive to target stockholders  the spinoff is expected to enhance the ability of our company to more effectively tailor our employee benefit plans and retention programs including by converting our cashsettled equity awards into stocksettled equity awards which will allow us to preserve capital to grow our business and avoid liquidity issues in addition we believe the issuance of our independent publicly traded and more efficiently priced equity securities following the spinoff will be more attractive to our management and employees and less dilutive to our stockholders liberty also expects that its outstanding equity awards with respect to liberty ventures common stock will become more valuable and attractive following the spinoff as a result of the expected increase in the aggregate trading price of the liberty ventures common stock and our common stock thereby becoming a more effective tool in incentivizing and retaining its management and employees         the liberty board of directors also considered a number of costs and risks associated with the spinoff in approving the spinoff including the following  after the spinoff the liberty ventures common stock and our company will each have smaller individual market capitalizations than the current market capitalization of the liberty ventures common stock and their trading prices may be more volatile than the liberty ventures tracking stock price was prior to the spinoff the board also considered the possibility that the combined market values of the separate stocks may be lower than the market value of the liberty ventures common stock prior to the spinoff  the risk of being unable to achieve the benefits expected from the spinoff  the loss of synergies from operating as one company particularly with respect to administrative and support functions  the potential disruption of the businesses of liberty and commercehub as their management and employees devote time and resources to completing the spinoff  the substantial costs of effecting the spinoff and continued compliance with legal and other requirements applicable to two separate public reporting companies and  table of contents  the potential tax liabilities that could arise from the spinoff including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the spinoff is taxable to holders of liberty ventures common stock andor to liberty in the event such tax liabilities were to arise our companys potential indemnity obligation to liberty is not subject to a cap         libertys board of directors evaluated the costs and benefits of the transaction as a whole and did not find it necessary to assign relative weights to the specific factors considered libertys board of directors concluded however that the potential benefits of the spinoff outweighed its potential costs and that separating our company from liberty in the form of a distribution to libertys stockholders that is generally taxfree is appropriate advisable and in the best interests of liberty and its stockholders internal restructuring         prior to the spinoff liberty will effect an internal restructuring resulting in commercehub becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of our company the internal restructuring  as a result of the internal restructuring upon the effective time of the spinoff approximately      ·       of the shares of our series c common stock will be held by former minority holders of commercehub the commercehub minority holders  providing liquidity to such minority holders as we expect that shares of our series c common stock will trade on the nasdaq global select market following completion of the spinoff as described in more detail above interests of certain persons         in connection with the spinoff the executive officers and directors of liberty will receive adjustments to their stock incentive awards with respect to liberty ventures common stock and stock incentive awards with respect to ch parent common stock see effect of the spinoff on outstanding liberty ventures incentive awards below for more information         the executive officers of ch parent are entitled to indemnification with respect to actions taken by them in connection with the spinoff under the organizational documents of ch parent as well as customary indemnification agreements to which ch parent and these persons are parties         the liberty board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them when it approved the spinoff conditions to the spinoff         libertys board of directors has reserved the right in its sole discretion to amend modify delay or abandon the spinoff and the related transactions at any time prior to the distribution date in addition the completion of the spinoff and related transactions are subject to the satisfaction as determined by the liberty board of directors in its sole discretion of the following conditions certain of which may be waived by the liberty board of directors in its sole discretion  receipt of the opinion of baker botts in form and substance reasonably acceptable to liberty to the effect that the spinoff will qualify as a taxfree

of the liberty ventures common stock that the stockholder held immediately before the spinoff allocated between such shares of liberty ventures common stock and shares of our common stock in

        we provide a cloudbased ecommerce fulfillment and marketing software platform of integrated supply demand and delivery solutions for large retailers online marketplaces and digital marketing channels collectively demand channels  and consumer brands manufacturers and distributors collectively suppliers  our software platform acts as a hub that allows trading partnersour customersto conduct omnichannel commercial relationships in consumer and businesstobusiness ecommerce markets approximately  trading partners have access to our platform daily to exchange critical information with each other including orders invoices product information and other electronic documents collectively our trading partner customers constitute a vibrant network of the largest retailers marketplaces and brands in north america including qvc walmart costco dell and many others that use our platform to interact with one another to more efficiently manage and orchestrate sophisticated supplychain strategies across thousands of trading partners and physical distribution facilities we estimate that in  our customers used commercehub to enable approximately  billion in the order volume and total economic value of goods gross merchandise value or gmv          the value of our trading partner network continues to grow over time as more partners are added for example a retailer or online marketplace that wishes to do business with any of the suppliers on our network need only integrate their information system with commercehub once to gain the ability to send orders to any of these suppliers conversely a supplier that wishes to do business with multiple retailers on our platform need only integrate their own system to commercehub once through an initial integration that can then be further configured to connect the supplier to other retailers on the platform our existing volume of retailer marketplace and supplier customers constitute a critical mass of many of the most important players in north american ecommerce this has helped our company achieve a meaningful network effect whereby new suppliers are attracted to our network because of our retailer and marketplace customers and new retailer and marketplace customers are attracted by our ability to facilitate their interaction with thousands of potential suppliers this network effect has allowed us to grow our business with a comparatively low cost of customer acquisition         commercehub was founded because online retailers have since the beginning of ecommerce faced significant difficulties providing their customers with a large assortment of products for sale online the difficulties were both financial and operational for example buying products from suppliers and holding them in inventory requires a significant amount of financial capital similarly operating warehouses that receive and prepare orders for shipment is expensive and difficult commercehub helps solve these problems by providing a platform where retailers and suppliers can more easily exchange electronic information and by enabling suppliers to process and ship customer orders on retailers behalf through commercehubs platform retailers are able to leverage the virtual inventory provided by a network of suppliers without losing control over the fulfillment process and suppliers are able to unlock new sources of demand for their products         we have continued to enhance our software platform and introduce new solutions that we believe position us well for the further evolution of ecommerce as ecommerce continues to take a larger share of overall retail sales consumers have embraced online marketplaces such as amazon ebay and jet which provide a broad selection of products that are sold and fulfilled by thirdparty retailers coinciding with the trend toward larger product assortments digital advertising platforms such as facebook google and pinterest have put the speed and power of ecommerce in the palm of consumers hands through applications on mobile devices at the same time consumer expectations have increased to the point where fast and free or nearlyfree delivery has become the norm  table of contents         our solutions unite supply demand and delivery and provide our customers with a single platform to source and market the products consumers desire and to have those products delivered more rapidly to the consumers doorstep         specifically we provide our customers with the following solutions  supply solutions   enable retailers to expand their product offerings without the economic and logistical limitations or risks typically associated with carrying physical inventory  demand solutions   provide retailers and suppliers with a single platform to gain greater access to shopper demand through a single connection to retail channels marketplaces paid search social and advertising channels and  delivery solutions   facilitate rapid costefficient ontime delivery with greater control of and visibility into the consumer experience by leveraging our solutions to allow our customers to coordinate more effectively with delivery providers         through our supply solutions retailers and online marketplaces gain the ability to sell a broad selection of products without the cost of buying storing and shipping inventory from warehouses by leveraging our network of approximately  dropship capable suppliers and thirdparty marketplace sellers that receive orders from demand channels and ship products directly to consumers         our demand solutions provide access and management capability for the largest and most important ecommerce channels in north america commercehubs platform allows sellers such as consumer brands distributors and manufacturers to sell through major retailers including walmart qvc costco and dell as well as leading online marketplaces such as amazon ebay and jet in addition companies that sell directly to consumers through their own websites can use commercehub to place advertisements list products for sale and promote awareness of their products on google shopping yahoo shopping pinterest facebook comparison shopping engines and other ecommerce marketing channels         our delivery solutions enable more rapid delivery through more efficient use of national regional local and specialty carriers for example our solution for enhanced delivery experience allows retailers to automatically and cost effectively adjust carrier service levels to meet consumer delivery promise dates to help reduce delivery times our network of thirdparty logistics partners helps retailers and sellers distribute inventory to locations that are closer to a wider distribution of consumers thus reducing their delivery cost while simultaneously enabling consumers to receive their products quickly         we seek to grow our business by  continuing to grow overall usage of our platform including gmv we process through our platform  table of contents  expanding the number of retailertosupplier connections within our existing customer base  leveraging our expansive trading partner network of retail customers to attract new suppliers and our expansive network of suppliers to attract new retail and marketplace customers  enabling our existing customers to more easily sell their product assortments through newly emerging ecommerce channels such as social networks  expanding our offerings and retail customer base to new geographic markets outside of the united states and canada  providing flexible integration options that allow any supplier regardless of their level of technical sophistication to meet the requirements to sell through major retailers and marketplaces and  continuing to develop new and innovative solutions and features that help our customers capture a larger share of the growing ecommerce market to further increase the volume of ecommerce transactions processed through our platform         our company was founded in  by frank poore and richard jones and was acquired by qk holdings inc in august  and later by liberty in may  our role as strategic partner to retailers and their suppliers         commercehub is generally viewed as a mission critical partner to our retailer and supplier customers we believe our solutions directly address the most important issues facing companies that are selling online today retailers and brands that sell directtoconsumer face a challenging market environment characterized by flat to declining retail store sales more demanding consumer expectations in terms of product availability and delivery and the proliferation of emerging search and social ecommerce channels to convert sales commercehubs platform and solutions enable our customers to meet these market challenges and more efficiently grow their online sales as a percentage of their overall business         there are several elements of our business that have enabled us to generate significant value for our demand channel and supplier customers we have a long history of successfully helping our customers reduce the overall complexity of their relationships to help grow their revenue through ecommerce our solutions help our customers grow their online sales by facilitating more rapid fulfillment of consumer orders and allowing them to capture more consumer demand through marketplaces and digital advertising channels many of our customers use our supply solutions to enable a large percentage of their overall online sales our demand solutions provide our customers with a valuable means for attracting profitable consumer traffic to their websites we believe that this combination of supply enabling the fulfillment of consumer orders through a network of suppliers with demand connecting suppliers and retailers to consumer demand by facilitating access to online marketing channels is unique in the industry and provides us with a compelling platform to continue to successfully grow our business         because our solutions play a critical role in helping our customers manage a complex array of business relationships in a highly competitive retail environment we have benefited from strong loyalty and enduring longterm relationships with our customers in addition we believe we are becoming an increasingly strategic partner to our overall set of trading partner customers as we become increasingly integrated into their systems and gotomarket efforts as the amount of business conducted through our platform increases and as more retailers and suppliers connect centrally into the commercehub platform         further enhancing the value of our platform are valueadded capabilities that we continue to add to our platform for the benefit of our customers most of the new features we add to our platform are  table of contents developed based on feedback we receive from our customers regarding challenges they face in ecommerce for example the following capabilities solve unique issues related to virtual inventory fulfillment including  managing high dropship order volumes with multiple parties each consumer order must be managed with at least one third party that fulfills the order on the sellers behalf which is more complex than traditional direct fulfillment a complexity that increases exponentially when scaled across large retailer transaction volumes  retail branding requirements retailers frequently desire that the multiparty dropship fulfillment process be invisible to the consumer which requires that thirdparty suppliers include retailerbranded packing slips and other materials in shipments to consumers and  insight analytics and proactive error resolution retailers must monitor and track a high volume of dropship orders and identify shipments that are at risk of missing the consumers delivery promise date our industry         ecommerce has grown significantly over the last several years as consumers have increasingly shifted their retail purchases from traditional brickandmortar stores to online stores and marketplaces this growth has been due to a number of factors including  the availability of a broader selection of merchandise online  consumer convenience and ease of use  more competitive and transparent pricing  increased functionality and reliability of ecommerce websites  the emergence of mobileconnected devices and specialized websites and  the proliferation of online distribution channels         as a result of these factors consumers today have more options to discover research and purchase products online although these ecommerce growth drivers create significant opportunity for retailers and brand manufacturers they also create additional complexities and challenges retailers and brand manufacturers seeking new avenues to expand their online sales must manage product data transactions and delivery promises across hundreds of highly fragmented online channels with different requirements for conducting business varying data attributes evolving business models and competitive pressure to increase the pace of innovation         in addition to the shift toward ecommerce retailing the organic growth of the economy and consumer spending provide an additional tailwind in this environment wellrun brickandmortar retailers have increasingly focused on optimizing the interplay between their physical and online storefronts this omnichannel approach allows customers to shop and interact between channels in a more fluid manner this in turn allows shoppers to buy a product online but pick it up instore retailers to fulfill online orders through instore delivery by using their stores as warehouses and shoppers to return a product purchased online to an instore location an omnichannel strategy allows a retailer to position its physical storefront not as a balance sheet liability but rather as part of a platform to provide consumers with a more consistent convenient and effortless retail experience regardless of how they choose to engage the retailer as a result of its success we believe that omnichannel strategies now represent a more significant component of all retailers revenue mix         growth in ecommerce spending has consistently outpaced overall growth in retail sales a trend that is expected to continue based on data from the us department of commerce ecommerce  table of contents spending in the us has grown at a compound annual rate of  since  exceeding  billion in  when it amounted to  of all retail sales during the same period total noninflation adjusted retail sales offline and online grew at a compounded annual rate of  ecommerce fulfillment industry background         the ecommerce fulfillment industry enables thousands of retailers around the world to transact and grow their relationships with tens of thousands of suppliers additional participants in this market include thirdparty logistics providers parcel carriers and other delivery companies fulfillment and warehousing providers and sourcing companies supply chain management involves communicating data about the goods themselves data related to the exchange of goods among these trading partners and information about the many thousands of companies who are members of the supply chain community at virtually every stage of the supply chain there are inefficient laborintensive processes between trading partners  eg  retailers and their suppliers or sellers and the online marketplaces on which the sellers list their goods for sale with administrative and communication requirements such as the exchange of product information between trading partners for the purpose of listing products for sale and verifying the status of goods before shipment while in transit and upon delivery to ensure that consumers receive the products they ordered by the date promised mistakes made during these processes negatively impact trading partners and their businesses either through penalties that counterparties impose or through poor consumer experiences that discourage future purchases ecommerce fulfillment solutions must address trading partners needs for integration collaboration connectivity visibility and data analytics to improve the speed accuracy and efficiency with which goods are ordered and supplied         the industry initially focused on electronically connecting retailers and suppliers over the internet to avoid costly and errorprone manual paper and faxbased communication processes the next evolution included automating and streamlining these fulfillment transactions between retailers suppliers and others in the supply chain ensuring orders were placed accurately and quickly and that goods were delivered on time and in accordance with the retailers requirements         as familiarity and acceptance of cloudbased services continues to accelerate we believe companies both large and small will continue to turn to cloudbased solutions such as ours for their supply chain integration needs as opposed to traditional onpremise software deployment traditional solutions         traditional ecommerce fulfillment solutions ranging from nonautomated paper or fax solutions to electronic solutions that are implemented using onpremise licensed software tend to focus primarily on fulfillment automation within a single facility and among a small network of trading partners onpremise licensed software provides connectivity between only one organization and its trading partners and typically requires significant time and technical expertise to configure deploy and maintain and to accommodate new trading partners added to the network providers of onpremise licensed software primarily link retailers and suppliers through the electronic data interchange  edi  protocol that enables the structured electronic transmission of data between organizations because of setup and maintenance costs technical complexity and a growing volume of requirements from retailers the traditional software model is not wellsuited for many retailers and suppliers especially where the network includes small and mediumsized suppliers with smaller information technology budgets         additionally the traditional approach to supply chain automation involves a system architecture made up of many pointtopoint connections between retailers and their suppliers these multiple connections are inherently errorprone and can be difficult to adapt to changing requirements and market circumstances for instance if there is a broad trend in the market that many members of a  table of contents retailing segment would like to adopt a supplier would be faced with a series of enhancements on a onebyone basis to the collection of connections they have with their retailers lacking flexibility and adaptability traditional approaches do not have the architectural capabilities necessary for retailers and suppliers to maximize the opportunities presented by the rapid evolution of market trends expansion of product assortments         while online retailing has removed the shelfspace constraints placed on retailers wanting to offer a large product assortment to consumers it has not removed the physical and operational constraints of storing products in inventory and providing the capability to quickly ship products to consumers when they are ordered in fact the ability to offer massive numbers of products for sale online has put more pressure on retailers to invest in additional warehouse and distribution operations and to increase financial capital investments to purchase and maintain larger inventories of goods for sale as an alternative to expensive infrastructure investment retailers looking to increase the number of products they offer often turn to thirdparty fulfillment mechanisms specifically dropship fulfillment to offer a wider array of product assortments through virtual inventory without expanding distribution center capacity or increasing financial investment in inventory with dropshipping a retailer or online marketplace seller is able to take a consumers order and provide it to a supplier that then delivers the product directly to the consumer the consumer perceives that the product was received directly from the retailer even though the retailer never held the ordered items in inventory         retailers impose their own specifications on their trading partners for electronically communicating their supply chain information these specifications set the standards for transmitting and acknowledging invoices inventory reporting purchase orders and shipping notices suppliers that transact with multiple retailers need to accommodate different specifications unique to each retailer which often vary based on a retailers size industry and technological capabilities suppliers that fail to comply with a retail partners specifications risk errors with processing orders and compliance fines such recurring performance issues may cause a retailer to discontinue its relationship with a supplier as a result suppliers are increasingly seeking out solutions to help them manage these challenges and improve their service levels with the retailers they supply         before retailers and suppliers are able to exchange electronic files for order fulfillment they must first exchange data related to the suppliers products additionally the retailer must transform the supplierprovided product data into a format that the retailers online storefront supports and enhance the data in a way that makes the product appear more compelling to consumers this enhancement includes rewriting product titles and descriptions creating additional data attributes that describe the products and manipulating product images to conform to the retailers standards all of this work falls under the responsibility of individual retailer and supplier employees who frequently rely on general purpose software and tools such as email and spreadsheets to accomplish these tasks this results in laborintensive and errorprone processes with no activity tracking or management capabilities the inefficiency of this process directly impacts a retailers financial performance by increasing the amount of time and resources required to list products for sale online or by reducing the number of products a retailer is able to carry online due to capacity constraints resulting from the manual tasks a similar exercise takes place in the context of an online marketplace where sellers must list products for sale and describe them in a manner that conforms to the marketplaces requirements driving demand         ecommerce is a large and global market that continues to expand as retailers and manufacturers continue to increase their online sales however it is also an increasingly complex and fragmented market due to the hundreds of channels available to retailers and manufacturers and the rapid pace of change and innovation across those channels historically a retailer or manufacturer might have simply established an online storefront and used a basic paid search program to drive traffic to its website  table of contents today in order to gain consumers attention in a more crowded and competitive online marketplace many retailers and an increasing number of manufacturers sell their merchandise through multiple online channels often referred to as an omnichannel marketing strategy each with its own rules requirements and specifications in addition retailers and manufacturers often seek to sell their products in multiple countries each with its own local consumer preferences and behaviors         the fragmentation and increasing complexity of ecommerce channels is placing greater demands on retailers and consumer brands that seek to grow their online sales these retailers and brands need omnichannel solutions that enable them to easily integrate their product offerings and inventory across multiple online channels traditional solutions however typically suffer from several limitations inhouse solutions are often costly slow to implement and difficult to keep current external solutions are often too narrowly tailored or aimed at helping retailers and manufacturers manage a single online channel or single category of channels rather than multiple platforms in a unified approach delivering products         from the consumers perspective an ecommerce transaction is not complete until the ordered products arrive at their doorstep there is room for error in even the simplest fulfillment process where a retailer is operating a single distribution facility with a small inventory of products the complexity of having a large network of thirdparty dropship suppliers significantly increases the management complexity and likelihood of error instead of managing a single distribution facility a retailer must ensure that hundreds and potentially thousands of thirdparty suppliers are shipping the correct product to the correct consumer address and that the product will arrive at the consumers doorstep by the date the retailer promised every ecommerce order must be split into its component line items and transmitted to the relevant supplier which must then select the appropriate carrier service level to meet the delivery promise date without management of the process across suppliers the retailer risks uncontrolled costs as each supplier makes their own shipping decisions and then charges back to the retailer the cost of delivery however the consequences of poor supplier network performance are even more significant as the consumer will blame the retailer for any fulfillment problems caused by the thirdparty supplier thus damaging the customers perception of the retailers brand commercehub solutions and capabilities         our solutions help retailers consumer brands manufacturers distributors and other market participants reduce the complexity of selling products through online sales channels including by sourcing through

the volume of activity our customers achieve through our platform and from recurring subscription fees the remaining portion of our revenue comes from services we provide to new and existing customers including highly targeted services that are focused on helping our customers quickly adopt our solutions and maximize their utility         usage revenue is derived primarily from fees charged to retailers and suppliers for their use of our platform to conduct business with their trading partners currently these usage fees are primarily influenced by the volume of customer orders related to our supply solutions that are processed through our platform usage revenue also consists of fees for activity related to inventory management thirdparty communication and fees related to the volume of online sales our customers achieve on certain demand channels         a customers recurring subscription fee is based on several factors including the number and type of trading partners  eg  online retailers that a customer is connected to through our platform the number and type of demand channels  eg  marketplaces digital advertising channels and social networks a customer accesses through our platform and the adoption of certain available feature upgrades that further enhance the functionality of our platform total recurring subscription revenue grows as new trading partner customers join the platform as those trading partners connect and create relationships with other trading partners and as our customers adopt new features and upgrades that we make available         our revenue is currently generated primarily from the united states and canada regulatory matters us and foreign law and regulation         various laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries apply both directly and indirectly to our online commerce business for example us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy online commerce and communications taxation intellectual property and the provision of goods and services through the internet may affect our business us and foreign laws and regulations are subject to the actions of us and foreign governments at the national state regional and local levels and to interpretation by us and foreign courts the application of us and foreign laws and regulations to our business therefore is uncertain and subject to change data privacy and security         we are subject to laws governing the collection use retention security and transfer of personallyidentifiable information about our customers the enactment interpretation and application of user data protection and privacy laws are in a state of flux and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country for example on december   the european commission the european parliament and the council of the european union  council  reached agreement on new data laws that give consumers additional rights and impose additional restrictions  table of contents and penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information the european parliament and the council are expected to adopt the new laws in early  with the laws to take effect two years later further on october   the court of justice of the european union invalidated the safe harbor framework which had allowed companies to collect and process personal data in european union nations for use in the us european union and us authorities announced on february   that they had reached agreement on a new data transfer framework called the euus privacy shield the european union and the us must implement the new framework which may be subject to legal challenge         in the us the federal trade commission has proposed a privacy policy framework and legislation is pending in congress that would require organizations that suffer a breach of security related to personal information to provide notice of such breach many states have adopted laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach affecting personal data such as californias information practices act complying with these different national and state privacy requirements may cause our business to incur substantial costs in addition online commerce businesses such as ours have and post on their websites privacy policies and practices regarding the collection use and disclosure of user data a failure to comply with such posted privacy policies or with the regulatory requirements of federal state or foreign privacy laws could result in proceedings or actions by governmental agencies or others such as class action litigation which could adversely affect our business technical violations of certain privacy laws can result in significant penalties including statutory penalties in  the federal communications commission  fcc  amended its regulations under the telephone consumer protection act  tcpa  which could subject our business to increased liability for certain telephonic communications with customers including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones under the tcpa plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of  per violation whichever is greater and courts may treble such damage awards for willful or knowing violations data collection privacy and security are growing public concerns congress and individual states and foreign legislative bodies may consider additional online privacy legislation online commerce         our business also must comply with other federal and state laws and regulations regarding online communications and commerce to the extent applicable to our business for example the childrens online privacy protection act prohibits web sites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age  without parental consent and imposes a number of operational requirements certain email activities are subject to the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act of  commonly known as the canspam act the canspam act regulates the sending of unsolicited commercial email by requiring the email sender among other things to comply with specific disclosure requirements and to provide an optout mechanism for recipients both of these laws include statutory penalties for noncompliance the digital millennium copyright act limits but does not eliminate liability for listing or linking to thirdparty websites that may include content that infringes on copyrights or other rights so long as our business complies with the statutory requirements various states also have adopted laws regulating certain aspects of internet communications on february   the president signed legislation that permanently extends the moratorium on state and local taxes on internet access and commerce         additional internetrelated laws and regulations adopted in the future may cover issues such as defamatory speech copyright infringement pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services such additional laws or regulations may slow the growth of ecommerce services and the internet which could in turn cause a decline in the demand for our customers online commerce business and increase our cost or our customers cost of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial conditions moreover the applicability of existing  table of contents laws governing issues such as property ownership libel personal privacy and taxation to commercial online services and the internet is uncertain and could expose our business to substantial liability         on february   the fcc adopted rules in its open internet proceeding that could restrict the ability of broadband providers to block or otherwise disadvantage our business among other things the open internet rules prohibit internet service providers from  blocking access to or impairing or degrading legal content applications services or nonharmful devices and  favoring selected internet traffic several broadband providers have challenged the open internet rules in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  dc circuit  the dc circuit is expected to rule on the challenge in  proposed changes in law and regulation         the regulation of internet services and access privacy data protection ecommerce and related matters is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past decade further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated and there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by future legislation regulation or deregulation intellectual

protection and reliance on common law trademark rights we also register copyrights and domain names as necessary competition         we compete primarily with other saas providers servicing the ecommerce industry however the competitive dynamics of our market are unpredictable because it is fragmented and rapidly evolving due to the nature of our business and the variety of products we offer we do not believe there is any particular competitor or small group of competitors that compete with our business as a whole rather our competitors vary by our solutions and offerings our supply solutions compete with similar offerings from vendornet which is owned by ebay enterprise and sps commerce inc in north america and virtualstock and kewill among others in europe in addition our supply solutions also face competition from inhouse developed solutions used by retailers that choose to build and maintain their own proprietary integrations to online channels using a combination of order management custom written software and valueadded networks our demand solutions have competitors in a highly fragmented market including channeladvisor corporation merchant advantage and various advertising and digital marketing agencies         we believe that there are several factors unique to our business that differentiate our solutions in the competitive marketplace including  the

determinable         in most instances revenue from new customer acquisition is generated under sales agreements with multiple elements comprised of subscription fees usage fees and related activation setup fees that allow retailers and suppliers to access the companys solutions customers do not have the contractual right to take possession of the companys cloud software the company evaluates each element in a multipleelement arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting an element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has standalone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within the companys control         subscription fees are charged on a standalone basis or in association with a minimum usage level required to be maintained by a customer in connection with our demand solutions the company recognizes subscription fees as revenue in the period in which such subscription fee is earned usage fees are comprised of fees charged to customers based on the level of a customers utilization of our solutions usage fee revenues are generated primarily from customer orders content services inventory management and thirdparty communication services the company recognizes usage fee revenue in the period in which such usage is earned         setup fees provide access to the companys ondemand service solution through production launch and are billed during the implementation phase and recorded as deferred revenue until a customers subscription period has commenced on a limited basis during a customers subscription term the company provides professional services to enhance the customers ondemand service solution setup fees and professional services related to customer solution enhancements do not have standalone value because they are only sold in conjunction with a subscription to our ondemand solutions they are only sold by the company a customer could not resell them and they do not represent the culmination of a separate earnings process setup fees without standalone value are recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the expected customer life which is currently estimated between  and  months based on the customer type and solution for which the setup fee is associated the company recognizes revenue for fees billed for solution enhancement services over the estimated remaining customer life the company evaluates the length of the amortization period based on our experience with customer contract renewals and consideration of the period over which those customers will benefit from the related offerings         deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of billed subscription and setup fees software and deferred costs         software and deferred costs consists of the cost of software that is acquired or internally developed and integration costs as follows         software costs     the company capitalizes the cost of acquired software payroll and payrollrelated costs and thirdparty consulting fees incurred in developing and enhancing the companys platform and related product offerings as internal use software software costs are amortized over two to three years which is the companys estimate of the average useful life of acquired and internally developed software we continue to evaluate the useful life of capitalized software and it is possible that in the future the period over which such software costs are amortized may be adjusted any change in our estimate of the useful life of capitalized software will affect our future results of operations  table of contents         integration costs     the company defers payroll and payrollrelated costs incurred in setting up and integrating new demand channels and suppliers onto our platform integration costs are amortized on a straightline basis over the expected life of the customer contract generally  to  months we continue to evaluate the expected life of our customer relationships and it is possible that in the future the period over which such integration costs are recognized may be adjusted any change in our estimate of the customer relationship life will affect our future results of operations sharebased compensation stock options         from the periods  through  commercehub granted nonqualified stock option units to its employees and directors at the grant date fair value these options typically vested  each year over the first four years and have a contractual expiration date of ten years stock option liquidity program         during  commercehub adopted a stock option liquidity program the liquidity program for eligible holders of stock options and certain eligible common shares shares issued as a result of an option exercise the liquidity program provides eligible option holders and stockholders the ability to cancel their vested options or sell their eligible common shares in exchange for cash payment cash consideration for the purchase and cancellation of tendered stock options is based on the fair value of commercehubs underlying common stock on the liquidity election date less the stock option exercise price the company expects to terminate the liquidity program upon the effectiveness of the spinoff stock appreciation rights program         since  commercehub has awarded stock appreciation rights sars at the fair value of commercehubs common stock on the date of grant all participants are eligible to tender their vested sars under the program and prior to the spinoff upon exercise the participant is entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the difference between the sar grant price and the then current fair value after the spinoff it is expected that participants will receive options of commercehub inc series c common stock resulting in the same value pre and post spinoff estimating the fair value of common stock         the fair value of shares granted under commercehubs stock option and sar plans in addition to the value used to estimate the stockbased compensation liability and related expense each period and upon an option holder or stockholder liquidity election under the liquidity program is based on commercehubs best estimate of commercehubs underlying common stock price with the assistance of an independent thirdparty advisory firm commercehub estimates the value of common stock through a combination of three different approaches  market multiple approach  guideline transaction approach  discounted cash flow dcf approach         the market multiple approach involves the capitalization of revenue and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and option expense multiples are determined through an analysis of certain publicly traded companies selected on a basis of operational and economic similarity with the principal business and operational revenue model of commercehub multiples are calculated for the comparative companies based upon their trading prices the risk analysis incorporates quantitative and qualitative risk factors which relate to among other things the nature of the industry in which  table of contents commercehub and the other comparative companies are engaged relative size profitability and growth rates         the guideline transaction approach is similar to the market multiple approach in that it involves a consideration of multiples of revenue and adjusted ebitda however multiples used for this approach were determined through the analysis of transactions involving controlling interests in companies with operations similar to commercehubs business         internally prepared financial projections are used to develop the dcf approach a valuation method that estimates the present value of the projected cash flows to be generated from the business in the dcf approach a discount rate reflecting all risks of ownership and associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows is applied to the stream of projected cash flows estimating stock option and sar values         with the assistance of an independent thirdparty advisory firm the company estimates the fair value of stock options and sars granted at each financial statement reporting date using a blackscholes optionpricing model blackscholes model the blackscholes model incorporates assumptions to value stockbased awards including the riskfree rate of return expected term volatility and dividend yield we utilize a single riskfree interest rate over the expected term of each grant the company estimates the riskfree interest rate based on the constant maturity us treasury yield curve as of the date of the valuation for the expected term of the stock option or sar award granted our assumption for the expected term of stock option and sar awards is  years based on historical exercise data for those options and sars that have been outstanding for more than  years as of the valuation date we estimate the life of such awards to be  years we estimate the volatility of our common stock by analyzing both the historical and implied volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies the same peer group used in the market multiple approach in determining commercehubs common stock share value our expected dividend yield is zero as commercehub has not paid any dividends on our common stock to date and does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future         stock compensation expense is recorded at the fair value as described above relative to the grant date of the respective stock option or sars award multiplied by the percentage of the requisite service period completed to date less total compensation cost previously recognized after the requisite service period is complete compensation cost is remeasured based on the fair value as described above of the entire award at each consolidated balance sheet date until the award is exercised         the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards represent managements best estimates however the estimates used involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future goodwill  intangible assets         we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date transaction and integration costs are expensed as incurred any excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of individually identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill assets acquired may also include identifiable intangible assets such as subscriber relationships which are recognized separately from goodwill         significant estimates and assumptions are required to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration where applicable these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement and typically include the calculation of an appropriate  table of contents discount rate and projection of the cash flows associated with each acquired asset as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill in addition deferred tax assets deferred tax liabilities uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date we reevaluate these items periodically based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and any adjustments to its preliminary estimates are recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations during september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance regarding purchase accounting adjustments made after the measurement period the amendment requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the estimated amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date this guidance is effective for public company financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december           we review goodwill for impairment annually on december  and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired entities have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the two step goodwill impairment test as described below if this is the case the two step goodwill impairment test is required in evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis management reviews the companys financial performance and evaluates other factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for our single reporting unit the company considers whether there are any negative macroenomic conditions industry specific conditions market changes increased competition increased costs in doing business management challenges the legal environment and how these factors might impact companyspecific performance in future periods if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting is greater than its carrying amount the two step goodwill impairment test is not required if the two step goodwill impairment test is required the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the entity must perform step two of the impairment test under step two an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation and the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount step two does not need to be performed         additionally we review the recoverability of our longlived assets upon the occurrence of certain triggering events if the carrying value of our longlived assets exceeds their undiscounted cash flows we are required to write down the carrying value to fair value any such writedown is included in impairment of longlived assets in our consolidated statement of operations a high degree of judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our longlived assets we may use quoted market prices prices for similar assets present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates we may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques due to the high degree of judgment involved in our estimation techniques any value ultimately derived from our longlived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value  table of contents         for the years ended december   and  the company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit was less than the carrying amount additionally no triggering events were identified during the interim periods accordingly no impairment losses were recorded in  or  income taxes         we record income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimate of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider all relevant factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as assessing available tax planning strategies we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized this process requires management to make judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of the various agreements and transactions to which we are party due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our business future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results actual income taxes may materially vary from these estimates and could have a significant impact on our financial position         we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than  likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities

our preferred stock and to determine with respect to any series of our preferred stock the terms and rights of the series including  the designation of the series  the number of authorized shares of the series which number our board may subsequently increase or decrease but not below the number of such shares of such series preferred stock then outstanding  the dividend rate or amounts if any

exchange including provision for adjustments within the discretion of our board  the voting rights if any of the holders of the series  the terms and conditions if any for us to purchase or redeem the shares of the series and  any other relative rights preferences and limitations of the series         we believe that the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of our preferred stock will provide us with flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in meeting other corporate needs that might arise the authorized shares of our preferred stock as well as shares of our common stock will be available for issuance without further action by our stockholders unless such action is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automatic quotation system on which our securities may be listed or traded         although we have no intention at the present time of doing so our company could issue a series of preferred stock that could depending on the terms of such series impede the completion of a merger tender offer or other takeover attempt our board of directors will make any determination to issue such shares based upon its judgment as to the best interests of our stockholders our board of directors in so acting could issue preferred stock having terms that could discourage an acquisition attempt through which an acquirer may be able to change the composition of our board of directors including a tender offer or other transaction that some or a majority of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the thencurrent market price of the stock dividend policy         we presently intend to retain future earnings if any to finance the expansion of our business therefore following the spinoff we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future all decisions regarding the payment of dividends by our company will be made by our board of directors from time to time in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs plans for expansion and possible loan covenants which may restrict or prohibit our payment of dividends  table of contents other provisions of our charter and bylaws board of directors         our charter provides that subject to any rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors the number of our directors will not be less than three and the exact number will be fixed from time to time by a resolution of our board the members of our board other than those who may be elected by holders

of office of our class i directors expires at the annual meeting of our stockholders in  the term of office of our class ii directors expires at the annual meeting of our stockholders in  the term of office of our class iii directors expires at the annual meeting of our stockholders in  at each annual meeting of our stockholders the successors of that class of directors whose term expires at that

office until their respective successors are elected and qualified or until such directors earlier death resignation or removal         our charter provides that subject to the rights of the holders

office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred or to which the new directorship is assigned and until that directors successor will have been elected and qualified or until such directors earlier death resignation or removal no decrease in the number of directors constituting our board will shorten the term of any incumbent director except as may be provided in any certificate of designation with respect to a series of our preferred stock with respect to any additional director elected by the holders of that series of our preferred stock         these provisions would preclude a third party from removing incumbent directors and simultaneously gaining control of our board by filling the vacancies created by removal with its own nominees under the classified board provisions described above it would take at least two elections of directors for any individual or group to gain control of our board accordingly these provisions could discourage a third party from initiating a proxy contest making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to gain control of us limitation on liability and indemnification         to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law our directors are not liable to our company or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duties as a director in addition our company
