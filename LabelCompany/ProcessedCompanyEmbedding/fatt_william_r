traveler share with us your professional background william fatt from  to 8 i was chief financial officer of canadian pacific limited cpl fairmont’s predecessor company in 8 i joined fairmont as chief executive officer and in  fairmont became a publicly traded company since that time we have been working to grow the brand throughout north america and abroad and build on our loyal customer base gt earlier this year fairmont began offering complimentary highspeed internet access throughout its portfolio what prompted this move wf fairmont has always prided itself on being a technological leader in the hospitality marketplace and the brand continually strives to improve the guest experience by offering the finest technology products and services available our decision to offer highspeed internet access free of charge was primarily driven by members of our guest loyalty program fairmont president’s club they provide valuable feedback to us on a number of fronts and they were telling us that this service was no longer considered a luxury that it had become a necessity during their travels moreover the majority of business travelers view having quality highspeed internet access as being on the same level as having a telephone in the guestroom in light of this and the fact that the internet is so firmly ingrained in today’s society making it complimentary is a natural step to rewarding our frequent guests and ensuring they are enjoying a productive stay at our hotels gt tell us about the fairmont gold product and how it’s been received to date wf fairmont gold is a “hotel within a hotel” concept that’s designed for travelers seeking an enhanced level of service and a greater degree of personalization for many of our clientele it is a home away from home providing them with an exquisite place to live work and relax while simultaneously being pampered and attended to it’s ideal for travelers who want to be pampered or who are looking for an added degree of individual attention whether it’s making use of the floor’s dedicated concierge for lastminute arrangements or enjoying a great breakfast before heading off to their appointments the product has been a staple at many of our city center hotels for quite some time now we have recently introduced fairmont gold floors at the fairmont chateau lake louise the fairmont orchid hawaii and the fairmont copley plaza boston gt tell us about service plus and how it works and cite a few examples of initiatives that have been a direct result of employee opinion and guest surveys wf our goal with any stay is to turn moments into memories for all of our guests service plus is a fully integrated humanresource strategy that not only educates our colleagues about meeting and exceeding guest expectations but also provides a framework for them to become actively involved in delivering upon the brand promise from recognizing and rewarding outstanding colleague contributions to developing engaging orientation programs service plus is about empowering our colleagues and unlocking the passion within them we believe if we care for and nurture our employees they will in turn nurture and care for our guests gt fairmont’s property portfolio includes some of the world’s most beautiful heritage hotels the company seems to take pride in the renovations and improvements that allow these “grand dames” to maintain their period elegance while updating them to today’s hightech standards tell us about that wf the fairmont collection is quite unique in the sense that many of the hotels are timeless classics hotels like london’s savoy the fairmont banff springs and québec city’s fairmont le château frontenac are all icons and possess a great deal of historical relevance so it is vital to keep these properties modern while retaining their elegance character and grand stature over the past five years we have invested over  million in our collection to achieve a balance between the traditional and modern we factor into each and every renovation project the brand’s pillars of warm and engaging service authentically local product and unrivaled presence furthermore archivists and historians are consulted to ensure we aren’t compromising the true nature of the property united states manhattan ny sakaguras sake collection stressbusting strategies posts you may also like san diego night moves  sep
