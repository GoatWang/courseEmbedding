vgi’s investment team is based in sydney and new york at vgi we focus on businesses that we understand and where we believe we possess insights not appreciated by the wider investment industry long term business success is achieved through operating where you have a competitive advantage in the business of investing competitive advantage is obtained through superior knowledge and analysis vgi believes that its long term investment horizon provides a competitive advantage in an investment world which is increasingly focused on the short term vgi invests in a relatively small number of high quality businesses vgi believes that diversification preserves wealth while concentration builds wealth this is complemented with opportunistic short selling of low quality businesses that are typically structurally challenged poorly managed and materially overvalued alignment of interests “an example of a really responsible system is the system the romans used when they built an arch the guy who created the arch stood under it as the scaffolding was removed it’s like packing your own parachute” – charles t munger berkshire hathaway annual meeting  alignment of interests is a critical aspect of vgi’s business model and culture this is achieved through the following vgi’s principals invest a material proportion of their net worth in vgi the various vgi partners funds andor an account managed by vgi vgi’s investment team is incentivised according to fund performance with all staff encouraged to reinvest any discretionary bonuses into the fund and vgi staff including

vgi’s investment philosophy capital preservation – we place a great deal of importance on assessing downside risk we attempt to know as much about our portfolio companies as we can and believe that this will enable us to prevent permanent loss of capital risk comes from not properly understanding your investments superior long term compound growth – we aim to produce superior long term compound growth over time by seeking out and investing in what we believe to be some of the best businesses in the world great businesses purchased with a sufficient ‘margin of safety’ will provide superior long term returns concentration – we aim to invest in a relatively small number of high quality stocks with about  to  core positions at any one time we aim to be concentrated enough in our best ideas so as not to dilute our overall returns but hold enough positions in order to provide an appropriate level of diversification concentrating capital in high quality businesses builds wealth our strategy is to buy wonderful businesses for the long term in an effort to defer tax minimise frictional costs and maximise our long term returns if a business performs well the stock price will eventually follow we aim to hold cash when we feel that no ‘margin of safety’ exists we demonstrated this in  by holding the majority of our capital in cash by doing this we were able to protect our clients’ capital during one of the worst market collapses since the great depression we are often contrarian and strive to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful to have better performance than the crowd you must do things differently to the crowd we aim to selectively short companies that we have identified to be structurally weak and believe are vulnerable to material price declines what does a great business look like the following are some of the qualities that we look for in a great business simple and easy to understand business model never invest in any idea you can’t explain in relatively simple terms dominant in its industry and has been through periods of recession and emerged stronger superior returns on capital achieved through high margins and relatively low capital reinvestment requirements this allows the business to distribute cashflow to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends sustainable competitive advantage protecting the business from competition and allowing management to increase prices above inflation without losing market share – these traits are often found in businesses that are natural monopolies or oligopolies in their industry significant cashflow generation creates excess cash over and above the business’ annual capital requirements strong balance sheet with sensible gearing levels high quality management with a proven track record of outstanding performance management should display honesty intelligence and integrity vgi partnerssydney  new yorkaustralian financial services licence
