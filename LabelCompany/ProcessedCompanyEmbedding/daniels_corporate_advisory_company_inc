following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere within this report the annual report on form ka contains forwardlooking statements including statements using terminology such as can may believe designated to will expect plan anticipate estimate potential or continue or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology regarding beliefs plans expectations or intentions regarding the future you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they  discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition and  state other forwardlooking information we believe it is important to communicate our expectations however forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those discussed in forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including those set forth under risk factors business and elsewhere in this report all forwardlooking statements and risk factors included in this document are made as of the date hereof based on information available to us as of the date thereof and we assume no obligations to update any forwardlooking statement or risk factor unless we are required to do so by law organizational overview the company has a growth goal of providing advisory services to business services as well as nonbusiness services client companies the company works with companies seeking to create andor acquire adjunct service businesses whose services will initially provide better lifestyles for its existing workforce and ultimately will be packaged on an additional profit center basis for sale to other small companies for the retention of their employees the profits generated from all the financial consulting assignments will be available for venture investment in public or private client companies as well as other quality business conceptoperating companies both public and private through the daniels merchant bank division the daniels merchant bank has an inhouse equity funding program whereby daniels will participate in consulting client potential growth by helping finance the growth of public and private client business service companies as well as nonbusiness service companies the merchant bank will also participate in nonclient potential growth by the purchase of equity in attractive small public companies whose growth strategies are in line with a philosophy of growth through leveraged acquisitions general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and expenses we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources critical accounting policies financial reporting release no  published by the sec recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements while all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations and we view certain of these policies as critical policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows  revenue recognition  fair value of assets  use of estimates revenue recognition revenues are derived from research development qualification and production testing for certain commercial products revenue from fixed price testing contracts is generally recorded upon completion of the contracts which are generally shortterm or upon completion of identifiable contractual tasks at the time we enter into a contract that includes multiple tasks we estimate the amount of actual labor and other costs that will be required to complete each task based on historical experience revenues are recognized which provide for a profit margin relative to the testing performed revenue relative to each task and from contracts which are time and materials based is recorded as effort is expended billings in excess of amounts earned are deferred any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to income when identified to the extent management does not accurately forecast the level of effort required to complete a contract or individual tasks within a contract and we are unable to negotiate additional billings with a customer for cost overruns we may incur losses on individual contracts all selling general and administrative costs are treated as period costs and expensed as incurred for revenue from product sales we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification subtopic  revenue recognition asc  asc  requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria  and  are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded we defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that we and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required asc  incorporates accounting standards codification subtopic  multipleelement arraignments asc  asc  addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services andor rights to use assets the effect of implementing asc  on our financial position and results of operations was not significant fair value of assets the company has adopted the standard fasb accounting standards codification asc   fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between  level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities  level inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability eg interest rates and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means the respective carrying value of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments these financial instruments include investments in availableforsale securities and accounts payable and accrued expenses the company has also applied asc  for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis the adoption of asc  for nonfinancial assets and liabilities did not have a significant impact on the companys financial statements use of estimates in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity has been the operating profits of our logistics subsidiary as of november   we had  in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of  financing activities we will have to raise capital by means of borrowings or through a private placement or a subsequent registered offering at present we do not have any commitments with respect to future financings if we are unable to raise adequate capital in the near term to finance all phases of a client corporate consulting assignment our proposed business will experience slow growth because it will be very hard to compete for business without a sound capital base to support advisory and implementation efforts on our suggested corporate growth strategies at present we do have sufficient capital on hand to fund very limited operations for the immediate future our consulting income on current and expected assignments and continued support from arthur d viola our sole officer and director is believed to be sufficient to support current capital demands management estimates that we will need at least  million to fund client corporate development consulting projects over the next  months however even if limited funds are raised consulting services can still be provided for phase one of assignments the providing of consulting expertise phase two the providing of short term capital to client companies will have to be curtailed because of a limited capital raise or be provided by mr viola andor a jointventure partner who will share in the potential revenues from phase two portions of any project this jointventure sharing will limit the amount of profit we can earn in any one project limited growth prospects because of lack of sufficient capital to implement results of corporate consulting assignments may very well not produce sufficient profit to cover the costs that will now be incurred by daniels corporate advisory legal and accounting expenses are significant for a reporting company and we will have to cover them out of limited consulting operations fees due to lack of adequate funding this may place additional constraints on the growth prospects of daniels corporate advisory as it may have to curtail added assignments for lack of adequate working capital to manage these new assignments if sufficient capital is not raised over the next  months the limited consulting assignments current available will not be sufficient to sustain our long term operations as a public company and we could fail comparison of the year ended november   to the year ended november   revenues sales for the year ended november   were  compared to  for the year ended november   an increase of  all of our  revenue was from logistics which operated for twelve months as opposed to one month of activity in  cost of sales during the year ended november   we incurred  in expenses compared to  in the same period ended november   an increase of  this is cost of sales relating solely to our logistics subsidiary started in the prior year operating expenses during the year ended november   we incurred  in expenses compared to  the same period ended november   an increase of  our expenses was about the same year over year except for stock issued as wages in  for  there was zero in  other income and expenses during the year ended november   we incurred a net income of  in other items compared to  in net expense in the same period ended november   an increase of  our major  other income was  of debt forgiveness in  the company had debt forgiveness of  which was offset by an impairment charge on an investment of  net income the company had a net income for the year ended november   of  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended november   this increase of  was in majority due to the due to our increase in logistics activity as described above offbalance sheet arrangements none inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the two years ended november   and  and since inflation rates have generally remained at relatively low levels our operations are not otherwise uniquely affected by inflation concerns going concern the accompanying audited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this filing have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles that contemplate our continuance as a going concern our auditors in their report have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as going concern our cash position may be inadequate to pay all of the costs associated with the testing production and marketing of our products management intends to use borrowings and the sale of equity or convertible debt to mitigate the effects of its cash position however no assurance can be given that debt or equity financing if and when required will be available the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue existence recently issued accounting pronouncements there are no other new accounting pronouncements adopted or enacted during the year ended november
