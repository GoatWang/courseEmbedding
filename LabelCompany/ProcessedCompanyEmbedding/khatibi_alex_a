improvement personally and professionally diversify or die an insider look at the rebirth of an ohio manufacturer from buckeye power current november 25 history is littered with stories of beloved but now diminished companies—kodak borders and blockbuster come to mind—that failed to adapt to changing consumer trends when us total vehicle sales plummeted to a record low of 5 million in february of  as reported by autodata corp alex products inc an award winning metal forming welding coating and engineering solutions provider in northwestern ohio was narrowly focused on producing suv seats with the us economy in a protracted recession alex products was forced to reduce employment from over  in  to less than  employees at its lowest point alex products retained its formidable capacity to manufacture and weld complex components apply coatings and design build and maintain metal forming equipment but the company needed to adapt and do so quickly contracts were won to produce barstools and stadium seats sales efforts expanded to earn work from a more diverse pool of customers in alex products core automotive segment in  alex products owner dave von deylen founded ap alternatives with a mission to design engineer and manufacture an innovative solar racking system they didnt offer just another racking system but rather reinvented the entire concept of solar installations ap alternatives started by designing a system that could utilize automated equipment to manufacture components as well as assemble them designs led to a fully prepanelized modular racking system that allows for factory quality control and rapid field installation alex products manufactures many of the racking components and specialized assembly equipment but ap alternatives does more than just provide solar racking hardware service starts before breaking ground with site layouts max density studies and onsite anchor testing for the solar array location to determine soil strength and confi rm the size of helical anchors needed ap alternatives deploys a mobile assembly line to the project location to install the full package of anchors prepanelized racking and structural bracing making do without sacrificing quality the postrecession us manufacturing resurgence slowly gained momentum but even by 2 capital for new equipment simply wasnt available tooling welding and automation equipment was recycled and refurbished to adapt to the production of a much wider array of both high and low volume parts for a diverse mix of automotive parts suppliers and the growing solar business despite making do with repurposed equipment quality never slipped in 25 alex products received its th consecutive supplier quality award from johnson controls for best in class quality cost and delivery and in 2 the company received the platinum supplier award and excellence in execution from johnson controls flexible manufacturing methodology key to survival a flexible manufacturing approach in which machines can be efficiently changed over to produce new products or multiple machines can be used to perform the same operation on a part allows alex products to rapidly scale and cost eff ectively produce various sizes of product runs with 25 contracts nearing prerecession levels alex products is investing in new equipment to deliver even more competitive pricing while enhancing the flexibility to more quickly produce an even wider variety of products alex products workforce now exceeds  employees including engineers skilled machinists industrial electricians maintenance technicians solar installation crews and welding metal forming and coating production teams it takes a community it takes more than a village to support a manufacturing resurgence on the
