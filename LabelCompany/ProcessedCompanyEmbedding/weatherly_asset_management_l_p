custom portfolios  custom portfolios portfolios are developed to create and maximize aftertax afterfee returns for each client with current emphasis on shortterm performance results many investors overlook the importance of longterm wealth accumulation a critical factor being aftertax returns interest on bonds dividends on equities and longandshorttermed realized gains or losses on any asset class are taxed differently and are incorporated into weatherly¹s overall investment strategy for each client as our principals have over  years of investment expertise we understand the risk and return characteristics associated with various asset classes and investments and strive to build custom portfolios that beat benchmarks on an aftertax and afterfee basis over time  asset allocation  we believe that one of the most important decisions investors must make is how their assets are best allocated between various asset classes including stocks fixedincome and cash equivalents  depending on an investor’s riskreturn profile assets should be allocated to capture the bulk of the return of the equity and commodity markets with much less risk highquality intermediatematurity fixedincome securities can be utilized to dampen this risk  we also layer in covered call and option strategies as appropriate   equity management   a bottomup approach to investment selection is the foundation of the investment process instead of focusing on broad themes or sectors we identify attractive companies using two essential criteria first we look for stocks selling at prices at which intelligent business persons with longterm horizons would be interested in buying the entire business second we look for stocks that have the potential to generate strong returns without a lot of help from the broad market while portfolios concentrate on individual equity selection exchangetraded funds etfs and noload mutual funds are used as appropriate  depending on tax liabilities equity investments and portfolio turnover qualified dividendpaying stocks may provide the best alternative on an aftertax basis capitalization and sector diversification portfolios tend to concentrate on largecap and midcap stocks with no more than  of the portfolio invested in one sector to help insulate the portfolio throughout the business cycle the equity component of our portfolios typically consist of  of our best equity selections representing  positions each  sale decision stocks are considered sale candidates when  the target price is reached  a more attractive opportunity materializes  the asset allocation is adjusted between stocks fixed income or other asset classes  the fundamentals of the company deteriorate fixed income management weatherly asset management offers a range of fixedincome investments that are both taxfree and taxable fixedincome investments follow three broad investment criteria all with a focus on highquality intermediatematurity securities maturity management maturities of the portfolios are actively managed based on the trend in interest rates by utilizing a battery of quantitative models as interest rates rise portfolio maturities tend to be shortened to protect principal and lengthened during a declining interest rate environment  sector diversification sector enhancement is an integral part of the portfolio strategy focusing on those sectors offering value high quality securities from all sectors of the fixedincome markets may be purchased including us treasurytips government agency mortgagebacked assetbacked corporate securities and preferred stock municipal securities will be utilized where appropriate for a client¹s fixedincome investments depending on each client¹s circumstances weatherly asset management utilizes its expertise in the municipal market to evaluate securities that vary greatly in their credit quality structure and volatility taxfree municipal portfolios utilize general obligation revenue prerefunded and variable rate sectors individual security selection once attractive sectors are identified weatherly asset management scrutinizes available positions in an effort to locate the most compelling individual value within a sector value is measured by comparing the incremental spread between a specific security and a comparable treasury historical spread levels and comparative value
