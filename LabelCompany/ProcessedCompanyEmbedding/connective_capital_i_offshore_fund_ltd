tags  equity long short connective capital management portfolio manager robert romero says the silicon valleybased firm which specialises in investing in the technology and alternative energy markets has identified profitable short opportunities in consumer hardware and semiconductors and long opportunities in areas such as emerging energy infrastructure hw what events do you expect to see in your sector in the year ahead rr we expect to see some bankruptcies in the technology and emerging energy sectors as some weaker companies fail to raise the necessary capital during the current credit crunch hw what is the background to your company and funds rr connective capital management was founded in november  and has approximately usdm in assets under management as of december  our team and myself have a proven track record of generating positive alpha returns on both the long and short sides of our trades the team currently manages three strategies connective capital i a longshort market neutral fund connective capital ii a  per cent net beta shortbiased fund and connective capital emerging energy a  per cent net beta longbiased fund hw who are your service providers rr our law firm is sadis and goldberg and our accountants are harb levy  weiland yulish  associates is administrator to our usbased onshore funds while kaufman rossin fund services administers our caymanbased offshore funds hw have there been any recent events such as changes to the management team rr traders justin lent and ying qian left the firm and ivan tsurikov replaced them as the trader analyst jeff lipton has left the firm and we are expecting to replace him in the first quarter of  hw what is the profile of your investor base rr our fund ownership currently consists of  per cent employees  per cent a family office  per cent funds of funds and  per cent high net worth individuals we are actively looking to attract new investors across the entire spectrum hw what is the investment process of your fund rr investment ideas are sourced from the extensive contact base of the investment team derived from their combined more than  years of experience in the technology sector the investment team members have extensive personal contacts with financial technological and operational personnel in the technology and alternative energy markets the research teams due diligence into target subsectors among technology companies provides the flow of investment ideas given the significant number of new companies and existing names in the technology and emerging energy sectors there are many opportunities to profit on both the long and short sides of the portfolio there is a great deal of hype promotion and momentum in the technology and emerging energy sectors but only a few companies emerge as dominant players in their respective space many companies eventually fail and are phased out creating an abundance of ideas on the short side connective capital management attempts to exploit these opportunities on the short side while trying to identify the few winners in each subsector then we attempt to reduce the volatility inherent in the technology and emerging energy markets by constructing a relatively balanced portfolio so that stock selection is the main driver of alpha and not prediction of market direction investments are selected on the basis of expected riskadjusted return returns may take time to be achieved so connective capital management attempts to hedge its market exposure so that the portfolio from stock selection has a medium to longterm investment horizon hw what is your approach to managing risk rr our firm manages risk based on an informationbased stoploss strategy hw what opportunities are you looking at right now rr as hysteria changes to measured caution we see growing opportunities for alpha generation on both the long and short side now that virtually every equitys valuation includes an estimate of performance under a recessionary scenario we are seeing a return to multiple differentiations based on actual company fundamentals we have identified profitable short opportunities in consumer hardware and semiconductors long opportunities include emerging energy infrastructure hw what events do you expect to see in your sector in the year ahead rr we expect to see some bankruptcies in the technology and emerging energy sectors as some weaker companies fail to raise the necessary capital during the current credit crunch hw how will these developments impact on your own portfolio rr to stay on top of these tumultuous market dynamics we strive to utilise our core strengths in fundamental research to general alpha as fear wanes we expect to see increasing opportunities and hope to generate even stronger performance than was possible under market panic we remain focused on aligning our fundamental insights with macro factors such as obamas plans for economic recovery and an unrelenting credit crunch hw what differentiates you from other managers in your sector rr connective capital management is based in silicon valley in the heart of the technology and emerging energy sectors with great personal access to the portfolio companies more than  per cent of the portfolio is less than  miles away given the investment teams experience and personal relationships with more than  industry executives engineers scientists and customers it has significant information flow the firm is also different from other managers because it generates a significant amount of alpha in the portfolio from the long and short side and does not maintain the typical long bias in the portfolio that some other managers might do hw do you have plans for any other product launches in the near future rr due to strong performance of our ccii qp short fund and the strong relative performance of our cci master fund longshort market neutral fund numerous investors have expressed interest in making an initial allocation or increasing their current allocations if the demand is there we will launch a ccii master fund however we are also experiencing redemptions through no fault of our own and expect that it will remain a difficult fundraising environment in the foreseeable future like this article  get the free daily newsletter print email furtherreading from hedgeweek olivier mollé and gilles sitbon
