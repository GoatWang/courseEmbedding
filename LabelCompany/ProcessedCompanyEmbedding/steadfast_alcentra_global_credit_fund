alcentra global credit fund you must first receive and carefully review a copy of the prospectus you may download a copy of the prospectus via the following link download prospectus an investment in steadfast alcentra global credit fund involves a high degree of risk you should purchase shares only if you can afford a loss of some or all of your investment past performance is no indication of future results and there can be no assurance that steadfast alcentra global credit fund will be able to execute the business plan for the properties or the offering you should carefully consider the information set forth in the “risk factors” section of the prospectus for a discussion of material risk factors relevant to an investment in our common stock including but not limited to the following an investment in the shares is not suitable for investors if they need access to the money they invest the companys shareholders should consider that they may not have access to the money they invest for an indefinite period of time see “liquidity strategy” unlike an investor in most closedend funds shareholders should not expect to be able to sell their shares regardless of how the company performs if a shareholder is able to sell their shares the shareholder likely will receive less than their purchase price and the then current net asset value per share “nav per share” unlike most closedend funds the shares are not listed on any securities exchange and the company may not seek to complete a liquidity event until two years following the termination of this offering or any followon offering shareholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate future company investments prior to purchasing shares as a result the offering may be considered a “blind pool” offering to provide shareholders with limited liquidity the company intends to conduct quarterly repurchases of shares beginning the first calendar quarter following the oneyear anniversary of the satisfaction of the companys minimum offering requirement to raise at least  in proceeds from this offering within one year from the date of this prospectus the “minimum offering requirement” although the company has implemented a share repurchase program it may be discontinued at any time and only a limited number of shares are eligible for repurchase the company currently intends to limit the number of shares to be repurchased during any calendar year to the number of shares the company can repurchase with the proceeds it receives from the issuance of shares under its distribution reinvestment plan in addition the company will limit the number of shares to be repurchased in any calendar year to  of the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the prior calendar year or  in each quarter though the actual number of shares that the company offers to repurchase may be less in light of the limitations noted above shareholders that tender their shares within one year of purchase will be subject to an early withdrawal charge of  the companys distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to the company for investment any capital returned to shareholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses as well as selling commissions andor dealer manager fees if applicable even if the company does eventually list its shares shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount to nav per share and this creates a risk of loss for investors who purchase shares at the offering price this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the companys nav per share will decrease the underlying assumptions and any forward looking statements herein may not be accurate the projections herein shown may not occur and your performance may vary significantly to the extent the information in this brochure conflicts
