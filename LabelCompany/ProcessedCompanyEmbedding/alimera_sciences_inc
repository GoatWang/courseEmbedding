growth momentum smallcap midcapmarketplacegrowth stock forumsummaryalimera made insufficient progress to move the stock higher in iluviens quarterly growth is still lumpy but trending higherestimating this years top line growthincreasing institutional ownership a very good signalimera nasdaqalim made some progress in  but it was insufficient to move the stock higher in a really tough environment for biotechpharma stocks iluviens quarterly growth trends are still lumpy but sales are generally trending in the right direction this article takes a look at q growth trends the companys growth initiatives and provides a  outlook i will also discuss institutional ownership changes seasonality and distributor inventories impact q and q sales alimera had a big sequential jump in net sales in q followed by a dip in q the company explained on the q call that q sales were inflated by a distributor inventory buildup and that enduser demand was actually slightly higher in q compared to q the company also noted that there was some seasonal weakness in early q and that iluvien sales dropped substantially in july followed by a strong recovery in august and september management said that august and september were two of the three strongest months in  not counting q since we still dont have the numbers source alimera earnings reports i did some back of the envelope calculations and concluded that iluvien sales in the us were probably around  million in september which translates into a  million quarterly run rate and if we assume sales have grown monthovermonth in q i conservatively estimate us sales in q in the  million range international sales are still lumpy due to the softness in the uk where iluviens reimbursement is restricted to patients who already had cataract surgery so i assume we will see flat or slightly higher sequential sales in q source alimera earnings reports based on these projections i expect q sales in the  million range the analyst estimate range is  million and the consensus is at  million  outlook there are several things to consider before making this years growth estimates  international growth should finally pick up alimera saw six consecutive quarters of growth in germany and sales in portugal are showing strong yy growth as mentioned uk is still soft due to restricted reimbursement but the company noted that the situation is getting better alimera expects to engage with nice in order to try to expand reimbursement in  and if it succeeds we should see a solid increase in sales in the uk later this year iluvien was also launched in ireland and the middle east in q  and a launch in italy should occur by mid by alimeras partner sifi the company is still negotiating in france where pricing is an issue and we may not see a launch there at all if the two sides dont come to terms  alimera had a significant presence at euretina conference the largest retina conference in europe in copenhagen europe in september  and at the american academy of ophthalmology in october  the company presented real world data from the use of iluvien in the eu which showed an even better experience than in clinical trials intraocular pressure iop is a concern for physicians and patients the real world data suggests the numbers are significantly lower than observed in clinical trials which bodes well for iluviens uptake going forward the companys presence at these conferences should also help with iluviens uptake in  source alimera investor presentation  since iluvien is administered just once every three years it takes time for physicians to see the products efficacy and safety we are now more than two years into the launch in the united states and physicians will now have enough data and confidence to use the product in more patients but i suspect this is more of a  catalyst which is the time alimera will have enough real world data in the us to promote the products benefits i continue to expect more robust growth in the us than outside of the us due to iluviens broader label in the us with all of this in mind my revenue estimate range for  is between  million and  million while the analyst consensus is  million there are a lot of moving parts and i see the potential for sales to exceed  million if everything goes well  if us sales exceed expectations if reimbursement gets expanded in the uk and if we see a launch in italy and france iluvien net sales estimates period low end high end q    q    q    q    q    fy    source authors estimates and calculations management expects expenses to stay roughly the same as in  which means cash expenses will be  million a quarter in  based on my revenue projections alimera should reach cash flow positive status in q or q  ifonce it does the company will probably initiate a labelexpansion trial in one of the two targeted indications the company has enough cash on hand to reach the cash flow breakeven point and i do not anticipate additional dilution or funding issues rising institutional sponsorship a big positive for alimera institutional ownership has significantly increased in q which is the consequence of the equity offering in august  it is good to see familiar names and it is especially encouraging to see additional accumulation in q  and early  based on g filings listed below are the funds that specialize in biotechpharma and the ownership changes source whalewisdom alimera sec filings the five funds on the list purchased around  million shares since q  as a reminder the august offering size was  million shares conclusion  could be a breakout year for alimera us sales should continue to grow and international sales could finally pick up due to the expansion in ireland the middle east and hopefully in italy and france the company should reach cash flow positive status in h  and initiate a labelexpansion trial which should expand iluviens addressable market in s execution is the main risk to the thesis and disappointing sales will probably keep the share price depressed authors note growth stock forum subscribers had an early look at this article and have access to regular exclusive updates
