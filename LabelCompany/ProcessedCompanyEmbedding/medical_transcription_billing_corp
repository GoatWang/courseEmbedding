in the us healthcare industry on oct   it is used to standardize codes for medical conditions and procedures the icd codes have enabled more accurate medical billing by offering many more classification options compared to those found in its predecessor icd for thousands of physicians and other clinicians in the united states the change from icd to icd was a major concern demanding time preparation and a lengthy period of adjustment mtbc has proven to be an ideal icd compliance partner and remained fully committed in meeting all applicable time frames for icd compliance prior to

successfully completed all the transition tasks well before the october  deadline mtbc made its icd to icd products available to clients to help them in testing their system and processes was any mapping or crosswalk strategy used between icd and icd code sets were there any tools available as a crosswalk between icd and icd mtbc did provide a mapping solution to ensure that all of its practices can look up icd to icd codes and vice versa in some cases there is a onetoone match however in many cases there is one icd code that maps many icd codes due to laterality and specificity within icd in other cases there are many icd codes that map to a single icd code due to having more combination codes available in icd the major tools of mtbc’s webehr and practice management available for the purpose are icd to icd code converter icd to icd converter smart app in what time frame was the system modification process completed what role did mtbc play in system testing mtbc successfully completed all icd modifications to its practice management and ehr solutions and made these available to our clients during q in  this gave us ample time to engage in comprehensive internal testing and targeted endtoend external testing the modifications primarily included the development of the icd translator in practice management as well as all of the ehr systems increasing the icd field size to  characters along with creation of new cms  forms we have also conducted extensive trainings for our coding staff about the icd coding system and its comparison and contrast with the current icd coding system was there a cost involved in icd transition were the modifications and upgrades and ‘icd claims submission testing support’ covered by existing contracts no extra cost was passed down to our clients on account of the icd transition with our practice management and ehr solutions nor was there any impact on the contractual agreement between mtbc and its clients moreover all the mentioned tools and upgrades during the icd transition were fully covered and did not interrupt mtbc clients’ cash and clinical workflow during the icd transition phase have you provided customer support and training for the icdrelated functionality and what were the charges how did you provide the trainings ie webinars or knowledge hub etc mtbc devised strategic plans to ensure efficient transition to the icd system without impacting clients’ workflow processes in this regard mtbc organized a series of free webinars to educate clients about the implications of icd coding standards was there any phased approach for implementing icd mtbc adopted a strategic plan for the icd implementation that encompassed various stages of development the main phases for the implementation were impact assessment – q  internal communication – q  implementation of icd development changes – q  internal testing – q  external testing with payers and clearing houses – q  client education – q  going live – q  is there any icd translator available for customer use mtbc has already released its set of mhealth apps our standalone icd to icd converter app is available on play storeapp store what was the overall impact of icd transition on the interfaces in use such as electronic prescribing lab interfaces and appointment reminders the icd developments had no impact on these interfaces and they remained fully icd compliant what role did mtbc play in the testing of icd claims have you coordinated with various payersvendorsclearing houses about the icd claims mtbc successfully completed the testing of icd claims well before time other than the external testing with major vendors and clearing houses including emdeon and cms – we even remained in constant
