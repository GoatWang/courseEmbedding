be affected by market interest rates the risk that the issuer will default the value of the underlying stock or the right of the issuer to buy back the convertible securities credit risk the issuer of instruments in which the fund invests may be unable to meet interest andor principal payments thereby causing its instruments to decrease in value and lowering the issuers credit rating derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the funds ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions developingemerging markets securities risk the prices of securities issued by foreign companies and governments located in developingemerging markets countries may be affected more negatively by inflation devaluation of their currencies higher transaction costs delays in settlement adverse political developments the introduction of capital controls withholding taxes nationalization of private assets expropriation social unrest war or lack of timely information than those in developed countries foreign securities risk the funds foreign investments may be affected by changes in a foreign countrys exchange rates political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulties when enforcing obligations decreased liquidity and increased volatility foreign companies may be subject to less regulation resulting in less publicly available information about the companies geographic focus risk from time to time the fund may invest a substantial amount of its assets in securities of issuers located in a single country or a limited number of countries if the fund focuses its investments in this manner it assumes the risk that economic political and social conditions in those countries will have a significant impact on its investment performance the funds investment performance may also be more volatile if it focuses its investments in certain countries especially emerging markets countries high yield bond junk bond risk junk bonds involve a greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the credit quality of the issuer the values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of highquality bonds in response to company political regulatory or economic developments values of junk bonds can decline significantly over short periods of time interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise conversely bond prices generally rise as interest rates fall specific bonds differ in their sensitivity to changes in interest rates depending on their individual characteristics including duration management risk the investment techniques and risk analysis used by the funds portfolio managers may not produce the desired results market risk the prices of and the income generated by the funds securities may decline in response to among other things investor sentiment general economic and market conditions regional or global instability and currency and interest rate fluctuations mortgage and assetbacked securities risk the fund may invest in mortgage and assetbacked securities that are subject to prepayment or call risk which is the risk that the borrowers payments may be received earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans faster prepayments often happen when interest rates are falling as a result the fund may reinvest these early payments at lower interest rates thereby reducing the funds income conversely when interest rates rise prepayments may happen more slowly causing the security to lengthen in duration longer duration securities tend to be more volatile securities may be prepaid at a price less than the original purchase value an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool may adversely affect the value of mortgagebacked securities and could result in losses to the fund the risk of such defaults is generally higher in the case of mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages subprime mortgages refer to loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages preferred securities risk preferred securities may include provisions that permit the issuer in its discretion to defer or omit distributions for a certain period of time if the fund owns a security that is deferring or omitting its distributions the fund may be required to report the distribution on its tax returns even though it may not have received this income further preferred securities may lose substantial value due to the omission or deferment of dividend payments reit riskreal estate risk the fund concentrates its investments in the securities of real estate and real estate related companies investments in real estate related instruments may be affected by economic legal cultural environmental or technological factors that affect property values rents or occupancies of real estate related to the funds holdings real estate companies including reits or similar structures tend to be small and mid cap companies and their shares may be more volatile and less liquid the value of investments in real estate related companies may be affected by the quality of management the ability to repay loans the utilization of leverage and financial covenants related thereto whether the company carries adequate insurance and environmental factors if a real estate related company defaults the fund may own real estate directly which involves the following additional risks environmental liabilities difficulty in valuing and selling the real estate and economic or regulatory changes short sales risk short sales may cause the fund to repurchase a security at a higher price thereby causing the fund to incur a loss a short position in a security poses more risk than holding the same security long as there is no limit on how much the price of the security can increase the funds exposure is unlimited in order to establish a short position in a security the fund must borrow the security from a broker the fund may not always be able to borrow a security the fund seeks to sell short at a particular time or at an acceptable price the fund also may not always be able to close out the short position by replacing the borrowed securities at a particular time or at an acceptable price the fund will incur increased transaction costs associated with selling securities short in addition taking short positions in securities results in a form of leverage which may cause the fund to be volatile small and midcapitalization risks stocks of small and midsized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments and may have little or no operating history or track record of success and limited product lines markets management and financial resources the securities of small and midsized companies may be more volatile due to less market interest and less publicly available information about the issuer they also may be illiquid or restricted as to resale or may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes all of which may cause difficulty when establishing or closing a position at a desirable price as of  agrex nav

overview performance peer comparison holdings characteristics distribution     risks to consider market risk the market values of the portfolio’s holdings rise and fall from day to day so investments may lose value interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices fall and vice versa―longterm securities tend to rise and fall more than shortterm securities the values of mortgagerelated and assetbacked securities are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates due to prepayment risk credit risk a bond’s credit rating reflects the issuer’s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal―the lower the rating the higher the risk of default if the issuer’s financial strength deteriorates the issuer’s rating may be lowered and the bond’s value may decline foreign nonus risk nonus securities may be more volatile because of political regulatory market and economic uncertainties associated with such securities fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect the value of the investment or reduce returns these risks are magnified in emerging or developing markets leverage risk trying to enhance investment returns by borrowing money or using other leverage tools―magnify both gains and losses resulting in greater volatility reit risk investments in real estate can decline due to a variety of factors affecting the real estate market such as economic conditions mortgage rates and availability reits may have additional risks due to limited diversification and the impact of tax law changes derivatives risk investing in derivative
