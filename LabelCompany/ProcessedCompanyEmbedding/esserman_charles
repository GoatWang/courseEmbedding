perfect sense to me to build a firm that had the skills and experience to bring a lot more than capital to the tablethe idea of building a firm with a gender balance across all levels of the organization also made perfect sense to me based upon the varied perspectives of the team and the fact that women make many of the buying decisions for our companies and products i enjoy working with exceptionally smart exceptionally creative and exceptionally driven teams i have my family and my work and i love both as well as the many professional and personal relationships that have been created through tsghow has tsg’s culture helped drive the firm’s success  our culture is based upon applying the golden rule in every relationship that needs to be the basis for any real partnership

was written by joel stanwood a nd year mba at the kellogg graduate school of management joel has worked with two private equity growthoriented funds focusing on consumer products and healthcarefinancialbusiness services prior to kellogg joel served in strategic operational and general management roles at siemens was recruited into the firm’s international management development program and is certified as a lean six sigma black belt keynote chuck esserman cofounder and ceo of tsg consumer partners the  kellogg private equity and venture capital conference was pleased to welcome chuck esserman head of tsg consumer partners to deliver the private equity keynote speech tsg was founded in  as the first pe fund solely focused on investing in middlemarket branded consumer product companies the firm has raised five funds and currently has  billion in capital under management given the overall theme of the conference “partnering through uncertainty unlocking value in a changing landscape” esserman explained the unique tsg approach to unlock value he began by suggesting that tsg’s investment approach appears to look like a primer on how not do to private equity deals however the strategy has performed consistently well through multiple economic cycles for example the usual private equity investment philosophy is to seek firms with attractive purchase valuations the lower the better exchange downside protection for upside potential avoid companies with low market share and seek a controlling ownership block in contrast tsg will pay top dollar for great companies will exchange upside opportunity for downside protection to avoid negative investment returns maintains focus on small and medium size companies that may have negligible market share but always clear differentiated consumer benefits and is indifferent between purchasing a majority or a minority ownership stake furthermore tsg uses little or no leverage invests all company profits or more in growth and will patiently court companies for years if necessary tsg will even provide interim marketing counsel and operational assistance…for free somehow doing everything “wrong” has worked out quite well for tsg and its investors on average tsg portfolio companies increase annual operating income by  annually during the investment period and portfolio operating income grew by  and  during the “great recession” years of  and  respectively as a result the cumulative enterprise value for recent investment exits was  billion compared to only  million when purchased furthermore tsg’s funds are oversubscribed the firm turned down over  billion in lp commitments during its latest fundraise the tsg team likes to find products that many wouldbe suitors dismiss as fads examples include vitamin water beverages smart balance “betterforyou” foods and pureology premium hair care products esserman concluded by sharing some more general private equity insights first specialized operational expertise matters more than financial expertise and that is true now more than ever second restricted access to bank debt should be viewed as a positive thing since it encourages reinvestment into company growth and reduces investment risk third private equity fund returns will be increasingly correlated with growth rates of portfolio companies and capital structures will need to change significantly finally structured equity investments versus leveraged buyouts will become increasingly common for the foreseeable future as for tsg expect the firm to stick to its knitting continued focus on strong brands in the lower and middle market cautious approach to leverage and handson partnership with the best management teams in the industry print email share via email
