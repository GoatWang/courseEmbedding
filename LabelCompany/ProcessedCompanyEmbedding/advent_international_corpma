technologies had a solid foundation for growth” said cédric chateau managing director and general manager of advent’s paris office “the main payments business unit in particular showed significant potential with its market forecast to grow at doubledigit rates worldwide we believed that this organic growth combined with increased operational efficiencies would create an even stronger company” beyond the promise of organic growth particularly in emerging markets ot stood to benefit from the future adoption of chipandpin cards in the us and dual interface cards in europe the development of lte g sim cards and other advanced solutions for mobile payments also boded well for the company we began advanced discussions with ot in early  when the company was a subsidiary of a familyowned french conglomerate we entered into exclusive negotiations in august  and together with management acquired full control of the business in november of that year   improving the organization and streamlining operations following our investment and the subsequent carveout of ot we worked closely with management to improve operations and position the company to realize new sources of growth for example we supported management in transitioning the company from regional business units to four core product business units in payments telecoms solutions and identity each with its own management structure furthermore ot has reorganized its global manufacturing footprint to create one manufacturing hub for each major region of the world europe north america south america asia and middle eastafrica the move should yield substantial economies of scale pursuing growth with a more efficient wellorganized operation the company is now focused on expanding the business—both through organic growth and strategic acquisitions in the latter area for instance ot acquired nagraid security a specialist in dynamic display cards in august  this is a unique payment card product with a dynamic “cvv” display which is gaining strong early interest from banking customers and significantly reduces fraud in “cardnotpresent” payment transactions ot has also made significant investments in manufacturing and personnel in the us to position itself for the future all of these initiatives have contributed to strong performance at the company ot met or exceeded the vast majority of its sales and financial objectives in  highlighted by doubledigit ebitda growth “i’m convinced that ot is in the right place at the right time” said ot ceo didier lamouche “we are one of the few companies able to provide worldclass digital security technology embedded in any environment—paper plastic mobile devices wearables cloud—for any endtoend solution with advent’s support we are executing on our

billion in  finding the right partner in a growing market advent international had already made numerous investments in the payments and telco sectors—including vantiv us worldpay uk monext france and mach luxembourg—and ot looked like a strong prospect in an adjacent space right from the start we knew that oberthur technologies had a solid foundation for growth” said cédric chateau managing director and general manager of advent’s paris office “the main payments business unit in particular showed significant potential with its market forecast to grow at doubledigit rates worldwide we believed that this organic growth combined with increased operational efficiencies would create an even stronger company” beyond the promise of organic growth particularly in emerging markets ot stood to benefit from the future adoption of chipandpin cards in the us and dual interface cards in europe the development of lte g sim cards and other advanced solutions for mobile payments also boded well for the company we began advanced discussions with ot in early  when the company was a subsidiary of a familyowned french conglomerate we entered into exclusive negotiations in august  and together with management acquired full control of the business in november of that year   improving the organization and streamlining operations following our investment and the subsequent carveout of ot we worked closely with management to improve operations and position the company to realize new sources of growth for example we supported management in transitioning the company from regional business units to four core product business units in payments telecoms solutions and identity each with its own management structure furthermore ot has reorganized its global manufacturing footprint to create one manufacturing hub for each major region of the world europe north america south america asia and middle eastafrica the move should yield substantial economies of scale pursuing growth with a more efficient wellorganized operation the company is now focused on expanding the business—both through organic growth and strategic acquisitions in the latter area for instance ot acquired nagraid security a specialist in dynamic display cards in august  this is a unique payment card product with a dynamic “cvv” display which is gaining strong early interest from banking customers and significantly reduces fraud in “cardnotpresent” payment transactions ot has also made significant investments in manufacturing and personnel in the us to position itself for the future all of these initiatives have contributed to strong performance at the company ot met or exceeded the vast majority of its sales and financial objectives in  highlighted by doubledigit ebitda growth “i’m convinced that ot is in the right place at the right time” said ot ceo didier lamouche “we are one of the few companies able to provide worldclass digital security technology embedded in any environment—paper plastic mobile devices wearables cloud—for any endtoend solution with advent’s support we are executing on our strategy and are wellpositioned in a fastgrowing dynamic industry”   advent international
