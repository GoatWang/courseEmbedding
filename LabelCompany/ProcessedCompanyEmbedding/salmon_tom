the hooks attached to the lures this is the largest most varied category of all fishing tackle the word lure typically refers to the imitations made for casting and trolling baits refer to the preserved baitfish and fish parts along with artificial baits which may contain natural and synthetic substances to closely imitate smaller creatures and their scents some lures and baits can be combined to increase their effectiveness and many anglers will modify them to create unique actions and profiles to fool heavily pressured fish most lures are designed for specific tactics water conditions depths speeds and predatory fish species lures range in weight from  oz to several ounces and are designed to float suspend sink or dive at controlled depths and increments as needed lures can be finished in multitudes of surface designs and colors including neons metallics glow ultraviolet and transparent finishes the type of finish is dependent on the species they are imitating and the effect intended they can also have different mechanical designs such as jointed sections internal rattles and trailer hooks the different subcategories of lures and baits available at fishusa include hard baits soft baits jigs and jig heads spoons spinners spinnerbaits and buzzbaits artificial baits prepared and cured baits attractants and cures worm harnesses trolling rigs and flies lure components and flies most hard baits were originally carved from wood which has been mostly replaced by plastics in modern luremaking while metals are used for others specific types of hard baits are stickbaits crankbaits jerkbaits swimbaits jigging lures and blade baits and topwater lures soft baits are rubber silicone or other soft plastics molded into swimbaits grubs worms tubes and other baitfish patterns jigs and jig heads are lead tungsten or tin weights molded onto specially designed hooks with long shanks to accept soft baits or materials to imitate various creatures spoons are metallic “blades” with shapes and bends similar to the eating utensil and most often imitate swimming or injured baitfish for casting jigging and trolling spinners feature metal blades which spin freely on a weighted or unweighted stiffwire shaft and create widereaching vibrations to trigger fish to chase and strike spinnerbaits are combinations of jigs and spinners creating larger profiles and tremendous vibration and motion artificial baits are products designed to specifically imitate the look and scent of live bait without the expense and difficulty of storing live bait these include hard and soft plastic eggs and roe paste and dough nuggets made of similar compounds to dough but hold their shape better larvae and waxies and baitfish prepared and cured baits are natural eggs and roe baitfish and cutbait and worms all of these have been preserved to prevent rot and decay attractants and cures are liquids and pastes to coat and spray scent onto lures preserve and cure your own eggs and baitfish and to attract fish to specific areas in the water worm harnesses are similar to spinners but are premade bait rigs with blades weights and typically two hooks to hold nightcrawler
