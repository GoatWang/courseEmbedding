yield while its cheapjun   about one liberty olp hawkinvest value growth at reasonable price contrarian growthsummarya pullback to strong support levels has created an ideal buying opportunity in this  yielding reitthe next quarterly dividend of  cents per share is coming up in late june and the dividend has been steadily rising over the yearsmanagement owns about  of the company which means their interests are aligned with shareholdersit makes sense to buy now to lock in a generous  yield a soon to be paid quarterly dividend and also possibly see this oversold stock rebound very soonone liberty properties inc nyseolp is a real estate investment trust or reit that specializes in commercial property investment including retail industrial and office complexes the majority of its leases are net which means the tenants are responsible for the real estate taxes insurance and even ordinary maintenance and repairs the shares of this reit have dropped recently along with others in this industry and that has created an attractive buying opportunity so lets take a closer look as the chart above shows this stock has bounced around quite a bit in  and has been in a trading range that was around the  level at the lows and about  per share when it was near the recent highs it is now in the  range which it quickly rebounded from at least  times this year and i think it is likely to rebound once again soon just a few weeks ago this stock rallied up to about  which was the second time it hit that level this year and i believe it can rebound back towards that level in the coming weeks and months i like the fact that this stock has rebounded from the  range more than once this year as this indicates it is a strong support level buying at strong support levels often reduces potential downside risks another positive is that the relative strength index or rsi is now around  which indicates that this stock is oversold when a stock hits oversold levels it can often be a sign that the selling has gone too far and that a rebound is coming next as shown in the chart the day moving average is  and the day moving average is  i believe this stock will rebound back to that level in june possibly after the federal reserve meets to determine if they will go ahead with an expected rate hike however i am not buying this stock with the primary focus as being capital gains i am primarily buying this stock for the generous dividend yield which is now about  not only is the dividend already generous but it has also been growing since  the dividend has been raised at least once a year and that has resulted in about a  dividend growth rate over the past four years with the pullback in the stock creating an ideal buying opportunity right now the timing also looks great because the next dividend payment of  cents per share is coming up very soon by looking at the dividend history for this company you can see the growth rate the increases and the fact that the next exdividend date is coming up in late june which is just around  weeks away that means investors can buy this pullback and lock in a yield of about  and also get the next dividend very soon on may   one liberty properties reported solid q earnings results for the first quarter of  the company generated  cents per share in ffo funds from operations on revenues of about  million which represents a  year over year increase the company also reported that it has available liquidity of  million total assets of  million and debt of  million this shows the balance sheet is strong and so is the liquidity both of which reduces potential downside risks for investors the ffo of  cents per share also indicates that the quarterly dividend of  cents per share is more than covered and this reduces potential downside risks another positive is that the company said it recently sold a property in colorado for  million which will result in a gain of about  million which will be recorded in the next quarter q the company was able to post a  year over year revenue increase because it has been acquiring additional properties and it continues to do so on may   it announced the acquisition of an industrial property in north carolina for  million i believe that the reit sector has been under pressure for the last few weeks due to anticipation of a fed rate hike in june i also believe that the pullback is overdone and that this sector will rebound sharply either just before or just after we get the expected rate hike as the chart below shows shares of realty income nyseo were trading for nearly  per share in april and then dropped to about  which was similar to the lows it hit in late  however it has already started to rebound i believe that since this is one of the largest reit stocks it has a market cap of about  billion the fact that it has already started to rebound could be a sign that the selloff in this sector is over much smaller reit stocks like one liberty properties could be poised to follow the lead of reit industry giants like realty income and also begin to rebound realty income yields just  and i think investors are willing to accept a lower yield in this name because it is wellknown and it is an industry leader in terms of market cap however i believe one liberty properties is far more attractive when you consider the yield and the very significant management ownership stake i believe one liberty properties could be an attractive buyout target for a much larger company and that buyout potential is clearly not being reflected in the share price today in summary one liberty properties has a lot to offer income investors especially at current price levels and with a yield of  the recent pullback in the reit sector is a buying opportunity especially because interest rates will remain low and many investors continue to seek income from dividend stocks short sellers who have recently been targeting the reit sector due to the anticipated rate hike could be poised to cover soon especially since it appears this sector has already hit strong support levels and bottomed out this company has a solid balance sheet a management team with significant skin in the game and an attractive real estate portfolio that is diversified geographically and with a mix of tenants ranging from office to retail to industrial another big positive is that this company has been steadily increasing the dividend and that the next  cent per share is coming up very soon around the end of june data is sourced from yahoo finance no guarantees or representationsare
