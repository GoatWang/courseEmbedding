gainor jr the ceo of dairy queendecision makersmr john p gainor jr the ceo of dairy queenremove the posters denigrating hindu beliefs from the dairy queen in kemah txhindu mahasabha of america inchindu mahasabha of america incsupportersmr john p gainor jrceo dairy queen we the undersigned are writing this petition with a request to bring your attention to rather ugly and untowardly posters messages denigrating and insulting hindu beliefs put up at a dairy queen in kemah texas as proud immigrants to the usa we are all aware of the iconic brand of dairy queen which serves as a neighbourhood icecream parlour and eatery thousands of practising hindus visit dq every day when they want to treat their children for a cup of icecream or want to spend some family time together but recently this pleasant and family friendly image of dq took a hit due to sad turn of events when a dq owner in the town of kemah tx mrmohammad dar a muslim us citizen of pakistani origin started displaying absolutely reprehensible sign posts and messages on his dq business property on the message board which says obey preserve the constitution of the usa not monkeyism of the dark ages the monkeyism being a specific reference to hinduism as it is clear from various press reports and interviews the mrdar has unapologetically given out his views about hinduism as he told mysacom hindus don’t follow any limit or law they follow desires like an animal – that is the foundation of hinduismmonkeys don’t plan anything they just do what they desire but humans follow the limit and law these messages are totally misplaced the foulest possible lies and a malicious attempt at smearing insult on hindus and their belief systemit portrays hindus and their beliefs in a false light and makes an attempt at spreading propaganda aimed at demeaning hindus which we as practising hindus of greater houston area find very disturbing all this was done on a property which was under the dq umbrella we find that act condemnable and request dq to take down the offensive posters at once without the slightest delay there are almost a billion human beings in the world who identify with the hindu set of beliefs hindus are a diverse set of people with an equally diverse of schools of thoughts beliefs and tenets by which they lead their lives hindus have been peaceful and have contributed to this great country with their hard work intelligence and innovation a very superficial look at ceos  of two of the worlds biggest companies google and microsoft would attest to the fact what practising hindus are we are pretty sure that dq also employs a number of people who believe in hindu beliefs or hinduism every hindu who comes to us or anywhere in the world for that matter of fact will abide by the constitution of that country and laws of the land in such circumstances if hatemongering pathetic lies are allowed to be peddled on a dq property we hindus feel it would be a very sad commentary on dqs business standards practises and above all ethics we would like to assure you that we stand by the freedom of expression and speech as granted by the constitution of the united states but will not however stand and watch our religion being lied about the first reports of these messages surfaced in the electronic media on march nd and since then we have seen comments of moral ascendancy from dq about the sign post and messages but nothing concrete in terms of action there is also news that the owner would be selling his business or moving out of it on march st the sign posts and messages being removed at that point would be of no consolation to hindus since that would be a direct implication to the callousness of dq and its franchise owners to the requests of hindus thus we respectfully submit this petition that the hate mongering and simply false signs and messages be taken down from the dq in kemah tx we condemn the actions of mrmohammad dar in the strongest possible terms and would like to ask dq to swiftly act against him and his outlet using the proud dq symbol thank youthis petition was delivered tomr john p gainor jr the ceo of dairy queenread the
