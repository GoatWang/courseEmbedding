bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions longerterm securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes in a declining interestrate environment the portfolio may generate less income investments in securities rated below investment grade commonly known as junk bonds present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higherquality securities investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks the risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries derivative instruments can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk nondiversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers as such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility the jp morgan emerging markets bond index global embi

time morgan stanley investment management msim is the asset management division of morgan stanley     wam is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio the wam calculation utilizes the interestrate reset date rather than a securitys stated final maturity for variable and floating rate securities by looking to a portfolios interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates the wam measure effectively captures a funds exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements   wal is the weighted average life of the portfolio the wal calculation utilizes a securitys stated final maturity date or when relevant the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest such as a put feature accordingly wal reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit widening spreads or tightening liquidity conditions   tracking error and information ratio are calculated using
