i introduction this case involves the alleged infringement of three design patents for truck headlights owned by paccar inc paccar by aftermarket replacement headlights sold by dorman products inc dorman presently before the court is dormans motion for certification pursuant to  usc § b for the reasons that follow dormans motion is denied ii background the pertinent facts and procedural history are summarized as follows in its memorandum and order dated august   the court granted paccars motion for summary judgment with respect to dormans affirmative defense of invalidity of the three patents based on the onsale bar under  usc § b and denied dormans motion for summary judgment on the same issue see dorman products inc v paccar inc  f supp d   wl  ed pa aug   that memorandum contains additional factual background procedural history and details of the underlying patents in the case dorman filed this motion for certification pursuant to  usc § b on september   seeking certification for interlocutory review by the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit of this courts order of august   paccar filed its response opposing certification on september   a the onsale bar of  usc § b as clarified in medicines  fd  fed cir  in concluding in its memorandum dated august   that the onsale bar did not apply to the three patents at issue in this case this court relied on the recent decision of the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit in the medicines company v hospira inc  fd  fed cir  en banc medicines the medicines opinion clarified the first prong of the twoprong test for applicability of the onsale bar whether the claimed invention was the subject of a commercial sale before the critical date medicines  fd at  citing pfaff v wells inc  us    see pfaff  us at  the onsale bar applies when two conditions are satisfied before the critical date first the product must be the subject of a commercial offer for sale    second the invention must be ready for patenting the federal circuit stated that the transaction at issue must be a sale in a commercial law sense and clarified that the mere sale of manufacturing services by a contract manufacturer to an inventor to create embodiments of a patented product for the inventor does not constitute a commercial sale of the invention id at  internal quotation marks and citations omitted medicines explained that commercial benefit—even to both parties in a transaction—is not enough to trigger the onsale bar of § b the transaction must be one in which the product is onsale in the sense that it is commercially marketed id the federal circuit concluded that the sale at issue in medicines was not a commercial sale because  only manufacturing services were sold to the inventor—the invention was not  the inventor maintained control of the invention as shown by the retention of title to the embodiments and the absence of authorization to the manufacturer to sell the product to others and  stockpiling standing alone does not trigger the onsale bar id at  additionally the federal circuit stated that while not disqualifying in all instances the confidential nature of the transactions is a factor which weighs against the conclusion that the transactions were commercial in nature id at  while medicines did not recognize a blanket supplier exception the federal circuit stated that the focus must be on the commercial character of the transaction not solely on the identity of the participants id at  b this courts memorandum dated august   this court relied on medicines clarification of the commercial limitation on pfaffs first prong in concluding that the offers for sale in this case were not commercial transactions and thus did not trigger the onsale bar dorman products  wl  at  specifically this court analyzed whether the nature of the two transactions at issue—price quotations from two headlight manufacturers—were commercial with respect to one quotation the court concluded that while the quotation was an offer for sale because it would have created a binding contract upon acceptance it was not commercial because it was a transaction between the patentee    and a supplier the terms were consistent with a contract for manufacturing services rather than the sale of a product at market value paccar retained title to the headlights the manufacturer was not free to market the headlights or the design of said to third parties the offer was confidential and the headlights were not produced in commercial amounts until after the critical date id at  with respect to the other quotation the court likewise concluded that it was an offer for sale but that it was not commercial because paccar retained control of the invention and the manufacturer was not free to market the headlights or claimed designs to third parties the offer was confidential the quotation has other terms characteristic of a manufacturing contract    and was not a sale of a commercial embodiment of the patented design at full price and the headlights were not produced in commercial quantities until after the critical date id at  iii applicable law a district court has discretion to certify an order that would otherwise not be appealable for interlocutory appeal when the district court is of the opinion that such order  involves a controlling question of law as to which  there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and  that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the termination of the litigation  usc § b see morgan v ford motor co civ no   wl  at  dnj jan   even if all three criteria    are met the district court may still deny certification as the decision is entirely within the district courts discretion in order to certify an order under § b the district court must conclude that all three requirements have been met katz v carte blanche corp  fd   d cir  citations omitted see also interwave tech inc v rockwell automation inc civ no   wl  at  ed pa feb   when there is no substantial ground for a difference of opinion certification for appeal can be denied on this ground alone citation omitted the party moving for certification bears the burden of establishing that all three requirements of § b have been met litgo nj inc v martin civ no   wl  at  dnj mar   citations omitted iv discussion the court concludes that dorman has not met its burden of showing that all three criteria for certification have been met the courts decision is based on the second criteria for certification which requires that there be substantial grounds for difference of opinion on the issue presented substantial grounds for difference of opinion exist where there is genuine doubt or conflicting precedent as to the correct legal standard hall v wyeth civ no   wl  at  ed pa dec   the clearest evidence of substantial grounds for difference of opinion is where there are conflicting interpretations from numerous courts knopnick v downey  fsuppd   md pa  while a lack of controlling authority on a specific issue may constitute substantial grounds hall  wl  at  it does not necessarily do so keystone tobacco co inc v us tobacco co  frd   ddc  citation omitted dorman argues that there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion with respect to the correct interpretation and application of the commercial requirement articulated in medicines to offers for sale specifically dorman contends that there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion because  no cases apply medicines the facts of which involved a sale to circumstances involving offers for sale  medicines is not squarely on point for cases involving offers for sale and  this courts application of medicines is inconsistent with the federal circuits holding in hamilton beach brands inc v sunbeam products  fd  fed cir  that there is no blanket supplier exception to the onsale bar dorman mem supp mot  the court addresses each of these arguments in turn first the lack of other cases applying medicines to circumstances involving offers for sale does not support a conclusion that there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion with respect to its application to offers for sale the medicines opinion is relatively recent—it was decided on july  —and the lack of reliance on the medicines opinion by other courts does not in and of itself create substantial grounds for a difference of opinion see ryan v flowserve corp  fsuppd   nd tex  simply because a court is the first to rule on a question or counsel disagrees on applicable precedent does not qualify the issue as one over which there is substantial disagreement citation omitted second dormans argument that medicines is not squarely on point to cases involving offers for sale fails because the en banc medicines opinion makes clear that the transaction at issue must be commercial in order for onsale bar to apply medicines  fd at   the commercial requirement clarified by medicines is not limited to sales rather the opinion discusses both sales and offers for sale in its clarification of pfaffs first prong see eg medicines  fd at  as a general proposition we will look to the uniform commercial code to define whether    a communication or series of communications rises to the level of a commercial offer for sale the opinion reiterates that to be true to pfaff when assessing prong one of § b a court must focus on those activities that would be understood to be commercial sales and offers for sale in the commercial community medicines  fd at  citing group one ltd v hallmark cards inc  fd   fed cir  emphasis added while the medicines opinion specifically clarifies that the mere sale of manufacturing services by a contract manufacturer to an inventor to create embodiments of a patented product for the inventor does not constitute a commercial sale of the invention it also states that it is wellsettled that mere preparations for commercial sales are not themselves commercial sales or commercial offers for sale under the onsale bar id at   citation omitted medicines thus articulates controlling law that is directly applicable to this case—in order to trigger the onsale bar there must be a commercial sale or offer for sale and there was none in this case id at  as required by medicines this court examined the characteristics of the transactions in this case—offers for sale—to determine whether they were commercial and concluded that they were not finally this courts order of august   is not inconsistent with the federal circuits holdings in hamilton beach and medicines that there is no blanket supplier exception to the onsale bar medicines  fd at  this court did not rely on a blanket supplier exception in its memorandum instead it did as the medicines opinion instructed and focused on the character of the transaction and not solely on the identity of the participants and concluded that the offers for sale in this case were not commercial transactions medicines  fd at  see dorman products  wl  at  furthermore this court reached a question that the hamilton beach decision did not—whether the transaction at issue was commercial in nature relying on the reasoning of hamilton beach this court found that the transactions at issue were sufficiently definite to constitute offers for sale id at  however unlike hamilton beach the court went on to analyze whether the offers for sale were commercial and concluded that under medicines they were not id medicines distinguished hamilton beach on this point stating that the inventor in hamilton beach only argued that the offer was insufficiently firm to constitute a commercial offer for sale and did not argue that no commercial sale of the patented product would occur if the inventor purchased it from its supplier medicines  fd at  the court concludes that dorman has not met its burden of showing that substantial grounds for difference of opinion exists with respect to the application of medicines to situations involving offers for sale dormans motion for certification pursuant to  usc § b is denied on this ground alone the court thus does not address the remaining requirements for certification—whether the challenged ruling involves a controlling question of law or whether an immediate appeal would materially advance the termination of the litigation v conclusion for the foregoing reasons dormans motion for certification pursuant to  usc § b is denied an appropriate order follows
