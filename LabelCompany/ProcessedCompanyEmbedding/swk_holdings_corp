flow streams about us people board of directors creative capital solutions  swk holdings creative capital solutions the combination of our longterm investment strategy and flexible capital base allows us to tailor each investment structure to meet the needs of our partners traditional royalty monetization royalty monetizations allow royalty owners to receive upfront capital in exchange for their expected future royalty payments these financings can entail either the sale of all or a portion of the royalty stream or can take the form of a nonrecourse loan if the royalty owner wants to maintain the future cash flows after the loan is repaid in either case the royalty owner receives liquidity today and reduces or eliminates entirely the commercial risk of the product synthetic royalties  revenue interests in a synthetic royalty transaction swk purchases a new royalty interest in an existing revenue stream from the marketer   structured debt financings structured debt financings are recourse obligations of the issuer for growth companies with commercialized products structured debt provides a more flexible source of credit capital than traditional lending institutions will typically offer hybrid transaction a hybrid transaction combines elements of a royalty monetization synthetic royalty and structured debt tailored to achieve the issuer’s financing goals if you have an interest in learning more about our capital solutions please contact us at inquiriesswkholdcom our approach investment process investment criteria creative capital solutions partner with swk rights plan  swk holdings rights plan swk holdings’s stockholder rights plan structured to preserve net operating losses by limiting ownership in swk holdings common stock on april   swk holdings announced that its board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan the primary purpose of the plan is to preserve swk holdings’s net operating losses or “nols” for tax purposes as the company believes that its nols constitute a substantial asset under the internal revenue code and rules promulgated by the internal revenue service swk holdings can carry forward its nols to offset current and future earnings and thus reduce its federal income tax liability subject to certain requirements and restrictions however swk holdings’s future use of these nols could be substantially limited in the event of an “ownership change” as defined under section  of the internal revenue code in general a company would experience an ownership change for this purpose if holders of at least  of the outstanding shares of common stock or “ holders” increase their aggregate ownership interest in the company over a threeyear testing period by more than  measured in terms of the market value of the company’s capital stock the new rights plan is designed to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change for federal income tax purposes by discouraging these shareholders of  or more of common stock from acquiring additional shares after giving careful consideration to swk holdings’s nols and past transactions in the company’s common stock the board of directors concluded that because the plan would serve to protect the nols and therefore stockholder value the plan would be in the best interest of swk holdings and its stockholders for more information regarding the rights plan please refer to the company’s sec filings investor relations investor presentations news corporate governance sec filings rights plan  annual meeting our strategy  swk holdings our strategy we work with healthcare product companies academia and inventors to structure investments that create longterm value for both our business partners and our investors we can invest at any point in the life cycle of a marketed product from launch to mature postip expiration our transactions enable our counterparties to invest in higher return activities such as acquiring new technologies financing development projects and funding additional working capital needs we seek to fill a void in the capital markets we believe traditional equity sources of capital are oftentimes too expensive for owners of proven intellectual property requiring substantial dilution to a product’s future potential in many cases bank financing which traditionally requires pledged collateral to fit within many constraints is also not a practical capital solution due to its many restrictive conditions our healthcare focus affords us a deep understanding of the value of life science business models and intellectual property allowing us to see value where others cannot we tailor our financing solutions to each situation with the goal of preserving our partners’ ownership interests in addition our structures provide liquidity today leveraging a product’s future potential while also reducing its future commercial risk though we have the capability to execute transactions of all sizes we specialize in sub million opportunities that other structured finance investors traditionally consider “too small” our approach investment process investment criteria creative capital solutions partner with swk investment process  swk

holdings relatively unknown royalty playdec   about swk holdings swkh sunny pamidimukkala value longshort equity growth at reasonable price eventdriventexas usitsummaryniche royalty income firmvaluable nol carryforward assetheavily underfollowedinvestment thesis  swk holdings serves a niche by providing long term royaltyrelated financing options in the life sciences sector in the subm transaction market and therefore faces significantly less competition than its peers  the company is heavily underfollowed with analyst coverage by two minor firms beginning in september  since the time of purchase swk holdings has continued to quietly increase and diversify its investments these two factors signal undervaluation and allow for a lowcost basis at the time of purchase  as of december   swk holdings had m of federal net operating loss nol carryforwards with most beginning to expire in  and the last expiring by  the large value and expiration period of these nol carryforwards make swkh an excellent longterm investment company overview swk holdings otcqbswkh was incorporated in july  as kana software and created customer communications software products in december  kana sold all of its substantial assets was purchased as an nol shell company and changed its name to swk holdings in july  the company began to carry out a new corporate strategy of serving as a specialty finance and asset management firm this strategy is carried out by offering customized finance solutions to life sciences companies institutions and inventors hence swk holdings generates income through three sources  the primary ownership or the debt financing of royalties generated by the sales of life science products and related intellectual property  interest and other income received by advancing capital in the form of secured debt to life science companies  realized capital appreciation from equityrelated investments in the life science sector makes up a very small portion of income the majority of the companys transactions follow a structure where swk provides capital in exchange for interest in an existing revenue stream swk does not anticipate providing capital prior to the commercialization of the product from which the revenue stream originates this existing revenue stream typically takes one of two forms through a royalty for the sales of a life sciences product  with a third party marketing the product such as when an inventor receives royalties from the sales of a drug or device  with a partner company marketing the product such as a medical device or drug company that sells its own products swk typically funds full amounts of transactions up to  million swk provides structured debt with warrants and other features generally the borrower may use the capital for the purposes of growth and general working capital acquisitions or recapitalizations in select cases industry analysis swk holdings is part of the alternative investments industry and within that industry fills a niche targeting healthcare royalties in transaction amounts below  million alternative investment as an industry is rapidly changing this seems to be driven by three key issues  globalization  monetization and  risk management  globalization is causing companies of all industries and sizes to be influenced by international events macroeconomic trends and new ideas from around the world as a result alternative investment firms have a tremendous number of opportunities for new capital that can be sourced from wealth in foreign countries but are also faced with the task of analyzing investments in a truly global context  despite the opportunities for new capital provided by globalization alternative investment firms are increasingly finding difficulties in raising capital for continued or expanded operations consequently many have turned to monetizing their businesses raising capital by selling minority interest in the firm to an outside institution  noninvestment risk management is becoming increasingly important to alternative investment firms since any damage to reputation can significantly impact the firms aum total or its ability to close transactions accordingly firms are paying greater attention to minimizing operational ex valuation error technology ex data breach and regulatory risk ex conflict of interest due to the smaller size of the firm and its transactions swk holdings is not affected by these highlevel changes as deeply as many of its larger peers  the company is not seeking any international investments at this time nor any capital from international sources however it does need to analyze investments through a worldly lens due to some of its revenue streams being dependent on international sales  swk holdings has already monetized by selling a minority stake in its firm to carlson capital a dallasbased alternative asset management firm  swk does not seem to be taking interest in minimizing noninvestment risk but due to the small nature of the firm doing so could be an unnecessary expense at this time swks small size and specialized nature allow it to escape many of the negative consequences of industry trends increased competition for investment opportunities unforeseen business risks etc while capitalizing on the positive ones new sources of global income for royalties increased capital the following porters five forces analysis further describes the industry risk analysis there seem to be three main risks associated with investing in swk holdings at this time  carlson capital and its affiliates have a  percent voting ownership interest in the company  a lender affiliated with carlson double black diamond lp provided a  million credit facility to swk holdings in exchange for common stock warrants and first offer rights on future share issuances and  the firms investments are relatively concentrated in a sector where default risk can lead to permanent losses  carlson capital directly holds  percent of voting common stock additionally swk holdings chairman of the board michael weinberg and one its directors christopher w haga are employees of carlson these factors demonstrate that carlson has significant control over the investment objectives of swk holdings and this could be seen as a threat to shareholders interests despite carlsons significant controlling interest its interests and those of shareholders are significantly aligned the carlson employees that also work for swk holdings have significant compensation interests in swks performance carlson will also receive a greater return on its investment in swkh if swk holdings continues to perform well  while the risk of swk holdings defaulting on this credit facility is very low due to its steady stream of income from its investments the first offer rights that were given to double black diamond will probably lead to carlson capital and its affiliates further increasing their control over swk holdings this credit facility also has the contractual ability to prevent swk holdings from pursuing additional financing or stock issues if the firm defaults the mitigants for this risk are similar to those stated for  swk holdings is expected to easily be able to make its interest and principal payments on this credit facility additionally swk holdings has a rights agreement that allows it to protect itself from one entity buying more than  percent of its shares over a threeyear span lest the transaction be considered a change in ownership and the company lose its nol carryforwards  all of swk holdings investments are concentrated within the healthcare industry and this is an industry that has a relatively high rate of defaulting debt agreements since swk holdings may not be able to recoup its initial investment if this occurs this may lead to permanent losses for the firm swk holdings has experienced management that is excellent in identifying prudent debt investments in this sector and performing adequate due diligence additionally the investments team has had a four year track record of managing over  million in pharmaceutical royalty assets with no defaults to date intrinsic valuation the following intrinsic valuation was created by projecting out the growth in revenue for each of the revenue streams in each category of financing provided by swk holdings this was then used to arrive at a growth rate for the projected fiscal year and this growth rate was then applied towards the growth for that year in the discounted cash flow analysis that follows swk is unique in that it can leverage its nol carryforwards to enjoy tax benefits these carryforwards will begin to expire in  so we expect swk to begin ramping up its usage of these carryforwards as their expiry dates approach this is reflected in the model by the tax benefit that swk receives in  and  as well as the vastly lowered tax expense in   and  we used a conservative exit multiple of x despite comparable firms having an average forward pe multiple of x we believe the firms eventual maturity warrants this lower multiple through this exit multiple and a calculated wacc of  we arrived at an implied share price of   an implied discount of  revenue drivers model disclosure i amwe are long swkh i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not
