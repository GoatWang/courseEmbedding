growth peers and the sp  index during the first quarter of  the fund performed largely inline with the morningstar midcap growth funds category as the fund rose  compared to the category average return of  the fund outperformed the sp  by nearly  basis points as of march   in terms of sector performance energy was the worst performing sector in the first quarter of  and the fund benefited on a relative basis because it held no energy companies energy companies do not generally meet our strict criteria of longterm consistent growth in addition the fund benefited from its stock selection in healthcare with holdings idexx laboratories rising over  and mettlertoledo returning nearly  during the quarter conversely a few of the fund’s holdings suffered industrywide setbacks for example auto supply stores autozone and o’reilly automotive declined in the quarter due to reports that amazon may start selling auto parts directly on its website becoming a direct competitor to the traditional retail chains with these stores possessing knowledgeable personnel and a strong reliable brand name in an industry that is less sensitive to the market environment we believe these companies will be able to maintain their longterm consistent growth in earnings and stock price regardless of amazon’s entrance into this market while the fund can look for opportunity among companies of all sizes would you please discuss why you believe midcaps are a “sweet spot” for the strategy the fund utilizes the timetested value line research to seek companies experiencing consistency in earnings and stock price growth preferably over a year period or longer due to this strict criteria a majority of companies that fit this strategy are in the midcap category compared to smaller companies many midcap companies have  years of proven growth experienced management teams significant market share and proprietary goods and services in addition midcaps generally have more growth potential for longer time frames than their larger peers the slight uptick in volatility in late march reminded investors that prices can move in two directions how has the fund performed on a riskadjusted basis as of march   the value line premier growth fund provided “low or below average” risk over   and  year periods among its morningstar midcap growth peers the fund also provided lower standard deviation than the morningstar category during the same timeframes volatility has been unusually low during the past two quarters as the dow jones industrial average experienced  days without a daily  drop yet in march  there were more down days than up days with volatility potentially on an upswing we believe investors should consider an allocation that focuses on risk adjusted returns over time average
