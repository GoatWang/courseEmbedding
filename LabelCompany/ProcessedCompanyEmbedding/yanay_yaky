leader in stem cell market researchyou are here home  stem cells all types  mscs  interview with yaky yanay president and coceo of pluristem therapeuticsinterview with yaky yanay president and coceo of pluristem therapeuticsmarch   by cade hildreth ceoi had the honor of interviewing mr yaky yanay president and coceo of pluristem therapeutics psti a clinicalstage cell therapy company based in haifa israel in this interview we discuss the history of pluristem therapeutics its clinicalstage products intellectual property ip portfolio marketing strategy and future directions enjoy these insights into pluristem therapeutics a worldclass leader in cell therapy manufacturing and placentalderived productscade hildreth  what is your background and how did you become involved with pluristemmr yaky yanaymr yaky yanay  i was appointed as pluristem’s president and chief operating officer coo in february  and prior to that served as pluristem’s chief financial officer and secretary since november  and executive vice president since march  since my background is in business and finance i specialize in assessing global trends including macrotrends of aging and longevityi am also active in the life science industry within israel for over a year i have cochaired the largest innovation organization in israel which is called the israeli advanced technology industries iati  it is an organization that represents over  companies across all the innovation centers of israel the entire innovative ecosystem from hightech to life science to agro technologies and more it represents companies from across the life science spectrum in israelten years ago when i began looking at pluristem it was a very young company with  employees and a basic technology i realized that i had found the technology and the company that i would like to take from a small company into large international company i was very excited by the trends and technologies that i was observing and how pluristem could impact the marketplacecade hildreth  when was pluristem founded and around what technologymr yaky yanay  pluristem’s original technology was invented at the technion and the weizmann institute which are both famous throughout the world the basic technology was to create an environment or ecosystem that would allow cells to proliferate in a highly efficient and natural waythe first bioreactors that were invented were to support expansion of hematopoietic cells in  we converted the technology so that it could support the expansion of mscs derived from the placenta donated after fullterm delivery since that time we have been developing the technology and have changed it dramatically today our propriety bioreactor technology provides fullscale cell manufacturing capabilities that allows us to expand trillions of cells and create a commercialgrade productthe technology behind a closed system relies on the understanding that in cell therapy and especially in msc therapy the “process is the product” the way that you are going to process the cell is the final product that you are going to get controlling the process is essential to get batchtobatch consistency and make sure that you are able to scale up go into advanced clinical studies and eventually go to market using your cellspluristem has an advanced biotechnology that can provide very large quantities of cells with full control over the process allowing us to have batchtobatch consistency we use cells derived from a fullterm placenta to create an allogeneic cell product that is readytouse we have already treated hundreds of people across the globe for different indicationscade hildreth  excellent what are pluristem’s plx cellsmr yaky yanay we like to call our plx cells adherent stromal cells or mesenchymallike cells they are collected directly from placentas collected after delivery of a fullterm healthy babies we collect the placentas from consented donors and after the initial extraction and collection of the target cell population we expand the cells using our bioreactors to produce a large number of doses today we can get about  doses –  treatments – from a single placentain all of our clinical studies we make sure to use several placentas in order to demonstrate in phase i and phase ii studies that regardless of the placenta or identity of the donor that we get the same cell potency and therapeutic effect with our plx cellscade hildreth  what are the therapeutic effects of plx cellsmr yaky yanay  currently pluristem is undertaking several advanced clinical studies we are in the process of launching three pivotal studies the first one will be of plxpad in critical limb ischemia cli the second one will be for the same product in muscle damage after hip fracture repair surgery with the goal of triggering the regeneration of muscle improving recovery and rehabilitation after the procedure and improving the longterm outcome the third indication is acute radiation syndrome which we are expecting to undertake in collaboration with the united states governmentfrom our very early stages we made the strategic decision to control our manufacturing since using our threedimensional d bioreactor technology provides a strong competitive advantage that was the first decision to control our manufacturing the second decision was to have more than one cellbased product today we have two products in clinical stages plxpad and plxrthe third decision was that we are not going to perform a  patient study but instead we are going to pursue opportunities that exist worldwide that allow for a relatively small study size this is because we are focused on shortening our timetomarket i would like our plx products to enter the market as early as possible we are committed to this strategy so in the last few years we have had intense discussions with the different regulatorswe have identified the european adaptive pathway project as a very interesting pathway for approval we have also identified the japanese track for accelerated market approval as an interesting pathway we are fortunate that the european authorities accepted our cli program to be included under their adaptive pathway we are actually the only company in the world that has had both european and japanese regulators accept it for fasttrack approvalsfurthermore it was with great pleasure and surprise that we witnessed the us government pass the st century cures act with this legislation the us government decided that american patients also deserve to get early access to regenerative medicine technologies it was huge step for the senate to approve this bill and a major gamechanger in our industry in my opinion it is the most important event for the cell therapy industry that has occurred in the past year and maybe longer i am very pleased that the bill passedcade hildreth i am pleased as wellmr yaky yanay i believe the st century cures act resulted from trends relating to aging and longevity in the world i am a cpa by training and have a financial education i always like to look at the numbers and graphs to understand how the macrotrends are impacting our daytoday activity when you are looking at global trends with major changes in lifespan it is amazing i keep telling my team and everybody that i can speak with that we are very fortunate to live in a generation that has doubled our lifeexpectancy over the past  years or so over the past  years the average human lifespan has doubled and i expect that we are going to see continued increases in our lifeexpectancy over the coming  to  yearsi look carefully at numbers that identify macrotrends in china they expect to have about half a billion people over age  by  in japan they expect to have  of the population over  within two decades i also believe the same phenomenon will affect europe and the us regulators are finally shifting their perspective to understand that we cannot continue to treat the patients the way that we treat them today we either need to develop new technologies or we will be forced to make moral decisions about how to limit medical expenses for elderly patients which is of course not an easy decision i am a supporter of the developing new technologies to address these global issues with cell therapies representing one of the most promising regenerative medicine technologies in the marketplacepatients cannot stay chronically ill and injured they cannot be hospitalized forever currently about  of the us healthcare cost is for hospitalization the drug component contributes  or  so it is not the leading factor it is about what the drug is doing for the patient we need to identify whether current treatments can reverse disease in patients or if these drug treatments keep patients in a chronic state this is the reason that we need regenerative medicine it is the reason that we have seen the japanese approve accelerated pathways as well as the european union us and chinaglobal governments need to change their approach to healthcare and i believe that cell therapy is one of the most promising technologies that we can use to address these issues of aging and longevitycade hildreth i fully agree with your assessment and you explain it well what is your estimated timeline for bringing pluristem’s plx cell products to marketmr yaky yanay     for our phase ii b study we expect to get our clinical readout by early  we are launching now a phase iii cli study with  patients that will enroll participants within the us and europe we had to undertake a lot of discussions with regulators to allow this cli study to be for  patients instead of for  patients or  patients thankfully the regulators have been supportive in europe there will be an interim analysis of the data once half of the patients have completed follow up if the data is good we could apply for approval for marketing in europe at that time although we would complete the full studywe are also going to launch the second indication a phase iii study for muscle recovery after hip fracture which will recruit roughly  patients again we are investing a lot of time and effort with the regulators to define our study design the end points and the size of the study currently we have about  employees so for a company our size we must pursue study sizes that make sense with the strategy we are not going to undertake any study above a couple of hundred patients because it takes too long and involves too much riskthe third indication is acute radiation syndrome a study that is fully funded by the us government we have been able to show unbelievable results after injecting our cells post exposure to radiation we can keep close to  of the population alive in preclinical studies small animals in comparison to about  survival with the placebo the us government through the national institutes of health nih got involved to join the radiation project now we have moved into large animal studies with a mutual target to launch a pivotal study in because efficacy trials are not permitted in humans for this indication studies in large animal models are needed to evaluate dosing for pluristem’s plxr as a medical countermeasure in the treatment of the hematologic aspects of ars these trials will be conducted by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid a part of the nih once the optimal dose is determined in large animals a pivotal trial could be conducted to support submission of a biologics license application bla for plxr for this indication under the animal rule regulatory pathwaythis pivotal study is intended also to launch in  we are preparing the company towards filing a bla hopefully at the end of  or the beginning of  for this product also we are actively preparing the company to market this product which is very interestingcade hildreth excellent what are pluristem’s marketing strategiesmr yaky yanay  great question we have spent a lot of time to shape our marketing strategies our marketing strategy is a threelegged approachthe first leg pertains to indications that involve large patient populations such as critical limb ischemia cli and orthopedic indications like muscle recovery postsurgery millions of patients across the globe are affected by these indications because we are a small company we do not have the capabilities to market our products to so many patients for these two indications we are targeting them for licensing agreements with potential partners since we are talking about relatively small studies we have the capabilities to complete the study file the bla and get to the marketing strategy it is very good to have a licensing deal but since the early days when we had only  employees part of our strategy has been to make sure that we do not become only a licensing company that receives royalties we also want to derive our own revenues and execute marketing capabilitiesthe second leg of our marketing plan is to rely on direct sales of our products to government agencies as we intend to do with acute radiation syndrome ars we anticipate that we will be able to market this product to the us government and potentially other governments we may also have other indications that are applicable for direct selling to government the advantage here is that since we control manufacturing the government can provide us with logistics assistancethe third leg of our marketing strategy involves indications for very small patient populations we define very small indications as those for which the number of patients are  per year or fewer first we are talking about a very small number of patients and second we are talking about premium indications by premium indications i mean that payors are likely be willing to pay more for these indications because our cell therapy products can introduce major saving into the healthcare system for these indications we will start and build our own marketing chain starting at a very small scale and eventually targeting patient populations for larger indicationscade hildreth what types of intellectual property ip has pluristem securedmr yaky yanay  over the last  years we have collected about  granted patents and about  patents that are pending or in process we are having an ip strategy that has several different layers the first layer involves threedimensional d expansion of our cellular products we have been able to secure a good number of patents that protect our method for expanding cells in our threedimensional bioreactor environmentthe second layer is about the composition of matter patents we have been able to demonstrate that any cells that are expanded on d matrix have a different composition of matter from cells that are expanded with traditional d expansion we have numerous patents that pertain to the compositional matter for d expansion the third layer of our patent strategy pertains to indications and methods of cellular injection meaning how do we inject cells for specific indications usually we inject our products directly into the musclewe have invested a lot of effort into these areas over the past few years to develop controls to allow us to manufacture not only the best inclass cells but to have full control on over the shipment and delivery logistics of our cellular products we have highly defined processes so that our products involve the same exact cells and process each time we want to have minimal preferably zero manipulation once we near the patient’s bedsidecade hildreth  excellent when pluristem was founded its cell expansion technology was licensed from the technion are you still licensing the technology todaymr yaky yanay  yes in  we converted our licensing to full acquisition we acquired the technology and now are the sole owner of the technologycade hildreth  what are your  year goals for pluristemmr yaky yanay  in  we expect to launch three pivotal studies and have the data readout this year as well we also expect to have major business milestones occur during  we are moving very nicely along our clinical pathway if i look five years down the road i expect to submit a series of bla submissions as i mentioned as early as end of  or the beginning of  in   and  we are going to submit a series of bla’s at the rate of at least one per year we also expect to start to producing marketing revenues from our products in the coming two yearsone big advantage that people usually don’t understand about cell therapy is that cells can exert many different effects for our plx cells they release many factors once they receive signals from the patient’s body we know that they release antiinflammatory factors immunomodulatory factors hematopoietic recovery factors muscle recovery factors and many othersi am expecting to see a series of phase iv studies or postapproval studies from different physicians across the globe that will try to use our approved products for different indications as well as products from other cell therapy companies as this occurs i expect to see a major expansion of cell therapy technologies within the market after the first products get approved i get daily calls from different physicians that want to use our plx cells for different indications we will see postapproval studies for many different indications some of which will be conducted by us and some of which will be conducted by the different clinical centerscade hildreth great points why did pluristem decide to focus on placental cellsmr yaky yanay the placenta is one of the most fascinating organs in the world first the placenta is a combination of two human beings it contains the cells of the mother and the baby what’s also important is that the placenta is extremely available you do not have to harvest anything to get the cells because you collect the cells after a fullterm pregnancy a healthy delivery you can collect  grams of young healthy tissue that would otherwise usually be thrown outadditionally the placenta is an ideal source for allogeneic cell therapy because of one special reason  the placenta comes from pregnancy which is the only place in nature where you see two organs living together without any immune response of the mother against the baby or the baby against the mother the placenta is the gateway between the mother and the baby which have of course different immune systems if you think about it a mother can even be a surrogate and carry a child which is not her own one that is not genetically related to her however her body does not reject the babytoday we know that the mother goes through a major immune modulation during pregnancy we are collecting the cells from the placenta which is the gateway between the mother and the baby and the organ that is responsible for allowing two different immune systems to live together we take these young fresh placenta cells which are very potent and have a unique immunological profile that allow us to do injection of the cells in an allogeneic way even if we are injecting repeated doses from the same placenta it is an amazing organ we cannot ask more than thatcade hildreth it is very interesting that you are leveraging a natural biological statemr yaky yanay yes because our cells are mscs and from the placenta they are immune privileged today we know that placenta cells are more immuneprivileged than any other cellscade hildreth fascinating pluristem is currently a leader in producing large quantities of placentabased cells what do you see as the future of placental cell therapiesmr yaky yanay celgene is also developing placenta based products for their celgene cell therapy division ctd  that is good news to see a company like celgene getting involved in this type of cell therapythe future of cell therapy i think the industry will need to figure out the way to scaleup production i believe the way to scaleup is by using a threedimensional bioreactor process it provides the capacity to scaleup significantly to inject millions of patients using the cells which is not the case with other technologies however we know today that changing the scaleup technology also changes and alters the cells eventually the companies that will become the dominant players within this industry are the ones that can manufacture cells in a very efficient way with both operational and financial efficiencyi truly believe that cell therapy has the potential to not only provide cures for many significant ailments and disorders but also to significantly reduce healthcare costs by allowing a reversal and repair of disease it depends on us the companies and the executives operating within this industry to produce clear strong clinical data i think that we are seeing a strong desire from regulators across the global to have these technologies come to market i hope and believe that we will be able to provide this datacade hildreth currently israel is a global leader for cell therapy innovation led by pluristem therapeutics gamida cell stem cell medicine ltd and many others what is supporting this innovation with israelmr yaky yanay that is a good question within israel science and technology play a major part of our life people appreciate education scientific development and progress additionally the goal of israel is to provide prosperity technology and wellbeing to the world people speak of innovation here people appreciate innovation and people want to contribute technologies that will do many good things for humanityas i mentioned earlier life science is one of the most important evolutions to happen over the past  years we need to contribute especially in this field also the number of large science companies in israel has tripled over the past decade it is continuously increasing most of these companies are young companies but some of them are starting to mature  when i speak with my friends and colleagues here that head life science companies we share an enthusiasm and desire to make sure that israel will be a leading provider of life science technologies we want to contribute our knowledge to help as many people as we can across the globe  i also believe that life science will be the leading industry in israel over the coming years even more important to our country than the hightech industrycade hildreth thank your for your time and knowledge it is an honor to learn about pluristem therapeutics and its future directions i appreciate the time you have
