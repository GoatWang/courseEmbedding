of the development of such an engine the machine was done by lowell machine works of cleveland ohio one of the reasons the engine was fabricated in cleveland was because they had gasoline available there he also had the design and the body of horseless carriage done there also the running gears for the automobile were fabricated there lambert went to extremes to have the engine made lightweight this was the first experience lambert had with building an automobile engine he originally agreed to spend  for the machine work to produce the automobile engine however after spending  wacholtz was not able to produce a working engine in cleveland lambert stopped the work at this stage of fabrication and shipped the nonworking engine and incomplete automobile to a small machine shop that he owned in ohio city this way he could then devote his personal attention to the engine and automobile when he could from his businesses he was running there the automobile consisted of two clutches and two chains which were connected to a jack shaft the two clutches gave two speeds forward and there was no reverse speed used the single front wheel of the tricycle designed automobile was steered by a foot lever and a hand lever this direct steering method provided that the arms could be rested and the steering done by the feet and vice versa one item that needed to be solved for completion and a working engine was a means of carburation lambert heard of a means of vaporizing gasoline by gottlieb daimler of germany he went to new york to see the engine that was operating a boat after seeing this complicated carburetor lambert developed what he called the vaporizer this was a simpler carburetor than daimlers which he was then able to get the engine working the way he intended it to the automobile was completed soon after he had it ohio city john w lamberts first american gasoline automobile there was a great deal of secrecy surrounding the developments of lamberts automobile operational tests were conducted with the window blinds pulled at the farm implement showroom where he ran it outside road tests were conducted at night on roads that were not used that was a good thing since many times there were long intervals between being able to get the automobile started again after it stopped it turned out that the villagers didnt even know what lambert was working on since it was such a new concept they didnt realize the significance of lamberts horseless carriage lambert is said to have had the first automobile accident one time when he was testing his horseless carriage at night in a secret run he drove his vehicle into a tree stump and ran into a hitching post he made up sales brochures for his horseless carriage in january  however not a single person bought one he decided after extensive work on this automobile that the idea of a horseless carriage was way off into the future and was discouraged to continue his father and brother encouraged him to sell his businesses in ohio city and move to union city ohio where they were and made stationary gasoline engines – which had an established market already there in  he started the buckeye manufacturing company and the lambert gas and gasoline engine company to make stationary engines and farm machinery implements later in  lambert started the union automobile company in that city lambert moved to anderson indiana from union city in  he then moved some of his machinery from his union city plant at that time lambert incorporated the buckeye manufacturing company and lambert gas

huntington  see also  footnotes  primary sources  secondary sources historyedit john william lambert made americas first such automobile in  according to a fiveyear extensive study by l scott bailey a wellknown automobile historian editor and publisher the study found substantial evidence to enter this claim on lamberts behalf the evidence from baileys study shows that lambert designed built and ran a gasoline engine automobile in the early part of  that he put on the market it shows that neither henry ford nor the duryea brothers have the distinction of building the first such practical working internal combustion gasoline engine automobile in the united states in europe carl benz and gottlieb daimler produced the first gasoline automobiles in  the duryea brothers made their automobile in  and started the duryea motor wagon company in  massproducing cars henry ford started massproducing cars in  at the detroit automobile company lambert initially designed and built his horseless carriage gasoline automobile in  he successfully tested it in january  inside an foot  m farm implement showroom he owned in ohio city ohio lamberts threewheeled surreytop gasolinepowered buggy was his own design it had a single cylinder fourstroke engine this the buckeye gasoline buggy was a oneseat tricycle with large rear wheels lambert designed a sales brochures advertising its specifications in january  he mailed this brochure out to prospects in the first part of february  with a price of  later in the month of february  he was running his automobile on the main street of ohio city bailey points out there are several letters on file dated in the latter part of february and the early part of march  requesting additional information on this horseless carriage that lambert described in the brochure other letters of inquire continued however lambert ultimately was not able to sell any this first model had a wipe spark ignition and dry cell batteries the automobile had two speeds forward and none going backwards a hand steering device was added later when the automobile was used outside on the roads the weight of the car was  pounds it had wooden wheels with steel rims for extra wear the carburetor was a surface vaporizer with a flexible diaphragm compensator this was patented by lambert on may   the original model cost lambert  in  it was lost in a fire when a grain elevator building that he was having remodeled burned to the ground in  lambert decided to manufacture stationary gasoline engines he moved to anderson indiana and there started buckeye manufacturing company in that same year he announced he would soon have a gasoline vehicle on the market to be called the buckeye he sent a picture to the newspapers which was of the buckeye gasoline buggy he made in  this endeavor also did not come to fruition instead he continued experimentation and devised the friction gearing disk drive transmission he invented and developed a friction transmission that would be the key feature on all of his future automobiles he would make lamberts first model design of  was eventually modified and developed into the union automobile which first was sold in  festivaledit lambert days is a community celebrating that honors the life of john w lambert the first gasolinepowered singlecylinder vehicle and the worlds first car wreck this is an annual threeday event that takes place in ohio city ohio on the third weekend of july activities and events car show art festival flea market sporting events parade live entertainment and lambert automobile displays others before duryeaedit in the late nineteenth century there were many individuals in the united states working on a horseless carriage some of which paralleled the time frame of lambert some notable individuals with verifiable primary sources that invented such vehicles before the duryea brothers were henry nadig charles h black and elwood p haynes henry nadigedit henry nadig of allentown pennsylvania invented a vehicle that history records he built sometime between  and  in  nadig reports that he began to construct a horseless carriage in  and when he finished it he then ran it on fourth street in allentown the original  vehicle was extensively modified in the winter of – to the point it could be almost considered a different vehicle this vehicle was driven for pleasure for the next ten years as of  this vehicle was owned by a david k bausch of allentown about  of the original vehicle still existed however it was in rough condition and needed complete restoration the historical importance of this particular vehicle is that it may be the oldest americamade gasolinepowered automobile that still exists charles h blackedit main article charles h black charles h black reported that he completed and tested his first steam engine chug buggy in  he rejected a steam engine as too cumbersome and hard to manage for use in an automobile he then went about making a gasoline engine vehicle later in  he then tried such a horseless carriage out in indianapolis on the paved streets of circle and delaware he drove this vehicle around indianapolis for the next twenty years a business card of ch black manufacturing company showed a picture of this vehicle with the writing estimates furnished for powerequipped vehicles of any style the business card was dated  elwood p haynesedit elwood p haynes who successfully made his trial run of his automobile on july   arranged a meeting with lambert shortly thereafter he told lambert a close friend of his that he planned on manufacturing the car and wanted to advertise it as americas first car to be able to promote sales lambert agreed not to refute this even though lamberts threewheeled automobile is considered to be the first successful gasoline automobile available for sale in the united states he let his friend haynes take the honors a mistake haynes made was that the duryea brothers and others predated him lambert never broke his promise to his friend however when he went into production he often made reference to his  gasoline engine horseless carriage buggy but never said it was americas first car made the smithsonian institution has not declared lambert the inventor of the first commercially available selfpowered gasoline engine automobile because he himself never made this claim others with prior patentsedit selden  roadengine invention george b seldenedit george b selden applied for a patent on a vehicle in  of an improved road engine based on a compression engine that used liquidhydrocarbon fuel ie gasoline the patent covered the basics of constructing a horseless carriage of a selfpropelled automobile however he had not actually built such a vehicle selden worked off the principles of george braytons twocycle gasoline engine patented in  blayton had exhibited his engine at the philadelphia centennial exposition in  and selden then decided to use that engine or a modified version of it as the basis for a patent he went about drawing up a model of a vehicle and applied for a patent strictly based on the drawing alone selden then used legal evasive tactics to stall the patents acceptance each year making minor amendments until he felt it was favorable for commercial production of the american automobile the idea behind this was that he wanted to secure the claim of being the first to have invented the automobile and get the seventeenyear legal rights to all the automobile royalties he legally stalled the process until he was forced to complete the application process this was sixteen years after he first applied for the patent and a few months before the actual massproduction of automobiles by car manufactures history records of automobile technology do not support his claim as being the first to have invented the automobile because at the time he was issued the patent selden had not been able to make a working model this evasion and stalling of finalizing a patent then had much influence as to how future automobile patents were handled from then on frank a huntingtonedit huntington vehicle  invention main article frank atwood huntington a vehicle was patented by a f a huntington of san francisco on january   this was about six months after carl benz received a patent in the united states for a selfpropelling vehicle there seems to be no further record if huntington built his  gasoline engine vehicle or if there was a west coast sales distribution of the vehicle before  huntingtons  patent was four years before the duryea brothers built their first car in  huntingtons patent number  states “ my invention relates to certain improvements in vehicles and it consists of an engine and suitable intermediate gearing whereby the vehicle may be propelled as will be more fully explained by reference to the accompanying drawings in which figure  is a plan view of the engine tank and gearing fig  is a side elevation

the principles of george braytons twocycle gasoline engine patented in  blayton had exhibited his engine at the philadelphia centennial exposition in  and selden then decided to use that engine or a

stall the patents acceptance each year making minor amendments until he felt it was favorable for commercial production of the american automobile the idea behind this was that he wanted to secure the claim of being the first to have invented the automobile and get the seventeenyear legal rights to all the automobile royalties he legally stalled the process until he was forced to complete the application process this was sixteen years after he first applied for the patent and a few months before the actual massproduction of automobiles by car manufactures history records of automobile technology do not support his claim as being the first to have invented the automobile because at the time he was issued the patent selden had not been able to make a working model this evasion and
