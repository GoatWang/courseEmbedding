insider trading case against sac capital advisors federal prosecutors have given a particularly nice gift to a former federal prosecutor bart m schwartz mr schwartz who is now the chairman of the consulting firm guidepost solutions was appointed sac’s independent compliance consultant and is charged with assessing the firm’s future trading practices the job is likely to earn mr schwartz millions but it will do little more than that it’s all part of the corporate monitoring industry a full employment act for former federal prosecutors that may have little effect on the way any company that is forced to hire a monitor conducts its business sac capital’s guilty plea was accepted by a federal judge last week the firm will pay a record  billion penalty for insider trading — a  million fine and about  million in forfeited profits deal professorview all posts the hedge fund will survive — even after the guilty pleas to insider trading charges by six employees and the conviction of two others — but in diminished form sac capital has already renamed itself point asset management making it sound strangely like a s euro trash band sac has also left the investment advisory business meaning it will only be managing about  billion mostly the personal fortune of the firm’s founder steven a cohen still is this punishment sufficient after all it allows an enterprise that harbored extensive corruption to continue enter mr schwartz who has a long history of serving as an independent monitor in government investigations he is the ostensible key to ensuring that point will remain on the straight and narrow a compliance monitor or consultant is a creation of the last decade when a corporation accused of wrongdoing agrees to settle the charges or is sentenced to probation it is often required to pay for a monitor to ensure that it does not break the law again the corporate monitor is to supervise the compliance procedures of the company as well as beef them up companies as diverse as apple bp deutsche bank and jpmorgan chase have all been subject to corporate monitors of late the monitors are supervising areas like compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and antitrust laws and after a violation why not have a person come in and make sure things go right it turns out there may be problems one of the main criticisms of these programs is that they perpetuate an “old boys’ network” rewarding former federal prosecutors with a job that pays millions of dollars mr schwartz for example the compliance consultant for point worked in the united states attorney’s office under rudolph giuliani he has made a career out of providing services related to the prosecution of crime and runs a company that provides not only corporate investigation and monitoring services but also surveillance systems and dna analysis there are other examples too paul j mcnulty a former deputy attorney general who wrote the justice department’s guidelines on charging corporations with criminal wrongdoing is a partner at the law firm baker  mckenzie and leads its compliance and investigations committee the work is quite lucrative the fees that mr schwartz is charging have not been disclosed but will probably run in the millions if not tens of millions of dollars in  questions were raised over the hiring of former attorney general john ashcroft to serve as corporate monitor of zimmer holdings a medical supply company in indiana accused of paying kickbacks to doctors mr ashcroft’s firm was selected by chris christie then the united states attorney in new jersey to be the monitor for which he received a fee of up to  million mr ashcroft by the way had been mr christie’s boss mr christie reported to him when mr ashcroft was attorney general mr christie had previously directed similar corporate monitoring contracts to two former justice department officials and a former republican state attorney general in new jersey the attorney general at the time michael b mukasey who was concerned about the appearance of favoritism opened an internal investigation into the appointment no specific charges were brought but in the wake of the ashcroft deal the justice department adopted the socalled morford principles named after the author craig s morford the acting deputy attorney general at the time the principles were intended to stem abuses in the naming of corporate counsel by requiring that monitors be picked for their “merit” but did not offer specific guidelines or prevent giving out these plum jobs to old colleagues not surprisingly monitors are still picked in a rather murky way in the case of sac for example mr schwartz was chosen by the firm a selection backed by an anonymous committee in the united states attorney’s office the work of these monitors is also secretive the justice department does not regularly report the existence and names of these monitors beyond that the monitors’ work is almost never disclosed the monitors are supposed to prepare reports that are given to the government any followup action by the government is also seldom disclosed one estimate of how many monitors have been appointed in the last decade is about a hundred but we are just not sure as part of its agreement with prosecutors sac capital for example was required to a hire a “compliance consultant” to review its insider trading policies even though the term here is consultant it is no different than a monitor because mr schwartz is there to look at the firm’s practices mr schwartz will file a report after 4 days identifying any “deficiencies” in point’s insider trading policies there will be another report after six months on progress in correcting these deficiencies if any exist asked about his work for sac mr schwartz said he had no comment james m margolin a spokesman for the united states attorney’s office in manhattan which handled the sac case said only that the consultant’s “reports are filed with our office they will not be made public” he added “beyond that we have no further comment” jonathan gasthalter a spokesman for point declined to comment on mr schwartz’s role at the firm or his compensation mr schwartz’s reports are advisory meaning that point can ignore them but does anyone really think that the monitor’s work will have any effect on how point does business mr cohen has every incentive to keep on the straight and narrow after avoiding criminal charges not only that but the adoption of insider trading protocols has no doubt been a priority for the company for some time corporate monitors may actually do good work — ensuring that a company improves its compliance and does not break the law again but companies often agree to them to avoid being prosecuted why should this compliance be outsourced for millions of dollars wouldn’t it be better for the government to take the money and make its own assessment or arrange its own investigation i’m not upset that mr cohen is going to be paying the equivalent of the cost of one of his expensive paintings but it would be nice to know that the public is getting something for this money without seeing the monitors’ work it’s
