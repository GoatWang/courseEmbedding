a woertz is one of the most powerful female executives in the united states with  billion in revenue adm ranks among the nations largest companies—never before has such a us powerhouse hired a woman for its top post woertz is a rarity in the world of executives—as of  only eleven fortune  companies had female ceos woertz who cut her teeth by spending  years in the ranks of the maledominated oil business dismisses her gender she prefers to think of herself as a ceo who happens to be a woman im fairly certain that archer daniels midland didnt hire me because im a woman i think my background and my performance mean more she said in a statement shortly after accepting the job according to the san diego uniontribune  woertz was born in pittsburgh pennsylvania on st patricks day in  her father chuck worked in the business world heading up a homeconstruction and development company woertzs mother vi was a librarian who believed summer vacations should be used for educational purposes as such woertz and her brother chuck jr did not spend their summers dallying on the beaches like many of their peers instead they toured corporate and industrial america my mother felt wed be earning a living during our entire adult lives and therefore believed we should spend summers in learning activities woertz once noted according to the chicago tribune  consequently i got to see a plate glass factory in pittsburgh a us steel plant and how heinz made ketchup other vacation destinations included an oil refinery a window factory and the headquarters of gulf oil and mellon bank which were both based in pittsburgh this early exposure to the manufacturing world made woertz feel at ease in industrial settings and helped pave the way for her future definitely there was a seed of inspiration sown there woertz told fortune s jon birger ive always enjoyed seeing how things are made after graduating from high school woertz felt pulled to follow her passion for mathematics speaking at a leadership conference in  in a speech titled stepping up to leadership in a global world woertz described how her love for math ultimately drove her into the corporate world if there was any one interest that might have signaled my future in business it was probably that i liked math i loved its complexity i loved taking apart a really hairy problem understanding its components and then solving it she acknowledged that running a corporation involves the same skills just on an elevated level when woertz graduated from pennsylvania state university in  with a degree in accounting she was already an anomaly in the early s there were not many women going into the field a star pupil in her graduating class woertz received several job offers she accepted a position with ernst  young in pittsburgh as one of  recruits who joined the company that year of those  there was only one other woman woertz already had ambition and drive—she dreamed that one day she might become a partner in an accounting firm little did she know she possessed the business acumen to go even farther during her time at ernst  young woertz worked with both small colleges and multinational firms she developed close ties with one client gulf oil corp and in  woertz left the accounting firm to join its forces at the time gulf oil was fortifying its internal auditing department because an investigation had uncovered that company executives had funneled millions of dollars into illegal campaign contributions woertz proved to be an invaluable numberscruncher and in  gulf oil transferred her to houston to head up an audit team the move was just one of the many relocations woertz was forced to take while following her dreams and ambitions woertz married along the way and had three children including a set of twins her husband a logistics consultant was supportive though woertz is now divorced she acknowledges her former husbands support helped open up her career path at one point we sort of said to each other gee somebodys career is going to have to take priority she recalled to fortune  in the end the couple followed her career plans during the s gulf oil united with chevron in the largest corporate merger to date under terms approved by the federal trade commission gulf was ordered to sell off some of its operations including a refinery a pipeline company and some  gas stations woertz was assigned to the team that handled the divestitures and was also charged with finding ways to pay down debt the task afforded woertz the opportunity to learn about assets and investments impressed with her financial insight in handling the job chevron invited woertz to join its san francisco office and work with strategic planning in  woertz was appointed finance manager of chevron information technology co and by  had been named head of strategic planning woertz continued to make a name for herself at chevron and in  was named president of chevron canada a refining and marketing subsidiary based in vancouver british columbia canada by  woertz was president of chevron international in  after the merger of chevron and texaco woertz became an executive vice president in charge of downstream operations downstream refers to everything that is done with oil after it comes out of the ground in this position woertz was in charge of keeping watch over the companys global refining lubricant and marketing businesses as well as its supply and trading ventures while downstream operations encompassed just one branch of the company it was no small matter—the division typically raked in  billion in annual revenues at its helm woertz was in charge of  refineries and  employees in  countries woertz struggled at first during the first part of  earnings in her division tanked dropping from  billion to  million the slide was at tributed to market problems a weak economy and operational glitches woertz fired her senior management team and reorganized the operation she developed an action plan that called for lowering operating expenses reducing refinery downtime and cutting better oil deals through her costsavings plan woertz turned a loss of  million in  into a  billion profit in  the job at chevron gave woertz firsthand experience with the global marketplace in one twoweek period she visited operations in costa rica brazil uruguay argentina the ivory coast nigeria and the canary islands this global interfacing helped prepare her for the job at archer daniels midland adm despite her love for the oil industry woertz took early retirement and left chevron in february of  to pursue other opportunities by april woertz had been scooped up by decatur illinoisbased adm one of the worlds largest farmcommodities processors adm takes products from farmers—like corn wheat and soybeans—and turns them into such products as chocolate corn sweeteners flour and soymeal among other things woertz however was brought on board to help adm boost its cornbased ethanol business as oil costs continue to rise adm is betting on the alternative fuel ethanol adm is the largest producer of ethanol in the united states and has been making it since the energy crisis of the late s since then adm has been waiting patiently for ethanol demand to take off in the marketplace by  it looked like ethanol would likely become a key player in the alternative energy craze as state legislatures passed bills requiring that gas be blended with ethanol in addition big industry seemed to be jumping on the biofuel bandwagon—in the early s automakers began releasing vehicles that ran on gas as well as e a blend of  percent ethanol and  percent petroleum in an effort to capture more of the ethanol market adm wanted to boost production worldwide by building about a dozen plants adm higherups thought woertzs expertise might help in this area ethanol is a tricky product it is highly corrosive and cannot be transported by pipeline greggory warren an analyst with the investment research firm morningstar inc told the chicago tribune that he believes adm hired woertz to help solve this problem she understands how to get the product from the processing plant to the consumers gas tank warren said adm is betting the future on energy products speaking to fortune  one former adm manager acknowledged that woertz had a tough job on her hands as only the eighth ceo in the companys year history in addition the company had been run by a member of the andreas family for decades by god if you only knew the culture there bringing an outsider a woman no less into a company thats a bastion of lifers and good ol boys—i cant tell you how huge a change that is upon joining adm woertzs salary was set at  million she also received a  million signing bonus in cash and stock the highpowered executive took time to ease into the job and made an effort to get to know the company and its employees from directors to factory workers during her first  days she logged thousands of miles on the companys jets she met with  employees and visited  of the companys operations she also held a global town hall meeting through a webcast that allowed employees from different locations across the world to ask her questions when woertz was hired at adm there was much talk about her being the first woman to run such a large company woertz downplayed her gender as has always been her style even on the golf course when she hits the green with business clients woertz refuses to start off on the womens tees that are incrementally closer to the hole though woertz deemphasizes her status as a woman she does take time to speak to upandcoming female business executives she has spoken to the women in leadership conference at the university of californiaberkeley and has been a commencement speaker at her alma mater one of woertzs children paula lucchini seems to be following her mother into the corporate jungle after graduating with an engineering degree from the university of san diego in  she joined chevron stepping right into the maledominated workforce her mother has spent her career navigating woertz believes her success is a direct result of her willingness to move around take on new challenges and find solutions getting the top job at adm involved years of hour workweeks and switching jobs every couple years to expand her experience i had a very pragmatic upbringing woertz noted in an online article posted on the website of the penn state smeal college of business im not one to get stuck in doubt or to dwell on a dilemma you make intelligent choices you take reasonable
