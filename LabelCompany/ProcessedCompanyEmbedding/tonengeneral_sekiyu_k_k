refineries  petroleum and petroleum products wholesalers except bulk stations and terminals tonengeneral sekiyu kk is one of japan’s largest oil refining and marketing companies the company is the result of a  merger of tonen corporation and general sekiyu both of which were majorityowned subsidiaries of us oil giant exxon mobil corporation exxonmobil exxonmobil holds a  percent stake in tonengeneral sekiyu with four refineries tonengeneral sekiyu has a combined refining capacity of more than  barrels per day approximately  percent of the country’s total capacity the refineries produce a range of products including kerosene gas oil heavy fuel oil lubricants naphtha liquefied petroleum gas natural gas and gasoline the company markets its gasoline through the exxonmobil marketing group and holds approximately a  percent share of the japanese gasoline market tonengeneral’s subsidiary tonen chemical corporation also manufactures and distributes petrochemical products general sekiyus early history although tonen corporation was incorporated almost ten years before general sekiyu came into being general sekiyu’s roots extend much further back than its date of incorporation general sekiyu had its beginning in the mitsui zaibatsu a very large general trading company which became involved in the distribution of petroleum products as early as the s when it began to sell kerosene although it was later forced out of that business by foreign competitors the company reentered the oil business in the years following world war i since japan has very little natural petroleum this reentry meant dealing with a foreign supplier in  mitsui became the exclusive distributor in the far east for the refined petroleum products of general petroleum corporation a us company mitsui quickly set up facilities to market and store oil and by selling highquality oil from california at competitive prices was able to challenge successfully the dominance of dutch oil interests in japan in  however mitsui’s us supplier was purchased by standard oil of new york and it became difficult to maintain the company’s distribution arrangements in  standard oil of new york and standard oil of new jersey combined their operations in the far east to create standardvacuum known as stanvac along with rising sun a dutch company stanvac held  percent of japan’s domestic oil market throughout the early s having failed to work out an agreement to enter the refining business with stanvac mitsui negotiated a contract to distribute the company’s products in  the japanese government passed the petroleum industry law bringing the oil industry under government control as part of the preparations for the expected war petroleum used to power japanese warships was seen as a vital strategic resource the law required all foreign oil companies to maintain a sixmonth supply of oil beyond the usual inventories when stanvac balked at this requirement mitsui compromised with its foreign partners by building tanks that would hold a threemonth supply while the us firm took care of the other half of the requirement tonens early history in july  just a few years after the petroleum industry law was passed and with the country still gearing up for war the ministry of defense and the fuel department of the ministry of commerce and industry formed a partnership of ten japanese oilrelated companies the partnership—consisting of nippon sekiyu kokura sekiyu chosen sekiyu aikoku sekiyu sayama sekiyu mitsubishi sha holdings mitsubishi shoji trading aratsu sekiyu maruzen sekiyu and mitsubishi mining co—was called towa nenryo kogyo co ltd a name later changed to tonen corporation the new company had capital of ¥ million and  employees keizaburo hashimoto president of the nippon sekiyu co ltd was appointed chairman of the board and fusazo kokura president of kokura sekiyu co ltd became president the larger corporate investors dispatched managerial officers to the company at the start of the refinery operation sales and the procurement of crude oil and finance were supported and ensured by the japanese ministry of defense the choice of an industrial site and the question of which technologies to adopt for the refinery operations however were major concerns as the result of cooperative discussions among shareholders a research and development center was located at the shimizu plant site in the shizuoka prefecture and the refinery facilities were located in the wakayama plant site in the wakayama prefecture in september  the production and distribution of oil products in japan fell under the influence of the national policy promoted by the fuel department of the ministry of commerce and industry all japanese oil companies’ independent business activities were severely restricted the effects of the national policy were limited however in the case of towa nenryo tonen which was heavily engaged in munitions production wartime and postwar restructuring in  normalpressure distillers began to operate in tonen’s wakayama refinery and successfully produced engine starter volatile oil airplane fuels automobile gasoline mineral turpentine solvent kerosene light oils and heavy oil from  to  the wakayama refinery processed  kiloliters of crude oil  percent for munitions and  percent for civilian use in  a crude oil heating distillery was built at the wakayama refinery and processed  kiloliters of crude oil before the end of world war ii— percent for munitions and  percent for civilian use on tonen’s shimizu site research and development activities started as a result of the serious shortage of natural resources caused by the war the major projects at the research and development center were the substitution for petroleum products of other materials such as highoctane gasoline developed from artificial oil and lubricants made from raw natural rubber and the processing of heavy tar oil produced in southeast asia and volatile oil made from pinetree gum the construction of the shimizu refinery was hindered by the shortage of materials under wartime conditions and was not realized on a large scale until  after the war ended tonen experienced a considerable fall in sales when the need for airplane fuel for munitions use ceased abruptly threequarters of tonen’s  employees were dismissed in  the major board members including chairman and president were banned from public duties by the supreme commander for the allied powers scap because of their involvement in japan’s war effort and they were obliged to resign from the company nobuhei nakahara became president scap prohibited crude oil imports to japan and banned refinery operations on the pacific coast site tonen almost ceased to operate until  the late s were a pivotal time for the various divisions of the mitsui zaibatsu including the one that was eventually to become general sekiyu as well on july   the supreme commander of the allied powers then ruling japan ordered the breakup of the mitsui and other zaibatsu which it perceived as having an undesirable feudalistic and totalitarian influence on the country in the wake of this order managers of the different divisions of mitsui bussan kaisha the main trading arm of the company took responsibility for the welfare of their employees and set up their own new enterprises based on their former business functions accordingly members of the old petroleum department set up an independent company to market and distribute oil the company was named general bussan kaisha ltd and was capitalized at only ¥ in setting up business the new firm relied on the strong relationship with stanvac that it had inherited from its parent mitsui in  general bussan kaisha took over the osaka general bussan which had originated from the fuel department of the osaka branch of mitsui bussan kaisha ltd and thus consolidated all the petroleum operations of the former zaibatsu under one name and management the company continued to distribute petroleum under government direction in the early postwar years japan’s oil industry struggled to recover from the devastation wrought by allied bombardment of the home islands almost all of the petroleum industry’s infrastructure including its refineries and tanks had been reduced to rubble distribution of oil was firmly under the control of the occupying government and the main task at hand for the industry was to rebuild company perspectives tonengeneral sekiyu kk as one of the world’s premier oil refining and marketing companies is committed to the future of japan by providing a stable supply of safe highquality energy products by making full use of the worldwide network of the exxonmobil group our goal is to respond swiftly to customer requirements and to make a positive contribution to the needs of customers employees shareholders local communities and society as a whole in december  tonen like general started a relationship with the standardvacuum oil company stanvac to start up its refinery business again tonen needed a crude oil supply distribution outlets and technical and financial support for production facilities and a business relationship with stanvac was thought to be indispensable to acquire the highest production technology from standard oil development company sod later renamed exxon research and engineering company tonen transferred  percent of its ownership to stanvac in july  oil refining on the pacific coast site was again permitted by scap and tonen started operations in  this relationship with stanvac meant that stanvac had partnerships with both tonen and general—a commonality that would ultimately lead to the merging of the two companies s end of allied occupation expansion for both companies in  the allied occupation of japan ended and rationing of petroleum was abolished the demand for oil to fuel the nation’s postwar industrial boom began to increase in november  general strengthened its ties with stanvac when a new contract between the two companies was negotiated authorizing the japanese company to distribute stanvac’s refined petroleum products this access to a stable supply of petroleum products allowed the company to expand rapidly tonen also was focused on expansion pursuing two basic strategies first the expansion of production facilities had to take place as quickly as possible to enable the company to take advantage of domestic market opportunities as the strategic importance of its pacific coast location increased the shimizu refinery’s production capacity had to increase very quickly second using advanced technology licensed from sod the quality of products and the efficiency of refinery processes had to be improved as the motorization of japan was expected to take place in the near future the development of highoctane gasoline and highquality lubricants was necessary the establishment of production methods was of great importance to tonen in november  fluid catalytic cracking fcc a refinery method using catalysts to make fuel oil was introduced in the wakayama refinery processing  barrels per day in  tonen’s refining capacity reached  barrels per day the wakayama refinery processed  barrels per day of crude oil and the shimizu refinery processed  barrels per day at that time the largest refinery operations in japan general also was seeing the fruits of its labors in  the company was listed on the tokyo stock exchange for the first time by  in addition to its main office in tokyo general had opened branch offices in  other cities around japan and owned petroleum storage tanks in  separate locations the company sold its products to other dealers as well as directly to factories and government agencies it had obtained the contract to supply stanvac bunker oil to foreign ships in japanese ports and to japanese ships in foreign ports just seven years after its founding general’s capitalization had increased to ¥ million with shares held by nearly  stockholders expansion projects continued after this period in  tonen completed a new barrelperday refinery and still another baitelperday fcc refinery was built in  in  after the completion of alkylation equipment production volume of airplane fuels reached  barrels per year almost equal to the annual airplane fuel consumption of the country tonen almost monopolized the airplane fuel market in japan key dates  the mitsui zaibatsu large trading company the forerunner to general sekiyu becomes the exclusive

sekiyu and tonen corporation merge forming tonengeneral sekiyu from  to  tonen’s investment in production capacity expansion amounted to ¥ billion the company made seven issues of stock to finance its expansion consequently the company’s equity grew  times in this period from ¥ million in  to ¥ billion in  in  tonen established two joint ventures general sekiyu kk capitalized at ¥ billion and owned on a  basis with general bussan kaisha ltd which became general sekiyu seisei co ltd in  and nichimo sekiyu co ltd equally owned with nippon gyomo sengu co ltd by entering into joint ventures tonen was able to operate at higher capacity and thus benefit from economics of scale to finance its expansion the company made seven new stock issues between  and  when it was capitalized at ¥ billion having grown almost three times over this period s vertical integration for tonen splitup of stanvac tonen’s aim in the s was vertical integration into oilrelated fields including transportation of crude oil new product development diversification into petrochemicals and alliance with other industrial enterprises these changes were achieved in several stages tonen founded toa tanker co ltd with a capital of ¥ billion minao furihata vicepresident of towa nenryo became toa tanker’s president and in  the company’s name was changed to tonen tanker co ltd in the s transportation costs represented a relatively large proportion of the total cost of crude oil to bring down crude oil prices the reduction of transportation costs was essential under the policy for promoting japan’s petrochemical industry enacted by the ministry of international trade and industry tonen diversified into petrochemicals in  tonen founded tonen sekiyukagaku petrochemical co ltd with capital of ¥ billion tonen president enpei nakahara was also president of this new company steamcracking and oxyalcohol plants were built in the kawasaki refinery and production of ethylene propylene and butane began in  tonen decided that its technological dependence on stanvac had gone too far and that independence in research and development activities had to be regained that year the company acquired a acre site and spent ¥ million on establishing a research and development center in  the japanese government passed the petroleum industry law giving the ministry of international trade and industry a large degree of power over the oil industry the government could now control prices for oil products and refinery capacities these moves made it more difficult for foreign interests to establish oil refineries in the country but made it possible for more japanese independent refiners to enter the industry the eventual result was a heavily crowded petroleum industry that same year significant changes were taking place at stanvac general’s partner and tonen’s parent company stanvac was ordered to be dissolved as a result of an antitrust case brought by the us government against the us oil industry the company was split in two and the resulting companies were integrated respectively with mobil oil corporation and esso standard eastern from this point on general maintained a relationship with just one of its former partners standard oil company of new jersey which would become known as exxon tonen’s arrangement with the former stanvac was more complex stanvac’s stake in tonen was split into two stakes with mobil oil and esso each owning  percent of the japanese company both companies supplied crude oil to tonen and distributed its products under their own brand names and through different marketing channels competition between mobil and esso in the japanese market proved to be a spur to tonen’s growth in the second half of the s japan completed its shift from reliance on coal to reliance on oil to fuel its rapidly growing economy oil was cheap and plentiful owing to the discovery in the late s and early s of large reserves in the middle east in  general bussan changed its name to general sekiyu meanwhile tonen continued to expand at the wakayama refinery the first stage of the expansion project in the ogake area was completed in  and the second expansion project in the area was completed in  this made the refinery the newest and the largest in japan the first stage of the expansion project at the kawasaki refinery was completed in  equity participation in kygnus sekiyu kk in  boosted the kawasaki refinery’s economy of scale by  tonen’s total assets reached¥ billion and the company was capitalized at ¥ billion s general sekiyu’s expansion into refining followed by an oil crisis in  general was able for the first time to expand its activities beyond marketing and distribution to include petroleum refining in conjunction with the allied return of the island of okinawa—captured during world war ii—to japanese control general arranged under the tutelage of japan’s ministry of international trade and industry to form a joint venture with its perennial partner esso and with another japanese company sumitomo chemical company the joint venture provided for esso to construct a refinery on okinawa with a capacity of  barrels a day which would be completed in january  under the agreement when the island reverted to japanese control on may   the refinery would become the joint property of esso which took  percent of the shares and general and sumitomo each of which gained  percent ownership in return for providing  million of financing this arrangement was in accordance with japanese law which stipulated that japanese interests hold at least half of any company operating in japan in addition the agreement for the new operation contained restrictions on the amount of oil that would be shipped to japan the joint venture was named nansei sekiyu general’s longawaited entry into the oilrefining business came at a fortuitous point in japan’s industrial development by  more than threequarters of the country’s energy needs were met by oil almost all of that oil was imported from the middle east prices for oil products were kept low through plentiful supply and heavy competition between the large number of oil refiners and distributors in  however japan and its business and government leaders received a rude shock when the arab oil embargo resulted in a sharp rise in oil prices the doubt cast by this event on the security and stability of a national economy based so heavily on a necessarily imported commodity had farreaching effects on the japanese oil industry in december  reacting to large profits reaped by the oil industry from the higher prices of the oil crisis the government stepped in to fix prices for refined oil products this move was prompted in part by public anger over a general sekiyu memo that had come to light and that advocated “grabbing this one chance in a thousand” to make huge profits on the oil crisis general’s public relations suffered further when it was revealed that the company had instructed service station owners to restrict sales of gasoline to selected customers in february  the japanese government formally charged general sekiyu and other oil companies with joining together to form an illegal pricing cartel for the purpose of increasing their profits during the previous year after a tenyear court battle the companies’ convictions and fines were upheld in  by the japanese supreme court and company executives were given suspended prison terms throughout the mids japan’s oil refining industry found itself in choppy waters and neither tonen nor general sekiyu was an exception general sekiyu registered pretax deficits in the first half of  while tonen reduced excess production capacity cut its costs and stopped new employment to adjust to the slower economic growth as the decade unfolded tonen and general sekiyu looked for ways to offset the effects of the oil crisis recognizing that the japanese oil industry had already matured tonen set about developing new fields of business tonen technology kk established in  as a crude oil reserve company diversified into computer sciences in  tonen energy international corporation was established with its headquarters in new york and a branch in london to obtain finance for the crude oil transactions of the company meanwhile general sekiyu focused on partnerships to bolster its sagging earnings in  the company joined with six other japanese companies to form an oilstockpiling venture the new company was to construct a tank storage facility for petroleum products this venture allowed general sekiyu and the other participants to fulfill their governmentimposed obligation to maintain a threemonth petroleum reserve then in september  general announced that exxon its longtime us partner and supplier of crude oil would purchase  percent of general by buying up  million worth of new shares to be issued by the company in addition general took over exxon’s  percent share in the nansei sekiyu refinery on okinawa bringing its ownership to  percent and increasing its oil refining capacity other joint ventures between exxon and general sekiyu—the general gas company an importer of liquefied petroleum gas and the general sekiyu refining company—became wholly owned subsidiaries of general sekiyu under the agreement general sekiyu would gain the same access to raw materials and technological expertise as exxon’s wholly owned subsidiaries while remaining an independently managed japanese company the new mergers allowed general to streamline its operations and eliminate duplication of effort with its subsidiaries the move improved the standing of exxon and its subsidiaries within the japanese oil market giving the group which also included the wholly usowned esso standard sekiyu and toa nenryo kogyo a  percent share exxon’s stock purchase was approved by japan’s governmental foreign investment council and completed by late may  by march  general’s profits had recovered from a slump in the previous year caused by high costs for raw materials and heavy sales of lowpriced products to post extremely high profits a result of higher prices for its products s general sekiyu’s struggles and tonen’s focus on technology the roller coaster ride of the crowded japanese petroleum industry continued into the beginning of the s however in  the price for arabian light oil amounted to  per barrel and the total annual deficit of the japanese oil industry amounted to almost ¥ billion general sekiyu posted a loss in march  its fortunes only worsened as the year progressed as domestic demand for petroleum products declined under japan’s program to diversify its sources of energy away from almost total dependence on oil by  general’s share of the petroleum market had slipped to  percent in the following year the company reduced its refinery capacity by  percent to  percent in keeping with earlier government recommendations in january  general complied with governmental restructuring of the petroleum industry by consolidating some of its marketing activities with esso standard sekiyu the wholly owned subsidiary of exxon the two companies together held slightly more than  percent of the japanese petroleum market in  with general alone holding  percent despite these steps general reported a drastic fall in revenues for the fiscal year ending in march  as net income fell  percent as a result of lower prices for oil products by late  general’s share of the fuel oil market had slipped to  percent and the price of the company’s shares had dropped as well this decline was attributed to a shift in the demand for refined petroleum products away from gasoline which was general’s strength toward heavier products tonen had a more successful decade the company’s efforts in the early s focused on the rationalization of production through the successful development of energysaving technologies the company achieved a savings of almost  kiloliters—¥ billion annually compared with the  level as a result of improvements in its production process and management system tonen’s business situation gradually improved from  through the end of the decade the company’s financial statements showed a profit each year the longterm orientation of management policies resulted in the improvement of tonen’s equity ratio to  percent in  among the highest in the japanese oil industry tonen aimed to develop an intelligent refinery by employing the most advanced information technology and operation backup systems in terms of new product development tonen chose to focus on new energy sources new materials life sciences and information technology tonen’s major development in the field of new energy was an efficient lowcost amorphous silicon for electricity and a clean combustion system—supersonic fuel injection—used in the f racing car in the field of new materials tonen developed and patented a highquality pitchbased carbon fiber with a host of applications in airplane bodies automobile frames and mechanical parts in the field of life sciences tonen established a reputation as a pioneer in genetic engineering and cell technology including a leukemia vaccine which enabled a doubledigit increase in the general potency of a wide variety of vaccines in the field of information technology tonen benefited from years of experience in computerized operational control and plant maintenance systems for this purpose tonen system plaza inc was established in  s deregulation and consolidation the s have been a more troubled time for tonen in addition to a february  fire at the kawasaki refinery that cut into the company’s  earnings its safety record was further tarnished by a may  gas leak at the same refinery most important however behindthescenes clashes between tonen’s management and its exxon and mobil major shareholders came to light in the early s which raised doubts about tonen’s future according to an article in tokyo business today the roots of the conflict were found in tonen’s diversification efforts and conservative management philosophy tonen had entered a period of slow growth in the s because of the mature nature of the refinery business under president nobuyuki nakahara the company began to build up larger cash reserves to save for future investments in new growth areas but nakahara began to be stymied in his efforts to diversify by exxon and mobil as these shareholders pressured him for higher dividend payouts which in turn started to draw down tonen’s cash reserves according to some analysts the oil giants in addition to wanting a higher return on their investment wished to keep tonen from diversifying into areas where it would compete with them from  to the mids tonen had in fact invested little in its existing facilities or in developing new ones with its late  decision to add an oil hydroconversion unit to its kawasaki refinery—the first such unit in japan—being one of the exceptions meanwhile tonen’s dividend payout ratio historically in the  to  percent range exceeded  percent from  to  then surpassed  percent starting in  nakahara reportedly fought over the increased dividends but to no avail and was eventually pressured to resign early in  nakahara’s successor—tamehiko tamahori who had been president of tonen tanker kk—developed a new corporate strategy to become a “worldclass refiner” therein he outlined four challenges for the company attaining global costcompetitiveness through reengineering employing worldclass technology such as the oil unit offering “full cooperation” with exxon and mobil and pursuing growth opportunities after “carefully evaluating the business risks” it appeared then to some analysts that tamahori intended to be even more cautious about diversification and would work more closely with exxon and mobil than his predecessor japan began to deregulate the oil industry in the mids which posed additional dilemmas for both tonen and general sekiyu with increased competition and the resulting depression of prices both companies found that they needed to cut costs to remain viable by early  tonen general sekiyu and another exxon affiliate esso sekiyu kk began exploring ways to merge their downstream operations general sekiyu and esso sekiyu were not unaccustomed to working together in  they had joined together to streamline their delivery operations despite the hurdles associated with deregulation the japanese energy market remained appealing to exxon corporation in august  exxon increased its holding in general sekiyu to a majority stake of  percent with exxon firmly at the helm of both general sekiyu and esso sekyiu the streamlining of operations began in earnest the next two years saw general sekiyu’s and esso sekiyu’s activities become increasingly entwined customer service functions were merged in  and in  the two companies joined their finance administration marketing and distribution operations despite its efforts to trim costs general sekiyu’s finances took a turn for the worse the company posted a loss of almost ¥ billion in —and a loss of ¥ billion in  in december  us energy giants exxon corp and mobil corp announced that they planned to merge with exxon buying out mobil when the merger was complete on november   the newly formed exxonmobil had four japanese affiliates esso sekiyu and mobil sekiyu both of which were wholly owned and tonen and general sekiyu in each of which exxonmobil held approximately  percent this change was perhaps more significant for tonen than for general while general had been majority owned by exxon prior to the merger neither exxon nor mobil had held a majority share in tonen it was only by pooling their holdings—each of  percent—that the two companies gained control of tonen exxonmobil wasted little time in implementing costcutting measures in its japanese operations with an aim of reducing redundancies—something exxon had initiated some years earlier with general sekiyu and esso sekiyu—the company announced in january  that its subsidiaries would enter into a threeyear shared services agreement in the areas of distribution supply refining and logistics at the same time exxonmobil announced the formation of a new japanese company—exxonmobil business service yugen kaisha—which would handle accounting financing procurement public relations and information systems for all four of exxonmobil’s japanese subsidiaries the restructuring of services allowed general sekiyu and tonen to reduce their combined workforce eliminating some ¥ billion in payroll costs more drastic reorganization was in the offing however for general sekiyu and tonen in late february  the two companies announced their plans for a fullfledged merger to take place in july the companies’ joint press release of february   explained the move “the decision has been made to merge gs k and tonen in order to further increase the operational and administrative efficiencies of the two companies increase overall competitiveness and fully realize their potential profitability for all shareholders” under the terms of the merger which was completed as scheduled tonen was absorbed into general sekiyu and the company was renamed tonengeneral sekiyu kk general sekiyu’s president masayoshi okai became chairman of the board for the newly merged entity and tonen’s president tamehiko tamahori assumed the office of president the new company with its pooled refining capacity was japan’s largest refiner tamahori’s reign as president of tonengeneral sekiyu was not longlived in march  he retired and was replaced by gary pruessing a wisconsin native and a year veteran of exxon prior to heading up tonengeneral pruessing had served as a vicepresident of exxonmobil refining and supply company looking forward by early  it was yet unclear what the longterm effects of the merger between general seikiyu and tonen would be the company was still in the process of consolidating its operations and looking for ever better ways to reduce operating expenses although many efficiencies had already been realized they had been offset in large part by costs associated with restructuring but according to tonengeneral president gary pruessing the eventual cost savings from the merger were likely to be even better than originally expected in an august  letter to shareholders he wrote that although annual cost reductions had been projected initially at ¥ billion starting in  the revised estimate was closer to ¥ billion principal subsidiaries nansei sekiyu kk  tonengeneral kaiun yk  tonen technology kk tonen sogo service company ltd chuo sekiyu hanbai kk tonen chemical corporation kygnus
