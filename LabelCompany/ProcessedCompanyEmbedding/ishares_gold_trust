loss of principal because shares of the trust are intended to reflect the price of the gold held by the trust the market price of the shares is subject to fluctuations similar to those affecting gold prices additionally shares of the trust are bought and sold at market price not at net asset value nav brokerage commissions will reduce returns shares of the trust are intended to reflect at any given time the market price of gold owned by the trust at that time less the trusts expenses and liabilities the price received upon the sale of the shares which trade at market price may be more or less than the value of the gold represented by such shares if an investor sells the shares at a time when no active market for them exists such lack of an active market will most likely adversely affect the price received for the shares for a more complete discussion of the risk factors relative to the trust carefully read the prospectus following an investment in shares of the trust several factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of gold and a corresponding decline in the price of the shares among them i large sales by the official sector a significant portion of the aggregate world gold holdings is owned by governments central banks and related institutions if one or more of these institutions decides to sell in amounts large enough to cause a decline in world gold prices the price of the shares will be adversely affected ii a significant increase in gold hedging activity by gold producers should there be an increase in the level of hedge activity of gold producing companies it could cause a decline in world gold prices adversely affecting the price of the shares iii a significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards gold should the speculative community take a negative view towards gold it could cause a decline in world gold prices negatively impacting the price of the shares gold spot prices provided by the bullion desk no warranty is given for the accuracy of these prices and no liability is accepted for reliance thereon prices are provided on a reasonable efforts basis and delays may occur both because of the delay in third parties communicating the information to the site and because of delays inherent in posting information over the internet prices shown are indicative only and do not represent actionable quotations on prices of actual trades the amount of gold represented by shares of the trust will decrease over the life of the trust due to sales of gold necessary to pay the sponsors fee and trust expenses without increases in the price of gold sufficient to compensate for that decrease the price of the shares will also decline and investors will lose money on their investment the trust will have limited duration the liquidation of the trust may occur at a time when the disposition of the trusts gold will result in losses to investors although market makers will generally take advantage of differences between the nav and the trading price of trust shares through arbitrage opportunities there is no guarantee that they will do so there is no guarantee an active trading market will develop for the shares which may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your shares the value of the shares of the trust will be adversely affected if gold owned by the trust is lost or damaged in circumstances in which the trust is not in a position to recover the corresponding loss the trust is a passive investment vehicle this means that the value of your shares may be adversely affected by trust losses that if the trust had been actively managed might have been avoidable shares of the trust are not deposits or other obligations of or guaranteed by blackrock

this information must be preceded or accompanied by a current prospectus investors should read it carefully before investing ishares gold trust the trust has filed a registration statement including a prospectus with the sec for the offering to which this communication relates before you invest you should read the prospectus and other documents the trust has filed with the sec for more complete information about the issuer and this offering you may get these documents for free by visiting wwwisharescom or edgar on the sec website at wwwsecgov alternatively the trust will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling tollfree  investing involves risk including possible loss of principal because shares of the trust are intended to reflect the price of the gold held by the trust the market price of the shares is subject to fluctuations similar to those affecting gold prices additionally shares of the trust are bought and sold at market price not at net asset value nav brokerage commissions will reduce returns shares of the trust are intended to reflect at any given time the market price of gold owned by the trust at that time less the trusts expenses and liabilities the price received upon the sale of the shares which trade at market price may be more or less than the value of the gold represented by such shares if an investor sells the shares at a time when no active market for them exists such lack of an active market will most likely adversely affect the price received for the shares for a more complete discussion of the risk factors relative to the trust carefully read the prospectus following an investment in shares of the trust several factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of gold and a corresponding decline in the price of the shares among them i large sales by the official sector a significant portion of the aggregate world gold holdings is owned by governments central banks and related institutions if one or more of these institutions decides to sell in amounts large enough to cause a decline in world gold prices the price of the shares will be adversely affected ii a significant increase in gold hedging activity by gold producers should there be an increase in the level of hedge activity of gold producing companies it could cause a decline in world gold prices adversely affecting the price of the shares iii a significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards gold should the speculative community take a negative view towards gold it could cause a decline in world gold prices negatively impacting the price of the shares gold spot prices provided by the bullion desk no warranty is given for the accuracy of these prices and no liability is accepted for reliance thereon prices are provided on a reasonable efforts basis and delays may occur both because of the delay in third parties communicating the information to the site and because of delays inherent in posting information over the internet prices shown are indicative only and do not represent actionable quotations on prices of actual trades the amount of gold represented by shares of the trust will decrease over the life of the trust due to sales of gold necessary to pay the sponsors fee and trust expenses without increases in the price of gold sufficient to compensate for that decrease the price of the shares will also decline and investors will lose money on their investment the trust will have limited duration the liquidation of the trust may occur at a time when the disposition of the trusts gold will result in losses to investors although market makers will generally take advantage of differences between the nav and the trading price of trust shares through arbitrage opportunities there is no guarantee that they will do so there is no guarantee an active trading market will develop for the shares which may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your shares the value of the shares of the trust will be adversely affected if gold owned by the trust is lost or damaged in circumstances in which the trust is not in a position to recover the corresponding loss the trust is a passive investment vehicle this means that the value of your shares may be adversely affected by trust losses that if the trust had been actively managed might have been avoidable shares of the trust are not deposits or other obligations of or guaranteed by blackrock inc and its affiliates and are not insured by the federal deposit insurance

at that time less the trusts expenses and liabilities the price received upon the sale of the shares which trade at market price may be more or less than the value of the gold represented by such

complete discussion of the risk factors relative to the trust carefully read the prospectus following an investment in shares of the trust several factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of gold and a corresponding decline in the price of the shares among them i large sales by the official sector a significant portion of the aggregate world gold holdings is owned by governments central banks and related institutions if one or more of these institutions decides to sell in amounts large enough to cause a decline in world gold prices the price of the shares will be adversely affected ii a significant increase in gold hedging activity by gold producers should there be an increase in the level of hedge activity of gold producing companies it could cause a decline in world gold prices adversely affecting the price of the shares iii a significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards gold should the speculative community take a negative view towards gold it could cause a decline in world gold prices negatively impacting the price of the shares gold spot prices provided by the bullion desk no warranty is given for the accuracy of

information to the site and because of delays inherent in posting information over the internet prices shown are indicative only and do not represent actionable quotations on prices of actual trades the amount of gold represented by shares of the trust will decrease over the life of the trust due to sales of gold necessary to pay the sponsors fee and trust expenses without increases in the price of gold sufficient to compensate for that decrease the price of the shares will also decline and investors will lose money on their investment the trust will have limited duration the liquidation of the trust may occur at a time when the disposition of the trusts gold will result in losses to investors although market makers will generally take advantage of differences between the nav and the trading price of trust shares through arbitrage opportunities there is no guarantee that they will do so there is no guarantee an active trading market will develop for the shares which may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your shares the value of the shares of the trust will be adversely affected if gold owned by the trust is lost or damaged in circumstances in which the trust is not in a position to recover the corresponding loss the trust is a passive investment vehicle this means that the value of your shares may be adversely affected by trust losses that
