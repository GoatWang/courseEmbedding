inc wwweastsidespeedshopcom he is a member of sema pwa and pmi you can reach lou by visiting wwwloulobsingercom email loulobsingerloulobsingercom or call him directly at   several years ago i brought my then year old son to the annual lane automotivemotor state car show this show and cruise has been held every memorial day weekend for the last  yearsmy son owen spotted a brightblue  mustang fastback from a mile away and it was easy to see why with all the bright red and orange hot wheels logos on the car it looked exactly like the matchboxhot wheels cars he spent his days racing parking crashing and collectingi asked around looking for the owner simply to ask the usual questions when a tall man with a big smile came up and said “does the little fella want to go for ride”“no thanks” i said “i can’t imagine we can fit a car seat in there” we both laughed as the tall man put down the armful of binders he was carrying “well c’mon little guy let’s check out the car anyway”the two of them spent at least  minutes checking out the race seats the cage the engine and the killer paint job before my son spotted the cotton candy vendor at least a mile away even today my son can vividly recall the cool hot wheels car and “the nice man that let him look inside”that tall man was scott wahlstrom marketing manager for motor state and he dropped everything he was doing on the first day of the show including the long line of sales reps following him around like hungry dogs just to show my son this cool car and as i’ve come to learn over the years in dealing with motor state his actions typify those of every motor state employeeor as one performance retailer put it the other day “there’s a reason they’ve won sema’s wd of the year award something like four times”lj scott thanks for taking some time out of your busy and i do mean busy schedule to catch up with me for the magazine tell me what have you been up to these days or better yet what’s a typical day like for youscott laughing yeah these last few days have been meeting after meeting after meeting but so many different parts of our business fall under the marketing umbrella that i tend to be involved with numerous projects within the companyi don’t think there is such a thing as a “typical day”…laugh but most days include work on catalogs flyers websites ad campaigns vendor and customer calls and getting things in order for the upcoming trade showslj that’s your role at motor state marketing manager right scott yes effectively i manage the look and the message of motor statelj so i mentioned the story of my son and you checking out your mustang and again thank you—that meant the world to him you dropped everything just to show him the car scott you bet but any one of us would’ve done the same thinglj yeah that seems to be the mantra around there and i’d have to agree it’s almost a corporate policy scott exactly look at it this way—lots of people can do what we do so our goal is to do it better there’s nothing more important to the lane family than taking care of our customers and vendors we aim to treat everyone with respectlj tell me about the mustang scott well just about everyone around here is a handson car guy racer enthusiast etc in fact a very high percentage of our employees are involved in racing street performance offroading—you name it we live sleep eat and breathe performance thus we’re all very knowledgeable about what we sell you know the saying “behind the wheel on the weekends and behind the phone on the weekdays”the best way to know what is going on within the various markets is to be involved so that’s exactly what we do i wanted to build a car that made a statement and also showcased the products we selllj ah and so the mustang comes trickortreating scott yes the mustang concept came about years ago when hot wheels were hot and we had done several of the lane collectables limited edition versions for companies like edelbrock and so oni proposed building a real car to match a collector car and wanted to run it on the hot rod power tour we were up against a pretty tight timeline to get the car completed and unfortunately it snowballed into a major projectthe build process took several detours which every car builder knows can spell disaster and what was going to take  months ended up taking me eight years to complete although i missed my initial power tour run back in the late ’s i have since run it on a couple legs and have had a real blast with it looking back i’m not sure a car that gets about milespergallon would have been a smart choice anywaylj it’s such a great looking car scott thanks i had a lot of help from my friends to get the car where it is today brent robbins built the chassis and al wyant and chris burgo helped me with all the assembly and interiorbrian “allornothin’” robbins a long time motor state employee and ken messing of messing cylinder heads are responsible for the killer  ford bigblock ken built the long block and brian handled the supercharger and fuel systemthe car has a  supercharger with twin  carbs it’s underdriven for the street but it’s still crazy fast we were building the car to have that vintage funny car look and i think it workedlj switching gears what are you seeing out there in your customer base—any signs of recovery any steps you’re taking at motor state scott well of

segue so scott say you’re one of these performance retailers what would you do differently to grow your business to in fact thrive scott the big battle is still the internet i think retailers must use

defendantsappellees before pratt and mahoney circuit judges and zampano district judge mahoney circuit judge  donald and irene wahlstrom the wahlstroms appeal from a judgment entered august   in the united states district court for the district of connecticut alan h nevas judge that granted defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed the wahlstroms state law claims for the wrongful death of their son on the basis that a case involving a collision between two pleasure craft on navigable waters falls within the courts admiralty jurisdiction and under general maritime law recovery of wrongful death damages is barred where plaintiffs are not dependents of the decedent we conclude that the state law claims were properly dismissed because actions brought under the federal courts admiralty jurisdiction are governed solely by federal maritime law we also conclude however that the wahlstroms have stated at least to some extent a valid claim for wrongful death damages under federal maritime law as to which there are disputed issues of material fact accordingly the judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion background  the facts in this case are straightforward and undisputed on june   scott wahlstrom scott the year old son of the wahlstroms was killed when the rented kawasaki  sx jet ski that he was operating collided with a twentyfoot power boat on the thames river a navigable waterway within connecticut territorial waters the wahlstroms as the administrators of scotts estate brought an action under the connecticut product liability act conngenstat sec m et seq  and the connecticut unfair trade practices act conngenstat sec a et seq  against kawasaki heavy industries ltd kawasaki motors corp usa and kawasaki motors manufacturing corp usa collectively kawasaki the companies that designed manufactured and distributed the rented jet ski that scott was using at the time of his accident basing federal jurisdiction upon diversity of citizenship the wahlstroms sought compensatory damages attorney fees pursuant to conngenstat sec a  and punitive damages pursuant to conngenstat secs b  and ga   kawasaki moved for summary judgment on the basis that the action was governed solely by federal maritime law which barred the wahlstroms from any recovery opposing the motion the wahlstroms argued that the case was governed by connecticut law but even if federal maritime law applied scotts estate was entitled to recover damages judge nevas referred the case to magistrate judge arthur h latimer to rule on that motion  in a recommended ruling issued april   magistrate judge latimer determined that kawasakis motion should be granted see wahlstrom v kawasaki heavy indus ltd  fsupp  dconn he concluded that the case was governed by federal maritime law id at  and that the general maritime law does not allow the nondependents of a decedent who is not a seaman to recover wrongful death damages for his death arising in state territorial waters id at  citing anderson v whittaker corp  fsupp   wdmich affd in part revd in part on another ground  fd  th cir truehart v blandon  fsupp   edla reviewing the applicable supreme court precedents magistrate judge latimer stated  a collective reading of these cases reveals three points  the supreme court has never held that a nondependent beneficiary may recover loss of society ie nonpecuniary damages in a general maritime wrongful death action  the explicit language of the dohsa does not permit the recovery of nonpecuniary damages nor may such recovery be supplemented by state wrongful death statutes or the general maritime law where the dohsa governs and  the jones act does not provide wrongful death damages to the nondependent survivors of a deceased seaman  id at   stressing the need for uniformity in admiralty law the anomaly of allowing a recovery to the wahlstroms that would not be available to them if scott had been a member of the specially favored class of seamen and the overall fairness of a distinction between dependents and nondependents the magistrate judge concluded that the wahlstroms claims including their application for punitive damages should be dismissed id at   the wahlstroms objected to this recommended ruling contending that admiralty jurisdiction is inappropriate in this products liability case and in any event that the magistrate judge had erred in his analysis of federal maritime law after review and over the wahlstroms objections however the district court approved and adopted the magistrate judges recommended ruling id at   judgment was then entered in favor of kawasaki this appeal followed discussion  it is settled law that a tort claim involving a collision between two vessels used for pleasure or commercial purposes on navigable waters comes within the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts see foremost ins co v richardson  us    sct    ledd   in re guglielmo  fd   d cir the parties to this appeal do not dispute that both the jet ski operated by scott and the power boat involved in the collision are vessels under  usc sec   or that the thames river at the location where the fatal collision occurred is a navigable waterway further the wahlstroms concede on appeal that this case falls within the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts with this jurisdiction comes the application of substantive maritime law and absent a relevant federal statute we apply the general maritime law as developed by the courts east river ss corp v transamerica delaval inc  us    sct    ledd   that law includes elements adopted from the law of products liability see id at   sct at   the wahlstroms advance two contentions on appeal  federal maritime law does not preclude the application of state wrongful death statutes and therefore the connecticut products liability act and its wrongful death provisions should govern this action or  in the alternative if this court finds that federal maritime law governs the principles underlying the connecticut wrongful death provisions should be used to fashion the federal maritime remedy before considering these contentions we address a preliminary matter  the wahlstroms did not request relief under federal maritime law in their complaint rather they raised only state law claims nor did they seek leave to file an amended complaint to include a claim for wrongful death damages under federal maritime law kawasaki however raised the applicability of federal maritime law as an affirmative defense and this issue was extensively discussed by magistrate judge latimer in his recommended ruling further the parties briefs and oral argument on appeal focused squarely on the issue of what relief if any is available to the wahlstroms under federal maritime law accordingly we deem the wahlstroms complaint to be constructively amended to include a claim for relief for wrongful death damages under federal maritime law see a charles a wright et al federal practice and procedure sec  at  d ed  appellate courts using fedrcivp b by way of analogy permit constructive amendment of pleadings only when the effect will be to acknowledge that certain issues upon which the lower courts decision has been based or issues consistent with the trial courts judgment have been litigated see also purofied down prods corp v travelers fire ins co  fd   d cir where insurer did not assert counterclaim for back premiums and issue was not raised by pleadings but attorney for insured admitted premiums were due appellate court deemed pleadings amended to conform to the evidence menefee v wr chamberlin co  fd   th cir where injured seaman alleged only leg injury but evidence of back injury was also presented without objection the back injury was regarded on appeal as matter that had been tried by lower court cf walton v jennings community hosp inc  fd   n  th cir collecting cases in which district and appellate courts allowed constructive amendment of complaints  a application of state law in a maritime wrongful death action  magistrate judge latimer dismissed the wahlstroms state law claims because those claims  would be in conflict with the applicable substantive admiralty law  wahlstrom  fsupp at  quoting icelandic coast guard v united technologies corp  fsupp   dconn according to magistrate judge latimer because connecticut tort law would permit recovery of damages by nondependent beneficiaries and maritime law would not the supremacy clause mandates preemption of state law in this case id we go further and hold that federal maritime law whether or not it conflicts with state law applies to actions for wrongful death in state territorial waters brought under the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts we premise this holding upon supreme court precedent which over the past thirtythree years has transformed the face of the federal maritime wrongful death remedy  in the harrisburg  us    sct    led   the supreme court after reviewing maritime law as accepted and received by maritime nations generally held that there was no right to recover for wrongful death under the general maritime law in the absence of a statute giving the right the court expressed no opinion whether a suit could be maintained under a state wrongful death statute because the suit at issue would have been barred in any event by the applicable state statutes of limitations id at   sct at  in western fuel co v garcia  us    sct    led   however the court did reach the issue and held that state wrongful death statutes could provide a remedy for a wrongful death in state territorial waters  in  congress changed the complexion of the recovery available for wrongful death under maritime law by passing two statutes which specifically afforded federal remedies for wrongful death to certain classes of plaintiffs in maritime actions one statute the death on the high seas act dohsa  uscapp secs   gave the representative of anyone killed on the high seas ie more than three miles from shore the right to bring a wrongful death action dohsa explicitly does not apply to any waters within the territorial limits of any state id sec  the second statute the jones act  uscapp sec   gave the personal representative of a seaman who died in the course of employment the right to maintain a wrongful death action for negligence there was still however no right of recovery under the general maritime law for deaths in state territorial waters of nonseamen or seamen who died as a result of a vessels unseaworthiness rather than negligence thus after the enactment of dohsa and the jones act some actions for wrongful death in territorial waters could still be brought under state wrongful death statutes see eg the vessel mv tungus v skovgaard  us    sct    ledd   right of recovery for wrongful death in state territorial waters and limitations on that right were those established by state law  all of this changed with the supreme courts decision in moragne v states marine lines inc  us   sct   ledd   in moragne the court overruled the harrisburg and held that an action does lie under general maritime law for death caused by violation of maritime duties id at  the court was addressing the specific issue of what if any remedy should be available for a wrongful death caused within state territorial waters by a vessels unseaworthiness a claim for which there was no right of recovery under applicable state law id at  in fashioning the remedy however the supreme court did not limit the new right of recovery to unseaworthiness claims but instead established a general remedy for wrongful death under maritime law in doing so the court stated  our recognition of a right to recover for wrongful death under general maritime law will assure uniform vindication of federal policies removing the tensions and discrepancies that have resulted from the necessity to accommodate state remedial statutes to exclusively maritime substantive concepts eg hess v united states  us   sct   ledd   goett v union carbide corp  us   sct   ledd   such uniformity not only will further the concerns of dohsa and the jones act but also will give effect to the constitutionally based principle that federal admiralty law should be a system of law coextensive with and operating uniformly in the whole country the lottawanna  us   wall    led    id at  footnote omitted in our view the supreme courts creation in moragne of a federal wrongful death action under general maritime law precludes the use of state wrongful death statutes in maritime claims without such preclusive effect the tensions and discrepancies resulting from application of state remedial statutes could not be removed  this view is fortified by rulings of the supreme court and other federal courts in mobil oil corp v higginbotham  us   sct   ledd   the supreme court recognized that under moragne one national rule applies to fatalities in territorial waters according to the court the moragne rule of uniformity was needed because at the time the case was decided fatal accidents on the high seas had an adequate federal remedy while the same accidents nearer shore might yield more generous awards or none at all depending on the law of the nearest state id at  n  other courts have concluded that after moragne federal maritime law  displaces state wrongful death statutes in territorial waters  neal v barisich inc  fsupp    n  edla quoting thurmond v delta well surveyors  fd   n  th cir garwood j concurring collecting cases affd mem  fd  th cir see also nelson v united states  fd   th cir holding that the need for uniformity in maritime wrongful death actions requires extension of moragne to cover claims based on negligence to the exclusion of state wrongful death statutes in re ss helena sincere navigation corp v united states  fd   th cir moragne wrongful death remedy precludes recognition in admiralty of state statutes shield v bayliner marine corp  fsupp   dconn the fact that plaintiff relies partly on diversity jurisdiction does not affect the rule that maritime law applies thus to the extent plaintiff seeks to recover under connecticut state law his claim must be dismissed citing wahlstrom  fsupp at  gilmore v witschorek  fsupp   edill same cf icelandic coast guard  fsupp at  even if plaintiffs commercial losses would be cognizable under the applicable state tort law products liability scheme of either iceland or connecticut claims for such losses nonetheless are not permitted where they would be in conflict with the applicable substantive admiralty law footnote omitted in re dfds seaways bahamas ltd  fsupp   sdny it is well settled that federal maritime law is to be applied to the exclusion of conflicting state law even in state courts complaint of cambria ss co rischmiller v dahl  fd   th cir although death occurred in state territorial waters court declined to apply state law because postmoragne appellate decisions have endeavored generally to develop a uniform body of federal law neither borrowing automatically from federal statutory provisions nor applying any particular state law cert denied  us   sct   ledd   accordingly we conclude that federal maritime law rather than connecticut law must be applied in the present case  b wrongful death action under federal maritime law  moragne established a wrongful death action under the general maritime law the court refrained in moragne however from addressing any subsidiary issues relating to the new cause of action such as the measure of damages and the schedule of beneficiaries preferring that the final resolution of such questions await further sifting through the lower courts in future litigation  us at   sct at  these issues are presented for consideration in this case   right of a nondependent parent to recover for the wrongful death of a child  magistrate judge latimer held that the wahlstroms were barred from any recovery because the general maritime law does not allow the nondependents of a decedent who is not a seaman to recover wrongful death damages for his death arising in state territorial waters  fsupp at  citing anderson  fsupp at  truehart  fsupp at  this conclusion is overbroad and is not supported by the cases invoked in its behalf anderson awarded damages for loss of support and services and loss of society only to the dependent survivors widows and children of two persons killed in a boating accident and specifically disallowed such damages for the nondependent parents of the other two persons who were fatally injured in that accident  fsupp at  survival damages for the decedents pain and suffering prior to death were awarded however to all of the plaintiffs both dependents and nondependents id at  thus anderson limits the damages that may be awarded but does not support the proposition that no damages may be awarded to a nondependent parent  similarly truehart dismissed the claim for loss of society of the nondependent survivors two parents and two siblings of a person killed in a boating accident but did not dismiss the complaint  fsupp at   indeed emphasizing the fact that the litigation was to continue as to the plaintiffs other claims the district court certified the loss of society ruling for immediate appellate review pursuant to  usc sec b   fsupp at  see also id at  n  even if not entitled to lossofsociety damages nondependent survivors may still maintain wrongful death actions for pecuniary damages such as funeral expenses and perhaps loss of services moreover the plaintiffs subsequently achieved a  settlement of their remaining claims see truehart v blandon  fsupp   edla revd on other grounds  fd  th cir see also cantore v blue lagoon water sports inc  fsupp   sdfla parents of decedent killed in fatal jet ski accident may recover medical and funeral expenses but for loss of society only if actual financial dependency on decedent is proven and for loss of services only if actual pecuniary damages proven for loss of valuable services estate may recover for decedents pain and suffering before death but not for future economic loss  it is therefore inappropriate to rule that the wahlstroms may achieve no recovery for their sons wrongful death the supreme court counselled in higginbotham that as moragne itself implied dohsa should be the courts primary guide as they refine the nonstatutory death remedy both because of the interest in uniformity and because congress considered judgment has great force in its own right  us at   sct at  footnote omitted the pertinent provision of dohsa  uscapp sec  authorizes the personal representative of a decedent to sue for the exclusive benefit of the decedents wife husband parent child or dependent relative see supra note  thus indicating that a parent need not be a dependent of the decedent to have standing to recover some damages see first natl bank v national airlines  fd   d cir dohsa requires a showing of dependency on the part of all claimants except a wife husband parent or child of the decedent cert denied  us   sct   ledd   the companion provision  uscapp sec  however limits a dohsa recovery to a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained by the persons for whose benefit the suit is brought see supra note  indicating that the focus of our analysis should be upon the elements of damage recoverable by nondependent parents such as the wahlstroms we proceed to that inquiry   the elements of damages recoverable by a nondependent parent for the wrongful death of a child  the predominant issue on this appeal is the availability of damages for loss of society to the nondependent parents of a decedent who perishes under circumstances giving rise to admiralty jurisdiction we shall accordingly address our initial attention to this aspect of the wahlstroms claim and then consider other elements of damages at least arguably encompassed by the wahlstroms demand for compensatory and punitive damages in their complaint we begin this inquiry by reviewing the postmoragne decisions of the supreme court in this area  in its first subsequent visitation of the admiralty wrongful death action established in moragne the supreme court ruled in sealand services inc v gaudet  us   sct   ledd   that in the case of a longshoreman who died as a result of severe injuries incurred on a vessel in louisiana navigable waters the decedents dependents may recover damages for their loss of support services and society as well as funeral expenses id at  see also id at  in addition to recovery for loss of support services and society damages for funeral expenses may be awarded under the maritime wrongfuldeath remedy in circumstances where the decedents dependents have either paid for the funeral or are liable for its payment  the court next ruled in higginbotham that the gaudet allowance of lossofsociety damages to a dependent of a decedent who perished in territorial waters could not be extended to the high seas in view of the dohsa limitation of damages to pecuniary loss see  us at   sct at  and reiterated this ruling in offshore logistics inc v tallentire  us     sct   ledd   both higginbotham and tallentire like gaudet and moragne were suits by dependent widows of the decedents  miles v apex marine corp  us   sct   ledd   addressed however the situation of a nondependent mother who sought lossofsociety damages for the death in territorial waters of her seaman son the fifth circuit had held that in a general maritime wrongful death action nondependent parents may not recover for loss of society whether or not their deceased children were survived by spouse or child miles v melrose  fd   th cir affd sub nom miles v apex marine corp  us   sct   ledd   the supreme court affirmed on the differing ground that there is no recovery for loss of society in a general maritime action for the wrongful death of a jones act seaman  us at   sct at  thus restoring a uniform rule applicable to all actions for the wrongful death of a seaman whether under dohsa the jones act or general maritime law id the court also stated that the holding of gaudet applies only in territorial waters and it applies only to longshoremen id at   sct at   as magistrate judge latimer noted none of these cases support the recovery of lossofsociety damages by a nondependent beneficiary in a general maritime wrongful death action and both dohsa and the jones act have been construed by the court to bar such damages where those statutes apply see  fsupp at  this does not settle the question presented by this appeal however because neither dohsa nor the jones act is applicable and no supreme court ruling bars the award of lossofsociety damage to the wahlstroms  on the other hand a number of other federal courts have explicitly addressed the issue whether nondependent parents may recover lossofsociety damages for a death in territorial waters and have almost unanimously responded in the negative both the fifth circuit see miles  fd at  and sixth circuit see anderson  fd at  have so ruled and most of the pertinent district court decisions concur see cantore  fsupp at  kline v maritrans cp inc  fsupp   ddel jones act seaman rollins v peterson builders inc  fsupp   dri on reconsideration reversing prior ruling in light of miles v apex marine corp anderson  fsupp at  dfds seaways  fsupp at  no recovery for nondependent parent of decedent survived by a spouse glod v american president lines  fsupp   ndcal nondependent siblings but see thompson v offshore co  fsupp   sdtex palmer v ribax inc  fsupp   mdfla hamilton v canal barge co  fsupp   edla thompson and hamilton can no longer be regarded as authoritative in light of the subsequent evolution of fifth circuit law see miles  fd at  no recovery by nondependent parents in general maritime wrongful death action sistrunk v circle bar drilling co  fd   n  th cir hamilton undermined by supreme court ruling in higginbotham cert denied  us   sct   ledd    we agree with the overwhelming majority of the pertinent federal decisions that nondependent parents cannot recover damages for loss of society in a general maritime action we recognize the argument that an essentially pecuniary standard such as dependency should not provide the dividing line on this issue given the nature of lossofsociety damages see gaudet  us at   sct at  the term society embraces a broad range of mutual benefits each family member receives from the others continued existence including love affection care attention companionship comfort and protection thompson  fsupp at  because a loss of society is not a financial loss it would be inappropriate to conclusively presume that only those family members financially dependent on the decedent have suffered such a loss countervailing concerns nonetheless outweigh the force of this contention  the primary considerations that we must consult in resolving this issue are the humane policies implicit in the judicially created cause of action for maritime wrongful death and  the interest in the uniform administration of admiralty actions public admr v angela compania naviera sa  fd   d cir cert dismissed  us   sct   ledd   it would hardly promote the uniform administration of admiralty actions for this circuit to adopt a rule in conflict with almost every decided federal case on this issue in addition in view of the special regard accorded by admiralty to seamen it would be anomalous to expand the class of beneficiaries of nonseamen who may recover for loss of society in the aftermath of the supreme courts denial of any such recovery to the beneficiaries of seamen see miles  us at   sct at  denying any recovery for loss of society to beneficiaries of seamen see also wahlstrom  fsupp at  citing miles  us at   sct at  regarding special solicitude shown by admiralty for seamen and their families truehart  fsupp at  general maritime law is its most generous to seamen the wards of admiralty  finally a ruling in favor of the wahlstroms on this issue would effectively extend the rule of gaudet to nondependent parents of persons who die in territorial waters this would hardly be consonant with the courts unanimous statement in miles that the holding of gaudet applies only in territorial waters and only to longshoremen  us at   sct at  see miller v american president lines  fd   th cir miles limited gaudet to its facts but gaudet is not applicable to those facts in view of subsequent enactment of longshore and harbor workers compensation act gaudet thus condemned to a kind of legal limbo limited to its facts inapplicable on its facts yet not overruled murray v anthony j bertucci constr co  fd   th cir miles limited gaudet to its facts cert denied  us   sct   ledd   even if the limitation of gaudet in miles is read more favorably to gaudet as focused upon the distinction between longshoremen and seamen we perceive no basis for an extension of gaudet to allow recovery by nondependent parents under the general maritime law cf walker v braus  fd   th cir allowing widow of nonseaman deceased victim of accident in louisiana territorial waters to recover for loss of consortium would directly contradict the policy of uniformity emphasized and relied on by the court in miles  for all these reasons we conclude that the wahlstroms may not recover damages for loss of society in this case and proceed to address the other elements of damages that will require consideration upon remand  the wahlstroms may recover damages for funeral expenses to the extent that they paid for their sons funeral or are liable for that payment see gaudet  us at   nn   sct at   nn  cantore  fsupp at  neal  fsupp at   nn  truehart  fsupp at  they also may recover for related medical expenses cantore  fsupp at  damages for mental anguish may not be recovered see gaudet  us at  n   sct at  n  thompson  fsupp at  loss of support or services is compensable but only to the extent that the wahlstroms anticipated future pecuniary benefits from support or services to be rendered to them by their deceased son see gaudet  us at   sct at  in re p  e boat rentals inc fusselman v ennia gen ins co  fd   th cir cantore  fsupp at  kline  fsupp at  dfds seaways  fsupp at   c survival action under federal maritime law  magistrate judge latimer stated that the wahlstroms had apparently abandoned at oral argument any conceivable claim for survival as opposed to wrongful death damages  fsupp at  on appeal to the district court and to this court the wahlstroms argued primarily for wrongful death damages pursuant to connecticut law but cited a survival case evich v morris  fd  th cir cert denied  us   sct   ledd   in both fora and contended generally for wrongful death and survivorship benefits in their main brief to this court we deem the issue of survivor damages preserved  the distinction between survival and wrongful death actions was articulated by the fifth circuit in miles as follows  in a survival action the estate or successors of a deceased person are allowed to prosecute a claim for personal injury that the deceased himself would have had but for his death in a wrongful death action the victims dependents not the victim are allowed to recover for the harms they personally suffered as a result of the death independent of any action the decedent may have had for his own personal injuries   fd at  see also shield  fsupp at   the elements of damage ordinarily pursued in a survival action are pain and suffering inflicted upon the decedent prior to death and loss of future earnings the wahlstroms may recover damages for their sons pain and suffering prior to death to the extent that it can be established at trial see miles  fd at  evich  fd at  p  e boat rentals  fd at  shield  fsupp at  collecting cases cantore  fsupp at  kline  fsupp at  evich also allowed recovery by the decedents estate for loss of future earnings reasoning that in the absence of dependent beneficiaries potential problems with double recovery do not exist  fd at  and concluding that such a recovery   better becomes the humane and liberal character of proceedings in admiralty   id quoting moragne  us at  quoting the sea gull  fcas   ccdmd no  most of the decided cases however are to the contrary  the supreme court disallowed such a recovery in miles see  us at  the courts analysis relied heavily upon the decedents status as a seaman and the resultant applicability of the jones act see id at  but the announced conclusion of its opinion unlike the companion ruling as to loss of society was not confined to seamen see id at  we  hold that a general maritime survival action cannot include recovery for decedents lost earnings  the circuit court ruling in miles explicitly rejected evich on this issue  fd at  and concluded without any reference to the decedents seaman status that the general maritime law does not permit a survival action for the decedents lost future wages id at  the court noted that most state survival statutes and the jones act do not allow recovery for lost wages and that dohsa provides no action for any kind of survivorship benefit id  a number of district court opinions also preclude recovery for lost future earnings in a federal maritime action see shield  fsupp at  cantore  fsupp at  kline  fsupp at  seaman we concur concluding that the wahlstroms may claim damages for their sons pain and suffering prior to death but not for lost earnings nor may damages be awarded for loss of enjoyment of life see shield  fsupp at  citing in re korean air lines disaster  fsupp   sdny see also in re korean air lines disaster  fsupp   edmich  d punitive damages  since the wahlstroms complaint seeks punitive damages and we have deemed the complaint amended to state a claim under general maritime law the issue is presented whether they may recover punitive damages under that law  magistrate judge latimer dismissed the wahlstroms claim for punitive damages stating  in light of the decision to grant judgment against plaintiffs state wrongful death claim as a matter of law any claim for punitive damages must also be dismissed cf neal v barisich inc supra  fsupp at  holding that because punitive damages are nonpecuniary a plaintiff has standing to seek them under the general maritime law only if having standing to seek other nonpecuniary losses cf also alcorn county miss v us interstate supplies inc  fd    cir   fsupp at   we are in general agreement with the view that plaintiffs who are not allowed by general maritime law to seek nonpecuniary damages for loss of society should also be barred from seeking nonpecuniary punitive damages in addition a number of district courts have invoked the supreme courts ruling in miles as a basis to disallow punitive damages for claims under the general maritime law in order to further uniformity between that law and the analogous federal statutes dohsa and the jones act see eg ceh inc v fv seafarer  frd   dri collecting cases boykin v bergesen dyas  fsupp   edva federal decisions are increasingly less receptive to recovery of punitive damages in a general maritime law survival action ortega v oceantrawl inc  fsupp   d alaska  in re cleveland tankers inc  fsupp   edmich most of these cases involved claims by seamen and there are a few district court rulings to the contrary see cleveland tankers  fsupp at  n  collecting cases overall however this postmiles authority lends additional support to our conclusion that the wahlstroms should not be allowed to pursue punitive damages under the general maritime law conclusion  the judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion on remand the wahlstroms may seek wrongful death damages for funeral and medical expenses and loss of support and services but not for loss of society they may seek survival damages for their sons pain and suffering prior to death but not for loss of future earnings or loss of enjoyment of life they may not seek punitive damages  the hon robert c zampano united states district judge for the district of connecticut sitting by designation  the word vessel includes every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water  usc sec    section  provides whenever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act neglect or default occurring on the high seas beyond a marine league from the shore of any state or the district of columbia or the territories or dependencies of the united states the personal representative of the decedent may maintain a suit for damages in the district courts of the united states in admiralty for the exclusive benefit of the decedents wife husband parent child or dependent relative against the vessel person or corporation which would have been liable if death had not ensued section  provides the recovery in such suit shall be a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained by the persons for whose benefit the suit is brought and shall be apportioned among them by the court in proportion to the loss they may severally have suffered by reason of the death of the person by whose representative the suit is brought  section  provides in pertinent part a application of railway employee statutes jurisdiction  in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any  personal injury suffered in the course of his employment the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury and in such action all statutes of the united states conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable cc∅  transformed by publicresourceorg can appoints wahlstrom to director
