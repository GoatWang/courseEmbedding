cyberoptics corprequest info  cyberoptics semiconductor inc has unveiled the wafersense automatic teaching system a measurement technology for  and mm semiconductor process equipment the wireless and waferlike device provides accurate wafer transfer coordinates for robotic handling and reduces equipment downtime and wafer scrap it uses machine vision to “see” targets that mark wafer transfer locations and then transmits their digital coordinates to the operator a camera captures live video from inside semiconductor equipment as an image processor reports the xyz offset from the teaching wafer to a target inside the equipment software logs data for comparison and analysis and helps to “train” the device to recognize new types of targetsvisit company websitehttpwwwcyberopticscomabout
