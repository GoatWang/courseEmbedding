following information sets forth each funds investment objective and policies the investment objective of each fund may be changed without the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding securities of that fund each funds returns and net asset value will fluctuate and there is no assurance that any fund will meet its objective for a description of how dva selects specific securities for inclusion in a funds portfolio see additional investment information contrarian fund the contrarian funds primary investment objective is to seek longterm capital appreciation and its secondary objective is to seek current income it will invest principally in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of common stocks believed by dva to be undervalued securities of a company may be undervalued as a result of overreaction by investors to unfavorable news about a company industry or the stock markets in general or as a result of a market decline poor economic conditions taxloss selling or actual or anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the company the fund will invest primarily in common stocks of larger listed companies with a record of earnings and dividends low priceearnings ratios reasonable returns on equity and sound finances which in the opinion of dva have intrinsic value the fund may however from time to time invest in stocks that pay no dividends it is anticipated that most stocks purchased will be listed on the new york stock exchange but the fund may also purchase securities listed on other securities exchanges and in the overthecounter market the fund may sell call options on securities it holds covered call options high return equity fund the high return equity funds investment objective is to achieve a high rate of total return the common stocks held by the fund will have the same investment characteristics as those held by the contrarian fund the fund generally will invest in common stocks that pay relatively high dividends ie comparable to the dividend yield of standard  poors  composite stock index in order to enhance its investment return the fund may sell covered call options and sell put options on securities it may acquire the fund will earn premium income on the sale of these options under normal market conditions the fund will invest at least  of its total assets in equity securities equity securities include common stocks preferred stocks securities convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred stocks equity investments in partnerships joint ventures and other forms of noncorporate investment and warrants and rights exercisable for equity securities and equity equivalents while most investments will be in dividend paying stocks the fund may also acquire stocks that do not pay dividends in anticipation of market appreciation future dividends and when dva believes that it would be advantageous to write options on such stocks the fund will be managed with a view to achieving a high rate of total return on investors capital primarily through appreciation of its common stock holdings options transactions and by acquiring and selling stock index futures and options thereon and to a lesser extent through dividend and interest income all of which in dvas judgment are elements of total return although the fund will not invest  or more of the assets in any one industry it may from time to time invest a significant percentage of its total assets in one or more market sectors such as the financial services sector if the fund concentrates its investments in a market sector financial economic business and other developments affecting issuers in that sector may have a greater effect on the fund than if it had not concentrated its assets in that sector small cap value fund the small cap value funds investment objective is to seek longterm capital appreciation it will invest principally in a diversified portfolio of equity securities of small companies with market capitalizations ranging from  million to  billion that dva believes to be undervalued securities of a company may be undervalued as a result of overreactions by investors to unfavorable news about a company industry or the stock markets in general or as a result of a market decline poor economic conditions taxloss selling or actual or anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the company under normal market  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th conditions at least  of the total assets of the fund will be invested in securities of companies whose market capitalizations are less than  billion the fund will invest primarily in common stocks of companies with a record of earnings low priceearnings ratios reasonable returns on equity and sound finances which in the opinion of dva have intrinsic value such securities are generally traded on the new york stock exchange the american stock exchange and in the overthecounter market the fund may also sell covered call options and put options on securities it may acquire additional investment information the portfolio turnover rates of the funds are listed under financial highlights a fund may periodically experience a high turnover rate over  the funds will usually hold stocks acquired for the longterm and will sell stocks when dva believes that anticipated price appreciation is no longer probable alternative investments offer superior appreciation prospects or the risk of decline in market prices is greater than the potential for gain portfolio turnover will tend to rise during periods of economic turbulence and decline during periods of stable growth generally the contrarian fund will exercise the discipline of selling stocks when their priceearnings ratio pe ratio rise to a level in excess of the pe ratio of the stocks that comprise the sp  composite stock index the use of options and futures contracts will tend to increase the portfolio turnover rate of the high return equity fund to the extent the investment policies of that fund result in a relatively high turnover rate it will incur greater expenses and brokerage fees selection of investments in order to determine whether a security is undervalued the principal factor considered by dva is the pe ratio of the security dva believes that the risk in owning stocks can be reduced by investing in companies with sound finances whose current market prices are low in relation to earnings in determining whether a companys finances are sound dva considers among other things its cash position and current ratio current assets compared to current liabilities and in this regard considers a  ratio to be favorable dva applies quantitative analysis to its research process and begins by screening a large number of stocks typically most companies selected for inclusion in the contrarian and high return equity funds will have market capitalizations well in excess of  billion and those selected for inclusion in the small cap value fund will have market capitalizations ranging from approximately  million to  billion in selecting among stocks with low pe ratios dva also considers factors such as the following about the issuer  financial strength  booktomarket value  five and tenyear earnings growth rates  five and tenyear dividend growth rates  five and tenyear return on equity  size of institutional ownership and  earnings estimates for the next  months fundamental analysis is used on companies that initially look promising earnings and cash flow analysis as well as a companys conventional dividend payout ratio are important to this process generally for the contrarian and high return equity funds dva seeks companies with growth rates better than  in the last five and tenyear periods for both earnings and dividends typically the funds will consist of approximately  to  stocks diversified by both sector and industry most investments will be in securities of domestic companies but the funds may also invest up to  of their assets in securities of foreign companies through the acquisition of sponsored american depository receipts adrs adrs are receipts issued by a us bank or trust company evidencing ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign issuer adrs may be listed on a national securities exchange or may be traded in the overthecounter market the funds may also invest in preferred stocks convertible securities and warrants while it is anticipated that under normal circumstances all funds will be fully invested in order to conserve assets during periods when dva

us government or its agencies and high  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th quality money market instruments including repurchase agreements investments in such interest bearing securities will be for temporary defensive purposes only the funds policies of investing in securities that may be out of favor differs from the investment approach followed by many other mutual funds companies reporting poor earnings whose businesses are cyclically down whose prices have declined sharply or that are not widely followed are not typically held by most investment companies it is dvas belief however that the securities of sound wellmanaged companies that may be temporarily out of favor due to earnings declines or other adverse developments are likely to provide a greater total investment return than securities whose prices appear to reflect anticipated favorable developments repurchase agreements each fund may invest in repurchase agreements under which it acquires ownership of a security and the brokerdealer or bank agrees to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed upon time and price thereby determining the yield during the funds holding period in the event of a bankruptcy or other default of a seller of a repurchase agreement the fund might have expenses in enforcing its rights and could experience losses including a decline in the value of the underlying securities and loss of income the securities underlying a repurchase agreement will be markedtomarket every business day so that the value of such securities is at least equal to the investment value of the repurchase agreement including any accrued interest thereon in addition the fund must take physical possession of the security or receive written confirmation of the purchase and a custodial or

corporation and listed on a national securities exchange the contrarian fund will only sell covered call options that are issued by the options clearing corporation and listed on a national securities exchange the funds are authorized to sell covered call options on all of the stocks they hold no put option will be sold however if as a result the high return equity or small cap value fund would be obligated to purchase securities whose total value exceeds  of the net assets of the fund when a fund sells a put option it will establish a segregated account consisting of shortterm highgrade debt obligations to cover its obligation to acquire the securities underlying the option or will hold on a shareforshare basis a put on the same security as the put sold where the exercise price of the put held is equal to or greater than the exercise price of the put sold the segregated securities will be marked to market daily to equal the current market value of the optioned stock by investing in stocks that pay relatively high dividends and earning premiums from the sale of put and covered call options a fund may seek to earn a current rate of return comparable to that of socalled high yield bonds a high yield bond sometimes referred to as a junk bond is generally considered to be a bond that offers a higher yield than a bond with a higher credit rating as compensation for the greater risk involved ordinarily such bonds are rated bb  ba through cc futures contracts the funds may purchase and sell stock index futures contracts and index options as hedges against changes resulting from market conditions in the values of the securities held by the funds or securities that they intend to purchase or sell where such transactions are economically appropriate for the reduction of risks inherent in the ongoing management of the funds the high return equity and small cap value funds may seek to take advantage of significant declines in the stock markets by selling put options on stocks and index futures contracts and during periods of rising prices all funds may sell covered call options on stocks and index futures they hold thereby availing themselves of increased options premiums which ordinarily correspond to significant movements in the market prices of common stocks the ordinary spreads between prices in the securities and futures markets due to the difference in the nature of those markets are subject to distortions eg the margin requirements on futures and the relative liquidity of the respective markets the funds may attempt to take advantage of such disparities to compensate for imperfect correlations a fund may buy futures contracts in a greater dollar amount than the dollar amount of the securities being hedged if the historical volatility of the prices of such securities has been greater than the historical volatility of the futures contracts in addition index futures contracts may be acquired and sold to facilitate cash management of the contrarian high return equity and small cap value funds pending investment of the proceeds of large purchases of a funds shares and to facilitate large redemptions of its shares while futures contracts provide for the delivery of securities deliveries usually do not occur contracts are generally terminated by entering into an offsetting transaction the funds will incur brokerage fees when they purchase futures contracts at the same time such a purchase is made the fund must provide cash or securities as a deposit initial deposit known as margin daily thereafter the futures contract is valued and the payment of variation margin may be required because each day the fund must provide or receive cash reflecting the decline or increase in the value of the contract a fund may not purchase futures contracts or options thereon if immediately thereafter the sum of the initial and variation margin deposits on its existing futures positions would exceed  of its total assets including margin deposits securities loans the funds are authorized to lend their portfolio securities to qualified brokers dealers banks and other financial institutions for the purpose of realizing additional investment income kdf does not intend to lend securities of any fund if as a result more than  of the net assets of the fund would be on loan  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th borrowing while all of the funds are authorized to borrow from banks in amounts not in excess of  of their respective total assets they do not intend to do so if in the future they do borrow from banks they would not purchase additional securities at any time when such borrowings exceed  of their respective net assets special risk factors the value of the shares of the funds will fluctuate with the investment experience of the securities they hold there can be no assurance of course that any fund will achieve its investment objective options and financial futures transactions when the high return equity or small cap value fund sells a put option the fund may be required to purchase the optioned stock at a price that exceeds the market price of the stock on or before the expiration date of the option put options will be sold with this possibility in mind and therefore the fund will sell put options on stocks that dva believes would be desirable holdings even if acquired at the strike price of the option when a fund sells a covered call option the fund may be required to sell the optioned stock at a price below the market price of the stock on the expiration date of the option in these circumstances the ability of the fund to realize a capital gain on the optioned stock will be limited to the difference between the price at which the fund purchased the stock and the strike price of the option plus the premium it received for the sale of the option however because the investment objective of the high return equity fund is to achieve a high rate of total return and the contrarian fund has a secondary objective of seeking current income transactions in covered call options will be effected with a view to achieving these goals and may limit the funds ability to realize additional capital gains on optioned stocks that have appreciated in value an option closing transaction may be effected only on an exchange that provides a secondary market for an option of the same series although the contrarian high return equity and small cap value funds will generally sell only those options for which dva believes there is an active market there is no assurance that a liquid market on an exchange will exist for any particular option in such event it might not be possible to effect closing transactions in particular options with the result that a fund would be unable to close out an option position by acquiring an identical option moreover there can be no assurance that option closing transactions can be effected at prices that are advantageous to a fund a fund will not enter into any futures contracts or options on futures contracts if the aggregate of the contract value of the outstanding futures contracts of the fund and futures contracts subject to outstanding options written by the fund would exceed  of the total assets of the fund investments in futures contracts entail the risk that if dvas investment judgment about the general direction of the securities markets is incorrect the funds overall performance may be poorer than if it had not entered into any such contracts for example if a fund has hedged against the possibility of a decrease in market prices which would adversely affect the price of securities held and market prices increase instead the fund will lose part or all of the benefit of the increased value of its securities because it will have offsetting losses in its futures position in addition in such situations if the fund had insufficient cash it might have to sell securities from its portfolio to meet daily variation margin requirements such sales of securities may but will not necessarily be at increased prices that reflect the rising market therefore a fund may have to sell securities at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so small cap securities investments in securities of companies with small market capitalizations are generally considered to offer greater opportunity for appreciation and to involve greater risks of depreciation than securities of companies with larger market capitalizations since the securities of such companies are not as broadly traded as those of companies with larger market capitalizations these securities are often subject to wider and more abrupt fluctuations in market price among the reasons for the greater price volatility of these securities are the less certain growth prospects of smaller firms a lower degree of liquidity in the markets for such stocks compared to larger capitalization stocks and the greater sensitivity of small companies to changing economic conditions in addition to exhibiting  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th greater volatility small company stocks may to a degree fluctuate independently of larger company stocks small company stocks may decline in price as large company stock prices rise or rise in price as large company stock prices decline investors should therefore expect that the value of the small cap value funds shares may be more volatile than the shares of a fund that invests in larger capitalization stocks derivatives in addition to options and financial futures transactions consistent with its objective each fund may invest in a broad array of financial instruments and securities in which the value of the instrument or security is derived from the performance of an underlying asset or a benchmark such as a security index an interest rate or a currency derivatives derivatives are most often used in an effort to manage investment risk to increase or decrease exposure to an asset class or benchmark as a hedge or to enhance return or to create an investment position in directly often because it is more efficient or less costly than direct investment there is no guarantee that these results can be achieved through the use of derivatives the types of derivatives used by each fund and the techniques employed by the investment manager may change over time as new derivatives and strategies are developed or regulatory changes occur investment manager and underwriter investment manager dreman value advisors inc dva  park avenue th floor

dollar amount times the difference between the stock index value which assigns relative values to the common stocks included in the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the futures contract is originally struck a fund may not purchase a futures contract if immediately thereafter the sum of its margin deposits on its existing futures positions would exceed  of the value of its total assets including the margin deposits a risk assumed in transactions in futures contracts is the possibility that dreman value advisors inc dva may be incorrect in its expectations as to the extent of various market movements or the time spans within which the movement takes place should the investment manager be incorrect in its predictions the funds return might have been better had hedging not been attempted further although the funds intend to trade in futures contracts only on exchanges or boards of trade where there appears to be active secondary markets there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on any exchange or board of trade will exist for any particular contract or at any particular time finally it is conceivable that under certain circumstances a fund would be required to sell portfolio securities at a time when it otherwise would not do so in order to make margin payments on its futures positions for the reasons above the purchase or sale of a futures contract may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in the futures contract while futures contracts provide for the delivery of securities deliveries usually do not occur contracts are generally terminated by entering into an offsetting transaction the funds will incur brokerage fees when they purchase futures contracts at the same time such a purchase is made the fund must provide cash or securities as a deposit initial deposit known as margin it is expected that the initial deposit would be approximately  of the contracts face value daily thereafter the futures contract is valued and the payment of variation margin may he required because each day the fund must provide or receive cash reflecting the decline or increase in the value of the contract the liquidity of a market in a futures contract may be adversely affected by daily price fluctuation limits established by commodity exchanges which limit the amount of fluctuation in a futures contract price during a single trading day once the daily limit has been reached in the contract no trades may be entered into at a price beyond the limit thus preventing the liquidation of open futures positions prices have in the past exceeded the daily limit on a number of consecutive trading days on any day or days when the price fluctuation limits have been reached a fund may be unable to liquidate existing futures positions or to implement a hedging strategy through the purchase or sale of particular futures the writing of a call option on a futures contract constitutes a partial hedge against declining prices of the securities which are deliverable upon exercise of the futures contract if the futures price at expiration of the option is below the exercise price a fund

the futures price at expiration of the option is higher than the exercise price the fund will retain the full amount of the option premium which provides a partial hedge against any increase in the price of securities which the fund intends to purchase if a put or call option that the fund has written is exercised the fund will incur a loss which will be reduced by the amount of the premium it receives depending on the degree of correlation between changes in the value of its portfolio securities and changes in the value of its futures positions a funds losses from existing options on

institutional investors who need to borrow securities in order to complete certain transactions such as covering short sales avoiding failures to deliver securities or completing arbitrage operations by lending its securities a portfolio can increase its income by the receipt of interest on the loan any gain or loss in the market value of the securities loaned that might occur during the term of

fund the fund will not lend its securities if as a result the aggregate of such loans exceeds  of the value of the funds total assets loan arrangements made by a fund will comply with all other applicable regulatory requirements including the rules of the new york stock exchange which require the borrower after notice to redeliver the securities within the normal settlement time of five business days all relevant facts and circumstances including the credit worthiness of the broker dealer or institution will be considered in making decisions with respect to the lending of securities subject to review by kdfs board of directors while voting rights may pass with the loaned securities if a material event occurs affecting an investment on loan the loan must be called and the securities voted kdf does not intend to lend securities of any fund if as a result more than  of the net assets of the fund would be on loan selling covered call options the funds may sell covered call options on securities that they own to reduce the effect of price fluctuations of these securities and increase their income such options will generally be written on securities which in the investment managers opinion are not expected to make any major price moves in the near future but which over the long term are deemed to be attractive investments for a fund until the option expires the obligation of a fund continues requiring the fund to deliver the underlying security against payment of the exercise price this obligation terminates upon the expiration of the call option or such earlier time at which the fund effects a closing purchase transaction by purchasing an identical option to the option which it previously sold to secure its obligation to deliver the underlying security a fund is required to keep the underlying security in escrow in accordance with the rules of the options clearing corporation and of the exchanges when selling a covered call option a fund in return for the premium gives up an opportunity for profit from a price increase in the optioned security above the exercise price and retains the risk of loss should the price of the security decline a fund may however close out its obligation to deliver the optioned securities by purchasing an identical option prior to the expiration date of the option it has sold a fund has no control over when it may be required to sell the underlying securities since it may be assigned an exercise notice at any time prior to the expiration of the option if a call option which a fund has written expires the fund will realize a gain in the amount of the premium however such gain may be offset by a decline in the market value of the underlying security during the option period if the call option is exercised the fund will realize a gain or loss from the sale of the underlying security the security underlying the call will be maintained in a segregated account of kdfs custodian b pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the premium received by a fund will be the current market value of the option and will be recorded as a liability in the funds statement of assets and liabilities this liability will be adjusted daily to the options current market value which will be the latest sale price at the time at which the net asset value per share of the fund is computed or in the absence of such sale the mean between the latest bid and latest asked prices the liability will be extinguished upon expiration of the option the purchase of an identical option in a closing transaction or delivery of the underlying security upon the exercise of the option closing transactions may be effected in order to realize a profit on an outstanding call option to prevent an optioned security from being called or to permit the sale of the optioned security there is of course no assurance that a fund will be able to effect a closing transaction at a favorable price if a fund cannot enter into such a transaction it may be required to hold a security that it might otherwise have sold in which case it would continue to incur market risk on the security the funds will incur brokerage commissions in connection with options transactions which are normally higher than those applicable to purchases and sales of other listed securities call options sold by a fund will normally have expiration dates of less than nine months from the date written the exercise price of the options may be below equal to or above the current market values of the underlying securities at the time the options are written from time to time a fund may purchase an underlying security for delivery in accordance with an exercise notice of a call option assigned to it rather than delivering such security from its portfolio in such cases additional brokerage commissions will be incurred the funds will realize a profit or loss from a closing purchase transaction depending upon whether the cost of the transaction is less or more than the premium received from the writing of the option because increases in the market price of a call option will generally reflect increases in the market price of the underlying security any loss resulting from the purchase of a call option is likely to be offset in whole or in part by appreciation of the underlying security owned by a fund regulatory

computed separately for each class each funds average annual total return quotation is computed in accordance with a standardized method prescribed by rules of the securities and exchange commission the average annual total return for a fund for a specific period is found by first taking a hypothetical  investment initial investment in the funds shares on the first day of the period adjusting to deduct the maximum sales charge in the case of class a shares and computing the redeemable value of that investment at the end of the period the redeemable value in the case of class b and class c shares may or may not include the effect of the applicable contingent deferred sales charge that may be imposed at the end of the period the redeemable value is then divided by the initial investment and this quotient is taken to the nth root n representing the number of years in the period and  is subtracted from the result which is then expressed as a percentage the calculation assumes that all income and capital gains dividends paid by a fund have been reinvested at net asset value on the reinvestment dates during the period average annual total return may also be calculated without adjusting to deduct the maximum sales charge calculation of a funds total return is not subject to a standardized formula except when calculated for purposes of the financial highlights table in kdfs financial statements and prospectus total return performance for a specific period is calculated by first taking a hypothetical investment initial investment in a funds shares on the first day of the period either adjusting or not adjusting to deduct the maximum sales charge in the case of class a shares and computing the ending value of that investment at the end of the period the total return percentage is then determined by subtracting the initial investment from the ending value and dividing the remainder by the initial investment and expressing the result as a percentage the ending value in the case of class b shares and class c shares may or may not include the effect of the applicable contingent deferred sales charge that may be imposed at the end of the period the calculation assumes that all income and capital gains dividends paid by the fund have been reinvested at net asset value on the reinvestment dates during the period total return may also be shown as the increased dollar value of the hypothetical investment over the period total return calculations that do not include the effect of the sales charge for class a shares or the contingent deferred sales charge for class b shares and class c shares would be reduced if such charge were included a funds performance figures are based upon historical results and are not representative of future performance a funds
