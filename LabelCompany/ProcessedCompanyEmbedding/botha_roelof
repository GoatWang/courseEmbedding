events student arts puzzles jobs  interview roelof botharoelof botha an actuary and venture capitalist based in silicon valley is driving innovation affecting the public globally he talks to marjorie ngwenya april   marjorie ngwenya photo techcrunch roelof botha graduated from the university of cape town uct with a bachelor of business science degree in actuarial science economics and statistics  he achieved the highest grades in the history of that program in  botha qualified as a fellow of the faculty of actuaries – the youngest to do so in south africa at the time he later went on to complete an mba at stanford university where he was valedictorian of his class  in silicon valley botha’s roles have included being cfo of paypal at a young age and director of youtube tumblr and a range of other companies whose products affect hundreds of millions of people today for the past  years he has been partner at sequoia capital a venture capital firm in the valley focussing on internet services and software investments he led sequoia capital’s investment in instagram and currently serves on the boards of companies that include eventbrite evernote and square  i spoke to botha about his motivations for training as an actuary and how this complements his current role i sought his views on leadership and the direction of future technological innovations during our conversation i found him to be sharp visionary and highly engaging in equal measure i get a thrill from watching companies thriving in the longterm in the way that paypal and youtube have i am inspired by the impact they have on the lives of hundreds of millions of people what led you to pursue an actuarial career in south africa i grew up in the shadow of a wellknown father and grandfather i had the top results in the province when i finished high school “botha’s grandson is number ” was the headline carried in the local newspaper psychologically i was driven to make my grandfather proud and accomplish something in my own right i finished high school at the end of  – it is the year that the anc was unbanned and nelson mandela was released people were speculating about south africa’s future and the country has certainly fared well compared to expectations back then no one could have foreseen the peaceful transition that we’ve had i wanted to keep my options open and studying actuarial science meant that i had a passport that allowed me to work internationally and to compete on a global scale actuarial science was the most difficult degree to get into i relished the challenge it presented a student two years my senior was my role model he chose the actuarial path and it influenced my thinking the appeal of the actuarial science degree was that it taught problem solving skills if you develop the skill of being able to approach situations analytically and solve very complex problems that serves you well whatever your career  there is a subtle benefit of actuarial science which i didn’t appreciate when i joined the profession professor robert dorrington at uct once quipped “actuaries are trained to think  years into the future and accountants are trained to think a year in arrears” part of what actuarial science enforces in you is longterm thinking and that frame of mind influences the work that i do today we invest in companies that employ three people and we have to imagine what the company might turn out to be in  or  years  in  you became the youngest to qualify as an actuary in south africa  a fellow of the faculty of actuaries how do you view that accolade i was thrilled however it paled in comparison to the thrill of being able to pass first time and the stress of waiting many months for results to be published i remember i was at the grahamstown art festival that year when the results were issued it is south africa’s version of the edinburgh festival when you’ve devoted that many years of your life to accomplishing an objective anyone could tell you if feels wonderful after a stint with mckinsey in johannesburg i understand that in  you went to the us to pursue an mba at stanford university graduate school of business where you were valedictorian  what motivated you to pursue an mba one of my colleagues at mckinsey was a stanford graduate and he convinced me that i should at least apply for a postgraduate programme in the us having done my undergraduate degree and qualified as an actuary an mba seemed a bit wasteful as i had already covered  some basic business training he convinced me nonetheless a further factor was that i had once overheard someone at uct accrediting my academic success to my grandfather’s influence part of my drive at stanford was to make a name for myself in a place where no one knew of my family or background if you think back to the late ’s we were starting to see the rise of technology there was a lot of enthusiasm around what was happening in silicon valley and the pervading sentiment that software was going to change the world there was excitement about opportunities to build new companies which would take on the established guard in an environment of enormous wealth creation disruption and change when i was accepted at stanford it was a great opportunity to live abroad for a few years compete against the best and take on a fresh challenge how well do you think your mba has complemented your actuarial training for your career toolkit i was exempted from a lot of the basic curriculum in subjects such as accounting finance and statistics because of my actuarial training it freed me up to do a lot of interesting subjects for example advanced derivatives the real value in the mba from an academic point of view was learning about nonquantitative subjects such as organisational behaviour negotiations leadership and interpersonal dynamics  affectionately known at stanford as “touchyfeely” it was an eyeopening experience allowing me to receive unvarnished feedback about the impression i create your classmates hold up mirrors to your blind spots and it is enlightening to understand how you come across functional competence and technical skills are important as a foundation but interpersonal and leadership skills are key differentiators later on  understanding how to influence and motivate people  what one skill would you advise trainee actuaries to hone early in their career empathy – the ability to put yourself in someone else’s shoes is an underappreciated skill please share some anecdotes from your time at paypal what did you learn from holding such an influential role my involvement with paypal was a true case of necessity being the mother of invention i had run out of money due to the emerging markets currency crisis in  when longterm capital management blew up i also couldn’t take money out of south africa prior to leaving the country because of exchange control so i watched the dollar value of my rand savings plummet i didn’t have money to pay rent one month i borrowed money from friends and family it was embarrassing to be in that position when the third offer from paypal came around i accepted it so that i could work parttime for three months before graduating  soon after joining i built a bottom up financial model to help understand the drivers of the business it turned out to be a good model that was very representative of the company’s situation and gave us visibility in being able to forecast as i was building the model i was trying to reconcile actual results compared to expectations i discovered that one piece of the model which worked out fraud losses was divergent identity theft was rife at the time and we were losing millions of dollars a month from this activity the view that was taken by the accountants mismatched the losses and the exposure to which they related i applied the chain ladder technique to our fraud losses to try to understand their cumulative distribution function i was trying to work out how long it takes on average for fraud to be notified i realised that our losses were much larger than we had believed i quantified the size of the problem and spurred engineers to build frameworks for fraud control we caught the problem early and saved the company from bankruptcy it was an interesting experience to apply actuarial techniques in a very different context initially i had a single model which i checked and tweaked monthly i soon figured out there were two underlying fraud types – identify theft and merchant fraud both displaying different characteristics changes in the mix of fraud were masking underlying movements we were continuing to break down the problem and building more predictive models  in a fastpaced internet startup when your predictions turn out to be robust you build credibility in the organisation you can start to see the impact of changes to business models and use scenario analysis to aid business decisions – it is of enormous value to a company after identifying the fraud problems we used logistic regression analysis to build the initial fraud models to predict whether a new user was a good or bad user we could decline what were believed to be fraudulent customers nowadays they largely use machine learning techniques  technology is advancing at such a fast pace vastly reducing distances as this virtual interview today proves tell me about your and sequoia capital’s role in this sequoia invests in very early stage companies and helps them blossom take for example youtube where the three founders are friends from paypal sequoia was their first investor – i took a board seat and helped grow the business and it was acquired  months later i acted as an advisor helping the founders to navigate businessbuilding and assisted with strategy negotiations and the eventual sale to google part of our involvement is providing financing but being a business building partner is a strong area of focus we meet regularly with entrepreneurs at board meetings and act as a sounding board i get a thrill from watching companies thriving in the longterm in the way that paypal and youtube have done i am inspired by the impact they have on the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the globe what future innovations do you foresee the least sexy and basic innovation to note is that software is infiltrating so many parts of the world in the same manner that decades ago maths was a foundational subject computer science is becoming that way there are tens of millions of people applying computer science in their jobs every day to help them be more productive this includes modern actuaries the recognition of the role of computer software in any discipline is something we should be aware of and harness if you want to stand out in tomorrow’s world you need to leverage computers as much as you can there is an abundance of consumer service innovation taking place today because of the accumulation of technology and the ubiquity of computing devices in consumers’ hands when i joined paypal there were some  million people in the world with an internet connection just  years later that number is fold  a third of the population of the planet smartphones are truly the personal computer and open up a range of services that can be made available we were the original investor in whatsapp recently acquired by facebook it has half a billion users of its messaging service saving lots of money as a result it is fascinating to be able to innovate with a team of  people and serve so many people around the planet with a wonderful software application that leverages cellular technology and smartphone capability there is a whole class of that sort of innovation which is very interesting and has a ripple effect on infrastructure such as database technology the databases we used at paypal wouldn’t meet the needs of whatsapp today – the scale is entirely different it is an interesting cycle of innovation and tomorrow’s data warehousing technology is incredible  lastly there is an explosion of data science making its way to other industries such as biology i am on the board of a company started by a south african who i met at a science olympiad in  the founder is a phd in electrical engineering but applying techniques to biology to make sense of fragments of genetic information to help parents make choices about the health of their children they are using data science and bayesian techniques to make informed decisions by combining completely different disciplines how would you describe your leadership and influencing style supportive but demanding in my work i help entrepreneurs and founders be the best they can and their companies in turn this relies on the brilliance and determination of founders but we play the role of setting high standards to help them realise their potential   if you were beginning a threeweek break tomorrow how would you spend the time i would spend it with my family i am married with two young children and it’s always fun to spend time with them i also have a number of interesting books that i’d like to read my biggest frustration is i am able to buy books faster than i can read them i remember being at my grandparents’ house when i was four or five looking at a huge stack of encyclopaedias and fantasising about absorbing all the knowledge within them a little bit of that curious child has remained with me and if i could have a ‘groundhog day’ i would spend all my days in a library to read every book available standing in  and looking back what new milestones would you be proud to reflect upon from a career perspective i would be most proud of the companies that i am involved with today and companies that i will support in future being enduring businesses in  we are in the business of making money for our limited partners foundations and endowments but i get a thrill from watching companies thriving in long term in the way that paypal and youtube have done and i am inspired by the impact they have on the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the globe in my personal life being a good parent and a husband do you find time to read the actuary  yes i have it delivered to the office my colleagues walk by my desk and marvel at me i am accustomed to it though  i suffered enough actuarial jokes as an undergraduate i like to read articles related to finance and investment i have always had a keen interest in theoretical finance options and derivatives as an undergraduate i used to look at back pages nowadays i am drawn to the puzzles pages my biggest actuarial challenge is doing cpd while working in such an unusual environment i have also been watching the training videos on the institute and faculty of actuaries’ website and i find them very useful editors choice  issue themes and deadlines features the making of a game changer comment print this

because you cant be brave or courageous without fear dave chappelle comedian a dozen things i’ve learned from roelof botha about venture capital and business  iq iq my views on the market tech and everything else a dozen things i’ve learned from roelof botha about venture capital and business posted by trengriffin  roelof botha is a partner at the venture capital firm sequoia capital he has been involved in many businesses he also writes “some democratize technology access square eventbrite unity some create global user communities youtube tumblr instagram whisper quizup and others disrupt markets through innovative business models evernote weebly xoom” in  prior to his graduation from stanford graduate school of business he was a director of corporate development for paypal he was named cfo in september  and after the paypal ipo joined sequoia in   “the key characteristic of a founder is the desire to solve a problem for the customer that is the driving passion not ‘i think this is going to be a billiondollar company and i want to hop in because i can get rich’”   “i look for the personal passion of the entrepreneur their ability to describe the problem articulately and the clarity with which they can explain why they have a unique and compelling solution to the problem”   “the most successful entrepreneurs tend to start with a desire to solve an interesting problem—one that’s often driven by personal frustration” if a business is not solving a genuinely valuable problem for customers nothing else matters and failure is inevitable founders who are thinking about revenue models term sheets and lots of peripheral issues when the business is not yet solving an important and valuable customer problem are missing the boat in making these statements roelof botha is expressing a desire for missionary founders over mercenary founders botha’s partner doug leone also favors missionary founders john doerr of kpcb also feels the same way about missionaries being preferable to mercenaries for the same reason brian chesky of airbnb once said “in a war missionaries outlast and endure mercenaries” on a related point roelof botha has said that he thinks many great companies sell out too early he has said that sequoia “loves being in business with entrepreneurs that want to build something enduring”   “there is a  mortality rate for venturefunded businesses think about that curve half of it goes to zero there are some growth investments—later stage investments—which makes things less drastic some people try for x returns with a very low mortality rate but even that vc model is still subject to power law the curve is just not as steep”  venture capital requires outsized tape measure home runs to be successful because of the failure rate a few giant winners must make up for many failures basic mathematics dictates this requirement you can’t have failure rates that reflect a power law without huge returns from socalled “unicorns”  the need for unicorns drives the selection process of venture capitalists this fact of life in the venture business means focusing on big markets and businesses that have the potential to grow revenues and profits at nonlinear rates most businesses that are formed are not candidates for venture capital that’s ok  the best way forward for a business which will never have revenue above  million may be bootstrapping with internally generated cash business loans or investments from friends and family  “entrepreneurship is much more than what vcs participate in”  many businesses described by founders as needing venture capital are really just small businesses looking for what amounts to small business finance the people who start these businesses are genuine entrepreneurs often they are better off with bootstrap financing or borrowing money in the form of a loan the businesses created by these entrepreneurs are very important businesses and a key part of building an economy and creating jobs but they are not the sort of businesses that are suitable for venture investing again that’s ok  the total amount of venture financing is overall a relatively small part of an economy because of its impact on innovation and productivity venture capital punches far above its weight in terms of impact but the absolute dollar amount invested per year is relatively small  “think of yourself as the central point of a network” the best way to scale a business is to create flywheels which is another name for a selfreinforcing phenomena and in the center of any flywheels benefitting any startup are the founders and their team to make a flywheel happen they must create a network that is mutually reinforcing the tricky part of any flywheel is overcoming the chicken and egg problem how does the business generate initial momentum before all the pieces are in place usually the jump start takes the form of a free chicken or a free egg  “the answer to creating a flywheel lies in two essential variables the size of the market and the strength of the value proposition any growth goes through an exponential curve then flatters with saturation if the ceiling of the market opportunity is  million even if you get a flywheel it will take you from twenty to sixty or seventy then peter out because you saturated the available space the bigger the market the more runway you have—so if you hit that knee of the curve you can grow exponentially and keep going for a long time doubling a business of material size for three to four years leads to a really large important company that’s a key element in the flywheel idea” to achieve the sort of growth needed by venture capital it is best to be surfing on a phenomenon that is nonlinear moore’s law is one such phenomenon especially when the business also benefits from network effects sometimes a flywheel is created in a really small markets and that is not so interesting to a venture capitalist given the need for unicorn style returns  “companies can end up with too much cash they might have a month runway they get complacent and there’s not enough critical thinking things go bump at  months and it turns into a crisis and then no one wants to invest more” josh kopelman of first round capital has a great post about raising cash in which he said “you should target  to  months of runway post series seed” he also makes important notes about how much harder it is to raise an a round than seed stage capital the amount of series a capital available is not much bigger and the number of seed funded startups competing for the money is larger than has been the case in the past one suggested rule is that a startup that has  months of cash should be thinking about raising more cash and should definitely have started raising by the time they have only  months of cash and should be nervous if they only have six months of cash on hand  to achieve a big success many things must come together in some cases what looked like smooth sailing from the outside was more like a near death experience a few small changes and the outcome would have been dramatically different there is always a mixture of skill and luck involved” “you have to put yourself in a position to be lucky” when considering the difference between luck and skill is it always best to refer to the work of michael mauboussin “there’s a quick and easy way to test whether an activity involves skill ask whether you can lose on purpose in games of skill it’s clear that you can lose intentionally but when playing roulette or the lottery you can’t lose on purpose” my friend craig mccaw said to me more than once that a ship as viewed from the dock may look pretty with the captain smiling from the upper deck in a resplendent uniform — but under the decks there is inevitably some ugliness associated with the travails of actually running something  “problem companies can actually take up more of your time than the successful ones” time is the scarcest resource of a founder or venture capitalist and the biggest time sink is a business that has lots of problems when problems arise that is when the value of a great board advisers and mentors kicks in and the reason why when given a choice a startup always wants to raise more than money investors who bring expertise and helpful relationships to the business are always preferable to purely financial investors  “it’s important to choose initial investors who are not twitchy and rushing for an exit”  “who are you getting in business with you really have to get to know the vcs you might be working with you’re essentially entering a longterm relationship” “consider a simple  x  matrix on one axis you have easy to get along with founder and not  on the other you have exceptional founder and not it’s easy to figure out which quadrant vcs make money backing” when you are potentially entering into a relationship with people who will be in your life for many years why would you make a choice to involve people in your business who are hard to get along with not only do poor relationships with key people substantially lower your chance of success the process will make you miserable why be miserable life is short  “think about private investing it’s very different from hedgefund investing or public investing you can take advantage of market psychology and short term mismatches because you can exit we don’t have that luxury in venture capital we can’t bet this trend will be fashionable for the next three years by definition we need to have a long term stance maybe the company goes public or is acquired in three years five years ten years— who knows …we like long runways” the length of time it takes for a venture capital investment to pay off drives many aspects of the venture capital industry sequoia is rather famous for saying to its portfolio companies “if you don’t have cash for a long runway you better have a revenue model that gets you to cashflow positive quickly” the better option is to have enough cash and cash flow to last a long time warren buffett treats cash as a call option with no expiration date an option on every asset class with no strike price as an analogy venture capital funds lock up capital from the limited partners during the life of the fund for that reason  buffett again says “cash combined with courage in a crisis is priceless” it is during a downturn that the hiring gets easier and cheaper so building a company then can ironically be very attractive   “since the distribution of startup investment outcomes follows a power law you cannot simply expect to make money by simply cutting checks that is you cannot simply offer a commodity you have to be able to help portfolio companies in a differentiated way such as leveraging your network on their behalf or advising them well” every startup and its founders employees business and markets are unique startups need handson help with finding product market fit recruiting finance team building and other aspects of building a business if the venture capitalists involved in a startup are not assisting with things like recruiting early engineers and closing big sales the startup has the wrong venture capitalists venture capital is a service business not just a way to make money via finance  “there is a subtle benefit of actuarial science which i didn’t appreciate when i joined the profession professor robert dorrington at uct once quipped ‘actuaries are trained to think  years into the future and accountants are trained to think a year in arrears’ part of what actuarial science enforces in you is longterm thinking and that frame of mind influences the work that i do today we invest in companies that employ three people and we have to imagine what the company might turn out to be in  or  years” roelof botha was actually trained as an actuary he points out that a successful venture capitalist must able to imagine what something might be a  years later of course since it is magnitude of success and not frequency of success that will determine outcomes a venture capitalist only needs to be really right about what they imagine in a few cases imagining the future is not a science but an art this description from botha about what he is looking for is qualitative “the key to startup success is purity of motivation… if they can weave a believable story with a compelling value proposition they’ll have us hooked”     notes nothing risked nothing special gained video what does roelof botha look for in a founder video this week in
