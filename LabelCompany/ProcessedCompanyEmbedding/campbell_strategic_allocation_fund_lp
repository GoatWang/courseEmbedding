futures contracts are standardized agreements traded on commodity exchanges that call for the future delivery of the commodity or financial instrument at a specified time and place a futures trader that enters into a contract to take delivery of the underlying commodity is long the contract or has bought the contract a trader that is obligated to make delivery is short the contract or has sold the contract actual delivery on the contract rarely occurs futures traders usually offset liquidate their contract obligations by entering into equal but offsetting futures positions for example a trader who is long one september treasury bond contract on the chicago board of trade can offset the obligation by entering into a short position in a september treasury bond contract on that exchange futures positions that have not yet been liquidated are known as open contracts or positions futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities including agricultural products metals livestock products government securities currencies and stock market indices options on futures contracts are also traded on us commodity exchanges the fund concentrates its futures trading in financial instruments such as interest rate foreign exchange and stock index contracts and metal and energy contracts forward contracts currencies and other commodities may be purchased or sold for future delivery or cash settlement through banks or dealers pursuant to forward or swap contracts currencies also can be traded pursuant to futures contracts on organized futures exchanges however campbell  company will use the dealer market in foreign exchange contracts for most of the funds trading in currencies such dealers will act as principals in these transactions and will include their profit in the price quoted on the contracts unlike futures contracts foreign exchange contracts are not standardized in addition the forward market is largely unregulated forward contracts are not cleared or guaranteed by a third party thus the fund is subject to the creditworthiness of abn amro bank nv chicago branch the foreign exchange dealer with whom it maintains all assets and positions relating to the funds forward contract investments there also is no daily settlement of unrealized gains or losses on open foreign exchange contracts as there is with futures contracts on us exchanges swap transactions the fund may periodically enter into transactions in the forward or other markets which could be characterized as swap transactions and which may involve interest rates currencies securities interests commodities and other items a swap transaction is an individually negotiated nonstandardized agreement between two parties to exchange cash flows measured by different interest rates exchange rates or prices with payments calculated by reference to a principal notional amount or quantity transactions in these markets present risks similar to those in the futures forward and options markets  the swap markets are generally not regulated by any united states or foreign governmental authorities  there are generally no limitations on daily price moves in swap transactions  speculative position limits are not applicable to swap transactions although the counterparties with which the fund may deal may limit the size or duration of positions available as a consequence of credit considerations  participants in the swap markets are not required to make continuous markets in swaps contracts and  the swap markets are principal markets in which performance with respect to a swap contract is the responsibility only of the counterparty with which the trader has entered into a contract or its guarantor if any and not of any exchange or clearinghouse as a result the fund will be subject to the risk of the inability of or refusal to perform with respect to such contracts on the part of the counterparties with which the fund trades the cftc has adopted part  to its rules which provides nonexclusive safe harbor treat  ment from regulations under the commodity exchange act as amended for swap transactions which meet specified criteria over which the cftc will not exercise its jurisdiction and regulate as futures or commodity option transactions notwithstanding the cftcs position the cftc or a court could conclude in the future that certain swap transactions entered into by the fund constitute unauthorized futures or commodity option contracts subject to the cftcs jurisdiction or attempt to prohibit the fund from engaging in such transactions if the fund were restricted in its ability to trade in the swap markets the activities of campbell  company to the extent that it trades in such markets on behalf of the fund might be materially affected regulation the us futures markets are regulated under the commodity exchange act which is administered by the cftc a federal agency created in  the cftc licenses and regulates commodity exchanges commodity pool operators commodity trading advisors and clearing firms which are referred to in the futures industry as futures commission merchants campbell  company is licensed by the cftc as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor futures professionals are also regulated by the nfa a selfregulatory organization for the futures industry that supervises the dealings between futures professionals and their customers if the pertinent cftc licenses or nfa memberships were to lapse be suspended or be revoked campbell  company would be unable to act as the funds commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor the cftc has adopted disclosure reporting and recordkeeping requirements for commodity pool operators and disclosure and recordkeeping requirements for commodity trading advisors the reporting rules require pool operators to furnish to the participants in their pools a monthly statement of account showing the pools income or loss and change in net asset value and an annual financial report audited by an independent certified public accountant the cftc and the exchanges have pervasive powers over the futures markets including the emergency power to suspend trading and order trading for liquidation of existing positions only the exercise of such powers could adversely affect the funds trading the cftc does not regulate forward contracts federal and state banking authorities also do not regulate forward trading or forward dealers trading in foreign currency futures contracts may be less liquid and the funds trading results may be adversely affected margin the fund will use margin in its trading in order to establish and maintain a futures position a trader must make a type of goodfaith deposit with its broker known as margin of approximately  of contract value minimum margins are established for each futures contract by the exchange on which the contract is traded the exchanges alter their margin requirements from time to time sometimes significantly for their protection clearing brokers may require higher margins from their customers than the exchange minimums margin also is deposited in connection with forward contracts but is not required by any applicable regulation there are two types of margin initial margin is the amount a trader is required to deposit with its broker to open a futures position the other type of margin is maintenance margin when the contract value of a traders futures position falls below a certain percentage typically about  of its value when the trader established the position the trader is required to deposit additional margin in an amount equal to the loss in value  historical perspective of managed futures pie chart managed futures industry volume by market sector agriculture other metals energy interest rates currencies             pie chart interest rates other energy currencies agriculture stock indices             interest rates metals     the managed futures industry market sector distributions presented above include both speculative and hedging transactions as well as options on futures the charts were prepared by campbell  company using data obtained from the futures industry association the charts show the change in market concentration from  to  in  the agricultural sector dominated most managed futures allocations however by  the agricultural sector made up only a small portion of the total trading volume with financial instruments such as interest rates stock indices and currencies representing the dominant portion of trading a significant portion of currency trading is done in the forward rather than in the futures markets and accordingly is not reflected in the foregoing chart please note that the pie charts above and the bar chart below reflect the trading volume for the managed futures industry as a whole and are not indicative of the fund in particular growth in the managed futures industry january   december  bar chart                                          the managed futures industry has grown dramatically during the last two decades the chart was prepared by campbell  company and shows the industry growth since  using data obtained from managed account reports  investment factors the advantages of noncorrelation and diversification of your portfolio the nobel prize for economics in  was awarded to dr harry markowitz for demonstrating that the total return can increase andor risk can be reduced when portfolios have positively performing asset categories that are essentially noncorrelated even many seemingly diverse portfolios may actually be quite correlated for instance over time alternative investment classes such as real estate investment vehicles and international stocks and bonds may correlate closely with domestic equities as the global economy expands and contracts historically managed futures investments have had very little correlation to the stock and bond markets campbell  company believes that the performance of the fund should also exhibit a substantial degree of noncorrelation not however necessarily negative correlation with the performance of traditional equity and debt portfolio components in part because of the ease of selling futures short this feature of futures  being able to be long or short a futures position with similar ease  means that profit and loss from futures trading unlike many debt and equity instruments is not dependent upon economic prosperity or stability however noncorrelation will not provide any diversification advantages unless the noncorrelated assets are outperforming other portfolio assets and there is no guarantee that the fund will outperform other sectors of an investors portfolio or not produce losses additionally although adding managed futures funds to a portfolio may provide diversification managed futures funds are not a hedging mechanism and there is no guarantee that managed futures funds will appreciate during periods of inflation or stock and bond market declines noncorrelated performance should not be confused with negatively correlated performance noncorrelation means only that the funds performance will likely have no relation to the performance of equity and debt instruments reflecting campbell  companys belief that factors that affect equity and debt prices may affect the fund differently and that certain factors which affect the former may not affect the latter the net asset value per unit may decline or increase more or less than equity and debt instruments during both rising and falling cash markets campbell  company has no expectation that the funds performance will be negatively correlated to general debt and equity markets ie likely to be profitable when the latter are unprofitable or vice versa advantages of futures fund investments both the futures forward and swap markets and funds investing in those markets offer many structural advantages that make managed futures an efficient way to participate in global markets profit potential futures and related contracts can easily be leveraged which magnifies the potential profit and loss as a result of this leveraging even a small movement in the price of a contract can cause major losses  interest credit unlike some alternative investment funds the fund does not borrow money in order to obtain leverage so the fund does not incur any interest expense rather the funds margin deposits are maintained in cash equivalents such as us treasury bills and interest is earned on  of the funds available assets which include unrealized profits credited to the funds accounts global diversification within a single investment futures and related contracts can be traded in many countries which makes it possible to diversify risk around the world this diversification is available both geographically and across market sectors for example an investor can trade interest rates stock indices and currencies in several countries around the world as well as energy and metals while the fund itself trades across a diverse selection of global markets an investment in the fund is not a substitute for overall portfolio diversification ability to profit or lose in a rising or falling market environment the fund can establish short positions and thereby profit from declining markets as easily as it can establish long positions this potential to  make money whether markets are rising or falling around the globe makes managed futures particularly attractive to sophisticated investors of course if markets go higher while an investor has a short position he will lose money until the short position is exited professional trading campbell  company is one of the worlds largest and most experienced commodity trading advisors campbell  companys approach includes the following elements  disciplined money management campbell  company generally allocates between  and  of portfolio equity to any single market position however no guarantee is provided that losses will be limited to these percentages  balanced risk campbell  company will allocate the funds capital to more than  markets around the world  hours a day among the factors considered for determining the portfolio mix are market volatility liquidity and trending characteristics  capital management when proprietary riskreward indicators reach predetermined levels campbell  company may increase or decrease commitments in certain markets in an attempt to reduce performance volatility  multiple systems while campbell  companys approach is to find emerging trends and follow them to conclusion no one system is right all of the time campbell  company utilizes a multisystem strategy on behalf of the fund that divides capital among different trading systems in an attempt to reduce performance volatility campbell  company received advisory fees in exchange for these services convenience through the fund investors can participate in global markets and opportunities without needing to master complex trading strategies and monitor multiple international markets liquidity in most cases the underlying markets have sufficient liquidity some markets trade  hours on business days while there can be cases where there may be no buyer or seller for a particular contract the fund tries to select markets for investment based upon among other things their perceived liquidity exchanges impose limits on the amount that a futures price can move in one day situations in which markets have moved the limit for several days in a row have not been common but do occur see the risks you face  your investment could be illiquid generally investors may redeem all or a portion of their units on a monthly basis subject to a declining redemption fee during the first year see distributions and redemptions limited liability investors liability is limited to the amount of their investment in the fund investors will not be required to contribute additional capital to the fund  value of diversification  managed futures industry past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results historical

index with the sp  index note that stocks associated with the nasdaq and eafe indices as well as bonds have historically had a higher correlation with the sp  index than managed futures as represented by the mar index this low correlation shows that managed futures have a tendency to behave somewhat independently from stocks historical correlation of monthly returns with the sp  index january

the average return for that particular investment generally the higher the standard deviation the higher the volatility shown below are three comparisons of volatility overall upside and downside overall volatility is the most common measure of volatility or risk upside volatility measures the volatility of only the profitable months downside volatility shows the volatility of only the unprofitable months investors are typically more concerned with downside volatility which is perhaps a better historical indication of the risk of actually losing money as can be seen from the chart managed futures mar have shown comparable upside volatility and less downside volatility than the other benchmarks with the exception of bonds there is no guarantee that this low downside volatility will persist into the future nor is this representative of future returns through an investment in the fund standard deviation of monthly returns january   june  bar graph lehman govt mar bond sp

the proper evaluation of any investment must include an assessment of the risk which must be taken to achieve the prospective return another measure of risk in addition to standard deviation is historical worstcase decline or largest drawdown in other words if you had purchased an investment at a monthend peak in performance and then subsequently sold at the lowest monthend price thereafter the worst case decline would be the largest percentage loss experienced the chart below shows the worst case cumulative monthly decline in the lehman brothers government bond index mar index sp  index eafe index and nasdaq composite index since  the mar index experienced a smaller peak to valley decline than three out of the remaining indices this does not imply that managed futures are necessarily safer than the benchmarks compared it is merely intended to put risk in a historical perspective worstcase declines january   june  bar graph lehman bros govt bond index   months  mar fundpool

indicative of future results the effect of increasing allocations of managed futures in a portfolio the chart below shows the effect of allocating increasing percentages of the fund into a portfolio consisting of stocks and bonds beginning with a portfolio made up of  bonds and  stocks the fund was added in  increments while the bond allocation was decreased by the same percentage as the allocation of the fund increased up to approximately  returns increased and standard deviation one measure of risk was reduced if more than  of the fund was introduced returns continued to increase but risk increased as well the foregoing chart does not constitute a recommendation that anyone invest more than  of their net worth which is the maximum allocation allowed by the prospectus in the fund both the increase in return and reduction of risk generated by additional allocations to the fund in excess of the  allocation allowed represent only incremental improvements to the overall portfolio prospective investors must keep in mind that the benefits illustrated by the foregoing chart are only evident during periods in which managed futures represented by the fund outperform stocks or bonds there can be no assurance that the fund will outperform stocks or bonds during any particular investment cycle effect of adding campbell strategic allocation fund to a hypothetical portfolio containing stocks and bonds april   june  historical line graph this chart prepared by campbell  company contains historical trading results hypothetically blended the stocks are represented by the sp  index and bonds are represented by the lehman brothers government bond index see the glossary following this section for information integral to this chart hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations some of which are described below no representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown in fact there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program one of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight in addition hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading for example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results there are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully

models attempt to reduce volatility by combining instruments that behave differently from one another the first chart shows the correlation between the sp  index and various stock bond and managed futures indices the second chart shows the correlation between the fund and the same indices the first chart used the sp  index as the benchmark for comparison while the second chart uses the fund as the benchmark against which the others are correlated managed futures have historically had a lower correlation with the sp  index than the sp  index has had with other stock and bond indices this does not mean that the fund is a hedge for a stock portfolio but merely that the returns of each may be somewhat independent of the other historical correlation of monthly returns with the sp  index

fund  continued past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results volatility comparison april   june  a common measure of risk is standard deviation which measures the variability of returns around the average return for that specific investment generally the higher the standard deviation the higher the volatility or risk a comparison of overall volatility measured by standard deviation of monthly returns for the fund eafe index sp  index and nasdaq composite index is shown in the first chart below notice that the volatility for the fund has been declining in recent years while that of some of the stock indices has been rising during the last three years the fund has had lower volatility than equity indices past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results and there is no guarantee that such low volatility will persist into the future upside volatility measures the volatility of only the profitable months downside volatility measures the volatility of only the unprofitable months investors are typically more concerned with downside volatility which is perhaps a better historical indicator of the risk of actually losing money the second chart compares the upside volatility for the fund the eafe index the sp  index and the nasdaq composite index the third chart compares downside volatility for the fund and the same indices campbell  company believes that prospective investors should note that the fund has had less downside volatility in most cases when compared to equity indices once again there is no guarantee that this low volatility will persist into the future overall volatility bar chart csaf eafe sp  nasdaq     since inception      last  mos     last  mos     last  mos     last  mos     upside volatility

campbell strategic allocation fund  continued past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results risk perspective the proper evaluation of any investment must include an assessment of the risk which must be taken to achieve the prospective return another measure of risk in addition to standard deviation is historical worstcase decline or largest drawdown in other words if you had purchased an investment at a monthend peak in performance and then subsequently sold at the lowest monthend price thereafter the worstcase decline would be the largest percentage loss experienced the
