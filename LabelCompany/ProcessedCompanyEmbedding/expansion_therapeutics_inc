among others the following  the possibility that the anticipated benefits and synergies from the merger transaction between novelion and aegerion pharmaceuticals inc cannot be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected the possibility that costs or difficulties related to the integration of aegerion and qlt operations will be greater than expected the risk that market acceptance of aegerion’s products juxtapid and myalept in the us may not continue at the levels we expect and may be lower outside the us including in brazil and japan than we expect the risk that the conversion of prescriptions for juxtapid or myalept into patients on therapy may be lower than we expect or the dropout rate may be higher than we expect the risk that the prevalence of the diseases aegerions products treat or that we are pursuing treatment for may be lower than we estimate and that it may be more difficult to identify patients than we expect the risk that the side effect profile or other results for aegerions products in commercial use and in further clinical studies are inconsistent in scope and severity with the side effect profile and other results observed in the pivotal study of each drug the risk that the negative impact of the launch of pcsk inhibitors on juxtapid sales will be greater than we currently expect particularly in the us where the negative impact has been greater than we expected to date or that other competitive products will negatively impact our results the risk that private or government payers may refuse to reimburse aegerions or our products or

revisions to the juxtapid risk evaluation and mitigation strategies rems program may negatively impact us sales the risk that net revenues for myalept in the us may be negatively impacted if there are more medicaid patients prescribed myalept than we expect the risk that named patient sales for aegerion’s products in brazil and other key countries outside the us may not be at the levels we expect the risk that regulatory authorities in regions or countries where either of aegerions products is not yet approved may refuse to approve such products or additional indications for such products such approvals are not made on a timely basis or such approvals impose significant restrictions or require additional development the risk that exchange rates will negatively impact the amount of net product sales recognized the risk that the initiation of future clinical trials may be delayed the risk that we will not be successful in our lifecycle management or business development efforts the risk that aegerions and our patent portfolios and marketing and data exclusivity may not be as strong as we anticipate the risk of unexpected manufacturing issues affecting future supply the risk that aegerion incurs more costs than we expect in responding to investigations defending litigation and resolving litigation the risk that any of the foregoing may cause product sales revenue to be lower than we expect or that we may incur unanticipated expenses in connection with our activities the risk that we may not be able to successfully execute strategic plans including our costreduction program and the other risks inherent in the commercialization drug development and regulatory approval process the risk associated with our ability to be granted a rare pediatric disease designation and any subsequent qualification for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher including the risk that zuretinol will not qualify under the current or any future applicable criteria for

agreement in principle related to its class action litigation include risks related to the final approval by the court of the final settlement terms including that the payment amount and availability of insurance could be amended and the amount and terms of any final settlement may be substantially higher and less favorable than we anticipate based on the terms of the preliminary agreement in principle and the possibility that the court may materially alter or fail to approve the settlement terms  in addition aegerions agreement in principle with the us department of justice doj and the us securities and exchange commission sec relating to the investigations by these agencies and the terms of potential final settlements with these agencies include risks associated with the required approvals of final settlement terms by relevant government agencies such as the proposed settlement with the doj being subject to approval of supervisory personnel within the doj and relevant federal and state agencies and approval by a us district court judge of the criminal plea and sentence and the civil settlement agreement and the proposed settlement with the sec being subject to review by other groups in the sec and approval by the commissioners of the sec  the terms of the preliminary agreements in principle may change following further negotiations  the amount and terms of any final settlement may be substantially higher and less favorable than we anticipate based on the terms of the preliminary agreements in principle  final settlement terms could include the imposition of additional penalties further limiting aegerions ability to conduct its business as currently conducted and as planned to be conducted additionally the doj and the sec each likely will outline their views of the factual background in connection with any final settlement  the governments recitation of their assessment of the background could lead to additional legal claims or investigations by

applications – nohla therapeutics clinical applications the first clinical trial using notchmediated ex vivo expanded cord blood hspc was opened by dr delaney in  in the myeloablative double cord blood transplant setting this trial used patientspecific cord blood units for ex vivo expansion followed by immediate infusion no serious adverse events related to the expanded cell product were reported in this phase  trial and the clinical relevance of using notch ligand for ex vivo generation of increased numbers of human stem and progenitor cells was established this was the first trial demonstrating that infusion of ex vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells without coinfusion of t cells from the same donor could result in a significant decrease in the time to hematopoietic recovery of both neutrophils and platelets thus with established proof of concept the goal was further development of this t cell deplete cellular therapy as an economically and clinically feasible product with ready patient access specifically as a cryopreserved universal donor cell product without the need for hla matching the product can be cryopreserved for future on demand use in contrast to the initial patientspecific product patient access to this cryopreserved product would be dramatically enhanced as all of the expanded products would be potentially available for any given patient regardless of hla typing or location of the patient two clinical trials have been completed in adults using this cryopreserved universal donor product in the context of cord blood transplant and high dose chemotherapy with no unexpected safety issues and preliminary efficacy data demonstrating reduction in treatment side effects and time to engraftment other trials are ongoing including a multicenter randomized trial comparing cord blood transplant with and without use of the expanded cell product and a pediatric trial using the product in the setting of intensive chemotherapy advantages of the product the cryopreserved universal donor expanded cb progenitor product has many advantages it is devoid of tcells and can thus be administered without need for hla matching making it a true universal donor product it is a “preexpanded” cryopreserved product and can be distributed and stored for immediate on demand use it has potential uses in a broad variety of indications requiring temporary myeloid engraftment for example chemotherapyinduced severe neutropenia sepsis or accidental radiation exposure advantage of the platform the true advantage of this ex vivo expansion platform is the ability to manipulate the notch signaling pathway with tight regulation thereby optimizing this methodology to direct stem and progenitor cell fate in vitro for the ex vivo
