education health care individual liberty taxes  regulation reform  restructuring transparency legislation publications capital “reserve” fund posted by south carolina policy council on thursday march   ·   since when does ‘reserve’ mean ‘slush’ as has become a yearly tradition legislators have voted to raid the capital reserve fund to funnel money to their own pet projects the purpose of the fund is to finance previously authorized capital improvement bond projects and to retire interest or principal on previous bonds each year the state constitution mandates that it be appropriated  percent of the previous year’s general fund revenue however a provision in the constitution allows the fund to be used for “other nonrecurring purposes” and lawmakers have used that phrase as license to raid the fund for all manner of things that have nothing to do with capital improvements the meaning of this third provision – much like the commerce clause and general welfare clause in the us constitution – has been expanded well beyond its original intentions capital projects are supposed to be large necessary projects for example of the roughly  million appropriated to the fund this year  million is given to the deal closing fund this fund which is used to hand out tax dollars to specific companies to “lure” them to the state was given a total of  million last year— million in recurring funds  million from the indecipherable part b and  million from the mortgage settlement fund this year’s fund also appropriates  million for the state farmers market  more than it was funded in last year’s capital reserve fund bill a fund reserved for capital projects is designed to fund longterm largescale necessary improvements – roads bridges refurbishments of prisons dmv offices or other government buildings – not to prop up failed costly ventures when those ventures run through their originally allotted budget below are just a few more items in the capital reserve fund that seem questionable at best  million cadet accountability system for the citadel  million for the department of revenue to repay a loan from hacking incident  million for the catt programreadysc – a program designed to provide workforce training for companies  million for a systemwide infrastructure and workforce development for state board of technical and comprehensive education  million clemson universitypsa advanced plant technology lab  million business incubator program the general assembly routinely uses the capital reserve fund to give these types of appropriations on years when they don’t have to use the fund to fill in general fund deficits the word “reserve” in capital reserve fund is apparently meaningless to legislators since every year they build up the fund and raid all of it in the same year this fund should be what its title implies – a reserve fund – and should only be used to spend on actual capital projects and only when there is some semblance of immediate necessity a bill has been proposed in the senate s that would propose an amendment to eliminate “other recurring purposes” from the capital reserve fund appropriations criteria that would at least have the merit of preventing this “reserve” fund from being used as in effect a slush fund an additional point if there are really no legitimate and immediately necessary capital projects to be undertaken in a given fiscal year or at least if such projects haven’t taken all the previous year’s appropriation to the capital reserve fund that money should be returned to the taxpayer if the general assembly has taken more money from taxpayers than is required to run the state they have a moral obligation – not a legal one but at least a moral obligation – to return it to the people who

hoa in sc i am trying to find out if reserve funds can be used for capital improvements for common areas there is no mention of reserve funds in any of our governing documents does anyone know if this is allowed in sc carole micheledkentuckyposts   am   i have a question for you what is your understanding of what reserve funds can be used for carolelsouth carolinaposts   pm   my understanding is that they are for repairs to the common areas ex repairing a fence but i am not sure if improvements to the common areas are also included i have seen some definitions of reserve fund include capital improvements for other states sc does not have any hoa laws a bill is pending but there is nothing right now since our governing docs do not reference reserve funds at all i am unsure of what the definiton is in sc the reason i am asking is that our hoa has a pond but the only access to it is through swampy water so i am wondering if we can use reserve funds to build a boardwalk and small dock area so that homeowners can fish in the pond danielhcaliforniaposts   pm   i dont know if it is allowed in sc but i would think not usually reserve funding is guided by a reserve study the reserve study specifies in detail what action items the reserve funds are for an action item would include both a verb and an object and a time period for example repaint the fence on th street every  years if something is not in the reserve study the reserves would not be used to pay for it chances are that capital improvements are not anticipated and not included in the reserve study glenlohioposts   pm   imo you cant use the funds to build the boardwalk and small dock but only to repair or replace it after it exists better to do a special assessment to fund it once you start playing with the reserves it is too easy to use those funds studies show that  out of  people have problems with fractions rogerbcoloradoposts   pm   posted by carolel on   ami am a board of director for an hoa in sc i am trying to find out if reserve funds can be used for capital improvements for common areas there is no mention of reserve funds in any of our governing documents does anyone know if this is allowed in sc carole if there are no restrictions in the covenants or state law i think you can whether or not to do so may require association approval unless your governing documents delegate the authority to the board of directors geraldtposts   am   reserve funds are not for repair they are for replacement of common elements maryaposts   am   gerald wrong they are for major repair and replacement sometimes theres a fine line between repair and major repair but its up to the bod to decide which to apply and whether or not to use the reserve monies if reserve funds were to be used only for replacement then assns with private streets could not resurface those streets a major repair using reserve funds please login to post a reply click member login on the menu forums  homeowner

health care individual liberty taxes  regulation reform  restructuring transparency legislation publications update surplus capital reserve sine die uber posted by south carolina policy council on friday june   ·   session is over … almost the third week in june ended on a tragic note in the general assembly and attention has rightly been away from legislative business in the interests of keeping tabs on the legislature however here’s a summary of the main business at present supplemental appropriations bill  the house passed a supplemental appropriations bill on wednesday determining what to do with a surplus of  million divided between recurring and nonrecurring revenue some of the  million was precommitted to education but lawmakers have discretion over roughly  million of the surplus some notable expenditures in the house supplemental appropriations bill include  million to county transportation committees or ctcs for the repair and maintenance of state owned secondary roads  million for a state employee onetime bonus  for every employee employed for more than  months and earning less than   million for “economic development infrastructure” – ie to build an interchange for volvo  million for debt service on economic development bonds paying down some bond debt will free up more bonding capacity to finance projects such as the volvo incentives package the senate finance committee approved a different version of the bill wednesday which the full senate approved on thursday the senate version of the legislation increases the share of the surplus going to ctcs to  million the senate achieved this increase by cutting other proposed expenditures including child support enforcement at the department of social services medical assistance payment case services at the department of health and human services appropriations to the homestead exemption fund and indigent defense the bill will be debated over the next several days in a conference committee alongside other budget bills on road funding bear in mind putting more money into the same unaccountable and wasteful transportation governance system without reform is unlikely to yield any significant or lasting improvements to south carolina roads capital reserve fund  an amended version of the capital reserve fund passed the house on wednesday the most recent version of the legislation passed by the house appropriated  million in contrast to the  million appropriated by the most recent senate version of the bill each version of the legislation appropriates a large amount of funds to higher education but the house version focuses on this area to a greater degree than the senate the house legislation restores financing to a number of higher education projects for which the senate only appropriated  including  million for a proposed children’s hospital at the medical university of south carolina a private donor recently gifted the same amount to musc for the same purpose but that apparently doesn’t alter the university’s need for this appropriation  million for repurposing of the stern center at the university of charleston  million for renovations of the old law school at the university of south carolina usc columbia  million for a business and behavioral sciences building at clemson university  million for the south caroliniana library at usc columbia despite the constant claims of poverty by state institutions of higher education south carolina’s principal state universities are doing just fine financially nor does increasing university funding seem to improve educational outcomes in any case many lawmakers seem determined to give the universities all or most of what their lobbyists ask for with different versions having passed both chambers the crf bill is now in conference committee amending sine die also on wednesday the house passed a new sine die resolution which would permit the general assembly to debate h during the additional session days the house and senate were already operating under a separate sine die resolution that restricted the matters lawmakers could debate the senate adjourned thursday under the terms of the original sine die resolution with senate leaders expressing little interest in considering the house resolution or debating the gas tax prior to final passage of all budget bills however there is no guarantee senators won’t return to this resolution or the gas tax when they return to approve conference committee reports on the multiple appropriations bills and others leaders in the senate alluded to a return to columbia next week assuming all goes according to plan in conference committee it would be irresponsible of the legislature to extend session even further – increasing the taxpayer cost of the already toolengthy session – to debate what is sure to be the largest tax increase in state history since the senate has already voted put the gas tax bill on special order the bill will be
