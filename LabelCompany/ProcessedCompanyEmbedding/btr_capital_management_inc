investment portfolio is customized to a client’s objectives and the potential for risk and return are properly aligned conservative – consistent – thematic  since the firm’s founding we have consistently followed what we believe is a conservative and timetested approach to investing our conservative approach means we work diligently to avoid unjustified aggressiveness and outsized losses even though investing in any financial instrument inherently involves a risk of loss our priorities are to preserve the investment assets that our clients have accumulated and grow them to meet future objectives we seek to identify investment themes that we believe will generate aboveaverage returns and pay close attention to the prices we pay for securities relative to measures of longterm or intrinsic value this approach has resulted in a track record of strong performance service – integrity – partnership responsiveness and transparency are the two most important elements of a financial advisory relationship btr places a high emphasis on the quality of communication with our clients we seek open honest and transparent interaction we embrace our role as trusted advisor problem solver and leader on a client’s financial team and partner closely with their accountants and attorneys btr portfolio managers work with our clients to reduce the complexity associated with ongoing financial management   our approach btr capital management skip to content menuabout us our approach our team why btr contact us close our approach a timetested approach to investment management btr is an investment counseling firm each client works with the portfolio managers who are directly responsible for management and oversight of that client’s investments at the outset of our relationship we work with clients to identify a unique balance point between potential risk and return and then construct and manage a portfolio of individual securities plus a few mutual funds or etfs according to the clientspecific guidelines and objectives the portfolios we manage reflect a combination of btr’s proprietary research and investment themes as well as the individual goals and objectives that are specific to each client to the extent that assets are intended to fund retirement education or other needs we work with our clients to plan their portfolio management in the context of these objectives long term btr focuses on a longterm investment horizon which allows our clients to fully realize the value of our approach it also helps us keep portfolio turnover low which may increase tax efficiency thematic btr invests in themes we conduct proprietary research and develop a view on how value will be created across economies and sectors once identified we invest in these themes through the purchase of individual equities and in certain cases mutual funds and etfs value oriented we seek to enter and exit investments at attractive prices relative to book value cash flows or other intrinsic measures we believe this practice provides a margin of safety that will help mitigate downside risk while increasing the potential for upside appreciation focus on quality our research process emphasizes the quality of company management and a firm’s financial strength we seek to invest in strong teams and solid balance sheets conservative we pay particular attention to the risk portion of the risk versus return tradeoff customized we work with clients to establish their personalized portfolio guidelines and investment parameters each portfolio is then managed according to these guidelines learn more  client experience we take pride in our high level of service and aim to be available to our clients when needed btr portfolio managers typically schedule facetoface meetings for initial consultations portfolio reviews and planning we make ourselves available by phone email or web meeting to help our clients address pressing financial questions and to accommodate their busy schedules  asset allocation btr constructs portfolios consisting of equities fixedincome securities and cash or cash equivalents each client agrees to a target asset allocation in his or her statement of investment guidelines and objectives as well as permissible ranges around those targets this approach allows btr to make tactical adjustments in the face of changing economic conditions risks and the flow of assets between market sectors while at the same time generally maintaining a desired longterm portfolio allocation  equities investing we believe that focused active management of equities produces attractive longterm returns our investment team develops proprietary themes that identify sectors of the market most likely to benefit from fundamental economic and social shifts we invest in approximately  to  positions per portfolio in order to capture the value we expect to be created from these shifts focusing primarily on sector selection we believe use of individual securities also provides greater tax efficiency through low turnover the average holding period is approximately three years and typically results in lower total expenses as compared to most activelymanaged mutual funds  fixedincome investing fixedincome securities serve as a portfolio stabilizer for our clients and we seek to structure such investments to provide safety of principal and regular income consistent with this approach we do not attempt to use fixedincome securities to generate outsized portfolio returns and seek to avoid taking undue credit risk or actively trading these holdings btrmanaged balanced and fixedincome portfolios typically hold  to  individual bonds of shorttointermediate maturity that we believe are of high credit
