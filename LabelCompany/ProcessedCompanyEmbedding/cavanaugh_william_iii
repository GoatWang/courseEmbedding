chairman awards member national academy of engineering  thad eure jr memorial award greater raleigh convention  visitors bureau  outstanding alumnus award tulane university  ■ as ceo of carolina power  light company william cavanaugh iii forged a merger in  between his company and florida progress corporation to establish progress energy as a regional leader in the energy business while many power and utility companies began to expand quickly after industry deregulation cavanaugh and progress energy took a more cautious approach primarily focusing on its core businesses cavanaughs conservative approach helped progress energy weather industry scandal a recession and the vagaries of deregulation that eventually plagued the more aggressive power companies industry analysts subsequently praised cavanaughs approach of keeping the company true to its utility roots while taking disciplined steps toward expansion and diversification from the high seas to high wires a native of new orleans cavanaugh received his bachelors degree in mechanical engineering from tulane university he then spent the next eight years in the us navy primarily serving in the navys nuclearpowered submarine program after leaving the navy in  as a lieutenant commander cavanaugh joined the mississippibased entergy corporation where he spent the next  years working in a variety of positions at first he held management positions with the companys various subsidiaries including arkansas power  light louisiana power  light and mississippi power  light he went on to serve as group president of energy supply chairman ceo and president of entergy operations and chairman ceo and president of system energy resources in  cavanaugh left entergy and joined carolina power  light cpl in raleigh north carolina as president and coo at the time the company was a sleepy utility with one of the industrys worst run plants over the next eight years cavanaugh would guide the company toward establishing facilities that would rank among the best in the industry when cavanaugh was appointed ceo of cpl in  few industry analysts paid much attention to the change in leadership within two and a half years however the company had undergone major adjustments many insiders noted that cavanaugh sparked more change in the company in that short amount of time than it had experienced in several decades cavanaugh oversaw several expansion efforts including a  million acquisition of the north carolina gas company the building of a  million gas turbine plant in rowan county and the purchase of the internet company interpath communications which cavanaugh integrated with cpls caronet telecommunications cavanaugh also made significant changes in senior management and accelerated the companys costcutting efforts wary of deregulation early on in his stint at the helm of cpl cavanaugh took a cautious approach to the increasing deregulation of the power industry between  and  congress had passed laws that opened up wholesale power purchasing and energy trading with utilities sharing their grids and buying and selling electricity from each other as a result many companies optimistically saw deregulation as the beginning of a new era of expansion and profits many states geared up for a more competitive retail market cavanaugh and cpl on the other hand remained skeptical in an article in business north carolina  the state utilities commission attorney gisele rankin told edward martin that when a legislative commission began to debate the best method of deregulating retail electricity in north carolina cpl became known as the justsayno crowd november  while companies such as duke energy enron and others pressed north carolina for deregulation cavanaugh stood firm in his beliefs cavanaugh and cpl were concerned that states with higher electricity rates like new york would end up draining power from lowcost states like north carolina and force cpl and other electric utilities to raise their prices he also saw deregulation as removing companies incentives to invest in power grids and new plants as they focused on becoming the lowest bidders for supplying power in direct confrontation with duke energy cavanaugh and cpl initiated concerted lobbying in an attempt to sway legislators and donated over  to a pair of groups aligned against deregulation which assisted two people in attaining appointments to the member commission assessing the issue cavanaugh told martin we felt deregulation of electricity was such an important step—fiddling around with something that already worked well—that we should be careful not to put the system in jeopardy november  cavanaugh rebuffed most offers at expansion and diversification he was especially wary of enron which offered cpl a year contract for its industrial customers cavanaugh later recalled that he couldnt figure how other companies were accomplishing such a great deal of marketing and trading that is in spite of high volume sources of actual profits were unclear in opposition to these other companies tactics cavanaugh focused his company on the core business of serving wholesale and retail customers he believed that cpl was growing and strong and he was unwilling to go overseas or to any other place where the company would be unfamiliar with the business landscape many analysts saw cavanaughs philosophy as leaving cpl out of the ultimately profitable bigger picture makes a move while cavanaugh may have been cautious about deregulation he was not going to let cpl be left behind in  he negotiated the purchase of florida progress corporation the parent company of florida power the merger of the two midsized companies would allow cpl to compete in a rapidly consolidating electricity industry and also in a new geographic market cavanaugh was named chairman and ceo of the newly formed progress energy cavanaugh credited the small financial windfall from the merger with partially offsetting a recent decrease in customer demand for electricity which had come about as a result of moderate weather reduced purchases by industrial consumers and intentional temporary shutdowns at a number of nuclear plants taking into account the layoffs of  employees that had resulted from the merger the company was on track to notch  million in savings through  and an additional  million by  cavanaugh remained optimistic about the companys syntheticfuel merchantgeneration and marketing businesses which sold electricity on the wholesale market he told kris hundley of the st petersburg times  our plans for solid earnings and dividend growth have not changed july   guides through troubled times while cavanaugh remained optimistic he faced a struggling economy which reduced the forecast demand for energy after the terrorist attacks of september   cavanaugh saw the future of energy further altered as the economic slowdown deepened cavanaugh told martin in business north carolina  we quickly saw that the business of doubledigit growth was not going to be possible november  although cavanaugh stood on the sidelines during much of the initial activities of deregulation he had made limited forays into other businesses not all of which were successful expansions of gasturbine plants in georgia and north carolina were halted when wholesale gas prices plummeted in  the companys telecommunications subsidiaries also stumbled cavanaugh proceeded to try to slim down the company by selling such noncore subsidiaries as progress rail services a rail freightcar lease and repair service cavanaugh then reemphasized the companys focus on earning profits through production of regulated electricity in  the company struggled with lessthanexpected earnings of  million on gross revenue of  billion the companys earnings per share dropped to  in  compared to  in  most industry analysts noted that the companys performance may not have been stellar in  but it consistently outperformed other utilities as it weathered energybusiness scandals and the economic downturn in a presentation before the companys annual meeting of shareholders in may  cavanaugh told shareholders as reported on pr newswire progress energys strategy is to remain true to its utility roots while making strategic investments in related business that can generate higher growth may   by the end of the year cavanaughs strategy appeared to be working the company reported consolidated net income of  million or  per share in  in addition the company made successful efforts to sell further noncore assets—including the north carolina natural gas subsidiary purchased through cpl in —which helped the company pay down its more than  billion of debt these sales helped reduce the companys capital expenditures and push its leverage the use of debt to increase returns to below  percent at the same time the company raised its dividends for the th consecutive year including the years when it was still cpl management style be competitive cavanaugh noted that success goes beyond capturing and holding a market share he stressed that management must comprise good competitors if the company is to be able to pursue and capitalize on opportunities as reported in executive speeches  cavanaugh told attendees of the rd national conference of the american association of blacks in energy that achieving success also means working with the best suppliers and—at the heart of the matter—attracting and retaining the best employees december  industry analysts and coworkers noted that cavanaugh was a highcaliber leader who stressed excellence and ethics in  progress energy was one of only three sp  companies to be recognized by standard and poors for providing the most complete and detailed information possible to investors as reported by pr newswire cavanaugh observed in this postenron era its more important than ever for corporations to be clear and upfront about their financial condition and business practices acting with integrity is very much the progress energy way may   decides to retire although cavanaugh had originally planned to retire on february   the enron scandal of  and general turmoil in the industry led the companys board to ask him to delay his date of departure cavanaugh agreed but said that he would still want to retire close to the initially scheduled date if the financial situation improved by january of  cavanaugh and the board believed that the state of the industry had calmed down considerably and that progress energy was on firm footing cavanaugh retired from his position as ceo in march  and from his position as chairman the following may industry analysts agreed that cavanaugh turned over the reins of a company with a solid financial foundation he accomplished this feat by making wise decisions that successfully led progress energy through a recession and through the uncertainty of deregulation in a progress energy press release j tylee wilson the presiding director noted bill made progress energy a great place to work for employees and an exceptional value for investors january   upon retirement in addition to spending more time with his family cavanaugh intended to remain involved in nuclear issues for the power industry he served on the governing board of the world association of nuclear operators as well

lawyers attorneys a lawyer is a person who practices law as an advocate barrister attorney counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services the role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms bankruptcy lawyers bankruptcy law provides for the development of a plan that allows a debtor who is unable to pay his creditors to resolve his debts through the division of his assets among his creditorsthe philosophy behind the law is to allow the debtor to make a fresh start not to be punished for inability to pay debts bankruptcy law allows certain debtors to be discharged of the financial obligations they have accumulated after their assets are distributed even if their debts have not been paid in full some bankruptcy proceedings allow a debtor to stay in business and use business income to pay his or her debts personal injury lawyers a personal injury lawyer is a lawyer who provides legal representation to those who claim to have been injured physically or psychologically as a result of the negligence or wrongdoing of another person company government agency or other entity personal injury lawyers tend to practice primarily the area of law known as tort law even though personal injury lawyers are trained and licensed to practice virtually any field of law they generally only handle cases that fall under tort law including work injuries automobile and other accidents defective products medical mistakes and slip and fall accidents more links attorneys in mississippi
