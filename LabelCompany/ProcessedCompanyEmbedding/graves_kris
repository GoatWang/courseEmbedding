    download pdf     quick facts facility kris graves projectsvertical photography location long island city nychallenges provide photorealistic colors for professional printing of photos improve workflow between photo and video editingsolution ” nec multisync pawbksv with spectraviewii™ color calibration software result helped graves stay true to his art form and allowed for photorealistic images to be produced date august based out of the vibrant city of new york kris graves’s modest photography studio off of his apartment may suit the nature of his minimalist photography style but it belies the depth found in his photos since  graves has worked on numerous photography and video projects and boasts an extensive portfolio along with various published worksfor graves photography isn’t merely the recording of an image as it is for most of us it’s an art form he pursues with passion specializing in dramatic landscapes in all sorts of settings – urban rural and some of the most remote locations on the planet – graves seeks to share the wonders of the world with those who view his work whether it is as an individual print on a website or in one of the numerous books he has publishedin order to make sure that the images he captures stay true to the moments in time when he experienced them and the places he has ventured graves knows he must have the best tools at his disposalthe challengein mid graves ever in the middle of multiple projects came to realize a serious disparity in quality between the professionalgrade nec multisync paw monitors he used during his day job at the solomon r guggenheim museum and the more consumergrade monitor he was using for his personal work graves’ guggenheim work involves photographing works of art for archival purposes something which requires significant care in almost all aspects of the task beyond the considerations necessary for the handling of any give piece of art the importance of capturing the true colors shadows and overall style of each piece for the archive is something which requires high quality equipment the nec monitor functioned on another level beyond what he was experiencing at home as an artist this difference stood out starkly to him and he began to consider that it might be time for a change “you always want your work to look its best” said graves “and when you’re working with publishers and having your work printed you have to make sure the colors are spoton this was something i couldn’t risk and decided i needed to take extra steps to ensure the quality”his workspace consisted of an apple laptop that he used for video editing and a desktop pc that was used for photo editing while both the laptop lcd and desktop monitor were used for different purposes each had different color presentation and were inconsistent compared to his work environmentthe solutionfate intervened for graves when he was contacted by nec to review the very product he required nec’s new ” multisync paw nec reached out to graves after reading comments he made about his work at the guggenheim and the current nec monitors he used there “it was really exciting to be given the chance to use this display before it was unveiled” said graves “i grew up with nec products my father always used them in his work so i knew what an exciting opportunity this was and felt fortunate to find myself in a situation where i could receive a unit to review for nec”graves immediately tested the limits of the paw putting it through the paces as he designed the layout for his next book edited scans for multiple artists edited his own photography collection and continued photographing and editing artworks overallspecifically graves found the resolution of the paw to be far more impressive than his previous monitor “i was able to get a resolution of  x  which is impressive the unit i had been using was the same size dimensionwise but could never offer this many pixels” said graves this increased resolution meant he could now view drastically more detail in his images than he could beforefor his work this meant special attention paid to the finer details of the scenic views he captured for example during one of his three trips to iceland graves captured an image of melting icebergs which featured a variety of shades of blue not only from the iceberg but from the water in which it floated the details captured through his expensive camera equipment and lens can only be done justice with a monitor distinguishes between the subtleties of the various hues and gradientsthe effect is similar to the work of the impressionist painters where many hundreds or thousands of individual dots or brush strokes were used to create an image but only when viewed at a distance georges seurat’s iconic saturday in the park with friends is perhaps the bestknown example of this style the closer you get the more detail you see but the image itself cannot be taken in only the dots for graves the reverse is true while there is in image to behold from a distance the closer you look the more impressive it becomes the subtle changes among shades of blue and white in the iceberg can be appreciated and offer a deeper sense of the moment itself perhaps there is an individual drip forming or the last bit of an ice lattice structure is failing these minute details which add drama and life to an otherwise simple scene are all in the images which graves captures without a highquality monitor at his disposal however it is difficult for him to add the little touches that allow him to share what he saw in person with the rest of the world in his individual prints and booksin that same vein graves also said the color correction feature provided by nec’s spectraviewii was an amazing addition to the display “with my work i have to make sure the screen is absolutely color correct for proofs when everything goes to press having the color correct option makes it easy to work for all mediums books video the internet etc”again the beauty of the melting ice which he captured during his travels would be lost if not done an injustice without having technology which can complement his camera nec’s spectraviewii system uses a color sensor to take color measurements of the display screen during calibration the software analyzes these measurements and sends color adjustment commands directly to the display monitor this means that color adjustments are made in the monitor rather than in the computer’s video graphics adapter which is often unable to render the subtleties required for this type of work with spectraviewii the video graphics adapter is not used at all to make any gamma or tone response curve corrections to the display so the fidelity of the system is maintainedgraves also noted that he’s actually able to use two separate computers via the paw at the same time “using two computers on the same monitor with the same keyboard is an amazing option for me because i often have an apple laptop set up for video editing and my pc set up for photo editing” said graves “it also allows me to have the same color correction on both devices which assures me of the output”in the end graves says he is very satisfied with his switch to nec’s paw the unit will help him stay true to his art form and allow for photorealistic images to be produced   have

themselves  stunning portraits of black men that accurately portray how they see themselves  slate sign in sign up slatebeholdthe photo blogfeb    am stunning portraits of black men that accurately portray how they see themselves  by david rosenberg   the artist kris graves if you were one of kris graves’ subjects for his series “the testament project” having your portrait taken most likely felt like an extended hangout graves photographed  men who were friends or family in the series spending hours with each one and sometimes with more than one subject at a time during which they would catch up on each other’s lives and talk about “politics music entertainment and money” the portraits graves took however were more than just a friendly collaboration with some important people in his life they were a way for graves to portray black men in a new way one that tried to avoid the misrepresentation with which graves feels black men are viewed—either demonized ridiculed or idolized—in popular culture he described the work as “an exploration of black identity in a modern way not the black identity that has been given to black people” advertisement besides sharing experiences graves is also currently working on a video component to the project graves decided to have his subjects choose from a palette of colors he would then use to light them the lighting not only presented his subjects in a unique way but by allowing the men to pick their own colors graves said he was collaborating with them to portray their individuality along with their blackness not everyone picked colors and graves said that was fine saying that adding somewhat “neutral” portraits into the series created a nice mix larry kris graves keith kris graves the producer kris graves a lot of graves’ work covers landscapes and although he had worked with portraiture before the idea for “the testament project” was a vehicle through which graves would be able to address issues about which he felt strongly “for the most part i can make a nice landscape but it tells nothing about me” he said “i wanted to do a more personal series that related to my background and my upbringing and my family” graves said that the ways in which racism affects his friends and family has long been a topic of conversation during family gettogethers advertisement “if i am at my parents’ house or other family members are over the conversation is loose a lot of race stuff going on” he said “it’s not too serious but it’s always like this happened to me always stories about how someone recently dealt with racism or discrimination so it was very open talking to these guys it was like talking to family even if we hadn’t spoken in a while i imagine amongst black people that conversation happens every time they’re together” the designer and trevin kris graves although he’s still tinkering with the video component of the project graves said he’s ready to begin making portraits of black women to add to the series he’s also interested in making portraiture of black people out of doors “i want to take the project on the road to national parks where black people never go to shoot them in the landscape” “the testament project” is on view at blue sky gallery in portland oregon through feb  you can also see some of the work at clampart gallery in new york part of the “headshots contemporary photographic portraiture” through april  shahin kris graves load comments powered by livefyre slate sign in sign up slate slate sign in sign up kris graves the testament project  lenscratch fine art

by aline smithsonnovember   kris graves jessica  courtesy of sasha wolf projects about a month ago i was standing in a room of vivid color surrounded by beautiful faces each shimmering with a different spectrum of the rainbow i had the lucky opportunity to experience kris graves’ new work the testament project in person at the center for fine art photography in colorado which runs through november th when the show opened kris held the audience in rapt attention as he discussed his process and project turning the idea of being a person of color on its head the large glowing photographs and video components were exhibited in an enclosed rectangular room which served as a small chapel of possibility and respect taking the viewer to a spiritual space filled with light color and thoughtfulness i believe that all who experienced it came away a little bit changed kris is an artist who does it all beyond his photographic endeavors he was the founder of the gallery kris graves projects and has become a prolific bookmaker and publisher the third volume of the testament project is available here kris is also a wonderfully supportive and warm person making his successes even more meaningful he recently photographed spaces where police have taken black lives for vanity fair and is currently working on a photographic series with the heads of state of the nation of hawai‘i group the series of works will be captioned by historical information about the time before the united states occupied and stole hawai’i kris graves b  new york ny is a photographer and publisher based in new york and london he received his bfa in visual arts from suny purchase college he has been published and exhibited globally including the national portrait gallery in london england blue sky gallery in portland oregon bryn mawr college in bryn mawr pennsylvania clampart gallery in new york virginia museum of contemporary art in virginia beach and center for fine art photography in fort collins colorado among others he is represented by sasha wolf projects kris graves the artist  courtesy of sasha wolf projects the testament project is an exploration and reconception of the contemporary black experience in america more often than not black people are portrayed in the extreme – either as very rich or very poor they are demonized infantilized ridiculed idolized or hypersexualized and within the art canon there is a noticeable scarcity of black representation in the glowing portraits i give control of the colored lighting to my subjects in order to create a space that is participatory and empowered by including my subjects in the creation of the scene and the altering of color i seek to create photographs that portray individuality in addition to their blackness kris graves busola  courtesy of sasha wolf projects kris graves shahin  courtesy of sasha wolf projects kris graves corey  courtesy of sasha wolf projects kris graves elsa  courtesy
