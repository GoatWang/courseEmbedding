research project skip to main content search search dollar general corporate rap sheet dollar general by philip mattera dollar general is one of the biggest players in the dollar store sector of us retailing which targets consumers with incomes so low they cant afford to shop at discounters such as walmart  it operates more than  smallbox outlets mostly in small towns and rural areas and has annual revenue of more than  billion dollar general has sought to capture a greater share of the spending of lowincome families on consumables by introducing more food products including some fresh and frozen items but that spending has been hampered by cuts in the food stamp benefits on which many of those families depend along with the other dollarstore chains dollar general has been involved in controversies of over the sale of hazardous products including chinesemade toys containing lead and the denial of overtime pay to store managers who perform a great deal of nonadministrative work

spread rapidly throughout the southeastern united states after taking over the company from his father in  cal turner accelerated the growth through the acquisition of other chains such as pn hirsch and eagle family discount that approach ended up stretching the chain too thin and in the late s turner decided to focus exclusively on internal expansion especially in small towns overlooked by giant discounters such as walmart he added some items above  while keeping most below  and he relied on limited direct mail and wordofmouth rather than advertising in  the securities and exchange commission launched an investigation into dollar general accounting irregularities that inflated reported earnings dollar general had to restate its financial results for three years and cal turner had to step down the company also paid  million to settle a shareholder lawsuit and later paid a  million civil penalty to the sec turner and three other former executives also paid individual fines totaling about  million see here and here despite the scandal dollar general along with other dollar stores benefited from the expanding demand for lowcost goods even among middleincome consumers the company introduced dollar general market stores larger outlets with more food including fresh produce and refrigerated and frozen items including these offerings allowed the chain to begin accepting food stamps in  the private equity firm kohlberg kravis  roberts took over dollar general for about  billion including the assumption of about  million in debt among kkrs plans was a stronger push into
