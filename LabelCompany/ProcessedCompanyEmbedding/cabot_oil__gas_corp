                                                        oil  gas exploration surveys for reservoir discovery petroleum exploration surveyshydrocarbon mapping collc is a remote sensing oil and gas survey company that specializes in locating oilgas reservoirs and drill sites anywhere  faultfractures are included with the hydrocarbon survey maps hydrocarbon mapping collc is in the business of finding oil and gas reservoirs for its customers  we have found reservoirs in texas oklahoma kansas illinois and more that operators are producing we have found wildcat reservoirs expanded old fields and helped determine where to drill within old fields for new production       hydrocarbon mapping co llcwe find oil and gas reservoirs​ we have prospects for sale in oil country  see the prospecs page for a list all images on this website are copyright protected hydrocarbon mapping hydrocarbon mapping is a  company formed for the purpose of locating hydrocarbon reservoirs our procedure is to st define the area that you want surveyed for oil and gas reservoirs we usually first define the location of faults and fractures this helps to define probable traps and trends after this the hydrocarbon survey is done to help determine if there are any potential reservoirs if there are good hydrocarbon signatures we then define the reservoir size after this the quality of the reservoir is defined when a reservoir is located we then work on the probability of production this is simply defined by the color intensity of a reservoir our discovery rate is limited to where a client dictates that hydrocarbon mapping collc surveys the clients that have the greatest success are companies that commission regional surveys and companies that are extending reservoirs in known fields or are in oil and gas country where there are known reservoirs the regional surveys are performed in an effort to locate reservoirs within several thousand acres once a reservoir is located then larger scale maps are developed that define these reservoirs in more detailthe exploration methods used by hydrocarbon mapping are based on data and methods used by experienced oil finders one data source is light signature that emanates from every known material in the universe every molecule in the universe has a unique light signature that defines what it is astro physicists are able to study planets and stars and define their material composition they can define what materials the solids are and what material the gases are made up of a scientist can determine the material that a planet is composed of from the light signature light signature enables definition of oil and gas reservoirs oil reservoirs differ in many ways gravity parrifin content gas content water content etc the dna that is light signature can define separate oil reservoirs and gas reservoirs this helps to determine multiple stacked reservoirshydrocarbon mapping collc accesses data from tools that are placed on earthorbit satellites we use all of these tools to incorporate the following information in the finished product radar infrared temperature gamma ray radiometrics dialectiric potential telluric ionization and geomagnetic the remote sensing data is combined in order to produce reservoir survey results hydrocarbon mapping collc also uses a proprietary method of locating and mapping oil and gas reservoirs this method is proving to be very successful and cost effectivehydrocarbon mapping surveys properties for oil and gas companies mineral owners and oil and gas investors                                our company has found many oil  gas reservoirs  we use several remote sensing techniques                                 to generate a finished product for our customers the finished product is a hydrocarbon survey                                 presented on google earth aerial maps                                  gps locations are presented on hot spots if requested                                faults and fractures are included on the hydrocarbon survey map                                final presentation is emailed so that they can be viewed on your computer                                we feel like we are the best in the business offering a unique product to our clients
