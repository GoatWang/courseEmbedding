increased during our operational planning for  and  i have toured our area of operations in laos and received reports from our agricultural advisors in singapore china and south america we have confirmed reports that the demand for castor beans and castor bean derivative products exceeds current production by a wide margin these facts and earthgens goal of becoming one of the largest us based growers of castor beans is the basis for the companys expansion goals our operating plans call for starting castor bean operations in south america and in the us plans also include adding  acres of castor bean farms in laos over the next two years it is estimated that  acres of new farms are capable of producing  tons of castor beans annually that could produce annual sales of approximately  based on todays world market prices the planting schedules are subject to finalizing land use rights in these areas and obtaining additional working capital in the recent april  report published by castor oil reports they noted that castor oil is possibly the plant oil industrys most underappreciated asset it was also reported that castor beans are one of the most versatile of plant oils it is used in over ten diverse industries and is the starting material for producing of over  end products new applications of castor oil are being explored in areas such as pharmaceuticals and biopolymers  bioplastics the reported concludes that these end user markets for castor oil and its derivatives are expected to expand significantly over the next few years castor oil report also points out that uses of castor oil have changed over the years many years ago castor oil was primarily used for medicinal purposes and as a general industrial lubricant today chemical engineers have come up with many uses of castor oil and its derivatives such as polyamide  nylon  fibers are use in the very large carpet manufacturing industry engineering plastics for heat tolerant automotive and air plane parts lubricating grease coatings inks sealant aircraft lubricants surfactants emulsifiers encapsulants plastic films plasticizer for coatings and components for shatterproof safety glass castor oil has even made its way into cosmetics and related products even as more uses for castor oil emerge earthgen believes that demand for castor oil will be most affected by its use as clean fuel biodiesel one example of this is cited in studies done by evogene ltd an israeli based agricultural hybrid seedcompany the report of tests in brazil for biodiesel and biojet fuel production utilizing castor beans found castor beans to be an effective drought tolerant and high oil yielding crop expanding use of castor bean oil and the results of evogenes tests confirm that castor beans are an ideal clean biodiesel feedstock and are some of the reasons why earth gen is accelerating plans for castor bean farming in california by utilizing nonfarm land to cultivate a high value drought tolerant castor

bean oil for manufacturing and not the expected future demand for use as clean biodiesel earthgen believes that based on import demands from the major industrial countries and the need of chemical

period the plantation is configured to allow for replanting to begin almost immediately starting with the early monsoon rains in july of this year it takes five to six years for a tree to become mature enough to start the conversion to agarwood which is estimated to take an additional two to three years earthecos replanting process should yield consistent agarwood product availability for years to comeceo george shen stated agarwood from our phonehong tree farms is a highly valued crop and offers earthgen the opportunity to use the experience we have gained in managing agricultural projects in laos to build additional sources of revenue i have a long history of managing rare wood forestry operations based on sustainability and environmentally sound practices our agarwood plantation operations share the same operating goals with earthgens castor bean operations as contributors to keeping our environment clean and greenearthgens purchase agreement with phonehong tree farms includes that at the time of closing earthgen will issue the owner of phonehong tree farms  shares of earth genbiofuel inc restricted common stock additionally phonehong tree farms will assign the rights to all agarwood trees on the land and the future rights to all products grown on the land for a period of  years to earthgens subsidiary eartheco agriculture inc further details of the agreement have not been disclosedmr shen added that earthgen believes there are many opportunities to acquire additional agarwood assets as local farmers currently lack options to bring their products to market reducing their income and overall economic development in laos planned commercialization of the agarwood trees will expand opportunities for farmers by introducing modern marketing methods and commercial practices that add value as these small farmers become successful businesses they should create jobs and contribute significantly to economic prosperity in its areas of operations
