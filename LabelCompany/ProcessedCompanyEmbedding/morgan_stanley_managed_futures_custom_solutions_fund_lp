morgan stanleys managed futures funds    in general the primary objective of the funds managed by ceres is to provide absolute returns that diversify an investor’s portfolio with low to no correlation to traditional investments ie equities and fixed income and other alternative investment strategies  for a custom portfolio ceres works with the investor to define their investment objectives and riskreturn targets as well as establishing the expectations and attributes associated with such the ultimate goal of ceres investment process is to identify and invest with commodity trading advisors ctas who have the potential to add value to the custom portfolio and the investors overall portfolio from both an absolute return and diversification standpoint   differentiators experience and expertise ceres team consists of highly experienced and vastly knowledgeable professionals dedicated exclusively to the structuring and monitoring of fund portfolios allocating to registered commodity trading advisors ctas reputation given morgan stanleys worldwide brand recognition and ceres strong reputation and presence in the managed futures industry ctas and other service providers are quite often willing and accommodating in order to have the opportunity to be business partners with us extensive product platform our wideranging set of product offerings provides qualified individual and institutional investors with the potential to meet their investment objectives and help diversify traditional and alternative investment portfolios comprehensive due diligence and manager selection process in order to be considered and selected for inclusion in one of our funds a cta must endure a thorough investment and operational due diligence review as well as demonstrate attributes pedigreebackground trading approach technology etc that help to differentiate them from other ctas in the funds and across the managed futures industry       investment process  sourcing ctas who are candidates for a potential investment allocation from our funds are sourced from ceres expansive network of contacts as well as identified through screening of databases and from various industryrelated events and conferences  in order to qualify for investment consideration a cta must first meet specific minimum criteria related to length of track record assets under management and investor concentration levels  the teams investment professionals actively monitor the cta universe and maintain an ongoing dialogue with ctas to remain informed of new entrants into the industry the evolution of organizations and trading strategies cta performance relative to the current economic environmentmarket cycle product innovation and application and distribution trends  due diligence  analysis ceres conducts comprehensive due diligence of all ctas considered for potential inclusion in one or more of our funds  due diligence of the cta consists of a quantitative analysis and qualitative review of various aspects of a cta including but not limited to  investment strategy and trading approach  historical returns  performance over various time periods sectorstyle attribution absolute and relative returns etc risk attributes volatility measures decline periods portfolio efficiency etc correlations versus other ctas and asset classes margin and leverage utilization research processes adherence to policies and procedures organizational structure and personnel primary thirdparty service providers technology contingency operational capital and disaster recovery plans  portfolio construction and cta selection when constructing a portfolio we initiate the process by defining the riskreturn objectives and our longterm expectations ctas are then selected based upon whether or not we believe they have the potential to help the fund meet its objectives enhance its riskreturn ratio minimize the magnitude of its drawdowns or provide it with additional trading style or market diversification  the confidence we have in the ctas we select relies upon our due diligence process as well as on additional analysis we perform including analysis of the ctas performance relative to a funds fees and the fee terms we negotiate with the ctas review of correlations to the other ctas in the funds portfolio and determination of what specific market instruments will be traded in the fund in order to adhere with regulatory requirements  approval and governance all proposals for a new fund or to add a cta to a fund must first be reviewed by ceres investment management committee and then presented to ceres board of directors for consideration and approval  ongoing portfolio management and monitoring ceres views portfolio management and risk monitoring as equally as critical as the initial due diligence and portfolio construction processes  as such we assess assign and manage risks in several ways relying upon assorted means to do so  for instance once a fund allocates to a cta and trading is initiated ceres actively monitors the cta and underlying funds on an ongoing basis ranging from intraday realtime performance market and trade monitoring to daily nextday review and analysis of pl margin commitments positioning and trading  longerterm strategic evaluations of a cta are also conducted particularly in relation to a ctas performance relative to its historical profile its peer group and ceres overall expectations  this includes various reviews performed monthly quarterly annually and as warranted  likewise tactical portfolio rebalancing and allocation adjustments are implemented as often as monthly to account for the current market environment and subsequently the potential opportunities and underlying risks to the funds and ctas
