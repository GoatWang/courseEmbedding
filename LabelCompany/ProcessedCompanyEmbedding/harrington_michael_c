and leora booth in the mids leroy e harrington who preferred to be called harry was a successful salesman for pabco building products in california throughout h is travels harry recognized an opportunity to start a business that would distribute roofing products exclusively which was a new concept at the time in early  harry and his wife ilene moved to salt lake city to start a roofing distributorship harry canvassed the local lumberyards and offered to help them become specialized roofing dealers in trade for purchasing his products harry found a space on  south in salt lake city which he rented from a local coal company at this location he opened le harrington company and remained there for several years in the early ’s harry purchased a home and three acres to build a roofing yard at  south  west the location was good but he had no access to telephone service which he needed to effectively run his business leroy e harrington “harry” one day harry went to the grocery store across the street which had phone service the store was owned by elden booth elden had purchased the store after serving in the merchant marines during wwii and marrying his sweetheart leora christensen harry asked elden to share his telephone service with him and offered to pay for it he also needed help unloading products and asked if elden was interested in helping out elden agreed to both and their working relationship began that day as business grew harry offered elden parttime work while harry wanted elden to become more involved with the business he recognized elden’s need for more roofing experience harry suggested that elden go to work for a local roofing contractor which elden did for two years elden  leora booth l e harrington company was the distributor of el rey roofing products as business improved harry offered elden fulltime work this enabled ilene to turn over many of her responsibilities to elden one of his new found duties was in bookkeeping which he was hesitant about taking on “but harry was always there to teach me whatever i needed to learn” elden said as harry grew older his health began to decline this caused him to think about the company’s future he decided to form a partnership with charles “charlie” elliott of el rey roofing with this reorganization the business was renamed harrington  company harry remained president charlie became vicepresident and elden was made secretary in  the business was growing with the previous addition of new roofing products harrington  company needed space to expand after negotiating with the railroad for some land of a more appropriate size the property on  west was traded for a business site at  west layton avenue where they still do business today as harrington’s business continued to improve and as time went on harry’s health began to rapidly diminish after charlie’s retirement ilene harrington visited with elden and expressed her concern about the future of the company if something should happen to harry they wanted elden to buy the business this was due to elden’s loyalty to harry throughout the many years they had worked together michael h booth brian e booth stephen c booth elden had a special relationship with harry and ilene harrington elden often has stated that they treated him like the son they never had on january   elden purchased harrington  company which he led for the next  years until he sold it to his sons as teenagers stephen michael  brian booth were each given opportunities to work at harrington  company over the years they have learned the various aspects of the business while working in the roofing yard as truck drivers and forklift operators ridgeloaders warehousemen salesmen and eventually owners they credit their father for teaching them the value of dedication and hard work that customers and employees are family and should be treated as such that honesty is truly the best policy and much much more today they work

an entityâ€™s efforts to recover payment of a debt purchased from a third party for its own account is not subject to the fair debt collection practices act the â€œactâ€  justice gorsuch in his first written opinion as an associate justice for the united states supreme court employed a traditional plain language reading of the statutory text in explaining the decision of the court despite the favorable nature of this ruling to banks and other entities which purchase debt in the marketplace the impact of the courtâ€™s decision is softened by the issues to which it did not grant certiorari specifically whether a party qualifies as a debt collector under the act if it regularly seeks to collect debts that it purchased for its own accountbusiness and corporate lawcorporate lawthe courtâ€™s decision is significant in light of the role that venture capitalists play in the development of startups and emerging growth companies and their evolving relationship with the founders of these companies in most venture capital financings the relevant parties will enter into a voting agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions for how the shares of a companyâ€™s capital stock are voted with respect to the composition of the board of directors and voted or tendered in connection with an acquisition of the company generally speaking an amendment to or waiver of a provision in such a financing agreement requires the consent of the company the key holders who are commonly the founders and the investors investors can limit the risk associated with recalcitrant founders stalling or obstructing efforts by the company to raise additional capital if the founderâ€™s right to consent to an amendment is tied to the founderâ€™s continued provision of services such that if a founder was terminated he or she would lose his or her right to consent meanwhile founders should remain wary of provisions of this sort as there is ample precedent of investors forcing founders out of a company in closing parties would be wise to closely scrutinize the language included in financing documents specifically voting agreements which not only affect their rights but also serve as the foundation for the partiesâ€™ relationship in guiding the future of the company the facts of and decision in this case provide a stark example of the reality that while investors and founders generally have interests that are largely aligned each likely seeking to increase maximize and sustain value there also remain significant areas of diverging interests these interests must be
