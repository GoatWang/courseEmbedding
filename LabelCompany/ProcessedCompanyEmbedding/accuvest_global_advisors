portfolioshome charts to watch portfolio notes investing ideas videos highlights links website twitter linkedin july  japan quality qe october   by brad j leave a comment for some time one of our stronger themes has been to buy japanese stocks with the yen hedged an update on this topic seems warranted at this time measured to midoctober of this year a fairly large range of returns can be calculated between the nikkei and the acwi depending on the date used to calculate returns outperformance by the nikkei can be seen as high as  and a similar number can be seen if looking for underperformance by just changing the start date  a currencyhedged etf such as dxj or dbjp has increased the upside and decreased the downside when looking at similar measurement periods as always different stories can be written depending on when return calculations start what really matters is the outlook going forward we believe that improving earnings valuations monetary policy and reforms all point to a strong relative value story tipping in favor of japan japan has seen one of the strongest eps trends of any country in the acwi while they have slowed recently the longerterm growth rate remains around  valuations are attractive on an absolute and relative basis out of a universe of  countries japan has the th lowest price to book ratio x and the th lowest price to cash earnings ratio x relative to history japan has the  ranked value profile japan’s current pe ratio is x lower than its  year average pe ratio lastly japan’s forward pe multiple is trading at a  discount to the msci world the largest discount in  yearsmonetary policy has become one of the most important drivers of stock market outlook while the market has not necessarily rewarded countries with cheap valuations or countries with relatively strong fundamentals it has rewarded countries where the central bank is loose the playbook since the crisis has been to buy stocks on pullbacks in the market where monetary policy is most accommodating that has meant the us for some time has been the stock market to buy on pullbacks with the fed at a key juncture in its policy meaning moving to neutral the bank of japan is the central bank that wears the mantle of most accommodating recent economic data has come in weaker than expected in japan but this will lead to further easing of monetary policy within weeks perhaps this is the stated policy of the abe regime which is actively devaluing the yen in pursuit of inflation the boj is entrenched in policies that will depreciate the currency in order to gain a competitive edge internationally this makes companies more profitable that seems to be a clear outcome whether the boj can engineer an economy that grows consistently at an acceptable rate and breaks a multidecade deflationary cycle is a question with a lessclear answer  as equity investors owning exportoriented companies and hedging that exposure out of jpy into usd is an attractive play the average forecast of  financial institutions is for jpy to move to  over the next year against eur the yen is expected to weaken as well for the japanese economy to recover a depreciation of the yen is a necessary condition while the fed approaches the end of qe the boj will be expanding its balance sheet gaining a relative monetary policy advantage on the reform side of the ledger expectations for more aggressive action should be expected on several fronts tax labor social spending electoral system agriculture immigration and education what should also be of interest to equity investors is the announcement that the government pension investment fund is planning to increase its allocation of domestic equities to  the current allocation is  the increase could drive purchases of up to ¥t of japanese equities other mutual funds that follow the gpif weights could create buying demand double that amount it is also probable that abe delays the raising of the consumption tax that affected the market negatively in the spring based on fundamentals and valuations our call is to have an overweight to japanese stocks in core strategies a weaker yen is part of that outlook as we believe many of the companies in the index will do well given a more competitive stance with a weaker currency typically we would add to the analysis that a potential currency appreciation creates additional return possibilities in the case of japan we do not expect currency appreciation to play out hence our desire to hedge the yen when it comes to owning japanese stocks while there are other ways to do this an etf is our preferred vehicle the ease of purchase the very low cost relative to replicating the strategy independently intraday liquidity and instant diversification all play into the selection dbjp and dxj both fit the bill  we have rotated between the two based on our view of relative value at the sector levels where there are key differences between these two etfs print this piece disclosures this article was compiled by brad jensen a portfolio manager at accuvest global advisors this article is strictly informational and should be used

its overview of energy reform taking place in mexico at that time we mentioned that the reform is a journey and not a destination stating that occasional updates would be necessary to stay plugged into the reform process recent events create the need for such an update what you should know this month legislation to implement energy reforms was approved with the spotlight now on implementation the information that will begin to flow will cover corporate investment and business opportunities and will dwell less on the legislative process regardless of how these opportunities present themselves and whether investors are able to take advantage in direct ways the country of mexico has pushed the ‘go’ button on activity that will create longterm growthenhancing capabilities investment vehicles that could play the benefits of the structure reforms are limited presently certainly for average investors however the mexican equity market as a whole should benefit the peso should see relative strengthening the trajectory in economic growth will tilt further upward and societal benefits will also be seen in a country that has already begun to grow its middleclass further sovereign credit rating upgrades are likely to be seen lowering risk premiums and spreads for mexican bonds some have likened mexico’s energy reform to germany’s reunification in terms of economic impact timing human capital and infrastructure investors should consider the shotgun approach to investing in mexico currently building exposure broadly across mexican asset classes while looking for positive knockon benefits from the ongoing energy reform what you should watch however to stay in front of the curve and to build knowledge and awareness of how the game is evolving the playbook and an understanding of the roster of players a brief overview follows the players secretaría de energía de méxico sener will have the responsibility to select fields and define contracts in the bidding process   the secretariat’s website has video and other material covering recent and future efforts in the reform process secretaría de hacienda y crédito público de méxico the finance ministry will determine the fiscal regime related to any bidding process comisión nacional de hidrocarburos cnh is a technical body dealing with the implementation of mexico’s hydrocarbon policy it will supervise and regulate exploration and production which will include opening the bidding process and awarding contract pemex the state owned petro company established in  whose mission and business model will change significantly going forward cfe the state owned electric utility whose dominance is second only to pemex recent regulatory changes cfe and pemex are now “state productive companies” with budgetary autonomy as well as economic administrative and technological independence both are free to partner with private entities through a process managed by sener cfe can engage in contracts with private companies for the operation of the distribution and transmission network private companies will be able to generate electricity for selfconsumption shcp will slowly migrate from collecting taxes on cfe and pemex to dividends starting in  expropriation of private land will cease land owners will get rent or  of project earnings the mexican government will assume a percentage of the pemex and cfe’s pension liabilities cnh will regulate and grant contracts through auctions in which private and state companies can participate sener will determine the technical conditions of the contracts to be awarded cnh will receive all geological and technical information held currently by pemex private companies can distribute gasoline with impendent franchises in  and import gasoline from  opportunities for foreign investors investors can participate in gasoline commercialization and petroleum gas distribution investors can own up to  of companies dedicated to offshore activities in exploration pipeline construction is possible for foreign investors future steps round  this is what has been happening over the course of  and was essentially wrapped up this month pemex was required to present to sener the economics and technical aspects of the projects they wanted to keep pemex also provided a list of likely private company partnerships pemex requested  of proved reserves  of proved and probable and  of proved probable and possible as well as  of prospective resources sener effectively ended round  by issuing a resolution in which pemex was declared to keep certain projects where they are considered a competitive operator and a list of projects where a private partner could improve production or efficiency of those projects requested pemex has been granted all of the reserves requested which is about  billion proven barrels of oil equivalent boe and  billion boe of possible reserves in the round  disclosure only a small fraction of the prospective resources were awarded to pemex hardly any of those already small prospective resources correspond to deep sea and shale gas fields the lower initial allocation should be seen as a desire for sener to be flexible and allocate broadly to private enterprise round  this round should take place over the remainder of  and into the q’ it is in this round where farmouts and jvs will be announced sener will auction projects in which pemex has solicited or been assigned a private partner this round is unlikely to involve any meaningful transfer of assets as pemex was granted most of the reserves requested already in round  projects that will be farmed out will be the deep sea heavy crude oil in shallow waters and mature fields there are approximately  sites fitting these descriptions that have been identified round  this round is likely to play out in h’ and will focus most attention on the auction process sener cnh and the treasury will auction oil and gas projects in which pemex and private companies can compete headtohead the bidding process currently includes  blocks in exploration and  blocks in production leading to k sqm blocks include fields in deep water extra heavy crude oil and shale resources nearly b pa in additional spending is expected to be invested in the sector over the next six years pemex has been spending about b pa in capex in recent years what you should remember in the country of mexico energy reform will create a significant number of new jobs lower the cost of energy increase the manufacturing competitive advantage ignite a strong infrastructure buildout country wide bring significant foreign investment all adding up to increased economic growth to as much as two percentage points higher it is not just in the energy sector where benefits will be seen but across the entire economy with important benefits to society as a whole investors will find it difficult to uncover any pureplay investment vehicles focused on energy reform however all asset classes should be considered for increased exposure the mexican stock market is not cheap currently but it has always traded at a premium to em and should not discourage longterm investors from building positions mexican sovereign debt should see relative price improvement through spread compression given potential ratingagency upgrades this would include the quasisovereign entities cfe and pemex pemex is currently rated a by moody’s and bbb by both sp and fitch all three services have the credit as “stable” pemex disclosures all abide by us sec standards and most of the usddenominated bonds are eligible for major investment grade indexes a broader base of investors will be holding the bonds going forward corporate credits in mexico also can see spreads narrow much of the fixedincome sector of the market has not seen the improvement yet that can be expected exposure to mxn is also a likely beneficiary of energy reform and should be sought through local fixedincome

incomemexico a country in transition may   by brad j leave a comment we have been traveling regularly to and investing on and off in mexico for over thirty years we have seen the peso strengthen and bust a couple of times governmentowned banks privatized and then bust an ongoing rollercoaster ride in the bolsa through it all we have been big believers in the longterm prospects for the country its economy and financial markets however it is clear that a thoughtful process regarding entry and exit points is required high valuations low on the list in our countryranking methodology we have seen the mexican stock market move around our attractiveness list quite a bit for several quarters however it has been lurking at the bottom of the pack as extremely high valuations relative to its own history as well as to the other thirty countries in our model have kept the market in an unattractive zone which currently means the absolute bottom of our list consider some of the positives and negatives related to mexico in the following tables for some of the reasons shown above on a tactical basis we have been without mexico in our global and international portfolios and actually short in our longshort portfolio there are some interesting headlines however that we are tracking closely energy reform has been talked about for decades but is only recently with the election of the new president enrique peña nieto actually becoming realtiy since  with the creation of the current mexican constitution the government has controlled oil and its derivatives basic petrochemical industries and the generation of electricity in  presidente lazaro cardenas nationalized the entire mexican oil sector this has meant that in practice all profits that are generated from the staterun petroleum agency “pemex” have flowed to the federal budget investments in new technologies required capital expenditure and deep water exploration have been woefully insufficient recent regulation  reform in december historic constitutional amendments were passed laying out the terms under which private companies will be able to bid on energy projects in april the government laid out new proposals implementing regulations to its congress that will dictate how it plans to open up its oil and gas resources for international private investment there are more key dates in the timeline towards eventual implementation the biggest is a special session of congress planned for midjune at which time congress will debate and vote on the regulations that have been put forth a simple majority of  is required for passage regulations will lay out the specifics on bidding rounds contracts tax structures etc there will be additional detail on the different type of profitsharing arrangements companies can use including licenses and productionsharing agreements mexico is showing itself to be very aware of how to compete internationally a  minimum national content threshold will be enforced staring in  both of those variables are considerably friendlier than the brazilian market which was privatized in  an overhaul to the fiscal regime has also been unveiled which is quite progressive and should make investment in mexico’s energy projects more appealing the royalty will be as low as  which will compete aggressively with other international markets the bigger picture check back occasionally as we update the progress on this topic the momentum and outlook is strong what will it mean for the country its markets and investors there are no real direct ways to play this theme via mexican companies in a pure sense there will be positive knockon effects that will be analyzed and assessed for petrochemical cement infrastructure and financial companies the bigger picture has to be seen as quite positive it is hard to forecast precisely but we are seeing research estimating  million new jobs by  gdp could increase by  to  as a result of the reform this kind of activity could translate into higher demand for goods and services emigration to the us could subside in the us the multiplier effect in the energy sector shows one new job created in the oil and gas industry supports four more indirect jobs hopefully that kind of multiplier effect will be seen in mexico government revenues certainly would increase lower energy prices would reduce the need for electricity subsidies and public financial pressures would ease us companies that currently operate in the eagle ford should find it easy to extend their expertise across the border where the same formation flows into mexico the geographic regions of tamaulipas nuevo leon coahuila dallas houston san antonio and the actual border towns could see huge direct investment if these various benefits begin to show themselves as realities the peso could strengthen as well mexico will be a strong candidate for rating agency upgrades print this piece sources bloomberg bbva morgan stanley ubs credit suisse

eis tracks the msci israel index which fits our methodology best and is larger in terms of assets since the june  launch of isra eis has a fractionally higher return which may or may not be important at least we know that the “bluestar israel global index” used in the market vectors implementation has produced similar results we recently traded approximately  eis shares in one block  million in a single print that represented x adv average daily volume and  of the current shares outstanding we were able to buy the block  cents inside the ask price and  bps above the thencurrent inav intraday net asset value as we often say there are no etfs that benefit more from the wrapper than the singlecountry roster there is no way to own israel in such a diversified low cost easilyexecuted way except through an etf and to execute it for size inside the bidask spread with no market impact is exemplary but back to the question as to why we own israel in the first place some highlights from our country ranking model are presented below overall the israeli market could be characterized as fundamentally solid fairly valued with strong momentum and reduced risk headwinds israel’s economic growth has been resilient even amid a period of weak global trade expansion the   number should be replicated in  and  the country has seen a strong start to major natural gas production as production expands it will moderately continue to contribute to growth even larger fields are expected to come online in  providing another significant boost to gdp exports have been volatile but are outperforming in a difficult global environment israel exports are up  while global trade volumes have actually declined by  over the same three year period the current account is in surplus and is growing with more momentum likely as natural gas production expands the country has seen fx reserves triple since  government debt ratios and fiscal deficits have declined the main risk to the country may be the potential strengthening of the currency which would diminish some of the competitive advantages currently in place the bank of israel however has been highly aggressive with its monetary policy lowering base rates bp over  months to  as well as intervening in the fx market and creating a sovereign wealth fund inflation pressures remain very low and considerable flexibility is still afforded to the boi of course there are geopolitical issues in israel the current cabinet remains split on what caused the recent breakdown of palestinianisraeli peace talks clearly some are committed to peace talks while others aren’t ongoing issues are likely in israel as we all can imagine “event risk” is always present when investing in individual countries there may be more likelihood of such events in israel than other countries but nothing currently causes us to back away from the other positives specifically related to the financial markets and as has been the case for ten years we will reevaluate all of these factors every month to the extent that there are changes that cause israel to be less attractive or other countries whose profile improves in a relative sense to give us a more attractive opportunity there can be moves in our rankings and portfolio allocations please check back often to our blog for updates on all of these issues   sources barclays ubs bloomberg print this

get back to em march   by brad j leave a comment global investors have been experiencing an ongoing drag on returns to the extent they have had exposure to emerging market em equities it is difficult to abandon the asset class given historical performance relative economic growth current valuation discounts and portfolio management tenets regarding diversification but the fact that the us has been such a strong performer along with its size and prominence in the press creates questions about why any nonus stocks should even be in the portfolio for experienced investors the real question centers on how to exploit the eventual recovery and what might trigger such a move in this article we attempt to review all of these issues in a shorthand summary fashion the em case ems are too important to ignore with  of the world’s population and  of its income ems have an abundance of natural resources emerging economies have been growing consistently faster than developed markets for a long period of time the emerging consumer is becoming more important with middle class membership increasing substantially in many countries  for instance growth in consumption is far outpacing what is being seen in the us investment spending is outstripping dm and is expected to continue to expand portfolio benefits are compelling with higher longterm returns and diversification benefits em differentiation with the case made for em it then seems counterintuitive to belittle the investment management profession and call the space a contrived asset class yet the differences amongst countries’ fundamentals are considerable currently the fear of tapering and attendant rise in interest rates has created a potential scenario whereby countries with a current account deficit find it difficult to fund their shortfall however there are many em countries with strong external fundamentals – current account surpluses exceptional foreign reserve balances etc  these countries are as cheap as those that have funding issues fundamental and risk metrics are varied amongst all countries and perhaps more so in em  valuations however are universally cheap  on average there is a  point discount in pe’s for em vs dm  china as an example is trading at a  discount to its yr average which is th percentile cheapness to its own history  relative to apxj em is at its th percentile cheapness to its year history em performance triggers and outlooks valuation is a necessary condition for em countries to attract attention and see prices move higher however it is not a great timing tool em needs to see growth outlooks stabilize and the yellenled fed to confirm its accommodative stance  avoiding a currency crisis is paramount  as of now that does not seem to be a problem so we could be very close to a rotation out of what is a relatively expensive us market into countries that have fundamental and valuation profiles that are attractive  the cycles seen historically as em countries gain attention and assert their relative growth advantages can be strong longlasting and highly rewarding  in the spirit of “buy low sell high” there is no doubt that many em countries pass the test of being “low”  investors need a process to select those countries and a commitment to valuebased principles that will produce strong outperformance from current levels click here for a printable version of this post

very interesting quarter comes to a close with significant questions still being debated in the market  most important to strategy that will be described herein are a is the us equity market decline a gardenvariety correction or does it portend something more significant b have interest rates increased too quickly too soon or has a persistent trend only just begun c why are emerging markets underperforming the us so dramatically thus far in  the financial markets can be characterized as usdriven almost entirely  outcomes are highly disparate amongst markets with many showing significantly negative returns  with rates rising and many equity markets negative on the year portfolio performance has been challenging  with six months remaining in  a focused strategy implemented in a disciplined fashion is required make the year a rewarding one  this report will attempt to lay the foundation of what that strategy will look like and on what tenets it will be based rd quarter big picture view filed under investing ideas our q big picture view april   by brad j leave a comment it is important to note some broad highlights as we move into the second quarter of  a growth in europe has disappointed and the euro area remains in its second recession in five years b the most dramatic recent market development has been the sharp depreciation of the yen in the face of the new administration’s insistence on much more stimulative monetary policy c chinese policy makers made modest tightening moves intended to take some steam out of the property markets and credit growth  neutral policy and relatively stable growth with inflation around  means china will stay an engine of growth these nd quarter highlights and more are discussed in our indepth review of the last
