become public until the trial this included scientific data that showed a clear link between risperdal and the condition known as gynecomastia even though they had this information jj knowingly kept this evidence secret hiding it from the fda and burying it from scientific studies the philadelphia jury found that johnson  johnson was guilty of falsifying concealing andor destroying evidence after

workers who were injured in the plant explosion securing them a massive verdict and overcoming the normal limits set by workers’ compensation attorneys kurt arnold kyle findley and kala sellers have won a verdict of  for our clients who were injured and traumatized by the williams olefins plant explosion in  the blast occurred during a  million expansion project which was initiated while operations continued at the plant the ceo and the board of directors were warned that continuing operations would put workers at increased risk but they overruled the safety warnings and ordered that the plant continue operating instead of shutting down for a few months for the expansion project as a result a reboiler overpressurized from the lack of a functioning valve causing an explosion that could be seen for miles our clients were all injured in the blast and were forced to flee the site immediately the event left them with both physical and psychological injuries and they needed compensation to help heal the plant’s owners’ parent company williams companies inc attempted to limit their compensation by placing the blame on williams olefins llc—the holding company for the plant with a vast amount of experience with plant operations arnold  itkin attorneys set out to find the truth after receiving over  documents we found that the pressure relief valve for the reboiler was not opened more importantly we found that the isolated reboiler was the subject of multiple audits and safety warnings—all of which were ignored as the necessary repair was never provided we discovered evidence that the defendants had “substantial certainty” that an explosion would occur under those circumstances as a result our clients could seek compensation beyond the limits set by workers’ compensation the most vital evidence we found however was proof that williams companies inc were the true employers of plant managers and personnel and were in control of daily operations at the site during trial the defendants insisted that they were protected by the statutory employer defense they continued to exclusively blame williams olefins llc which would limit their responsibility for the explosion however after  weeks the jury saw the truth—they awarded a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and found that the plant managers were actually employees of williams companies inc as a result the jury assigned  responsibility to williams companies inc and  to williams olefins llc both were found to have substantial certainty about the inevitability of an explosion and so a sizable award was able to be given to our clients the jury awarded our clients the following shawn thomas  million christopher devall  million eduardo elizondo  and michael danton  the award was made of the
