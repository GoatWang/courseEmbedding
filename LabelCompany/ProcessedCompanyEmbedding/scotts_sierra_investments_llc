originally created in february  the strategy was inspired by a paper written by gary antonacci and available on optimal momentum  antonacci’s book dual momentum investing an innovative strategy for higher returns with lower risk also details dual momentum as a total portfolio strategy my dual etf momentum spreadsheet is available here and the objective is to track four pairs of etfs and provide an “invested” signal for the etf in each pair with the highest relative momentum invested signals also require positive absolute momentum hence the term “dual momentum” allocate smartly today relative momentum is gauged by the  month total returns of each etf the  month total returns of each etf is also compared to a shortterm treasury etf a “cash” filter in the form of ishares barclays  treasury bond etf shy in order to have an “invested” signal the etf with the highest relative strength must also have month total returns greater than the month total returns of shy this is the absolute momentum filter which is detailed in depth by antonacci and has historically helped increase riskadjusted returns an “average” return signal for each etf is also available on the spreadsheet the concept is the same as the month relative momentum however the “average” return signal uses the average of the past   and  “″ month total returns for each etf the “invested” signal is based on the etf with the highest relative momentum for the past   and  months the etf with the highest average relative strength must also have an average  total returns greater than the  total returns of the cash etf portfolio was used to test a similar strategy using the same portfolios and combined momentum score “″  the test results were posted here i also posted an updated test previously using allocate
