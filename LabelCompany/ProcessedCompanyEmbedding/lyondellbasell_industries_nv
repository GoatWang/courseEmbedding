the best known stocks rather they are boring industrial firms that toil in obscurity and supply the lifeblood of a growing world economy many of warren buffetts dividend stocks here fit this description exactly lets take a look at one of the more interesting highyield dividend growth names lyondellbasell to see if this chemical maker may be appropriate for conservative investors looking to live off dividends in retirement business overview founded in  in london lyondellbasell is one of the worlds largest diversified chemical suppliers and refiners the company manufactures various commodity chemicals as well as a number of plastic resins used in many different types of consumer and industrial products source lyondellbasell investor presentation lyondellbasell operates five business units olefins  polyolefins americas olefins  polyolefins asia europe and international eia intermediates  derivatives refining and technology olefins  polyolefins are basically petrochemicals that are turned into polymers such as ethylene polyethylene butadiene polypropylene and other chemicals used to make plastics these chemicals are used in many consumer products and durable goods around the world in addition to producing these valuable chemicals lyondellbasell is also one of the best when it comes to the process of manufacturing them which is why its the worlds leader in licensing olefin catalysts and catalyst production methods as you can see while lyondellbasells business is pretty well diversified the vast majority of its sales and operating profits come from its olefins  polyolefins and intermediate products businesses business segment  of  sales  of  operating income olefins  polyolefins americas   olefins  polyolefins eia   intermediate products   refining   technology   other   total   source  annual report its americas segment is the major cash cow thanks to the us shale boom which is providing lots of cheap natural gas that results in low input and power costs on the flip side refining margins are under pressure due to the worst oil crash in  years which is compressing refining spreads business analysis at first glance lyondellbasells top line is volatile and may make you think the company is in trouble with two straight years of doubledigit sales declines however its important to realize that lyondells sales are naturally volatile because of the cyclical prices of the commodities it produces what you really need to focus on is the companys bottom line which shows strong growth in operating margins and free cash flow per share over time what explains this disconnect remember that lyondells profits are driven by several factors mainly the spread between input costs and its final products for example a major input cost as well as its main source of power for the company is natural gas which it uses to create many of its products meanwhile the final price of its chemicals is often tied to oil prices because competitors in most foreign markets where lyondellbasell ships its products depend on oil rather than natural gas for their production processes so when natural gas prices are low as they have been for nearly a decade thanks to the us fracking revolution and oil prices are high then the companys profits are maximized when oil prices decline the selling price of its products declines as well but so do input costs generally speaking this explains why the companys margins have been far higher and steadier than its volatile sales would have you imagine its all about the natural gasoil spread and we cant forget that as one of the worlds largest specialty chemical manufacturers lyondell enjoys large economies of scale courtesy of its vertically integrated business model you can see that the companys large scale advanced manufacturing technologies which have been developed since the s and costadvantaged assets in the natural gasrich us have resulted in some of the best efficiency in the industry company operating margin net margin return on assets lyondellbasell    industry average    source morningstar lyondell enjoys not only impressive profitability but also generally steady earnings in many different types of oil price and refining margin environments thanks to its efficient operations and spreaddriven business more importantly for dividend investors is the fact that lyondell has proven it can generate consistent free cash flow which is what ultimately pays for secure and growing dividends better yet thanks to the shale revolution and americas massive supply of cheap natural gas the us plastics industry is poised for solid growth in the coming decades thats due to a growing world population and rising wealth in developing markets which creates higher demand for plastics over time you can see that per capita consumption of chemicals plastics and fuels in major markets such as china and india significantly lags western nations today as these large countries continue to modernize even a small increase in polyethylene demand per capita will require new industry capacity in fact lyondellbasell notes in its annual report that current demand forecasts call for about  new worldscale pe plants through   just to meet projected demand source lyondellbasell annual report another factor benefiting the domestic market is that foreign competitors cannot compete as effectively with us producers since their input costs are higher remember foreign producers do not benefit from the glut of cheap natural gas in the us as a result between  and  us global plastic exports are projected to more than double from  billion a year to  billion and lyondellbasell is poised to be one of the main beneficiaries of this trend however perhaps the biggest reason to like lyondell is that its management has proven itself to be the most shareholderfriendly of any company in its industry you can see that lyondellbasell has returned a greater percentage of its capital to shareholders over the last five years than major rivals such as dupont nysedd dow chemical nysedow and celanese nysece that includes a substantial buyback program which has reduced the share count by  in just the past four years these share repurchases have helped to boost fcf per share keep the dividend payout ratio healthy and allow for strong yet still safe dividend increases despite its high capital returns management continues investing for the future for example lyondellbasell currently has two major projects its working on representing about  billion in growth capex that it expects to generate  ebitda margins and increase overall ebitda by about  million  in the coming years key risks while lyondellbasell has a lot going for it there are two major risks to consider first at the end of the day lyondellbasell still operates in a commodity business one in which its ultimate margins are set largely by the market in other words there is only so much efficiency and cost cutting that management can squeeze out of operations to control the companys profits many of the biggest drivers are simply out of managements control the two most important things that will impact the companys margins are natural gas prices and oil prices this is because lyondells most important product is ethylene which is made from the natural gas liquid ethane in recent years high oil prices meant that us ethylene producers saw record profits this is because high oil prices resulted in very high naphtha prices an oilbased plastic input that competes with ethylene meanwhile record us natural gas production resulted in a massive glut of ethane resulting in very low input costs and swelling profit margins the gradually growing world economy also kept demand trends stable creating a very favorable supplyanddemand balance in the industry especially for us producers however in recent years these low ethane prices have caused a boom in gulf coast petrochemical plants as companies attempt to take advantage of the profitable opportunity to create some of the worlds cheapest petrochemicals and export them overseas where prices are much higher this means that ethane prices are likely to rise over time as demand catches up to supply while persistently low oil prices could mean that lyondell faces lower margins for several years as they say in commodity markets high prices tend to cure high prices you can see that global ethylene capacity dark blue bars below is expected to increase substantially over the next five years pressuring operating rates grey line over the medium term if demand blue line for these commodity chemicals were to unexpectedly drop during this period of capacity expansion then the industrys supplyanddemand balance could really be thrown out of whack in this scenario which would occur if there was another recession there would be severe price pressure on these capitalintensive debtburdened manufacturers including lyondellbasell looking to fill their expensive plants rightsizing capacity in capitalintensive industries is very difficult and can take years of time companies have invested hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars into their plants and are reluctant to take them offline or shutter them next be aware that much of lyondells aggressive pace of buybacks has been financed by debt as the company took advantage of the lowest interest rates in history this has resulted in steadily rising debt levels over the last few years given that interest rates could rise from here the companys rate of buybacks and thus eps growth will likely slow in the future and we cant forget that in the event of a major economic downturn such as  highly leveraged capitalintensive industries can face major hurdles or even bankruptcy in fact lyondellbasell which was formed by the  billion acquisition of lyondell chemical by basell in  ended up filing for chapter  bankruptcy in  as demand for its products from industrial customers collapsed and the company was saddled with too much debt now in fairness to the company it emerged from bankruptcy in  and its debt levels more on this later are nowhere near the levels that sunk the company all those years ago still given the cyclical nature of the industry shareholders will want to keep a close eye on lyondells debt levels in the future because they make up an integral component of the dividends safety profile lyondellbasells dividend safety we analyze  years of dividend data and  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend our dividend safety score answers the question is the current dividend payment safe we look at some of the most important financial factors such as current and historical eps and fcf payout ratios debt levels free cash flow generation industry cyclicality roic trends and more dividend safety scores range from  to  and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least  since tracking the data companies cutting their dividends had an average dividend safety score below  at the time of their dividend reduction announcements lyondellbasells dividend safety score of  suggesting its dividend is generally safe and dependable and certainly one of the most secure in its industry since emerging from bankruptcy in  you can see that lyondellbasell has paid steadily rising dividends while industry conditions have admittedly been very favorable during this time period the key to lyondell having such a secure dividend is twofold as you can see management has been careful to maintain conservative payout ratios around  to  both in terms of eps and fcf this helps provide a large cushion in case profit margins and sales decline such as during the next inevitable economic recession in addition despite the rising debt levels of the last few years lyondell still maintains a strong balance sheet with low leverage ratios a very strong current ratio and a high interest coverage ratio the companys debt maturity profile is nicely spaced out only  billion of longterm debt is due before  and lyondellbasell also notes it has  billion in available liquidity it can tap given the highly capitalintensive nature of this industry to truly understand the strength of lyondells balance sheet we need to compare its debt levels to those of its peers as you can see lyondellbasells leverage ratio is about half that of its rivals while its interest coverage ratio and strongerthanaverage current ratio earn it an investmentgrade credit rating company debt  ebitda ebitda  interest debt  capital current ratio sp credit rating lyondellbasell     bbb industry average  na   na sources morningstar fastgraphs this means that lyondells cash flow is more than sufficient to service its debt pay its generous  dividend and still leave plenty of flexibility to grow lyondellbasells dividend growth our dividend growth score answers the question how fast is the dividend likely to grow it considers many of the same fundamental factors as the safety score but places more weight on growthcentric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios scores of  are average  or higher are very good and  or lower are considered weak lyondellbasells dividend growth score of  suggests that that shareholders can expect better than average payout growth in the future as you can see the companys dividend has increased at a fast pace in recent years compounding by  annually over the last three years just be aware that those impressive dividend growth rates are unlikely to continue in the future thats because the companys eps and fcf growth rate going forward is likely to be much smaller than in the past when the oilnatural gas price ratio higher is better for profits soared to unprecedented levels from  to  between  and  and industry operating rates expanded earnings and free cash flow per share seem more likely to grow at a midsingledigit rate over the long term and the companys dividend is likely to grow at similar rates however thats a good thing as management isnt likely to want to push the fcf payout ratio above  and risk its dividend safety going forward valuation over the past year lyondell has greatly underperformed the market staying close to flat while the sp  has generated a return near  today lybs stock trades at a forward pe ratio of  a large discount to the sp s forward pe ratio of  and offers a dividend yield of  which is higher than the stocks fiveyear average dividend yield of  when something looks too good to be true it usually is in this case the market appears to be pricing in expectations that lybs earnings which have perhaps been inflated over the past year with tight supplyanddemand and a favorable oilgas spread could be set for a decline over the medium term with that said if one assumes lyondellbasells earnings per share can still grow at a midsingledigit rate over the long term todays valuation doesnt seem unreasonable in fact the stock has potential to deliver longterm annual total returns of  to   dividend yield plus  to  annual earnings growth about in line with the markets historical  annual return since  however the path certainly wont be linear given the industrys volatile characteristics perhaps making lyb a less desirable income choice for conservative investors seeking capital preservation and steadier returns concluding thoughts on lyondellbasell industries i tend to shy away from almost all commodity companies especially those with high debt loads capitalintensive operations and dependence on uncontrollable macro factors however even despite its bankruptcy in  lyondellbasell seems like an interesting enough business to keep on my watch list i like its exposure to lowcost natural gas in the us the efficiency of its assets its healthy balance sheet the shareholderfriendly management team and the secular growth of plastics over the coming decades finding a safe growing dividend that offers a  yield is no small task in todays market either however i still cant get myself to really consider buying the stock today at least not in one of the more concentrated dividend growth portfolios i oversee i worry that the boom years in terms of earnings and dividend growth could be behind the company as new industry supply enters the market over the coming years challenging todays tight operating rates and favorable margins if demand were to unexpectedly slow during this time the stock could really get hammered and perhaps become really interesting for valuefocused income investors despite many of its favorable qualities lyondellbasell is still a rather volatile stock that is sensitive to many factors outside of its control conservative income investors with more concentrated dividend portfolios might consider these  other high dividend stocks while they continue watching lyb for an even better pitchabout this

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
