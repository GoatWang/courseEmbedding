statements                andes  inc    notes to condensed financial statements unaudited          description of business and history   description of business  andes  inc the “company” was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on july   and has been inactive since inception the company intends to serve as a vehicle to affect an asset acquisition merger exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business      summary of significant policies   the accompanying unaudited financial statements of the company have been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission requirements for interim financial statements therefore they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for complete financial statements the financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements in our form k filed february     the interim financial statements present the balance sheet statements of operations and cash flows for the company the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states   the interim financial information is unaudited in the opinion of management all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position as of september   and the results of operations and cash flows presented herein have been included in the financial statements all such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature interim results are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for the full year   use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities these estimates and judgments are based on historical information information that is currently available to the company and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and shortterm investments with original maturities of less than  days cash equivalents are placed with high credit quality financial institutions and are primarily in money market funds the carrying value of those investments approximates fair value   revenue recognition  revenue is only recognized when all of the following criteria are met  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured                  earnings loss per share  basic earnings loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been issued there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the periods presented   stockbased compensation  the company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” asc  compensation – stock compensation and the conclusions reached by fasb asc  equity – equitybased payments to nonemployees costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable the value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by fasb asc    income taxes  the company records income taxes under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards accounting standards regarding income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized accordingly the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on a morelikelythannot realization threshold this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryforward periods the company’s experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives   the company recorded valuation allowances on the net deferred tax assets management will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets based on the accounting standards for income taxes each reporting period to the extent that the financial results of operations improve and it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable the company will be able to reduce the valuation allowance   significant judgment is required in evaluating the company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain accounting standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than  likely based solely on the technical merits of being sustained on examinations the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes                  recent accounting pronouncements  the company has evaluated recent pronouncements through accounting standards updates “asu”  and believes that none of them will have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows    going concern     the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has incurred losses since inception and had accumulated deficit of  as of september   the company requires capital for its contemplated operational activities the company’s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown the obtainment of additional financing the successful development of the company’s contemplated plan of operations and its transition ultimately to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the company to continue operations the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements of the company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties   in order to mitigate the risk related with this uncertainty the company plans to issue additional shares of common stock for cash and services during the next  months    stockholders’ equity   preferred stock  the company is authorized to issue  shares of  par value preferred stock as of september   no shares of preferred stock had been issued   common stock   the company is authorized to issue  shares of  par value common stock as of september    shares were issued and outstanding   upon formation of the
