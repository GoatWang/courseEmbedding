held for nontrading purposes for which it is practicable to estimate that value   cash and cash equivalents investments availableforsale and cash held in escrow the carrying amount approximates fair value   mortgage notes payable the partnership adopted fasb asc  – “fair value measurements” for financial assets and liabilities  asc  defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements  asc  applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements accordingly the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of reported balances   as permitted we chose not to elect the fair value option as prescribed by asc  – “financial instruments” – including an amendment of asc  – “investments – debt and equity securities” for our financial assets and liabilities that had not been previously carried at fair value  therefore we did not elect to fair value any additional items under asc    the estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies  however considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value  consequently the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would be paid in a current market exchange  the following are financial instruments for which the partnership’s estimate of fair value differs from the carrying amounts     at june     at march       carrying amount   fair value   carrying amount   fair value   liabilities                         mortgage notes                             for the mortgage notes fair value is calculated using present value cash flow models based on a discount rate  it was determined that the tender option bond market through which these bonds have been securitized in the past continued to see a dramatic slowdown with limited liquidity and significantly reduced transaction levels  to assist in valuing these notes the partnership held separate discussions with various third party investment banks who are leaders in the municipal bond business  the discussions produced assumptions that were based on market conditions as well as the credit quality of the underlying property partnerships which held the mortgage notes to determine what discount rates to utilize                      independence tax credit plus lp ii and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements june   unaudited   note  – sale of properties   the partnership is in the process of developing a plan to dispose of all of its investments  as of june   the partnership has sold its limited partnership interests in two local partnerships  there can be no assurance as to when the partnership will dispose of its remaining investments or the amount of proceeds which may be received  however based on the historical operating results of the local partnerships and the current economic conditions including changes in tax laws it is unlikely that the proceeds from such sales received by the partnership will be sufficient to return to the limited partners their original investments  all gains and losses on sales are included in discontinued operations   on march   the partnership sold its limited partnership interest in tasker village associates “tasker” to an affiliate of the local general partner for a sales price of   the partnership did not receive any cash from this sale after the repayment of other liabilities of   the sale resulted in a gain of approximately  resulting from the writeoff of the deficit basis in the local partnership of the same amount at the date of the sale which was recorded during the year ended march    an adjustment to the gain of approximately  was recorded during the quarter ended june   resulting in an overall gain of approximately   in addition the sale resulted in a noncash contribution to the local partnership from i the general partner of approximately  as a result of the writeoff of fees owed by the local partnership to an affiliate of the general partner and ii the local general partners of approximately  as a result of the writeoff of fees owed by the local partnership to the local general partner

liabilities exceeded assets by  and for the three months ended june   incurred a net loss of  including gain on sale of properties of   these factors raise substantial doubt about the partnership’s ability to continue as a going concern as discussed in note  partnership management fees of approximately  will be payable out of sales or refinancing proceeds only to the extent of available funds after payments on all other partnership liabilities have been made and after the limited partners have received a  return on their capital contributions  as such the general partner cannot demand payment of these deferred fees beyond the partnership’s ability to pay them  in addition where the partnership has unpaid partnership management fees related to sold properties such management fees are written off and recorded as capital contributions   all of the mortgage payable balance of  and the accrued interest payable balance of  is of a nonrecourse nature and secured by the respective properties  the partnership is currently in the process of developing a plan to dispose of all of its investments  historically the mortgage notes and accrued interest thereon have been assumed by the buyer in instances of sales of the partnership’s interest or have been paid off from sales proceeds in instances of sales of the property  in most instances when the partnership’s interest was sold and liabilities were assumed the partnership recognized a gain from the sale  the partnership owns the limited partner interest in all its investments and as such has no financial responsibility to fund operating losses incurred by the local partnerships  the maximum loss the partnership would incur is its net investment in the respective local partnerships  dispositions of any investment in a local partnership should not impact the future results of operations liquidity or financial condition of the partnership   the partnership has working capital reserves of approximately  at june    such amount is considered sufficient to cover the partnership’s day to day operating expenses excluding fees to the general partner for at least the next year  the partnership’s operating expenses excluding the local partnerships’ expenses and related party expenses amounted to approximately  for the three months ended june     management believes the above mitigating factors enable the partnership to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   b subsidiary partnerships – going concern   mansion court associates “mansion court” mansion court had a net loss of  for the three months ended march    mansion court has sustained operating losses over the years and has not generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its obligations  the local general partner has provided funding in the past years however there is no obligation to do so  the property also has experienced a high number of vacancies due to deteriorating conditions in the area  as of december   the project had  out of  vacant units  vacancies continue to increase due to declining conditions in the surrounding neighborhood and the expenditure of funds at this time to make improvements would not benefit the project  the local general partner is exploring options to mitigate increased crime and deteriorating neighborhood conditions  these options include assistance from local government housing agencies and could include transfer of ownership   the partnership’s investment in mansion court at june   and march   was reduced to zero as a result of prior years’ losses and the noncontrolling interest balance was  at each date  mansion court’s net loss after noncontrolling interest amounted to approximately  and  for the three months ended june   and  respectively   c uninsured cash and cash equivalents   the partnership maintains its cash and cash equivalents in various banks  the accounts at each bank are guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation up to    d cash distributions   cash distributions from the local partnerships to the partnership are restricted by the provisions of the respective agreements of limited partnership of the local partnerships andor the us department of housing and urban development   e property management fees   property management fees incurred by the local partnerships amounted to  and  for the three months ended june   and  respectively  of these fees  and  were earned by affiliates of the local general partners which include  and  of fees relating to discontinued operations   f other   the partnership is subject to the risks incident to potential losses arising from the management and ownership of improved real estate  the partnership can also be affected by poor economic conditions generally however no more than  of the properties are located in any single state there are also substantial risks associated with owning properties receiving government assistance for example the possibility that congress may not appropriate funds to enable hud to make rental assistance payments hud also restricts annual cash distributions to partners based on operating results and a percentage of the owner’s equity contribution the partnership cannot sell or substantially liquidate its investments in
