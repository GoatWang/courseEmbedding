most profitable video games of all time techinsider apple inc aapl is a ‘buy’ ahead of new product launches charles payne  by sean johnson on august   companies inside tech tech apple inc nasdaqaapl is going to launch much awaited iphone  next month according to the reports answering the question about apple’s stock and whether it is a ‘buy’ or not in a program on fox business charles payne said that apple is a ‘buy’ because after the new product launches it will regain its charm and touch new heights payne also said that the latest reports of new ipads can also give a lift to the apple stock but apple must be vigilant about the cannibalization because of two product releases he said that apple inc nasdaqaapl does not normally come up the to the hypes of the media “i do think apple inc nasdaqaapl is a ‘buy’ i am an apple inc nasdaqaapl our subscribers are an apple and apple has reclaimed some of that charm … i think when this thing gets over a hundred bucks it’s going to regain some of that legendary status …” said payne payne said that there is no news so far about the apple inc nasdaqaapl’s tv and apple has probably delayed this product because of new iphone  and tablet releases he also said that a bigger version of iphone  will likely deplete the ipad sales because the phablet version of iphone  will serve the purpose for which ipads are bought fbn’s tracy byrnes said that apple cannibalizes the sales very often and keeps its customers waiting for the new products she said that tim cook has a strategy of not releasing apple inc nasdaqaapl products at once to keep the customers waiting and excited about the upcoming releases she also said that there is a high chance that the bigger version of iphone  will be released after the smaller version disclosure
