sfaith age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  i didnt know what to first expect when i started reading walking into walls blind spots that block gods work in you was it selfhelp is it a motivational what blind spots are we even talking about but as i begun to read through stephen arterburns book i was impressed by not just the style of writing which was very laid back and conversational always a good thing but although this like any book is never a substitute for actual face to face therapy that is beneficial to work through whatever is on ones heart walking into walls blind spots that block gods work in you really helps begin the first steps toward identifying the walls that we can put up in our lives that not only hinder a productive healthy living and relationships in our lives but can also hinder our walk with god now does any of this sound like part of us or all of us  stubborn resistance andor  arrogant entitlement andor  justifiable resentment andor  disconnected isolation andor  blind ignorance maybemaybe not walking into walls blind spots that block gods work in you isnt a book that is either condemning or difficult the reality is that  we all have currently or may experience at some point in our livesone or all of these blind spots and what stephen arterburn does is with gentle guidance encouraging anecdotes that help us see how these walls can blind us without knowing and even understanding through scripture really helps the reader no matter how small or big the circumstances in their lives deal with these walls that we put up in our lives currently the book is available in hardback and there is a study guide for readers to work at their own pace or with a study group and readers will find that the book is very easy reading yet conveys a very powerful message that we dont have to be held back by past experiences that contribute to the walls and blind spots that we carry into our present and sometimes into our futures i like the illustrations that stephen arterburn makes blending both scripture and pop culture that really helps us identify with the examples he conveys about the walls that are built up and with them the blind spots that can keep us from seeing what holds us captive and at the same time allowing god to do the dynamic work he wants to do with us and give us the future he has planned as shared i started this book out with hesitation due to its easy to try to offer easy solutions that are not often applicable to hard situations and walking into walls doesnt do this nor does this promise to fix your life your car your relationships but instead is about getting to the beginning steps that are needed to move forward in ones life the interesting thing is that there is a realization that we all carry walls and blind spots in our lives that either we maybe aware of or just try to conveniently ignore and with the writing style of stephen arterburn he really helps break down ways we can discover those walls and blind spots without it being a log confrontation the reading is in itself just a  pages with the study guide that is included taking up a good half of the other book but from the study guide itself its both a mixture of using scripture for reference and growth as a christian and selfdiscovery at the same time the book makes then for not only a good personal time reading but when read in a group study a great character growth journey with others who may feel like they are stuck in the same patterns it really opens up to questions we may have about feeling insecure maybe dealing with past issues just being brave to take on new directions in life for all the hesitations i had going into the book initially i came out of it really finding this to be for a short book very impressive its very impressive because there are things in all of us that we can work onnot to be perfect which is not possible or even healthy to try to attain but so we can keep moving forward into having positive healthy relationships and lives stephen arterburns writing is emotional he writes to connect with the reader and to speak directly to them and he definitely achieves that in walking into walls while at the same time you get that feeling of oh wow he does get it which many of times there are those who do need to just hear that not to be fixed or lectured but to knowpeople do understand and the book achieves it on that level on another level walking into walls helps bring a better understanding of how our experiences can both help and also hinder us and how to not let it become traps that keeps us in a bondage of bitternessdenial lies and blindness that affects all areas of our lives and how we interact with other people and just how it can affect our own journeys the steps that are provided are very practical and down to earth stephen arterburn doesnt share anything that would seem impossiblebut rather very plausible and workable so overall walking into walls is great reading really for anyone who finds themselves feeling stagnant in their lives or maybe finding themselves either physically or mentally repeating unhealthy habits and actions that are keeping them from moving forward was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate gloria thompson maryland  stars out of  a great writing for understanding

gibson june  follow caitjgibson stephen king in paris in   francois moriap — it doesn’t take much to provoke president trump into blocking a follower on twitter — anything from an insult to an unflattering gif to a mild “covfefe” joke seems enough to do the trick so it perhaps shouldn’t come as a surprise that bestselling author stephen king was abruptly added to the blockedbytrump list tuesday the horror fiction maestro has been one of trump’s most consistent and creative twitter critics since well before the november election “a trump presidency scares me more than anything else” he told ron charles editor of the washington post’s book world during a facebook live interview in september “i’m terrified that he’ll become president” stephen king trolls trump’s wiretapping tweets as only a horror writer could trump of course did exactly that — and king continued to offer outspoken condemnation and sometimes outright mockery in response to trump’s twitter missives that is until tuesday when king announced that he had apparently been blocked from viewing the president’s tweets trump has blocked me from reading his tweets i may have to kill myself — stephen king stephenking june   the tipping point appeared to be a couple of pointed barbs aimed at the president’s cabinet and his daughter ivanka trump if ivanka trump had grown up in farm country like some of us shed know her father is reaping exactly what he sowed — stephen king stephenking june   but it didn’t take long for another prominent trump critic and literary icon to come to the rescue bestselling author jk rowling promised that she would keep king informed of the president’s tweets i still have access ill dm them to you httpstcomhibeydbtg — jk rowling jkrowling june   despite his dramatic initial tweet king was quick to note that he wasn’t actually despondent for many in fact being blocked by trump — a phenomenon that has inspired a trending hashtag — is something of a mark of pride among leftleaning twitter critics who make a point to respond directly to many of trump’s tweets some consider being blocked as a sign of success their words were getting through and their messages effectively bothered the president or at least someone monitoring his account good grief its actually happened mr thinskin strikes again pictwittercompqskkrfa — mike p williams mikepwilliams may   they made it their mission to talk back to trump on twitter but is anyone listening others though have found the abrupt cutoff more disturbing hours before king was barred from viewing trump’s tweets the president’s realdonaldtrump account blocked votevets a progressive advocacy group that claims to represent more than  veterans military families and supporters the group had decried trump’s proposed travel ban which limits travel from six predominately muslim countries as “unconstitutional immoral” and a national security threat the commander in chief can block votevets the voice of k military veterans and families but we will not be silenced pictwittercomsacnhkur — votevets votevets june   sad that our draft deferring commander in chief is unwilling to hear the voice for over  veterans votevets httpstcotbbbdgaga — ted lieu tedlieu june   some have questioned whether it is unconstitutional for a commander in chief to prevent certain members of the american public from seeing his public communications this month the knight first amendment institute sent a letter to the president arguing that blocking twitter users because of their opinions was a violation of the first amendment holly oreilly a snarky twitter critic of president donald trump got blocked by him online she says its a stcentury violation of free speech adriana userothe washington post is realdonaldtrump violating the first amendment by blocking some twitter users as for king the development caught him so off guard that he first questioned whether it was a hoax but even if it wasn’t he assured rowling in a tweet that he’d be okay “i’ll always have pence” thanks maybe its a hoax im good either way ill always have pence hahahaha — stephen king stephenking june   read more how getting

information on a bim project this class will present how project teams can collaborate to develop information on a bim project we will initially look at setting up a plan of work to give clarity on which team members are delivering what information and when following this we will look at how designers can develop their designs using standardised bim objects in revit practical examples will then be given on how to link these objects digitally to the associated specification to better coordinate this information and reduce risk we will finish by exploring the role of the cloud and big data in future workflows and show practical examples of how the forge platform can accelerate this stephen was part of the team that developed the uk government’s bim level  standards and tools as director of research and innovation at nbs he has been fundamental in developing the products that led to nbs being the first uk autodesk solution associate in      collin van kooten solibri or navisworks collaboration in construction is challenging how can you organise the quality in data and geometry with all these different parties and models which software do you use to check your model navisworks or solibri an ifc workflow with solibri provides you with insights into the different clashes and the possibility to check in a rulebased manner but how do you create reports and collaborate with team members does navisworks manage a better workflow with more possibilities for everybody with navisworks you are free of file format it is easy to append and update revit ifc rcp or dwg files to a federated model in a single file check model geometry duplicates and data in a standardised way with collaborea the rulebased model checker for navisworks a report is no longer necessary because all the issues are visible and editable on a cloud platform using autodesk forge checking and collaborating becomes easy and editing the models in an autodesk workflow is simple     adam nagy what the
