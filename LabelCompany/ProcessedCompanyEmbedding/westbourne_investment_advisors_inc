current newsletter homephilosophyinvestment processasset managementour teamadvisory boardcontact uscurrent newsletter“the sources of deflation are not a mystery deflation is in almost all cases a side effect of a collapse of aggregate demand…a drop in spending so severe that producers must cut prices on an ongoing basis in order to find buyers…the basic prescription for preventing deflation is straightforward at least in principle use monetary and fiscal policy as needed to support aggregate spending in a manner as nearly consistent as possible with full utilization of economic resources and low and stable inflation in other words the best way to get out of trouble is not to get into it in the first place” ben bernanke“if inflation is the genie then deflation is the ogre that must be fought decisively”  imf director christine lagardeus equity markets  ignoring the speed bumpswhile there were numerous stories dominating headlines in q very few had any impact on the equity markets’ continued gradual ascension the federal reserve hiking of interest rates had no impact other than a flattening of the yield curve which created a decline in longterm rates testimony by the exfbi director on being fired and calls for ‘impeachment’ korean firing of ballistic missiles and numerous terrorist attacks in the uk and france had no impact conclusion the us economy is strong and the financial system is extremely healthy as discussed belownot all came up roses in q there was a continued drubbing of oil prices as opec failed to implement further production cuts which caused most stocks in the oil sector to trade down in addition the new york fed estimated that the current gdp growth is  well below its goal of  and president trump’s goal of  lastly news of amazon’s intention to acquire whole foods rippled through an alreadybattered retail sector causing investors to fear anything retailrelated be it grocery apparel automotive replacement stores and drugstores the fear with these retailers is a slow death of their business models from price deflation which is one of the dragons which the federal reserve seeks to slay and is in our view one of the most significant threats to the ebullient stock market we discuss this below as welldespite these positives and negatives the overall stock market valuation remains inexpensive especially when compared to alternatives ie fixed income commercial real estate and we continue to identify individual equities which trade at significant discounts to intrinsic valueprice deflation – the doubleedged in  as a freshman at virginia tech in engineering i was required to purchase an ibm portable pc for  the memory and processing power kb ram intel  mhz weight  lbs could be replicated today for less than  long distance calls were  minute vs sub now consider the cost of uber relative to a comparable taxi fare these are classic examples of deflation  contrast this with such inflationary costs of education healthcare autos concert tickets and housingwhile deflation benefits the consumer by increasing their purchasing power it is generally a negative for business retailers increase sales and gain operating leverage by i selling more units at ii higher prices than prior periods however if a retailer sells  more units at  lower prices sales are flat and it is unlikely that profits increase unless they are able to attain leverage from technological efficiency and or lower wages even if they are successful with such improvements unless pricing power improves such earnings growth will be shortlived technological efficiency is the primary reason we have witnessed so little inflation as measured by the consumer price index cpi and wage inflation over the last few years automation replacing headcountthe pain of deflation has hit the economics of a number of businesses quite significantly kroger recently announced that food deflation had crushed its already low operating margins macy’s indicated that its ability to raise prices on apparel and items such as handbags resulted in lower earnings and a number of layoffs best buy reduced its inventory of cds drastically and i recently purchased a cd there for  which had once priced at  molson coors indicated that beer pricing had declined causing the company to reduce earnings estimates amazoncom has been one driver of this deflation with its superior model of goods distribution and recently announced that it was entering the grocery business by purchasing whole foods again this will bode well for the consumer’s purchasing power but likely at the expense of the profits of kroger albertsons and safewaywhile the above seems quite negative we believe that not all retailers are doomed by the likes of deflation the business model of the “dollar stores” such as dollar tree seems to be able to withstand the online threats of amazoncom and walmartcom given the low purchase price of their items cvs a retailer with a pharmacy and a pbm pharmacy benefit manager also has a business model which we believe is intact and yet the valuation assumes the worst x cash earningsthoughts of inflation often conjures up negative images of the hyperinflation which occurred during the s nixon carter administrations  in  and  in  which put a crunch on the wealth and purchasing power of all americans however moderate inflation is actually a positive as it does not significantly impair purchasing power a bright note is recent commentary by the fed that they believe moderate inflation will continue “on a month basis inflation has declined recently and like the measure excluding food and energy prices is running somewhat below expected to remain somewhat below  in the near term but to stabilize around the committee’s  objective over the medium term”banks too big to fail quite the contrary  too profitable to retain capital…the most significant occurrence in q was the federal reserve’s annual stress test on the capital of the ”bank holding companies bhcs” aka financial institutions that are “too big to fail” recall that the fundamental bank model is to employ bankowned capital and using the liabilities customer deposits to fund the assets client loans mortgages and use this capital to cover any losses which occur from loan defaultsin  the banking crisis decimated the excess capital held by the bhcs resulting in the financial crisis a plunge of the stock market bailouts and  billion of penalties and lawsuits levied on the bhcs for bad behavior in the interim the fed imposed significantly higher capital requirements on the bhcs and the majority of earnings of the last  years have been retained by these institutions in order to increase capital reservesfor the first time in  years the fed approved the stress tests of all the bhcs tests that assumed certain dire scenarios and determined the capital adequacy of the bhcs in layman terms the fed said “all of you bhcs are strong enough to withstand another shock like  and you now have our permission to return excess capital to shareholders via stock repurchases and dividend increases” this is a huge change of tone citigroup doubled its dividend bank of america morgan stanley jp morgan all announced multibillion dollar buybacks and dividend increasesthe subtle point is this the financial infrastructure is much stronger than ever and capitalism is tan rested and ready we own a handful of the financials and believe they remain undervalued with significant growth opportunities ahead of themconcluding thoughtsdespite all of the speed bumps which the markets witnessed in the second quarter we maintain constructive on both the valuations of us equities and shortterm bonds as warranted the federal reserves “annual stress test checkup” of the banks indicated that the us financial system has healed and is in good shape which removes one of the bearish cases of a general market decline while we are concerned with the impact of deflation on some companies particularly those with slower growth we seek to identify companies with economic moats to protect them from such pressureswe wish you a happy summer and look forward to hearing from you with any
