over to hal harold van wart thank you sujal good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us on the call today i would like to update you on the progress that we have made on our two clinical programs let me begin with arhalofenate program since our last quarterly call we have delivered significant new clinical data in this program and are now able to describe what we believe to be an exciting new path forward arhalofenate is being developed for the treatment of gout the two primary goals of gout therapy are the lower serum uric acid and to prevent and retreat flares with regard to the serum uric acid approximately  of gout patients or about  million people in the us are unfortunately not able to reach their goal of less than  mgdl on the commonly used uric acid lowering therapies allopurinol or febuxostat moreover because these therapies paradoxically make flares worse or at least the first six months there is significant noncompliance for the american college of rheumatology recommendations this il ult and this flare problem can be addressed in some patients with colchicine prophylaxis colchicine however is counter indicated in over  of gout patients and is generally not well tolerated with the high non compliance rate with regard to flaring approximately  million gout patients experienced little more flares per year in spite of current therapy thus there remains a significant unmet medical need in gout patients first for more effective serum uric acid lowering and second for better flare control we believe that our lead product candidate arhalofenate can address both of these unmet needs because it has two activities in the same molecule arhalofenate lower serum uric acid by blocking the reabsorption of uric acid in the kidney by the urate transporter urat this urate in fact increases excretion of uric acid into the urine and thereby lower serum uric acid levels arhalofenate also has an inherent antiinflammatory activity it blocks the urate crystal induced production of il data preventing the trigger for gout flares this dual mechanism differentiates it from all available and emerging treatments for gout and defines what we believe to be a new class of therapy which we refer to as urate lowering antiflare therapy or ulaft since the beginning of this year we have announced data from the last two of the total of five completed gout studies that provide clinical evidence to support both of these actions first we have shown that arhalofenate can address the need for additional serum uric acid lowering in january we announced results from our phase  study of arhalofenate at six and  milligrams administrated in combination with febuxostat at  or  milligrams in patients with gout the minimum goal of treatment has reduced serum uric acid levels to below  mgdl however for patients with tophaceous gout there is a need to more quickly eliminate tissue deposits of crystals and a need patient target of below five or even four are desirable the combination of  milligrams of febuxostat with  milligrams of arhalofenate produced serum uric acid responder rate of  and  for the six and  mgdl targets respectively in combination with the higher  mg dose of febuxostat responder rate of   and  were achieved for the goals of six five and  mgdl respectively these responder rate data show that the arhalofenatefebuxostat combination therapy is striking and effective in getting gout patients to their serum uric acid target goal the use of combination therapy for patients to confidently achieve treatment goal will be an important component of our development strategy and i will return to that in a moment a second important result from this study was the demonstration that the serum uric acid lowering contributed by the uricosuric activity of arhalofenate was produced in a safe manner this is reflected by the observation that the increases in fractional excretion of uric acid produced by arhalofenate are gradual with low intraday variations that do not exceed the normal range a property that we believe explains arhalofenates lack of demonstrated renal toxicity earlier this month we announced the results of our phase b flare study that confirmed that arhalofenate has antiflare activity and can address the unmet need for better flare control this randomized doubleblind active and placebocontrolled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of arhalofenate for reducing gout flares in  patients that had experienced three or more flares in the prior year the study met its primary endpoint of demonstrating a reduction of  in flare rate for the arhalofenate  mg group compared to allopurinol with the highly statistically significant p value of  arhalofenate also showed a reduction of  of flare rate relative to placebo which was also statistically significant this is the first study to show that arhalofenate produces reductions in flares without concomitant dosing of colchicine in serum uric acid lowering observed for arhalofenate in this study was somewhat lower than allopurinol and we do not intend to position arhalofenate to replace allopurinol in responders mainly those patients who can achieve the serum uric acid goal on allopurinol however this incremental serum uric acid lowering when combined with at produced febuxostat is enough to get great majority of allopurinol inadequate responders to their serum uric acid goals i will note that the arhalofenate was well tolerated in both of these studies and the overall safety profile is favorable and continues to be consistent with those earlier studies collectively the five phase  studies completed today have enabled us to advance the target profile for arhalofenate we now believe that the major target population in  million gout patients who are inadequate serum uric acid responders on their current uric acid lowering therapy we believe that we can convert a great majority of them to responders by treatment with the combination arhalofenate  milligram and febuxostat for the subset of approximately  million of these patients with chronic gout and whose serum uric acid goal was less than  mgdl the ideal combination would be arhalofenate  mg with the  mg dose of febuxostat for patients with tophaceous gout that need a more aggressive goal of less than  mgdl we will combine arhalofenate with the  mg dose of febuxostat we believe that not only would these patients be able to reach their serum uric acid goal but the antiflare activity of arhalofenate will decrease their flare rate making them better able to stay on treatment and also possibly allow them to avoid the need for colchicine prophylaxis finally for the approximately  gout patients that either cant take or tolerate allopurinol we are contemplating a development of arhalofenate mono therapy as a treatment option to this patient population that has very limited choices within these markets the competitive landscape in gout has continued to evolve astrazeneca has now completed the phase  program for lesinurad the only other uricosuric drug in latestage development although the study involved in  mg and  mg doses of lesinurad they have recently announced that their ema submission was only for the lower  mg dose in combination with allopurinol we believe that the combination of arhalofenate  milligrams with febuxostat has a superior profile to the combination of lesinurad  milligrams with allopurinol with respect both to achievement of serum uric acid targets and also flare control and may very well be the better option for the gout patient this arhalofenate target profile can be confirmed in a very straightforward phase  program in which we contemplate studying these three target patient populations those with chronic gout tophaceous gout and those patients that cant take or are intolerant to allopurinol all in all we are very excited about where this program is headed and are currently targeting an end of phase  meeting with the fda for the third quarter of this year with the goal of being in a position to start a phase  study in the first half of  in parallel we are running a very active effort to explore potential partnerships either territory based or global as an option for advancing our phase  program now i would like to change gears and provide a brief update on mbx this compound is an oral potent and selective pparδ agonist with really exciting potential for the treatment of the number of high unmet need indications mbx had previously completed a phase  study in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and demonstrated positive effects on lipids including reductions of ldl cholesterol our strategy for mbx is to redirect development for indications with high unmet needs weve identified homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia hofh as the first new indication hofh is a rare life threatening genetic disorder characterized by loss of function mutations in the ldl receptor resulting in extremely high levels of ldl cholesterol early cardiovascular disease and early mortality two recently introduced therapies juxtapid and kynamro are able to provide ldl or cholesterol lowering in to rep patients however both drugs have tolerability and safety issues including black box warnings thus there continues to be a need for a therapy that will safely lower ldl cholesterol in these patients we observed significant reductions in ldl cholesterol in our earlier study in patients with mixed dyslipidemia but we were not sure whether the mechanism would be relevant to hofh in disease the patients didn’t had a functional ldl receptors in january we announced results from a preclinical study indicating that mbx decreased ldl by approximately  in an accepted animal model of hofh this data indicate that the ldl cholesterol lowering of mbx is not dependent on having a fully functional ldl receptor and could be viable treatment for hofh we are in the process of initiating a pilot study in up to eight patients with hofh this openlabel dose escalation study would be conducted in europe patients will be sequentially dose escalated up to  milligrams with treatment effects being evaluated relative to baseline as well as to the period while on the end of treatment we are actively engaged with health authorities and investigators and expect to start the study in the first half of this year we also continue to explore potential opportunities with small focus to our proofofconcept studies in other indications based on the clinically demonstrated effects of mbx potential indications include primary biliary cirrhosis severe refractory hypertriglyceridemia and nash for nash we are monitoring the progress of ongoing clinical studies of other drug candidates in this indication including the genfit mixed pparαδ agonist gft as our plans become more firm we will issue additional guidance with that i will now turn the call back over to sujal to review our financials sujal shah thanks hal in todays press release we reported cash cash equivalents and short term investments of  million as of december   compared to  million for the year ended  subsequent to december   cash increased by  million from the net proceeds related to the sales of common stock under our aftermarket facility in the first quarter of  we believe this provides with sufficient resources to fund operations through at least the end of  research and development expense for the three and  months ended december   was  million and  million respectively rd expense for the same period in  was  million and  million respectively the increase in rd expense for both periods was primarily related to the increased spending associated with the conduct of phase  arhalofenatefebuxostat combination study and our phase b arhalofenate gout during  general and administrative expenses for the three and  months ended december   was  million and  million respectively ga expense for the same period in  was  million and  million respectively the increase in ga expense in  compared to  was primarily related to an increase in personnel cost to both support our transition from a private to a public company and to resume our clinical development activities net loss for the three and  months ended december   was  million and  million respectively net loss for the same periods in  was  million and  million respectively increase in net loss was primarily due to the increase in rd expense and ga expense the net loss for the three and  months ended december   included noncash losses of  million and  million respectively from the mark to market valuation of the company’s warrant liability the net loss associated with these noncash charges was  million for the three and  months ended december   hal harold van wart all right let me close reiterating the company’s nearterm value generating milestones since the beginning of the year we provided strong rational for moving both of our programs forward aggressively arhalofenate into the registration studies in gout and mbx into a pilot study into hofh we expect the hofh study to begin rolling in the first half of the year and hope to have clarity on our next indication for  within that same time period we are also targeting the third quarter for end of phase  meeting with the fda to discuss arhalofenate throughout the coming quarters we will also be conducting extensive review of other options for advancing arhalofenate in the clinic including potential partnerships and we look forward to updating on our progress as these efforts evolve i would now like to open the call up to your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from brian klein with stifel please proceed with your question brian klein hi guys thanks for the comprehensive update and for taking my questions i guess first how  on arhalofenate i know you want to meet with your ca in the third quarter and i assume youll have some clarity on phase  trial design are you prepared to start phase  program prior to landing a partner for arhalofenate sujal shah hey brian this is sujal let me take articulate i think our thoughts behind this were optimistic given the data we now have in hand and the current level of interest that we may in fact be able to get a partner for arhalofenate before entering into phase  both the public market and pharma specifically vert recently assigned significant value for uricosuric drug that simple address the additional serum uric acid lowering needs of nonresponders to allopurinol thats a patient population of about  million to  million patients and thats particularly a higher dose as this has had some significant safety issues so we look at our profile and we believe we have a highly differentiated uricosuric and antiinflammatory drug with very good safety profile the right deal is on the table well look best ways to move our  if the right deal is not on the table well look best ways to move up phase forward in the best interest of our shareholders the end of the day were very open to looking at different types of structure brian and well firmly look to make those decisions at that point in time brian klein okay great thanks along those lines whats preferable to you guys internally are you looking for a worldwide partner how would help fund the phase  program or do you think regional base ph something makes more sense harold van wart i think at the outset were relatively agonistic to that we want to see what kind of options were given and decide which direction we want to go into we certainly would not be adverse to a global partnership with the right partner were not specifically trying to carve out any regions for ourselves if thats what youre asking brian klein great a couple of questions quickly on  i know youre targeting enrolment with eight patients maybe starting in the first half of this year when do you anticipate we might see initial data from that study harold van wart were in very final stages of getting our protocol through the regulatory agencies and the ethics committee and while were going to stick with the guy that we planned to start at to the first half of this year were hoping that it might even be a little bit sooner i think its realistic to assume that we could get that data before the end of the year brian klein great and i know you mentioned genfit and their upcoming data would you be anticipating possibly starting a trialing match ph sooner depending on the outcome of that competitor trial harold van wart yeah thats a very good question brian so it turns out the relevant fact related to that is that we only have  weeks of toxicology coverage right now for being able to do clinical studies with mbx we have directed our current toxicology program is in progress and we will have that data in the first quarter of next year in which case we will no longer be limited by that and since most of the exciting data from nash has come from serial biopsies in studies of year or longer duration its difficult to see what kind of study you could do in nash that would be informative in only three months so our likely preference would be to delay a start of any potential nash study until we could go for the  on for the length of time waiting to see biopsy data brian klein great thanks and just one final question for sujal i was wondering if you could give you a little bit of guidance here on rd spend for the year thanks sujal shah sure brian so bulk of what you see here little over a  million the  million reported for yearend was really towards project cost great majority of that of course was arhalofenate both the febuxostat and arhalofenate combination study as well as the gout flare study the remaining somewhere around  million was really the personnel cost that support our rd brian klein great thank you thanks for taking me harold van wart thanks brian operator thank you our next question comes from jeff chen with cowen  company please proceed with your question jeff chen thanks for taking the questions so question around the discussions of partnerships so are you still kind of having ongoing discussions about phase  designs with potential partners or is this something that you await until what you see in terms of the interested parties harold van wart no jeff i think we have a very clear idea what our phase  program would look like for arhalofenate and we actually have touched upon that in todays dialogue having said that as we engage pharma partners and start to learn how they might view the program we could be influenced by that and that could shift us in one direction or another we’re always trying to stay  keep in open mind as to what better and more effective ways to develop a drug could be but i dont think we could assume that well have a pharma partner before we go to our end of phase  meeting so were checking a view that were going to go there negotiate what we think is the best possible program to support the strongest possible label and along the way and parallel have discussions with pharma to be able to get their input and assess their level of interest jeff chen thats very helpful thanks and a followup question on  so for phase  in eu what would you consider to be acceptable spender in terms of ldl lowering that youre looking for harold van wart yeah to this question so we have had extensive calls with kol and asked them that question what amount of ldl lowering you believe would be clinically meaningful for this patient population and the numbers tended to gravitate around    because you need to remember also that thats  off of very high baseline level so the absolute reduction analogy and is actually quite significant and meaningful from that percentage drop so i think if we still  i think in that vicinity we consider that to be a victory operator operator instructions there are no further questions in queue at this time i will like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments sujal shah thank you operator thank you
