causal models to the field of economics in addition to using historical analysis in this field his achievements involve work on early models of industrial location he lived during the period when sociology became a separate field of science weber maintained a commitment to the philosophy of history traditions he contributed theories for analyzing social change in western civilization as a confluence of civilization intellectual and technological social processes organizations and culture art religion and philosophy least cost theoryedit leaning heavily on work developed by the relatively unknown wilhelm launhardt alfred weber formulated a least cost theory of industrial location which tries to explain and predict the locational pattern of the industry at a macroscale it emphasizes that firms seek a site of minimum transport and labor cost the point for locating an industry that minimizes costs of transportation and labor requires analysis of three factors material indexedit the point of optimal transportation is based on the costs of distance to the material index – the ratio of weights of the intermediate products raw materials to the finished product in one scenario the weight of the final product is less than the weight of the raw material going into making the product—the weight losing industry for example in the copper industry it would be very expensive to haul raw materials to the market for processing so manufacturing occurs near the raw materials besides mining other primary activities or extractive industries are considered material oriented timber mills furniture manufacture most agricultural activities etc often located in rural areas these businesses may employ most of the local population as they leave the locale area loses its economic base in the other the final product is equally as heavy material index is equal to  as the raw materials that require transport usually this is a case of some ubiquitous raw material such as water being incorporated into the product this is called the weightgaining industry this type of industry tends to build up near market or raw material source and are called footloose industry cotton industry is a prominent example of weightgaining raw material in some industries like the heavy chemical industry the weight of raw materials is less than the weight of the finished product these industries always grow up near market webers point of optimal transportation is a generalization of the fermat point problem in its simplest form the fermat problem consists in locating a point d with respect to three points a b and c in such a way that the sum of the distances between d and each of the three other points is minimized as for the weber triangle problem it consists in locating a point d with respect to three points a b and c in such a way that the sum of the transportation costs between d and each of the three other points is minimized in  lucnormand tellier found the first direct non iterative numerical solution of the fermat and weber triangle problems long before von thünens contributions which go back to  the fermat point problem can be seen as the very beginning of

formulated by thomas simpson in  and popularized by alfred weber in  in  in a book entitled économie spatiale rationalité économique de lespace habité tellier formulated an allnew problem called the attractionrepulsion problem which constitutes a generalization of both the fermat and weber problems in its simplest version the attractionrepulsion problem consists in locating a point d with respect to three points a a and r in such a way that the attractive forces exerted by points a and a and the repulsive force exerted by point r cancel each other out in the same book tellier solved that problem for the first time in the triangle case and he reinterpreted spatial economics theory especially the theory of land rent in the light of the concepts of attractive and repulsive forces stemming from the attractionrepulsion problem that problem was later further analyzed by mathematicians like chen hansen jaumard and tuy  and jalal and krarup  the attractionrepulsion problem is seen by ottaviano and thisse  as a prelude to the new economic geography that developed in the s and earned paul krugman a nobel memorial prize in economic sciences in  laboredit the labor distortion sources of lower cost labor may justify greater transport distances and become the primary determinant in production unskilled labor industries such as the garment industry require cheap unskilled laborers to complete activities that are not mechanized they are often termed ubiquitous meaning they can be found everywhere its pull is due to low wages little unionization and young employees skilled labor high tech firms such as those located in silicon valley require exceptionally skilled professionals skilled labor is often difficult to find and is more mobile than unskilled labor agglomeration and deglomerationedit agglomeration is the phenomenon of spatial clustering or a concentration of firms in a relatively small area the clustering and linkages allow individual firms to enjoy both internal and external economies auxiliary industries specialized machines or services used only occasionally by larger firms tend to be located in agglomeration areas not just to lower costs but to serve the bigger populations deglomeration occurs when companies and services leave because of the diseconomies of industries’ excessive concentration firms who can achieve economies by increasing their scale of industrial activities benefit from agglomeration however after reaching an optimal size local facilities may become overtaxed lead to an offset of initial advantages and increase in pc then the force of agglomeration may eventually be replaced by other forces which promote deglomeration globalizationedit similarly industrial activity is considered a secondary economic activity and is also discussed as manufacturing industrial activity can be broken down further to include the following activities processing the creation of intermediate parts final assembly today with multinational corporations the three activities listed above may occur outside mdcs webers theory can explain some of the causes for current movement yet such discussion did not come from weber himself weber found industrial activity the least expensive to produce least cost location then implies marketing the product at the least cost to the consumer much like retailers attempt to obtain large market shares today economically it is explained as one way to make a profit creating the cheapest product for the consumer market leads to greater volume of sales and hence greater profits therefore companies that do not take the time to locate the cheapest inputs or the largest markets would not succeed since their product costs more to produce and costs the consumer more his theory has five assumptions his first assumption is known as the isotropic plain assumption this means the model is operative in a single country with a uniform topography climate technology economic system his second assumption is that only one finished product is considered at a time and the product is shipped to a single market the third assumption is raw materials are fixed at certain locations and the market is also a known fixed location the fourth assumption is labor is fixed geographically but is available in unlimited quantities at any production site selected the final assumption is that transport costs are a direct function of weight of the item and the distance shipped in use with his theory he created the locational triangle his triangle is used with one market and two sources of material this illustrated that manufacturing that utilizes pure materials will never tie the processing location to the material site also industries utilizing high weight loss materials will tend to be pulled toward the material source as opposed to the market furthermore many industries will select an intermediate location between market and material the last generalization is considered to be wrong because he never takes into account terminal costs and therefore is considered biased toward intermediate locations to further explore the location of firms weber also created two concepts the first is of an isotim which is a line of equal transport cost for any product or material the second is the isodapane which is a line of total transport costs the isodapane is found by adding all of the isotims at a location the reason for using isodapanes is to systematically introduce the labor component into webers locational theory weber has received much criticism it has been said that weber did not effectively and realistically take into account geographic variation in market demand which is considered a locational factor of paramount influence also his treatment of transport did not recognize that these costs are not proportional to distance and weight and that intermediate locations necessitate added terminal charges labor is not always available in unlimited quantity at any location and is usually quite mobile through migration plus most manufacturing plants obtain a large number of material inputs and produce a wide range of products for many diverse markets so his

weber maintained a commitment to the philosophy of history traditions he contributed theories for analyzing social change in western civilization as a confluence of civilization intellectual and technological social processes organizations and culture art religion and philosophy least cost theoryedit leaning heavily on work developed by the relatively unknown wilhelm launhardt alfred weber formulated a least cost theory of industrial location which tries to explain and predict the locational pattern of the industry at a macroscale it emphasizes that firms seek a site of minimum transport and labor cost the point for locating an industry that minimizes costs of transportation and labor requires analysis of three factors material indexedit the point of optimal transportation is based on the costs of distance to the material index – the ratio of weights of the intermediate products raw materials to the finished product in one scenario the weight of the final product is less than the weight of the raw material going into making the product—the weight losing industry for example in the copper industry it would be very expensive to haul raw materials to the market for processing so manufacturing occurs near the raw materials besides mining other primary activities or extractive industries are considered material oriented timber mills furniture manufacture most agricultural activities etc often located in rural areas these businesses may employ most of the local population as they leave the locale area loses its economic base in the other the final product is equally as heavy material index is equal to  as the raw materials that require transport usually this is a case of some ubiquitous raw material such as water being incorporated into the product this is called the weightgaining industry this type of industry tends to build up near market or raw material source and are called footloose industry cotton industry is a prominent example of weightgaining raw material in some industries like the heavy chemical industry the weight of raw materials is less than the weight of the finished product these industries always grow up near market webers point of optimal transportation is a generalization of the fermat point problem in its simplest form the fermat problem consists in locating a point d with respect to three points a b and c in such a way that the sum of the distances between d and each of the three other points is minimized as for the weber triangle problem it consists in locating a point d with respect to three points a b and c in such a way that the sum of the transportation costs between d and each of the three other points is minimized in  lucnormand tellier found the first direct non iterative numerical solution of the fermat and weber triangle problems long before von thünens contributions which go back to  the fermat point problem can be seen as the very beginning of space economy it was formulated by the famous french mathematician pierre de fermat before  as for the weber triangle problem which is a generalization of the fermat triangle problem it was first formulated by thomas simpson in  and popularized by alfred weber in  in  in a book entitled économie spatiale rationalité économique de lespace habité tellier formulated an allnew problem called the attractionrepulsion problem which constitutes a generalization of both the fermat and weber problems in its simplest version the attractionrepulsion problem consists in locating a point d with respect to three points a a and r in such a way that the attractive forces exerted by points a and a and the repulsive force exerted by point r cancel each other out in the same book tellier solved that problem for the first time in the triangle case and he reinterpreted spatial economics theory especially the theory of land rent in the light of the concepts of attractive and repulsive forces stemming from the attractionrepulsion problem that problem was later further analyzed by mathematicians like chen hansen jaumard and tuy  and jalal and krarup  the attractionrepulsion problem is seen by ottaviano and thisse  as a prelude to the new economic geography that developed in the s and earned paul krugman a nobel memorial prize in economic sciences in  laboredit the labor distortion sources of lower cost labor may justify greater transport distances and become the primary determinant in production unskilled labor industries such as the garment industry require cheap unskilled laborers to complete activities that are not mechanized they are often termed ubiquitous meaning they can be found everywhere its pull is due to low wages little unionization and young employees skilled labor high tech firms such as those located in silicon valley require exceptionally skilled professionals skilled labor is often difficult to find and is more mobile than unskilled labor agglomeration and deglomerationedit agglomeration is the phenomenon of spatial clustering or a concentration of firms in a relatively small area the clustering and linkages allow individual firms to enjoy both internal and external economies auxiliary industries specialized machines or services used only occasionally by larger firms tend to be located in agglomeration areas not just to lower costs but to serve the bigger populations deglomeration occurs when companies and services leave because of the diseconomies of industries’ excessive concentration firms who can achieve economies by increasing their scale of industrial activities benefit from agglomeration however after reaching an optimal size local facilities may become overtaxed lead to an offset of initial advantages and increase in pc then the force of agglomeration may eventually be replaced by other forces which promote deglomeration globalizationedit similarly industrial activity is considered a secondary economic activity and is also discussed as manufacturing industrial activity can be broken down further to include the following activities processing the creation of intermediate parts final assembly today with multinational corporations the three activities listed above may occur outside mdcs webers theory can explain some of the causes for current movement yet such discussion did not come from weber himself weber found industrial activity the least expensive to produce least cost location then implies marketing the product at the least cost to the consumer much like retailers attempt to obtain large market shares today economically it is explained as one way to make a profit creating the cheapest product for the consumer market leads to greater volume of sales and hence greater profits therefore companies that do not take the time to locate the cheapest inputs or the largest markets would not succeed since their product costs more to produce and costs the consumer more his theory has five assumptions his first assumption is known as the isotropic plain assumption this means the model is operative in a single country with a uniform topography climate technology economic system his second assumption is that only one finished product is considered at a time and the product is shipped to a single market the third assumption is raw materials are fixed at certain locations and the market is also a known fixed location the fourth assumption is labor is fixed geographically but is available in unlimited quantities at any production site selected the final assumption is that transport costs are a direct function of weight of the item and the distance shipped in use with his theory he created the locational triangle his triangle is used with one market and two sources of material this illustrated that manufacturing that utilizes pure materials will never tie the processing location to the material site also industries utilizing high weight loss materials will tend to be pulled toward the material source as opposed to the market furthermore many industries will select an intermediate location between market and material the last generalization is considered to be wrong because he never takes into account terminal costs and therefore is considered biased toward intermediate locations to further explore the location of firms weber also created two concepts the first is of an isotim which is a line of equal transport cost for any product or material the second is the isodapane which is a line of total transport costs the isodapane is found by adding all of the isotims at a location the reason for using isodapanes is to systematically introduce the labor component into webers locational theory weber has received much criticism it has been said that weber did not effectively and realistically take into account geographic variation in market demand which is considered a locational factor of paramount influence also his treatment of transport did not recognize that these costs are not proportional to distance and weight and that intermediate locations necessitate added terminal charges labor is not always available in unlimited quantity at any location and is usually quite mobile through migration plus most manufacturing plants obtain a large number of material inputs and produce a wide range of products for many diverse markets so his theory doesn’t easily apply

assumption is known as the isotropic plain assumption this means the model is operative in a single country with a uniform topography climate technology economic system his second assumption is that only one finished product is considered at a time and the product is shipped to a single market the third assumption is raw materials are fixed at certain locations and the market is also a known fixed location the fourth assumption is labor is fixed geographically but is available in unlimited quantities at any production site selected the final assumption is that transport costs are a direct function of weight of the item and the distance shipped in use with his theory he created the locational triangle his triangle is used with one market and two sources of material this illustrated that manufacturing that utilizes pure materials will never tie the processing location to the material site also industries utilizing high weight loss materials will tend to be pulled toward the material source as opposed to the market furthermore many industries will select an intermediate location between market and material the last generalization is considered to be wrong because he never takes into account terminal costs and therefore is considered biased toward intermediate locations to further explore the location of firms weber also created two concepts the first is of an isotim which is a line of equal transport cost for any product or material the second is the isodapane which is a line of total transport costs the isodapane is found by adding all of the isotims at a location the reason for using isodapanes is to systematically introduce the labor component into webers locational theory weber has received much criticism it has been said that weber did not effectively and realistically take into account geographic variation in market demand which is considered a locational factor of paramount influence also his treatment of transport did not recognize that these costs are not proportional to distance and weight and that intermediate locations necessitate added terminal charges labor is not always available in unlimited quantity at any location and is usually quite mobile through migration plus most manufacturing plants obtain a large number of material inputs and produce a wide range of products for many diverse markets so his theory doesn’t easily apply furthermore he underestimated the effect of agglomeration worksedit über den standort der industrie theory of the location of industries  ideen zur staats  und kultursoziologie  kulturgeschichte als
