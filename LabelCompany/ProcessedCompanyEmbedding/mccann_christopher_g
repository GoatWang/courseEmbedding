chris’s significant contributions and reflects the seamless transition process that we have executed over the past several years working closely with chris i know there is no one better equipped to spearhead the continued growth and innovation of our company chris i have learned a great deal working alongside jim over the years as we took one storefront shop on manhattan’s east side and grew it into a leading omnichannel gift retailer our long history of focusing on innovation and embracing new technology will continue to play a vital role in solving for the gifting needs of our millions of customers looking ahead our company is poised to achieve even greater growth by deepening our customer relationships and expanding our business platform in both the floral and gourmet food gifting spaces your company has come a long way from that first flower shop in new york to what do you attribute your success jim there are lots of factors but let me give you an example of what drives us ten years ago although we were always an early adopter of new technologies it was very difficult for us to attract the best digital talent there weren’t enough to choose from and the really good ones seemed to be flocking to silicon valley or the next “hot” startup shop in manhattan everyone was competing for the best and the brightest flash forward to today and things are very different for us recently we took a dozen of our young employees out for dinner these are the future digital leaders of our company – five or so are harvard business school grads and the other seven also have incredible resumes and are digitally savvy and all of them could work anywhere in the world i asked one of these young people what attracted her to work for us she said she had made up her mind many years ago to build a career in digital marketing and that these days if that is your focus then you really should have flowerscom on your resume i realized then that we had indeed come a long way over the past decade she also said that having been with us for six months she truly understands the connection between our brand and our culture  she has been volunteering at smile farms a nonprofit on long island that our family helped found which consists of greenhouses that provide meaningful employment for developmentally disabled adults who grow plants flowers and food products to be used in their local communities this young lady said that volunteering at our smile farm in moriches new york has really put things into perspective for her in terms of giving back to the community in which we work this is not just about what we do but who we are philanthropy ties in with our culture of innovation and achievement chris over the years we have made an effort to focus on the core of what we do we are obsessed with making constant incremental improvements in everything we do particularly where it concerns our most important product customer experience this focus more than anything has driven our success we know that our customers come to us because they have a need to connect with someone important in their lives all of the work we do manifests itself in us helping our customers deliver a smile for all kinds of celebratory occasions once new hires recognize that this is at the heart of our business and our corporate culture they come to understand the role they can play in helping our customers deliver those smiles no matter how much technology changes the business it always comes back to the people is that part of your philosophy jim always technology is just a pathway to help our customers act on their thoughtfulness chris with that said another key component of our culture is aggressively fostering innovation we look for people who are likely to get speeding tickets not parking tickets what i mean by that is that we look for people who thrive in an atmosphere of doing –always moving forward always willing to experiment and not afraid to fail it comes back to the focus on our culture and making sure we constantly build manage and develop a culture of innovation and achievement leadership comes with a responsibility to consistently be on top of change we cannot allow our company and our people to become complacent jim to succeed in our firm it is also a good idea to be able to handle more than a bit of ambiguity good ideas can and should come from anywhere in your company so we don’t believe in sticking people in fixed slots – we prefer the “best athlete” approach deploying people and periodically redeploying them throughout the company to learn and share best practices we believe that a culture of innovation is a culture of reinvention and we are constantly reinventing ourselves as a company in the last quarter alone we launched new apps for android ios and windows  devices these are probably the third or fourth generation of apps we have launched – always working to stay ahead of the curve when we talk about a company of our scale with a culture of innovation like this i am proud to say we can compete with anyone you started as a florist then became a floral gift company and now you’re a leading gourmet food and gift baskets provider along with flowers how do you decide what gift areas to get into chris today more than half of our revenue comes from our gourmet foods brands – nearly  million and growing this reflects the constant reinvention of our businesses and our focus on engaging directly with our customers and asking them what products and services they need from us to help them deliver smiles gourmet foods such as our harry  david pears and gift baskets and fannie may chocolates represent brands and products that resonate with both customers and their recipients as highquality solutions for connecting and celebrating together how do you maintain your culture of innovation as your business scales larger and larger jim scale shouldn’t be an impediment to innovation in fact it should be an advantage in terms of allowing us the room to continually experiment – across a broad platform – while having a fairly high tolerance for failure at least failure as a learning tool and motivator this concept is embedded within our dna it is what we celebrate what we reward and what we fund as a company chris when new employees join us and attend one of our group dinners they may be one of a handful of new people around a table of a dozen or more they see us toasting our successes and laughing about our occasional flops but also learning from them while asking about new projects and new applications they see jim and i along with members of our senior management team all attending these dinners with the new young team members and they realize that this is because we are committed to and invested in our people we are impressing upon them very early in their careers to pay close attention to what their peers are talking about what they are working on what they are interested in both at work and in their everyday lives we ask them to think about what is affecting their lives and what they think the next great innovation is that we as a company ought to be thinking about we set the tone early in our interviewing process our hiring process and into our onboarding process that we want them to be part of our culture how do you balance the tremendous brand equity that flowerscom has built up over  years with the fact that the name does not represent all that the company has to offer jim the strength of the flowers brand is in the relationships we have with our customers it may have started with a floral arrangement for a birthday or an anniversary or a plant for mother’s day but it has evolved into a relationship in which our customers know that first and foremost we provide them with solutions for their connective and gifting needs this evolution can be seen now in our omnichannel multibrand approach – offering customers a broad range of products and brands that they have told us they would like along with access where and when they want it – in a retail store through a mobile app on our website or any of the new modes of contact under development on facebook and via other thirdparty platforms chris adding to all this is what we call the “glue” that ties our brands and customer access platforms together our celebrations suite of services including celebrations passport celebrations rewards and celebrations reminders these programs help tie together a gifting ecosystem for our customers for instance our celebrations passport program enables customers to pay one low price and receive free shipping or no service charges across our entire family of brands for a year this provides us with an opening to begin marketing all of our brands to those customers then using analytics to understand customer behavior better we get insight into what types of additional products and services our customers are most interested in and what we should be focusing our rd efforts on do you see opportunities to expand into other gifting areas chris yes very much so much of this comes from the continuing dialogue we have with our customers around their gifting and connective needs this in turn enables us to focus on finding innovative solutions for those needs it drives our merchant teams to try new products and product categories occasionally things may not work and that is okay too learning from what doesn’t work is as important as learning from what does it is critical for us to create and maintain a much deeper engaged and trusting relationship with the customer how hard is it for the brickandmortar store to survive today and will there be a role for the corner florist going forward jim this continues to be the context in which we think about the relationships we have with the thousands of local professional florists that we work with every day as the only leaders in our space who started out as florists chris and i have a unique knowledge and empathy when it comes to local florists it all goes back to our first shop where i worked full time chris would come in on weekends while he was attending high school and college and we worked hard every day to develop and maintain relationships with customers in the local community around that first shop so we know how hard it is to make a retail store work each and every day we try to replicate that focus and effort today through the use of technology we strive to make each customer interaction as direct and personal as possible to build relationships first and then do business we are now taking our culture of innovation and bringing that to our network of florists to help them compete and grow in their own communities we work closely with our bloomnet florists building and hosting websites for them in their local communities providing cuttingedge pointofsale and store management systems and much more to help them grow their businesses profitably chris one good example of this is our local artisan program which we launched a few years ago as a way to feature and showcase the creativity of local shops and their exclusive floral designs to millions of flowerscom customers through initiatives like this we are giving these shops a chance to reach a much wider audience that can now see what is available in a specific market on any given day jim it comes down to constantly innovating with a focus on driving customer experience – that’s what flowerscom and our family of brands represents and that is what will help us achieve our goals
