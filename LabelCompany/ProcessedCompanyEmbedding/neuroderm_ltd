neuroderm announced that a preliminary analysis of trial  demonstrated that the trial successfully met its primary key secondary and additional secondary endpoints with many patients experiencing a complete reduction of offtime to zero trial  design trial  was a day multicenter international us eu and israel parallelgroup blinded rater randomized phase ii study that investigated the efficacy safety tolerability and pharmacokinetics of two dosing regimens r and r of ndh and compared them to the baseline of standard optimized oral therapy r hour administration of ndh mg ldcd at a high day rate for  hours and a low night rate for  hours r hour administration of ndh during the waking hours mg ldcd complemented by a morning dose of mg oral ldcd all patients could add oral ldcd therapy at

throughout the day and also observed at pm  points and pm  points safety and tolerability both regimens were well tolerated of the  subjects four reported six serious adverse events including one subject with subcutaneous abscess and orthostatic hypotension and another with worsening pd symptoms these two patients did not complete the study additionally one subject fell and fractured his nose and there was one case of suspected panniculitis that was eventually ruled out infusion site reactions nodules bruising erythema and hemorrhage were common yet generally well tolerated these results corroborate the safety and tolerability data obtained in previous studies and did not raise new safety or tolerability concerns additionally the ndh infusion pump systems were reliable with only few minor correctable malfunctions reported no major inconvenience related to the wearing of the device was reported for either day or night administration the company also announced that it has received a scientific advice letter from the scientific advice working party of the european medicines agency ema the letter accepts the main design elements suggested by neuroderm for the amended indigo phase iii efficacy trial trial  including study population and primary and secondary endpoints as well as the suggested statistical analysis approach the ema suggested that neuroderm’s planned clinical and regulatory development program may be adequate to support a benefitrisk evaluation of nd for the treatment of parkinsons disease patients on levodopa with motor fluctuations at any stage of development of a product candidate developers can request scientific advice from the ema which provides a mechanism for the ema to give developers advice on the appropriate tests and studies in the development of a product candidate this process is designed to facilitate the development and availability of highquality effective and acceptably safe medicines for the benefit of patients neuroderm recently requested scientific advice from the ema focused on the amended nd indigo trial protocol the goal of this request was to reach agreement with the agency on the content of this protocol which is now being conducted as a pivotal efficacy and safety trial to support registration of nd in the eu and to confirm completeness of the development program intended to support the submission of a

system or cns disorders through proprietary formulations based on existing drugs that are intended to make a significant difference in patients lives product candidates in ndrm’s pipeline are designed to overcome major deficiencies of current treatments and achieve enhanced clinical efficacy through continuous controlled administration primarily subcutaneously or transdermally additionally because ndrm’s product candidates are based on reformulations of leading approved drugs ndrm believes that most of them qualify for an accelerated lower risk regulatory pathway to marketing approval for moderate to severe parkinsons disease ndrm’s product candidates are aimed at overcoming the most significant limitations of current levodopacarbidopa or ldcd therapy for over  years oral administration of ldcd has been the standard of care for parkinsons disease however despite its widespread acceptance oral ldcd has significant limitations primarily short duration in the blood or halflife as well as low absorption and availability in the body as a result plasma levodopa concentrations fluctuate sharply contributing to patients motor complications at the advanced stages of the disease patients do not respond to oral administration of ldcd motor complications are exacerbated and patients are left with limited treatment options that are highly invasive andor burdensome ndrm has developed liquid formulations such as its product candidates ndh and ndl that for the first time enable hour continuous subcutaneous administration of ldcd to overcome these limitations maintain steady levodopa levels and offer patients a better quality of life without the need for surgery there are three main stages to parkinsons disease mild moderate and severe each associated with increasing levels of motor complications and requiring different treatments ndrm is developing a pipeline of product candidates for the growing population of moderate and severe parkinsons disease patients that address the deficiencies of current treatments these product candidates are designed to administer continuous controlled doses of ldcd or apomorphine utilizing customized versions of offtheshelf belt pump devices ndrm is also developing a product candidate for patients suffering from cognition disorders associated with cns diseases these diseases include attention deficit disorderattention deficit hyperactivity disorder or addadhd parkinsons disease alzheimers disease and schizophrenia ndrm’s cognition product candidate is based on a combination of reformulated approved drugs allowing for continuous administration via transdermal patches in its recently completed phase ii trial ndrm examined plasma levodopa concentrations of individual parkinsons disease patients treated with optimized current standard of care and either ndl or a placebo as an addon for  days additionally in order to determine the effect of ndl without the standard of care ndrm conducted an additional week of treatment of ndl alone or with entacapone an average steady plasma levodopa concentration of ngml was maintained when ndl was administered alone and an approximately ngml plasma levodopa concentration was maintained when ndl was administered together with twicedaily oral entacapone intellectual property ndrm’s patents and patent applications underlying its product candidates cover specific compositions and methods of use of the active drug substances for the ndh ndl nd and nd product candidate programs for the ndh ndl and nd product candidate programs ndrm has four patents including patents in the united states south africa and new zealand and have more than  pending patent applications worldwide including one pending and two national phase international applications filed under the pct absent patentterm extensions these patents will expire between  and  additional patent applications ndrm has filed in this family if approved will expire in  in addition ndrm has one pending international pct application for the composition of nd in relation to the composition and method of use related to nd ndrm has currently been granted four patents including patents in australia japan mexico and the united states and have more than  pending patent applications worldwide pursuant to one national phase international application filed under the pct such patents will expire between  and  absent patentterm extensions competition parkinsons disease ndrm’s commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if its competitors develop and commercialize products treatments or procedures that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than any product that ndrm may develop specifically ndrm may compete with companies that attempt to decrease the sharp fluctuations and improve the bioavailability and shortlife associated with orally administered ldcd such as impax laboratories inc xenoport inc intec pharma ltd and depomed inc which are developing oral ldcd drugs that include a controlled release or gastric retention attribute in order to decrease the gastronomical tracts impact on the concentration of levodopa similarly synagile corporation is seeking to develop an ester form of levodopa for continuous subcutaneous administration if such products are approved and successfully improve the bioavailability of ldcd or an alternative drug the demand for ndrm’s parkinsons disease product candidates may be significantly reduced other cognitive disorders similarly although ndrm is in the clinical phase of nd for the treatment of other cognitive disorders such as addadhd if nd obtains approval in the future ndrm would compete with current treatments for example ndrm is aware that a number of existing treatments for addadhd are currently on the market and are marketed by pharmaceutical companies that may be far larger and more experienced than us current competitor drugs to nd for the treatment of addadhd include stimulants such as ritalin and adderall as well as the nonstimulant drugs strattera intuniv and kapvay further ndrm recognizes that patients and doctors are often unwilling to change medications and this factor may make it difficult for nd to penetrate the market even if it receives fda approval however based on its clinical trials ndrm believes that nd will have a sustainable competitive advantage over the current alternatives and at the very least offer an alternative mode of administration  shareholders
