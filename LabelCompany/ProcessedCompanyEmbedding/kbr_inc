fabrication of power plant components but the development of hammer forge welding techniques helped ready the company to move into refining as the petroleum industry developed kellogg was announced the number one construction company for years  to  this is mainly due to their work in the dulles greenway kelloggs entry into process engineering initially focused on the fleming cracking process but in the s kellogg partnered with the texas company texaco and standard oil of indiana to purchase the cross thermal cracking process kellogg set up one of the first petroleum laboratories in the country in  to commercialize and then license the technology this led to kellogg building some  units in the united states and abroad in the s and s kellogg worked with leading refiners on various technologies for the war effort these developments led to the construction of six hydroreformer units twenty fluid catalytic cracking units and the only complete refinery built during world war ii even bigger than the refining work was k the gaseous diffusion plant at oak ridge tennessee built as part of the manhattan project this period also included the development of the benedict–webb–rubin

building a dam on the texas colorado river near austin during the depression years for assistance in federal payments the company turned to the local congressman lyndon b johnson brown  root was the principal source of campaign funds after johnsons initial run for congress in  in return for persuading the bureau of reclamation to change its rules against paying for a dam on land the federal

massive sums of cash for johnsons first run for the us senate in  during world war ii brown  root built the naval air station corpus christi and its subsidiary brown shipbuilding produced a series of warships for the us government in  brown  root built one of the worlds first offshore oil platforms brown  root continued to pour money into lyndon johnsons career not just making massive contributions to johnsons campaign funds but also making and causing their subcontractors and others beholden to them to make unusually large political contributions to enable johnson to manipulate and influence other members of the house and senate to obtain further huge contracts and other benefits such as continuing the oil depletion allowance and the pricing of natural gas for johnsons
