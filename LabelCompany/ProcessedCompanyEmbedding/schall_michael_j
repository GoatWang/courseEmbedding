the right direction for multifamily starts in  by derek mearnsfxwyvuwtwuaftsd as the saying goes the numbers don’t lie and in the multifamily construction industry the figures are telling a story of robust and opportunistic growth in  a look at new starts reveals that developers were eager to add new supply to meet the existing demand for rental properties last year it seems confidence has returned and developers are realizing this rental trend is going to be around for a while the increased volume in new units for  proves it in builder’s sister publication multifamily executive’s top  multifamily builders list last year only the top  builders had  new starts or more on this year’s list however each of the top  builders broke ground on at least  new units this is the first time since  that so many companies have broken the  mark while  leader marlton nj–based the michaels development co didn’t make the cut and several other highrankers have dropped in the ranks some familiar names were happy to step up and take their places marietta ga–based wood partners and phoenixbased alliance residential co hurdled last year’s top builders to claim the no  and no  spots respectively previously they were ranked no  and no  alliance whose main focus in  was on texas metros and coastal markets expects another strong year in  and will expand its efforts to new regions “we see more markets having recovered to a point that select new development is feasible including markets such as tampa fla phoenix and denver” says alliance’s cfo jay hiemenz  builder   builder  see the complete interactive builder  list as the fog of recession lifts builders take stock in how theyve changed more focus on customers less focus on opening new markets inform builders business models today top builders gained ground in soft market last years market share was the highest in a decade for the builder –ranked companies modular manufacturers look past soft  for growth leaders expect builders to seek prefab solutions as framers could be in short supply top  multifamily builders in  things were definitely moving in the right direction for multifamily starts last year but alliance is not the only builder breaking ground in new markets clevelandbased the nrp group no  will be making its presence felt in the florida multifamily arena with attention placed on marketrate properties “in  we thought we’d see more new starts from affordable housing and less from marketrate it turns out there was more opportunity on the marketrate side and  is shaping up to be the same story” says david heller a principal at the nrp group the company expects more than  new starts this year making it among the more active builders in  san antonio–based galaxy builders no  has consistently remained in the top  thanks to its ability to maintain strong client relationships and its firm texas roots where growth was abundant this past year this is the company’s fifth consecutive year on the top builders list and this year it increased its new starts by  percent other notable moves on this year’s list include chicagobased amli residential which went from nd last year to seventh in  starts and houstonbased reit camden property trust jumped from no  last year to take the final spot in the top  on this year’s list increasing new starts more than  percent the projected new starts in  for some of the industry’s most prolific builders prove that this resurgence in construction is not going away any time soon the numbers appear to be working their way back toward prerecession levels and the outlook appears bright for at least the next few years dallasbased mill creek residential trust no  the new development spinoff of trammell crow residential leads the pack in projected starts for  with —more than double the number of new units it built in  according to the company’s ceo charles brindell mill creek is very bullish that the market growth trend that’s occurring will continue for the foreseeable future “i do believe that most markets will continue to be undersupplied for the next few years our core markets exhibit very strong demand fundamentals” says brindell mill creek expects to break ground on new units in regions such as denver washington dc southern california new england and several texas metro areas where brindell believes demand will remain strong thanks to a combination of highbarrier and highgrowth markets high demand for rental property has been tied very closely to regions that are experiencing job growth this year arlington va–based avalonbay’s no  director of investor relations john christie is keeping a close eye on job growth in  as a critical factor in keeping apartment demand high in the coming year “job growth has been sluggish until about a month ago” says christie “there has been a lot of help from job growth in our core markets there’s no supply so our occupancy rate is steady and we can generate pricing power” he adds the more than  new units projected this year for avalonbay also makes the reit one of the multifamily developers to watch in the coming months not surprisingly nearly every company in this year’s top  is
