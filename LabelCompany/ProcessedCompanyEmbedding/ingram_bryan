liquidators ignored part of our reservation and failed to provide the dollies that we requested we had to go back to get the equipment and they gave us nonfunctional equipment when contacted again the rep hung up on us granted we were upset on the phone customer service reps should never just simply hang up on a paying customer we had the reservation for nearly a month before the move date and they simply failed to provide what we asked for the experience was very poor and cost us  hours of our moving time my wife and i had to move two apartments that day and having a dolly was not optional since we spent that time finding equipment elsewhere we had to keep the truck another day and added mileage to our bill since we had to drive around to find a functional dolly i would not recommend
