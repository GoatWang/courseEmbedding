future of lipocines lead product candidate lpcnjun   about lipocine inc lpcn emerging equities special situations longshort equitysummarytopline data from lead product candidate lpcn  is expected by june  and resubmission of the nda is planned for the third quarter of  lipocine has a patent issue with its lead product candidate lpcn  the law suit could be a major setback for lipocine’s lpcn  lipocine nasdaqlpcn is facing a lot of trouble with its trt therapy lpcn  theres the yetunresolved crl and although they are progressing through a trial that addresses the crl the fdas known antagonism to trt therapy acts as a major hindrance on top of that they have a patent lawsuit challenging lpcn  and although the lawsuit was dismissed it was only because the drug did not get approved once it does the lawsuit will come back and with the any hope of securing a partner will vanish overall the prospect is gloomy the company recently announced that they have completed the enrollment in both the dosing validation nysedv and dosing flexibility nysedf studies for lpcn  topline results from these studies are expected in june  and resubmission of the new drug application nda for lpcn  is expected in the third quarter of  in a recent press release lipocine announced that the dv study will assess lpcn  in hypogonadal males on a fixed daily dose of  mg divided into two equal doses the dv study is an openlabel fixed dose no titration single treatment arm study of lpcn  efficacy will be assessed via responder analysis at the end of the dosing period which is  days the prespecified primary endpoint is the percentage of subjects with an average hour serum testosterone concentration cavg within the normal range with secondary endpoints based on maximum serum testosterone concentrations cmax however interestingly clarus therapeutics inc had filed a patent infringement lawsuit against lipocine inc in us district court in delaware dr robert dudley president and ceo of clarus and coinventor of the patent in question stated we remain strong in our belief that lpcn infringes claruss  patent and it is particularly noteworthy that the court did not rule on this central fact if lpcn were to be approved by the fda our plan would be to vigorously pursue all avenues to keep lipocines lpcn from entering the market and protect the intellectual property accompanying financial investment and years of work we have invested in jatenzo  our oral trt product we continue to advance the development of jatenzo which is being evaluated in a new phase  study that is near completion earlier in june  lipocine inc received a complete response letter nysecrl from the fda which means its nda is not approvable in its present form the crl cited deficiencies related to the dosing algorithm specifically the proposed titration scheme in the labeling was significantly different that the titration scheme used in the phase  study which would lead to different titration decisions between the clinical trial and clinical practice the court found that there was not an immediate reason to hear the case given lipocines failure to receive fda market approval for lpcn importantly the decision was made without ruling on the validity of claruss us patent  and other merits of the case court dismissed the lawsuit due to lack of fda approval for lpcn and not on merits of case clarus will be allowed to refile its lawsuit if necessary in other words even if lpcn is successful with the fda in regard to testosterone replacement therapy nysemkttrt clarus will just restart the lawsuit and has a high chance for preventing lpcn from entering the market if fda approves lpcn lipocine will have a difficult time finding a marketing partner with decent terms as a minimum one would expect that a potential partner to want the patent issue with clarus resolved which could potentially delay product launch clarus is obviously well aware of the situation and is likely willing to let the patent fight drag for longer period of time in the mean time they continue to advance the development of jatenzo  their oral trt product another major setback for the testosterone replacement therapy is the safety concerns from fda the fda cautions about using testosterone products for low testosterone due to aging which requires labeling change to inform of possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke in patients taking testosterone lipocine investors will have to keep a close eye on the stock the trt market is volatile for companies to succeed the compliance issues also may be a hurdle for lipocine to overcome no matter what happens it will certainly be an interesting next few months lipocine needs to deal with the law suit once its gets the approval for lpcn which the company expects to get by resubmitting of the new drug application nda for lpcn  which is expected in the third quarter of  lipocine reported a net loss of  million or  per diluted share for the first quarter ended march   compared with a net loss of  million or  per diluted share in the first quarter ended march   research and development expenses were  million in the first quarter of  compared with  million in the first quarter of  general and administrative expenses were  million in the first quarter of  compared with  million in the first quarter of  as of march   lipocine had cash cash equivalents and marketable investment securities of  million given the cash scenario the early stage of the rest of the pipeline and the precarious situation surrounding lpcn

results from both the dosing validation “dv” and the dosing flexibility “df” studies evaluating efficacy and tolerability of lpcn  lpcn  is an oral testosterone product candidate for testosterone replacement therapy “trt” in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency of endogenous testosterone also known as hypogonadism the results from these studies confirm the validity of a fixed dose approach without the need for dose titration to orally administering lpcn  lpcn  successfully met the fda primary efficacy guidelines in the dv study where  of the subjects achieved average testosterone levels “cavg” within the normal range with a lower bound confidence interval “ci” of  the df study restored  of the subjects’ average testosterone levels within the normal range cavg confirming that twice daily “bid” dosing is the appropriate dosing regimen for lpcn  and will be the basis for resubmission the adverse event profile of lpcn  in both the dv and df studies was consistent with the previously conducted week phase  study of androgen replacement “soar” clinical trial all drug related adverse events “aes” were either mild or moderate in intensity and none were severe to date the safety database of lpcn  includes  hypogonadal men demonstrating a profile consistent with other trt products the secondary endpoints assessed the maximum total testosterone concentration “cmax” post dosing using predetermined limits developed by us food and drug administration “fda” for transdermals consistent with the definition of cmax and the pharmacokinetic profile of multiple times a day dosing two prespecified analyses were performed cmax per dose and cmax per day in the dv study cmax per dose analysis the percentage of subjects with cmax less than  ngdl and between  ngdl and  ngdl were  and  respectively deviations from the predetermined limits in the dv study were observed in the cmax per day dose analysis for these thresholds only one subject who was a major protocol violator exceeded the  ngdl limit independent of per dose or per day dose analyses the df study met all cmax thresholds in per dose and per day dose analyses similar private companies
