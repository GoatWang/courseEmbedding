adherence to risk guidelines strategy fundamental longshort equity strategy we believe applying fundamental research with a focus on smaller capitalization stocks uncovers unique long and short investments businesses that are less diversified are inherently more affected by the drivers that create or destroy equity value over the investment cycle we have identified what we believe are the most important of these drivers as the strength or weakness of the business model itself the pedigree of the fiduciaries and the advantages or challenges created by the company’s financial structure we look for these qualities and construct the portfolio within a three category framework the first category is comprised of equities which have companyspecific catalysts that we expect to generate returns largely independent of the overall market the second category is investing behind themes that we believe will drive excess returns over time third we have a portion of the portfolio that is expected to be driven by cyclical aspects of particular industries we generally concentrate our positions in  longs and  shorts to maximize the value of our research and convictions and likewise do not utilize etfs to manage risk we avoid leverage invest across a broad set of industries and remain disciplined with our price targets and stop lossesread more  management investment management chris
