process algebraderek gatherer email author and vashti galpinbmc systems biologyhttpsdoiorg  gatherer and galpin licensee biomed central ltd received  july accepted  october published  november  abstract background robert rosen’s metabolismreplacement or mr system can be represented as a compact network structure with a single source and three products derived from that source in three consecutive reactions mr has been claimed to be nonreducible to its components and algorithmically noncomputable in the sense of not being evaluable as a function by a turing machine if mrlike structures are present in real biological networks this suggests that many biological networks will be noncomputable with implications for those branches of systems biology that rely on in silico modelling for predictive purposes results we instantiate mr using the process algebra biopepa and discuss the extent to which our model represents a true realization of mr we observe that under some starting conditions and parameter values stable states can be achieved although formal demonstration of algorithmic computability remains elusive for mr we discuss the extent to which our biopepa representation of mr allows us to sidestep rosen’s fundamental objections to computational systems biology conclusions we argue that the behaviour of mr in biopepa shows lifelike properties keywords robert rosen mr metabolismreplacement metabolismrepair relational biology process algebra biopepa computability turing machine backgroundrelational biology is a discipline founded by robert rosen – – based on the previous work of nicolas rashevsky – which considers biological network structures using the mathematical tools of category theory relational biology might be considered a branch of systems biology in that it studies the same objects as systems biology and for similar reasons namely to improve our understanding of how complex biological processes work however its methods and conclusions are so radically different to those of conventional systems biology that one might almost say it constitutes an alternative discourse on the subject systems biologists attempt to represent biological network systems as software objects for simulation on computers these network structures may vary in their degree of complexity but the difference between simple and complex networks is treated as one of degree rather than of kind by contrast relational biologists define complex systems as only those systems having impredicative selfreferencing components and claim that these systems are noncomputable as functions by turing machines for relational biologists complex systems are therefore qualitatively different to simple onesa turing machine is a formal mathematical model of computation which has a notion of its internal state an unbounded tape and a readwrite head for that tape  it also has a table to determine the next internal state the symbol to be written to the tape and the direction in which to move the head all of which depend on the current internal state and the current symbol the concept of the unbounded tape may be taken to imply limitless time and space for computation a function is turing computable if it can be evaluated by a turing machine which when given an input to the function eventually writes the value of the function for that input on its output tape assuming that the function is defined for the input no time bound can be imposed on how long the turing machine will take to output the valuean adequate exposition of the logic of relational biology is impossible within the limits of a research paper the strategy adopted here is therefore to concentrate on rosen’s metabolismrepairreplacement system conventionally abbreviated in brackets as mr a very small but nevertheless allegedly noncomputable network which is the central object of study in modern relational biology metabolismrepair was rosen’s own phrase but metabolismreplacement is used here for reasons given by previous authors  readers interested in the construction of mr and in particular the reasons why it is deemed to be noncomputable are referred to louie’s recent book  and for contextual material to rosen’s previous book  and the recent series of reviews  – only the briefest description of mr is given in the following paragraphs referring to figures  and  which illustrate mr in two ways figure  the louiekercel representation of  mr  lines with open arrowheads are metabolic productive reactions for instance a produces b lines with filled arrowheads represent catalysis conventionally these point to the substrate of a metabolic reaction for instance f catalyses the production of b from a and this is indicated by f pointing to a likewise φ catalyses the production of f from b so an openheaded arrow goes from b to f and a filled arrow from φ to b figure  the goudsmit representation of  mr  black lines are metabolic productive reactions red dotted lines represent catalysis – for instance f catalyses the production of b from a compare with figure  to which this figure is equivalent relational biologists argue that the noncomputability of mr by turing machines is achieved through a circular pathway of causal relations termed closure to efficient causation furthermore relational biologists seek to demonstrate that such noncomputable systems when represented as graphs may be surprisingly small in terms of their total number of nodes and edges relational biologists do not deny that complex systems can be simulated but maintain that they can never truly be computed as functions    since even the most advanced computers still use turing architecture ie they are random access stored program machines that are almost turing machine equivalent the full computational analysis of complex biological systems is therefore postulated to be beyond our current computing abilitiesrelational biology has therefore concentrated its efforts into pure mathematics to the exclusion of computational analysis rosen once quipped that his mentor rashevsky had lived in a time when computers were not easily accessible but even if they had been he would not have used them  the abstract graph structures developed by relational biologists are referred to as models and a modelling relation is achieved between a system in the natural world and a model in the mathematical world when their entailment structures meaning the totality of their internal causal relations are identical entailment is an important concept in relational biology when a certain pattern of system states necessarily results in a certain outcome it is said that this outcome is entailed by that cause relational biologists describe logical entailments in their mathematical work that represent entailments from the physical world and insist for a correct modelling relation to be obtained that these entailments must occur in the model a simulation by contrast represents the world in a much more approximate way than a model without the requirement for congruence of internal causal relations a simulation may be an excellent predictive tool for the natural world but when it goes wrong one may have no idea why since its entailment structure is largely a work of creative approximation relational biologists maintain that much of conventional systems biology is merely about the development of such approximate simulations   rosen also argued that a corollary of the noncomputability of complex systems is the fact that they are also nonreducible to their component reactions in that a model of a complex system cannot be constructed simply by an additive assembly of smaller models of that system’s individual reaction components  by contrast whatever claims that systems biologists may make about their own antireductionism  the construction of software representations of biological networks requires the individual representation of component reactions in code in effect a reduction at the software level relational biologists acknowledge that there are many systems that are reducible and algorithmically computable in this way but none of these are truly complex and therefore few are really interesting from a biological point of view a further point of disagreement concerns the issue of mechanism systems biologists and molecular biologists in general view biological processes as machinelike relational biologists maintain that closure to efficient causation ie the presence of closed causative loops as in mr produces an entailment structure meaning a pattern of necessary causal relationships that is quite unlike that of a machine in summary relational biologists see complex biological systems as nonmechanistic nonreducible and noncomputable   relational biologists are therefore drawn to the conclusion that much of systems biology is at best overambitious an attempt to compute the impossible and to force biological systems into inappropriate mechanist and reductionist straitjackets and as a result of this that systems biology has no predictive power on the other hand systems biologists rarely stay the course with the two booklength expositions of relational biology   and may even believe that anything is computable given sufficient time and processing power despite the fact that computer scientists have long known this to be trivially false  the two disciplines exist on either side of a lookingglass in this paper we attempt like systems biology versions of alice to cross the lookingglass and force the tools of one world onto the materials of the other a certain amount of abrasion inevitably results both to tools and materials but we aim to demonstrate that a minimal degree of adjustment is required to achieve congruence between the two approaches whether this represents genuine progress or yet another fudge perpetrated by systems biologists is left to the judgement of the readerwe now turn to consideration of mr in more detail figure  shows the current standard representation of mr as given by louie  kercel  figure  shows an alternative provided by goudsmit   figure  follows the representative conventions of relational biology as follows b is produced from a and this is represented by an openheaded arrow from a to b this productive reaction is catalysed by f and this is represented by a filled arrow from f to a these diagrams can be reexpressed algebraically in category theory within which it is possible to manipulate set theoretical expressions to deduce that mr contains impredicative set structures ie sets that are members of themselves  these form the centrepiece of the conclusion that mr as a function is not turingcomputable some authors have questioned the mathematical correctness or completeness of the various category theory manipulations performed by relational biologists – others have disputed these claims – the present paper concentrates solely on the diagrammatic representation of mr and attempts to reexpress it in process algebrarosen intended mr to be interpreted very generally as a representation of a whole metabolic system b produced from an entire set of nutrient sources a metabolic activity in b is catalysed by a set of enzymatic functions f and maintained by replacement functions φ here in the spirit of the previous simulation by prideaux  we consider mr as a representation of a single metabolic pathway with a b f and φ as individual entities rather than the sets of metabolites and enzymes implied in rosen’s use of mr as a general schema the goudsmit representation figure  can be thought of as emphasizing this narrower interpretation although it was not necessarily intended as such by its author this therefore makes mr more readily comprehensible to systems biologists in effect bringing mr as close as possible to the kind of network diagram typically displayed in the systems biology literature in the aristotelian language used by relational biologists a is the material cause of b demonstrated in figure  by the open arrowhead and f is the effective cause of b represented by the closed arrowhead ending on the material cause a the combination of two sequential closed and open ended arrows together represents entailment – the presence of f entails ie necessarily results in the presence of b a similar relationship of material causation exists between b and f this time effected by φ and between f and φ effected by b which is represented as b when acting as an effective cause this gives rise to a circular entailment structure f entails b which as b entails φ which entails f and so on such a circular entailment structure results in selfreference or impredicativity and therefore it is claimed noncomputability by a turing machinefigure  represents mr in narrower terms a is a substrate for the production of b under the catalytic action of the enzyme f b is also an enzyme represented as b which catalyses the production of φ from f similarly φ catalyses the production of f from b rather than attempting to represent the whole of metabolism and replacement this second version of mr demonstrates circular entailment and impredicativity in a single network with four components it can thus readily be seen how mr as a network motif  may repeatedly intrude into larger networks if mr’s noncomputability really presents an insuperable obstacle to understanding complex biological systems then by implication this raises questions concerning the usefulness of computational systems biologytable  summarizes previous attempts to simulate mr as long ago as  varela et al simulated an autopoietic system as a tessellation automaton on an ibm  the relevance of this early result to the computability of mr systems only became apparent once letelier et al demonstrated that autopoietic systems constitute a subclass of mr systems by which time several further simulations of autopoietic systems had been developed – cho et al produced an extension to rosen’s mr system by allowing for mutation defined simply as alterations to the system while it is in operation transforming mr from “a description in terms of mappings into a dynamical model familiar to control engineers” this dynamical model was then represented as a hybrid automaton operating with nondeterministic state transitions this automaton was then applied to a real example the xanthophyll cycle in plants other researchers attempted to construct realistic biological network structures that capture all the required properties of mr cardenas et al demonstrated that both a completely abstract system that merely manipulated numbers and a plausible biochemical network both fulfilled the theoretical requirements of mr they then simulated the latter using matlab copasi and metatool  a similar philosophy was adopted by prideaux  who constructed an mr system using the spice circuit simulator software the present study follows previous studies table  in attempting to simulate mr on a computer this is the first such attempt using the process algebra biopepa  table  summary of attempts to adapt  mr  or its

model with parameters chosen so that the model converges to steady state behaviour since odes are a continuous representation of a system that actually consists of discrete components it is also interesting to perform a stochastic simulation based on gillespie’s approach  of the model each stochastic simulation represents one possible trajectory of the model rather than average behaviour which is what the ode analysis provides in general figure  shows a single stochastic simulation and figure  shows the average of ten such simulations illustrating the smoothing effect of averaging over multiple simulations at steady state there are  molecules of a approximately  of p here we chose to use p instead of φ  of b  of f  of pb  of fa and  of bf the ode analysis can be performed for larger number of molecules by appropriately scaling the rate constants and an analysis for a with an initial quantity of  molecules is given in the additional file  figure  ode analysis for the

mr model parameters and initial values as for figure  the explanation for the fact that the parameter regime in figures  and  is more likely to produce a simulation with a finite lifespan whereas the parameter regime shown in figures     and  more consistently survives beyond the  time unit point appears to be related to the steady state values of b f and p that are obtained in each simulation in the former case these values are closer to zero than in the latter case and hence it is more likely for two of these species to reach zero at the same time which brings all reactions to a haltwe have also modelled the stu model presented in piedrafita et al in biopepa our biopepa model agrees with the ode analysis presented in that paper and also allows us to do stochastic simulation the results of the simulation not shown demonstrate that when stu is modelled stochastically it is a possibility that all reactions cease close to the initial time when molecule counts are low but that if the species can be established in sufficient numbers then the reactions are likely to continue indefinitely discussionrosen’s mr system has been encoded in the biopepa process algebra and this representation has been simulated in the biopepa java eclipse tool in some runs the system achieves a steady state and in others it exhibits initial activity and then becomes quiescent similar to results from other simulations  due to the use of a stochastic sampling algorithm identical input parameters can occasionally produce either “life” or “death” mr is therefore shown to be a fragile system under certain parameters and starting conditions vulnerable to small perturbations but nevertheless one that can on occasions achieve a metabolic equilibrium study of the behaviour of the model under an exhaustive range of input parameters has however not been performed it is possible that the system is more fragile in certain input ranges than others but that remains unknownthis paper represents the latest in a handful of attempts to produce realizations of mr in computers table  it differs from previous versions in that it uses as its starting point the diagrammatic representation of mr figure  rather than any of the mathematical formulations our simulation represents a hypothetical universe where biological networks are structured precisely as described by mr what therefore are its implications for rosen’s thesis that mr network structures are noncomputable given the demonstrated activity in figures      and  one might jump to the conclusion that rosen’s theory has been falsified but for several subtle reasons it is not possible to state this without reservationsprevious attempts to reexpress mr in mathematical terms that might be more conducive to construction of a turing computable model have often met with the response that they misrepresent in some way the structure of mr for instance goertzel’s transformation of mr in category theory into a representation in division algebra  was dismissed by louie for the reason that it altered the entailment structure  similarly the reexpression of mr in terms of λcalculus by mossio and colleagues  omitted a crucial component  the latter is of particular significance since anything that can be represented in terms of λcalculus can be encoded in the computer language lisp and is therefore by implication turingcomputable this insistence that no alternative mathematical expression of mr has correctly captured the entailment structures has also been extended to practical attempts to simulate mr on computers for instance louie takes this stance  relative to the work of prideaux   insisting it is merely a simulation of mr and not a successful computation of the model this issue of simulation versus modelling has also been a subject of much discussion in the field of autopoietic systems a case has been made that autopoietic systems are subsets of mr  within the autopoietic field the issue of turing computability has been much debated –  those persuaded of the computability of autopoietic systems have therefore deduced that mr must also be turingcomputable  nevertheless it has also been maintained that autopoietic systems as constructed so far in software are not congruent with mr entailment structures   the relevance of this debate to the computability or otherwise of mr depends entirely on the validity of the parallel drawn between mr and autopoietic systems for which there is still only a single derivation the model presented here is also open to the same potential criticism that we have distorted the entailment structure of mr or have not completely achieved the requirement for all entailments to be internal to the system insofar as our biopepa realization of mr resembles prideaux’s spice realization  it is vulnerable to louie’s same criticism of the latter  if that criticism is accepted nevertheless we believe that all the necessary productive or perhaps one might say the synthetic entailments represented by arrows in figures  and  are captured in our biopepa representation rosen did not specify within the context of mr where the raw material for a was to be obtained or how to prevent its dissipation or that of any of the other components the questions of how to define ancillary system properties such as the boundaries of the reaction compartment arise only when one insists on forcing mr into a biologically plausible contexta related issue concerns the way that the entailment structure of mr is translated into software processes biopepa is used to simulate mr in both stochastic and deterministic ways in the stochastic implementation the entailment structure is “sampled” meaning that one randomly chosen entailment will update the whole system state based on the rules of that entailment and the existing system conditions in the deterministic version there is no such “sampling” but we set an arbitrary starting condition which determines the subsequent development of the system the deterministic version is obviously the one closest to rosen’s notion of entailment but given that its behaviour is indistinguishable from the average of hundreds of runs of the stochastic version we do not believe that this issue is importantthe second potential criticism is that the unfolding of the system through time in both stochastic and deterministic versions of the simulation is represented by a sequence of states rosen was quite explicit that relational systems such as mr do not have states since states are by rosen’s definition a feature of systems where the entailment comes from outside the system ie systems existing in a changing environment  all computational simulations of mr to date are temporal and pass through a sequence of states at this point systems biologists may insist that all models must of necessity have states since organisms like computers exist in time however many of our standard representations of biological networks are statefree without it being much commented on for example the diagrams of metabolic cycles found in biochemistry textbooks have no explicit time component statefree does not therefore necessarily imply atemporality merely a condition of representation we consider this issue to be unresolvedwe now turn to issues related to computability and whether mr is noncomputable the first issue is that of definition of computability  the theory of computation in general and specifically the definition of computability applies to partial functions ie those that need only be defined on a proper subset of their input set the computability of a function does not require termination for an input value on which that function is not defined so it is not necessary for a turing machine computing that function to terminate for every input this issue of partial versus total functions meaning those defined over all inputs is raised in the appendix of mossio et al  cárdenas et al in their rebuttal of that paper state that rosen’s definition of computability requires termination after a finite number of steps presumably regardless of the input however as suggested by mossio et al in their appendix rosen’s notion of computability is nonstandard since if the function is not defined for an input the standard definition of computability does not require termination if rosen’s definition of computability does not match current mathematical understanding of computation then it severely weakens his argument about the noncomputability of lifethe second item we discuss is impredicativity one of the foundations of relational biology’s claim that mr is not computable is the existence of an impredicative set within its entailment structure when developed in category theory   however impredicativity in and of itself is insufficient to ensure noncomputability for example recent work in theoretical computer science has produced techniques for rendering impredicative sets nonwellfounded sets or sets defined coinductively as predicative ones   this opens the possibility of transforming mr in such a way as to eliminate its impredicative sets and show its turingcomputability some initial work has been done on applying hypersets a method for representing impredicative and predicative sets under a single graphical notation to mr  however this is not fully worked out with respect to mr as yetmossio et al expressed the basic mr system in λcalculus using recursion to capture the impredicativity they then used a fixed point operator to identify functions for f b and φ they emphasise that “…rosen’s definitional infinite regress is perfectly handled by recursion in particular as formalized in the λcalculus”  page  since the expression of a function in the λcalculus and computability of the function by a turing machine are equivalent this means that mossio et al purport to have shown that a general form of the mr system can be expressed as a computable function however this has been questioned by cárdenas et al on the grounds that mossio et al do not accurately represent mr specifically that they fail to capture the difference between b as product and b as catalyst see figures  and  this refers to the original formulation of mr by rosen as a depiction of a whole living system where b represents the totality of the products of metabolism from nutrient sources represented by a only a subset of those products would have a catalytic function and they are represented as b since the present adaptation of mr represents a single metabolic pathway b and b are the same entity it should be noted that this is one respect in which our simulation differs from that of prideaux  who treated b and b as separate entities and incorporated a conversion parameter between themthis brings us to the search for such predicted real mr systems some of the work on simulation of mr has involved attempts to define a plausible biological network that satisfies the constraints applied by the model    however it is also possible to approach this from the opposite direction given that a large amount of data is now available from the systems biology world on the structure of real biological networks it may be possible to search known networks for topological structures similar to mr the simplicity of mr interpreted in its microform with four entities and three reactions suggests that it would be extremely common defining mr as a network motif and searching for it in databases of networks would appear to be straightforward  however there is one major obstacle to this namely that mr mixes two kinds of reactions synthetic and regulatory that are frequently represented separately lerman et al call these mmodels and emodels respectively for instance classical metabolic diagrams mmodels frequently feature reaction intermediates and omit information on the catalysts of those reactions likewise genetic regulatory network diagrams emodels tend to represent which genes activate or interact with others without necessarily specifying any of the products of those reactions the search for real examples of mr would be best focussed on models combining both metabolic and expression data lerman et al have produced such a model which they call an me model for thermotoga maritima available in systems biology markup language sbml  the resources to answer this question are therefore beginning to become available and this would seem to be the obvious next step in the integration of relational and systems biology conclusionsmr is presented here in a version using the process algebra biopepa this is the latest in a series of attempts to realise mr in software form under some input parameter configurations the system can achieve a stable active state whereas with others it dies as in real living systems stochastic factors influence the outcome this “lifelike” property suggests to us that computational relational biology is possible provided it is recognised that its computational component will consist of openended processes methodsbiopepa is a quantitative process algebra specifically designed for modelling the interaction of proteins and other molecules  it was developed from the stochastic process algebra pepa which was introduced for modelling the behaviour and performance of artificial systems such as computer networks  a molecular species s is expressed in biopepa as follows where a…an are reaction names k…kn are stoichiometric coefficients and the operators op…opn are each one of the following   indicates the role of s is as a product   indicates the role of s is as a reactant   indicates the role of s is as an activator or catalyst  − indicates the role of s is as an inhibitor species are then combined to form a model where there are p species s through to sp and their associated molecule counts or concentrations x through to xpto make this more concrete consider the reactions in the mr model it consists of three enzymatic reactions of the form where s is the substrate e is the enzyme and p is the product considering one of them here we chose to use p instead of φ this can be expressed as the three bimolecular reactions b  p → pb at rate l  pb → p  b at rate l  pb → p  f at rate l  which show how the substrate binds to the enzyme after which the substrate and enzyme unbind or alternatively the product is created and the enzyme is freed these three species can be expressed in biopepa using the following text considering reaction rl this shows that both p and f are products of the reaction and pb is the only reactant in each case the stoichiometric coefficient is one meaning that only one molecule of each species is involved in the reaction the rate at which this reaction takes places is specified by using mass action furthermore the rates of the other reactions can be defined by again using mass action where l l and l are rate constants just considering these four species the overall model in its initial state could then have the form where there are binit molecules of b and pinit molecules of p and no molecules of either f or pba similar approach is used to express in biopepa and the rate constants used are m m and m the reaction requires a slight modification since the amount of a remains constant as it is provided by the environment the rate constants for this reaction are k k and k additionally each of b f and p have a degradation term which is also mass action based so the rate equation consists of a rate constant multiplied by the current quantity of the species the rate constants are d d and d respectively the full biopepa model is contained in the additional file  and the biopepa eclipse plugin can be downloaded from httpbiopepaorgthe style of definition that biopepa uses is reagentcentric which means that the reaction capabilities of each species are defined as opposed to the reactioncentric notation a → b it is easy to switch between these two notations and additional file  figure s provides output from the biopepa eclipse plugin tool illustrating the reactioncentric description of the biopepa model one of the advantages of biopepa is that a model can be defined once and then different types of analysis can be performed declarations
