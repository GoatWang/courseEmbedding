areinvestmentreturnsacrazyquilt rethinkrisk whymarkettimingworks markettimingworkswhenitmattersmost communityoutreach as seen in the august  issue of financial planning magazine rethink risk by jerry c wagner   passive asset allocation simply isnt enough these days advisers should also consider dynamic diversification strategies   the bear market of the last three years has clearly shown the weakness of the primary tool used by the investment advisory industry to manage risk — passive asset allocation while it has its place as one method of risk control within an investor’s portfolio it is not the only method financial advisers owe it to their clients to understand alternative methods of risk reduction and to be prepared to implement those tools when appropriate they should now broaden their horizons and also consider market timing dynamic asset allocation and strategic diversification many planners may be using a passive asset allocation portfolio because it’s the only method they know to manage risk basically they use historical statistics of return risk and correlation to allocate a portfolio among different asset classes or funds representing those asset classes once they make the initial allocation these planners review the portfolio quarterly yearly or whenever they can drag the client back in for an appointment they then reconsider the allocations based on the investor’s circumstances and risk tolerance make small changes and rebalance the portfolio to the proper percentage allocations passive asset allocation is risk management based on combining noncorrelated asset classes to create a portfolio with risk lower than the average risk of its component parts because it’s passive it cannot respond to evolving market conditions by definition it can only deliver mediocre returns the average return of its component holdings it takes almost superhuman discipline requiring proponents not only to hold on to investments that have already taken serious losses but also to sell portions of the top performers in order to buy more of the losing investments last it subscribes to the almost unamerican ethic that if you work less at your investing you’ll do better in reallife experience over the last five years financial professionals using passive asset allocation have become somewhat disillusioned returns seriously lagged during the bull market and then adding insult to injury losses were deeper than expected during the market crash previously noncorrelated asset classes were suddenly moving in lockstep as prices collapsed the financial press responded with frontpage stories speculating loudly about the “asset allocation hoax” but there was no hoax only a failure to understand that there is no holy grail approach to investing there are other options and market timing despite being one of the most criticized terms in the lexicon of investing is one of them many mutual funds and variable annuities consistent with their obvious conflict of interest on the sub ject denounce it yet it seems to be forever winning over converts in a recent comprehensive study of the advisory industry financial research corp of boston found that active management was the fastest growing segment of the financial adviser industry the industry’s trade association the society of asset allocators and fund timers saafti has grown from five firms in  to hundreds today the promise of market timing is of course to buy low and sell high will rogers professing to know the secret of market timing said “if it don’t go up don’t buy it” it differs dramatically from passive asset allocation in that it is not diversified and usually involves a  in –  out investment in the asset class with the highest probability of advancing based on the market timer’s system or skill still the conventional wisdom on the street is that studies show market timing doesnt work continued     connect   lets work together since  flexible plan investments has been

markettimingworkswhenitmattersmost communityoutreach it’s a rare financial professional who has not seen a callan chart also referred to as a periodic table of investment returns the chart harkens us back to the periodic table that used to adorn every science classroom in our high school days the classic callan chart has rows and columns of multicolored boxes resembling a crazy patchwork quilt drawn from all the colors of the rainbow in the example below each of its  columns represents one of the last  years within each column are boxes each colored a unique hue to represent a given index and each containing the annual return of that index finally the eight rows in each column rank the colored boxes in order of their performance for each column year summary among the most popular tools used by registered reps are callan charts or the periodic table of investment returns a staple of fund wholesalers and advisors alike they are used to graphically illustrate to financial consumers the need to diversify and the impossibility of market timing yet upon closer inspection the charts seem to provide a guide to better returns with less risk than the equally weighted asset allocation portfolios they are so often used to promote the difference is all in the assumptions made continued since  flexible plan investments has been dedicated to preserving and growing wealth through
