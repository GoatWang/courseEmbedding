involved in many of the most prominent high yield financings of the preceding two decades for companies including rjr nabisco beatrice foods and storer communications the argosy group focused on debt underwriting private placements sales and trading proprietary special situation investing and restructuring advisory assignments for highly leveraged companies argosy created a niche raising high yield debt acquisition by cibcedit see also canadian imperial bank of commerce and cibc wood gundy in april  cibcs investment banking subsidiary then known as cibc wood gundy announced the acquisition of the argosy group in  cibc wood gundy later cibc world markets acquired the argosy group the predecessor of trimaran the acquisition of argosy marked an aggressive push by cibc into the us investment banking business prior to that point cibc had never done a junk bond deal argosys three major principals had worked on some of the biggest junk bond deals of the s while at drexel burnham lambert the  argosy employees that cibc acquired would constitute the core of what would become cibcs high yield group and the cibc argosy merchant banking funds that were responsible for among other things the  billion windfall that cibc would earn from its early investments in global crossing the argosy principals also managed two collateralized debt obligation vehicles known as caravelle funds i and ii with the acquisition of argosy in  and oppenheimer  co in  the center of gravity of cibc’s investment banking operations began to shift toward the united states cibc’s high yield group began to develop a reputation for financing complex leveraged buyout transactions and worked closely with several of the leading private equity firms cibc provided financing for many of the leading private equity firms of this period including apollo management hicks muse kohlberg kravis roberts  co thomas h lee partners and willis stein  partners bloom heyer and kehler took on increasing responsibilities within cibc world markets ultimately as vice chairmen of the bank and coheads of leveraged finance the three argosy founders had responsibilities for leveraged loan and highyield sales trading and research debt private placements restructuring advisory and financial sponsor coverage they were also responsible for the creation and management of multiple special situations investment funds and collateralized debt obligation funds and the creation of a major leveraged finance business in the uk in the aggregate these businesses had several hundred employees in the united states canada and the uk investment in global crossing –edit see also global crossing in  the cibc argosy merchant funds backed gary winnick and his telecom venture global crossing which embarked on a project to build optical fiber cable connections under the ocean between europe and north america bloom heyer and kehler the heads of the cibc argosy merchant funds and all former drexel bankers were former associates of winnick from his days in the s as a salesman at drexel burnham lambert under michael milken they were also instrumental in providing global crossing with  million in equity financing before the company went public cibc would ultimately realize a gain estimated to be  billion from its relatively small equity investment in global crossing making it one of the most profitable investments by a financial institution in the s the investment is also thought to have personally generated millions of dollars for bloom heyer and kehler cibc’s investment in global crossing provided a considerable boost for its investment banking operations in the us and for bloom heyer and kehler in fact cibc’s gain on its investment in global crossing would represent more than  of the banks profits in  trimaran was founded in  effectively on the back of the success of the global crossing investment in april  trimaran closed on a  billion fund with capital provided primarily by cibc spinout from cibc world markets –edit see also cibc world markets the investment banking operations of cibc world markets reached their peak in  and  when the bank cracked the top ten of us issuers of high yield bonds and the top twenty in mergers and acquisitions advisory from  through  the high yield group at cibc world markets had grown to more than  and had raised more than  billion of high yield debt following the crash of the dotcom bubble and the shutdown of the high yield markets in late  cibc world markets began to suffer a series of setbacks in july  the wall street journal profiled cibc world markets chronicling the rapid decline of the bank from the peaks of wall streets league table rankings at the same time the high yield group was restructured with the original argosy group founders focusing their responsibilities on their new trimaran capital partners fund and the older cibc argosy merchant funds bloom heyer and kehler were succeeded by managing directors edward levy and bruce spohler who had worked previously at argosy and drexel together with bill phoenix by  as a result of these developments the cibc implemented a strategy to reallocate resources and capital away from the riskier cibc world markets division in favor of its retail operations as part of this reallocation and in an effort to reduce conflicts between the bank’s principal investments and its financial sponsor clients the trimaran operations would subsequently spinout completely from cibc world markets trimaran capital partners became independent of cibc in february  investments –edit although trimaran had made some investments in telecom and internet startups in  and had also made investments in companies such as iasis healthcare and village voice media the bulk of its capital from its  billion vintage private equity fund was uninvested after its first year and a half from the end of  through mid trimaran actively pursued new investments in december  trimaran partnered with kohlberg kravis roberts  co to purchase the transmission business subsidiary itc transmission from dte energy in  trimaran completed a number of leveraged buyouts including reddy ice

stewart clothing and auto parts manufacturer accuride corporation in  trimaran would add charlie brown steakhouse which would later acquire bugaboo creek steak house in  trimaran would also make investments in jefferson national and broadview networks among others successor entitiesedit trimaran initially attempted to raise a third  billion fund in  but existing limited partners expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the firm had not fully invested its existing fund and had yet to produce sufficient realizations to merit a new commitment although trimaran is still in operation managing its existing investment funds the key professionals in the firm have embarked on a number of different ventures mistral equity partners spinout edit following the failure of trimaran to raise its third fund in march  andrew heyer one of the three founders of trimaran left the firm to launch a new buyout firm mistral equity partners was founded with a team from trimaran to make investments in the consumer and retail industries mistral successfully raised an approximately  million fund trimaran capital partners iii has a preliminary target range of  million to  billion trimaran plans to

without heyer trimaran was never successfully raised mistral formed a partnership with the schottenstein family which has acquired wellknown retailers such as american eagle outfitters dsw shoe warehouse and filenes basement the family made an equity commitment to the new mistral fund and jay schottenstein assumed a parttime advisory role with the firm joint venture with nelson peltz  trian
