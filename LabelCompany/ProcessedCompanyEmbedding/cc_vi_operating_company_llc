system is called vi visual editor alternate editors for unix environments include pico and emacs a product of gnu the unix vi editor is a full screen editor and has two modes of operation command mode commands which cause action to be taken on the file and insert mode in which entered text is inserted into the file in the command mode every character typed is a command that does something to the text file being edited a character typed in the command mode may even cause the vi editor to enter the insert mode in the insert mode every character typed is added to the text in the file pressing the esc escape key turns off the insert mode while there are a number of vi commands just a handful of these is usually sufficient for beginning vi users to assist such users this web page contains a sampling of basic vi commands the most basic and useful commands are marked with an asterisk  or star in the tables below with practice these commands should become automatic note both unix and vi are casesensitive be sure not to use a capital letter in place of a lowercase letter the results will not be what you expect to get into and out of vi to start vi to use vi on a file type in vi filename if the file named filename exists then the first page or screen of the file will be displayed if the file does not exist then an empty file and screen are created into which you may enter text  vi filename edit filename starting at line    vi r filename recover filename that was being edited when system crashed to exit vi usually the new or modified file is saved when you leave vi however it is also possible to quit vi without saving the file note the cursor moves to bottom of screen whenever a colon  is typed this type of command is completed by hitting the return or enter key  xreturn quit vi writing out modified file to file named in original invocation   wqreturn quit vi writing out modified file to file named in original invocation   qreturn quit or exit vi  qreturn quit vi even though latest changes have not been saved for this vi call moving the cursor unlike many of the pc and macintosh editors the mouse does not move the cursor within the vi editor screen or window you must use the the key commands listed below on some unix platforms the arrow keys may be used as well however since vi was designed with the qwerty keyboard containing no arrow keys in mind the arrow keys sometimes produce strange effects in vi and should be avoided if you go back and forth between a pc environment and a unix environment you may find that this dissimilarity in methods for cursor movement is the most frustrating difference between the two in the table below the symbol  before a letter means that the ctrl key should be held down while the letter key is pressed  j or return   or downarrow move cursor down one line  k or uparrow move cursor up one line  h or backspace   or leftarrow move cursor left one character  l or space   or rightarrow move cursor right one character   zero move cursor to start of current line the one with the cursor   move cursor to end of current line   w move cursor to beginning of next word   b move cursor back to beginning of preceding word   return or g move cursor to first line in file   nreturn or ng move cursor to line n   return or g move cursor to last line in file screen manipulation the following commands allow the vi editor screen or window to move up or down several lines and to be refreshed   f move forward one screen   b move backward one screen   d move down forward one half screen   u move up back one half screen   l redraws the screen   r redraws the screen removing deleted lines adding changing and deleting text unlike pc editors you cannot replace or delete text by highlighting it with the mouse instead use the commands in the following tables perhaps the most important command is the one that allows you to back up and undo your last action unfortunately this command acts like a toggle undoing and redoing your most recent action you cannot go back more than one step  u undo whatever you just did a simple toggle the main purpose of an editor is to create add or modify text for a file inserting or adding text the following commands allow you to insert and add text each of these commands puts the vi editor into insert mode thus the esc key must be pressed to terminate the entry of text and to put the vi editor back into command mode  i insert text before cursor until esc hit   i insert text at beginning of current line until esc hit  a append text after cursor until esc hit   a append text to end of current line until esc hit  o open and put text in a new line below current line until esc hit  o open and put text in a new line above current line until esc hit changing text the following commands allow you to modify text  r replace single character under cursor no esc needed   r replace characters starting with current cursor position until esc hit   cw change the current word with new text starting with the character under cursor until esc hit   cnw change n words beginning with character under cursor until esc hit   eg cw changes  words   c change replace the characters in the current line until esc hit   cc change replace the entire current line stopping when esc is hit   ncc or cnc change replace the next n lines starting with the current line stopping when esc is hit deleting text the following commands allow you to delete text  x delete single character under cursor   nx delete n characters starting with character under cursor   dw delete the single word beginning with character under cursor   dnw delete n words beginning with character under cursor   eg dw deletes  words   d delete the remainder of the line starting with current cursor position  dd delete entire current line   ndd or dnd delete n lines beginning with the current line   eg dd deletes  lines cutting and pasting text the following commands allow you to copy and paste text   yy copy yank cut the current line into the buffer   nyy or yny copy yank cut the next n lines including the current line into the buffer   p put paste the lines in the buffer into the text after the current line other commands searching text a common occurrence in text editing is to replace one word or phase by another to locate instances of particular sets of characters or strings use the following commands   string search forward for occurrence of string in text   string search backward for occurrence of string in text   n move to next occurrence of search string   n move to next occurrence of search string in opposite direction determining line numbers being able to determine the line number of the current line or the total number of lines in the file being edited is sometimes useful    returns line number of current line at bottom of screen    returns the total number of lines at bottom of screen   g provides the current line number along with the total number of lines in the file at the bottom of the screen saving and reading files these commands permit you to input and output files other than the named file with which you are currently working   r filenamereturn read file named filename and insert after current line the line with cursor   wreturn write current contents to file named in original vi call   w newfilereturn write current contents to a new file named newfile   w smallfilereturn write the contents of the lines numbered  through  to a new file named smallfile   w prevfilereturn write current contents over a preexisting file named prevfile the

liability company or llc is a separate and distinct legal entity  this means that an llc can have its own tax identification number and bank account  the primary advantage of an llc is that its owners have limited liability meaning that under most circumstances the owners are not personally liable for the liabilities and debts of the llc  for example if an llc is forced into bankruptcy the owners will not be required to pay the llcs debts with their own money  if the assets of the llc are not enough to cover the debts and liabilities the creditors generally cannot look to the owners managers or officers for relief an llc can be taxed either as a passthrough entity like a sole proprietorship or partnership or as a regular corporation  by default an llc is taxed as a passthrough entity where the owners just pay taxes on the profits of the llc at their individual tax rates  this is different from a regular c corporation which pays a corporate tax on its net income before distributing profits to the stockholders the owners as dividends  when the corporation distributes profits the stockholders also must pay income tax on these dividends  most llc owners choose to have the profits passthrough so that taxes are only paid once on the profits totallegal™ has helped over  million people nationwide make essential personal and business legal documents themselves   pro se planning inc
