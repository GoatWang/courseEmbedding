 introduction  the present invention is directed to integrated radio transceivers and digitizers integrated baseband processors and device controllers digital interfaces there between architectures and partitions for same to licensing methodologies for same and for other products and services  a wireless networking systems  fig  is a block diagram of a wireless networking system  including an antenna system  a radio transceiver “transceiver”  an interface module  and a controller  the transceiver  alternatively represents a combination of receivers and transmitters the wireless networking system  interfaces between a shared medium illustrated here as a radio frequency “rf” medium and a device  the device  can be one or more of a variety of devices including without limitation a computer a printer or other electronic devices the wireless networking system  includes a receive path and a transmit path as described below  a high level operational description of the networking system  is now provided on the receive side the transceiver  receives an rf signal  through the antenna system  the rf signal  originates from a remote transceiver or other source the transceiver  downconverts the rf signal  to baseband analog signals  which are provided to the interface module  the interface module  digitizes and decodes the analog baseband signals  and formats the resultant information for the controller  the interface module  provides the formatted information to the controller  through an interface  the controller  controls andor enables the device  to take appropriate action on the transmit side the device  communicates to the remote transceiver or other destination through the controller  the interface module  and the directconversion radio transceiver  in a similar fashion  the wireless network system  is now described in detail the transceiver  is preferably a directconversion radio transceiver throughout the remainder of this disclosure therefore the transceiver  is interchangeably referred to as a directconversion radio transceiver  the directconversion radio transceiver  can be any of a variety of directconversion radio transceivers existing now or developed in the future for example and without limitation the directconversion radio transceiver  can be implemented as a directconversion radio transceiver disclosed in one or more of the following  us pat no  titled “method and system for downconverting electromagnetic signals” us pat no  titled “method and system for frequency upconversion” and  us application no  titled “method and system for downconverting an electromagnetic signal and transforms for same” filed apr    all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties alternatively the radio transceiver  is implemented with other direct conversion technology andor combinations thereof  the directconversion radio transceiver  frequency downconverts rf signals  from an rf frequency to an intermediate or baseband frequency in essentially a single step or process the directconversion radio transceiver  preferably upconverts baseband signals for transmission in essentially a single step or process as well the directconversion radio transceiver  optionally demodulates andor modulates as part of the frequency conversion process the directconversion radio transceiver  differs from conventional heterodyne transceivers in that heterodyne transceivers perform frequency conversion incrementally over multiple intermediate frequency “if” stages where each if stage includes associated filtering andor amplification  the transceiver  interfaces with the interface module  through a combination analogdigital interface  more specifically the transceiver  provides analog signals  to the interface module  and receives analog signals  from the interface module  the analog signals  include downconverted inphase “i” and quadraturephase “q” baseband receive signals similarly the analog signals  include i and q baseband transmit signals which are to be upconverted for transmission through the antenna system  the analog signals  andor  optionally include one or more analog control signals the transceiver  also sends andor receives digital signals  tofrom the interface module  the digital signals  can include for example timing andor control signals  the interface module  converts between the analog signals  and  on the transceiver  side and digital packetized data on the controller  side the interface module  includes a digitizer  a baseband processor  and a medium access controller “mac”  the digitizer  receives the analog signals  from the radio transceiver  and digitizes them the digitizer provides digitized i and q receive signals  to the baseband processor  the digitizer  also receives digital i and q baseband transmit signals  from the baseband processor converts them to the i and q analog transmit signals  and provides them to the transceiver   the baseband processor  performs one or more of a variety of processes on the digitized i and q receive signals  the processes can include without limitation timing recovery carrier recovery filtering signal conditioning equalization gain adjustments error correction decoding demodulation and the like resultant data is provided to the mac  through an interface   the baseband processor  receives transmit data from the mac  through the interface  the baseband processor  performs one or more of a variety of processes on the transmit signals the processes can include without limitation encoding filtering and modulation the baseband processor  provides the resultant digital i and q transmit data  to the digitizer  for conversion to the i and q analog transmit signals   the mac  arbitrates access between the shared rf medium and the device  the mac  preferably includes one or more devices andor functions eg software in accordance with ieee  standards incorporated herein by reference in their entirety ieee  is described in a number of publicly available documents such as for example ohara and petrick “ handbook—a designers companion” standards information network ieee press  incorporated herein by reference in its entirety the mac  is commonly known as a link layer device functions performed by the mac  can include without limitation network management authentication queing data transmission and reception error detection and retransmission  the mac  receives data from the baseband processor  through the interface  and formats eg packetizes the received data in accordance with requirements of the controller  the mac provides the packetized digital data to the controller  via the interface  similarly the mac  receives packetized data from the controller  decodes it and provides the resultant data to the baseband processor  through the interface   the analog i and q signals  and  communicated between the transceiver  and the digitizer  tend to be noisy and tend to have relatively low amplitudes and power levels as a result the transceiver  and the interface module  must typically be located relatively close to one another this limits design options it would be useful if the transceiver  and the interface module  communicated with one another through an alldigital digital interface or substantially alldigital interface because it would allow the directconversion radio transceiver  and the interface module  to be located remote to one another ie positioning can be determined independently of one another accordingly the present invention provides a digital interface between the transceiver  and the interface module   fig  is a block diagram of a network system  wherein the digitizer  is partitioned or integrated with the transceiver  in an integrated transceiverdigitizer  the integrated transceiverdigitizer  is preferably implemented in a monolithic package such as a multichip module “mcm” or integrated circuit “ic” all or substantially all of the analog signals  and  are thus contained within the integrated transceiverdigitizer  this allows the integrated transceiverdigitizer  to interface with the interface module  through a digital interface  the digital interface  can be a serial bus a multiplexed bus a parallel bus a direct connection andor combinations thereof example implementations of the digital interface  are described below with respect to figs  and  for example  the digital interface  allows the integrated transceiverdigitizer  to be positioned remote independently from interface module  for example the integrated transceiverdigitizer  can be located near the antenna system  and the interface module  can be located near the controller  andor in any other convenient location additional details of this aspect of the invention are described below  it would also be useful to reduce the number of pin interconnections in network systems referring back to fig  the interface module  typically includes approximately  pins for interfacing between the transceiver  and the controller  fig  is an example pinlayout representation of the interface module  including approximately  pins a first set of pins  interface with the radio transceiver  the first set of pins  corresponds to the interface  a second set of pins  interface with the controller  the second set of pins  corresponds to the interface  it would be useful to reduce the number of pins accordingly the present invention provides integration designs that reduce the number of pins this is described below with respect to figs a and b  fig a is a block diagram of a network system  wherein the baseband processor  and mac  are partitioned with andor integrated with the controller  in an integrated bbpmaccontroller  as a result of the integration the second set of pins  that were previously required to couple the interface module  to the controller  are essentially eliminated the reduces system integration effort and thus integration costs as well as providing other advantages that will be apparent to persons skilled in the art the integrated bbpmaccontroller  is preferably implemented within a monolithic package preferably but not limited to a single ic  in the example of fig a the digitizer  is integrated with the radio transceiver  as described above with respect to fig  alternatively the digitizer  is not integrated with the radio transceiver   another advantage provided by the network system  relates to quantity discount pricing for marketbased reasons controller designersmanufactures typically fabricate or order the fabrication of relatively large numbers of controllers integrated circuits “ics” the cost per ic typically decreases with increasing order size interface module designersmanufactures on the other hand typically fabricate or order the fabrication of relatively small numbers of interface module ics fabrication costs per ic typically decrease with increasing order sizes as a result when the baseband processor  and the mac  are integrated with the controller  quantity pricing associated with the controller  can be extended to the baseband processor  and the mac   the present invention includes other partitionintegration configurations as well for example fig b is a block diagram of a network system  wherein the transceiver  the digitizer  and the baseband processor  are integrated in a transceiverdigitizerbbp  the integrated transceiverdigitizerbbp  is preferably implemented as a multichip module or an integrated circuit the integrated transceiverdigitizerbbp  interfaces with the mac  through a digital interface  other particular options are possible depending on a number of factors such as available fabrication technologies available bill of material cost allocation customer preference etc  b technology licensing methodologies  the present invention also relates to methods for licensing technology between designersmanufactures of transceivers interface modules and controllers in practice transceivers interface modules and device controllers are typically designed andor manufactured by different entities as a result there is an inherent inertia that inhibits the type of cooperation needed to identify the problems and implement the technology transfers needed to implement the inventions described herein the inventors of the present invention are skilled in a number of technology fields these skills have enabled them to identify and solve technology issues described herein in order to facilitate technology transfers described herein the inventors have also devised licensing methodologies as described below with respect to figs  and   ii wireless networking systems  details of the networking system  illustrated in fig  are now described  a radio transceiver and analog interface  fig  is an example detailed block diagram of the transceiver  the transceiver  includes a txrx switch  that selectively operates the transceiver  in a receive mode or a transmit mode the txrx switch  is controlled by a digital transmitreceive control signal e the txrx switch  is illustrated in the receive mode in the receive mode the rf signal  fig  is received by the antenna system  filtered in a bandpass filter  and downconverted in a receive signal path  in the example of fig  the receive signal path  includes a low noise amplifier “lna”  an automatic gain control “agc” module  iq direct downconverters  and receive analog circuitry  the lna  is controlled by a lna gain control signal b which is typically a digital signal the agc module  is controlled by a rxagc signal c which is typically an analog signal the receive analog circuitry  can include for example and without limitation filters amplifiers agcs dc offset “controls and the like” the receive signal path  outputs baseband analog i and q signals irx a and qrx b respectively which are provided to the digitizer   in a transmit mode analog i and q transmit signals itx a and qtx b respectively are received from the digitizer  the i and q transmit signals itx a and qtx b are upconverted in a transmit signal path  filtered in the bandpass filter  and provided to the antenna system  in the example of fig  the transmit signal path  includes transmit analog circuitry  iq direct upconverters  one or more filters   and a programmable amplifier  the transmit analog circuitry  receives a transmit level control signal d which in the example of fig  is an analog signal alternatively the transmit level control signal d is a digital signal  the transceiver  optionally includes a diversity switch  controlled by a digital diversity antenna selection signal a the diversity switch selectively activatesdeactivates portions of the antenna system   the transceiver  further includes one or more frequency synthesizers  that receive a reference clock  from an oscillator  and a programming interface signal c the oscillator  also provides one or more reference clocks d to the baseband processor  based on the description herein construction and operation of the components within the transceiver  will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts  in summary in the example of fig  the interface  includes at least the following analog signals  baseband analog i and q signals irx a and qrx b respectively  baseband analog i and q transmit signals itx a and qtx b  rxagc signal c and  transmit level control signal d  in addition one or more of the following nominally digital signals may instead be analog signals  diversity antenna selection signal a  lna gain control signal b  programming interface signal c  reference clock d and  transmitreceive control signal e  because of the relatively low signal strength noise and other factors associated with analog signals the transceiver  and the interface module  must typically be physically positioned relatively close to one another in practice transceivers interface modules andor communication networks are typically designed manufactured andor integrated by different entities the physical positioning requirement between the transceiver  and the interface module  therefore requires that the different entities coordinate with one another during design manufacturing andor integration of the network system  this is cumbersome and adds additional costs to the network system  accordingly the present invention provides methods and systems for digitally interfacing between transceivers and interface modules this reduces the level of coordination required between the different entities and thus reduces costs associated with network systems  b interface module   digitizer  fig  is an example block diagram of the interface module  wherein the digitizer  receives the baseband analog i and q signals irx a and qrx b respectively and outputs the baseband analog i and q transmit signals itx a and qtx b respectively the rx agc signal c and the transmit level control signal d the digitizer  is illustrated with analogtodigital converters “adcs”  and digitaltoanalog converters “dacs”  the adcs  and the dacs  can be implemented with any of a variety of designs including without limitation comparators  the remaining digital signals including diversity antenna selection signal a lna gain control signal b programming interface signal c and reference clock d and transmitreceive control signal e are communicated between the transceiver  and the baseband processor  without passing through the digitizer    baseband processor  the baseband processor  includes a receive path  and a transmit path  the receive path  receives digitized baseband i and q signals  and  respectively which are filtered by i and q receive filters  and  respectively filtered i and q signals  and  are demodulated and optionally equalized in a demodulatorequalizer  a demodulated baseband signal  is decoded by a decoder  the output of which is provided to a descrambler  the output of the descrambler  is provided to a receive mac interface  which outputs receive data  to the mac   in the transmit path  a transmit mac interface  receives transmit data  from the mac  the transmit mac interface  outputs transmit data  to a plcp interface  which outputs transmit data  to a scrambler  the scrambler  outputs transmit data  to an encoder  which outputs i and q transmit data  and  respectively to i and q transmit filters  and  respectively the i and q transmit filters  and  output i and q transmit data  and  respectively to dacs b and c which convert the i and q transmit data  and  to analog i and q transmit signals a and b respectively   mac  the mac  receives the receive data  from the baseband processor  and reformats the receive data  according to requirements of the controller  the mac  typically reformats the receive data  into packetbased data for transmission to the controller  the mac  provides the reformatted receive data to the controller  through a host interface  and through the interface  an example of the interface  is represented by the second set of pins  in fig  as described above  the mac  receives transmit data from the controller  through the host interface  and reformats the transmit data according to requirements of the baseband processor  the mac  typically depacketizes the transmit data and provides the depacketized data to the baseband processor  as the transmit data   c controller  the controller  can be any of a variety of controllers including without limitation printer controllers and the like or other electronicdata processing devices fig  is an example block diagram of the controller  the controller  communicates with the interface module  through the interface  using a packetbased format  iii integrated radio receivers and digitizers

example block diagram of a bidirectional implementation of digital interface  including the transceiverside digital circuitry  from fig  fig  is an example block diagram of a bidirectional implementation of the digital interface  including controllerside digital interface circuitry  within the internal cell  of fig   in fig  the transceiverside digital interface circuitry  includes a plurality of latches  a bidirectional bus driver  and an address control and timing circuit  the transceiverside digital interface circuitry  can be considered as part of the digital interface  the digital interface  further includes a bus  the bus  can be designed with a bandwidth that is suitable for a sample rate andor symbol rate associated with the transceiver   in operation in the transmit path digital data from the baseband processor  is presented to the bidirectional bus driver  from the bus  at an appropriate time the address control and timing circuits  control the bidirectional bus driver  to present the digital data to an essentially parallel bus  which presents the digital data to each of the latches  the address control and timing circuits  then control a selected one of the latches  to pass the digital data through the selected latch  similarly in the receive path digital receive data is presented to the latches d and e from the analogtodigital converters a and b respectively the address control and timing circuits  control a selected one of the latches d and e to pass the digital data through the selected latch and onto the parallel bus  the address control

licensing methodologies  flowchart  of fig a depicts a licensing methodology in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention flowchart  shall be described with reference to an example licensing scenario  shown in fig b flowchart  begins with step  where control immediately passes to step   in step  a licensor  develops andor obtains the rights to a primary technology  the primary technology  can represent any intangible or tangible technologyrelated object including but not limited to any knowhow trade secret product apparatus component system schematic layout plan architecture mathematical model data formulae algorithm method guideline practice prototype cell library core semiconductor topography report as well as any tool software firmware andor hardware andor any portions or combinations portions thereof andor any intellectual property right relating thereto the primary technology  may or may not be subject to one or more patents andor patent applications the licensor  has rights to license andor otherwise grant access to the primary technology  to third parties although the licensor  may or may not own the primary technology  and may or may not have developed the primary technology   in step  the licensor  develops andor obtains rights to secondary technology  the secondary technology  can represent any intangible or tangible object including but not limited to any knowhow trade secret product apparatus component system schematic layout plan architecture mathematical model data formulae algorithm method guideline practice prototype cell library semiconductor topography report as well as any tool software firmware andor hardware andor any portions or combinations portions thereof andor any intellectual property right relating thereto the secondary technology  may or may not be subject to one or more patents andor patent applications the licensor  has rights to license andor otherwise grant access to the secondary technology  to third parties although the licensor  may or may not own the secondary technology  and may or may not have developed the secondary technology  in the example fig b the secondary technology  is operable with the primary technology   with reference to fig b consider an example scenario where the licensor  is trying to introduce the primary technology  and possibly the secondary technology  into a market where competing technologies exist it is noted that reference is made to this example for illustrative purposes only and is not limiting such competing technologies may have already been adopted by customers to some extent some of these customers may have incorporated these competing technologies into their products or may be in the process of doing so accordingly there is inertia with such customers to continue to use the competing technologies such inertia makes it difficult for the licensor  to convince customers to use the primary technology  because doing so would involve some expense on the part of customers to transition to the primary technology  in the licensing methodology of fig a according to an embodiment of the invention the licensor  uses the secondary technology  to help overcome such inertia  in particular in step  the licensor  uses the secondary technology  to help enhance and promote the market for the primary technology  in an embodiment in step  the licensor  provides the secondary technology  to licensee  via a license agreement  containing terms favorable to the licensee  by doing so the licensee  is more likely to use secondary technology  in its applications once the licensee  has adopted secondary technology  for its applications licensee  is also more likely to use primary technology  for its applications since primary technology  is operable with secondary technology  also once licensee  begins using the secondary technology  there may be a number of additional advantages for also using primary technology  thus in step  by encouraging the licensee  to use the secondary technology  in its applications licensor  is also able to encourage the licensee  to use the primary technology  for the licensee s applications  there are any number of ways for the licensor  to provide favorable terms in the license agreement  to the licensee  in step  for example the licensor  may license the secondary technology  to the licensee  in accordance with a payment structure favorable to the licensee  in the example of fig b the licensee  is shown as paying a first licensee fee  to the licensor  in exchange for access to secondary technology  in an embodiment the first license fee  could be relatively low given the market for example the first license fee  may comprise an access fee coupled with periodic royalty payments in an embodiment the access fee is set at a relatively low level relative to the market for comparable intellectual property and may be payable over time and the periodic royalty payments are also set at a low level or are waived altogether other favorable payment structures will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts  there are other ways for the licensor  to provide favorable terms in the license agreement  to the licensee  in step  for example the licensor  can structure the license agreement  so that options to access other fields of use or options to access other geographical areas or volume discounts may vest at relatively low thresholds other ways that favorable license terms can be provided to licensee  in step  will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts  as described above the license agreement  includes a first license fee  that is paid by the licensee  to enable the licensee  to access and have rights to the secondary technology  in an embodiment the licensee agreement  also provides for other license fees that are a function of the manner in which the licensee  bundles the secondary technology  with other technology or are a function of the manner in which the licensee  enables access to the secondary technology  by third parties  the licensor  can further encourage the licensee  to purchase and utilize the primary technology  by structuring the license agreement  so that such additional licensee fees are lower if the licensor  uses the primary technology  as opposed to other competing technologies  this is represented by steps   and  in flowchart   accordingly in step  if licensee  uses the licensor s primary technology  with the secondary technology  then the licensee  pays to the licensor  a second license fee  for example the licensee  may use the secondary technology  to produce a product  prior to selling the product  the licensee  may bundle integrate or otherwise couple the product  with the licensor s primary technology  such that the primary technology  operates with the secondary technology  in this case the licensee  pays to the licensor  a second license fee  in step   if instead the licensee  uses other technology  with the secondary technology  in the product  then the licensee pays a third license fee  to the licensor  the third license fee  is greater than the second license fee  for example the licensee  may use the secondary technology  to produce a product  prior to selling the product  the licensee  may bundle integrate or otherwise couple the product  with other technology  such that the primary technology  operates with the other technology  in this case the licensee  pays to the licensor  the third license fee  in step   there may be cases where the licensee  chooses not to couple either the primary technology  or other technology  to the secondary technology  in the product  however the licensee  may enable access to the secondary technology  via an access point  for example such that a third party  can bundle connect integrate or otherwise couple some technology  with the secondary technology  the technology  could include any technology including the primary technology  andor other technology  if the licensee  enables such access to the secondary technology  in the product  then the licensee  is obligated in step  to pay a fourth license fee  to the licensor  the fourth license fee  is greater than the second license fee  the relationship of the third license fee  to the fourth license fee  ie which is greater is implementation dependent  accordingly the licensee  pays the lowest license fee ie the second license fee  by using the licensor s primary technology  with the secondary product  through structuring the license agreement  in the manner just described the licensor  can provide additional motivation and incentive for the licensee  to adopt the licensor s primary technology  and secondary technology   as discussed above the licensee  uses the secondary technology  to produce a product  fig  illustrates an example product  the product  includes secondary technology  and application technology  the product  may also include an access point  as discussed above  the application technology  represents any intangible or tangible technologyrelated object as defined above the application technology  includes functionality that is specific to the particular application of the product  for example in the case where the product  is a printer or component thereof the application technology  is a printer component such as but not limited to a printer controller in the case where the product  is a computer the application technology  is a computer component such as but not limited to a computer controller such as a microprocessor  in an embodiment in step  of fig a the secondary technology  licensed by the licensor  to the licensee  comprises a synthesizable or compilable core software product representing one or more integrated circuit functions in one or more descriptor languages such as but not limited to verilog vhdl c etc the secondary technology  can be synthesized or compiled using design tools and can be instantiated in an integrated circuit design in whole or in part or used as machine instructions to a processor hardware or software the secondary technology  may also include other components such as for example associated design files andor knowhow  also in an embodiment the application technology  similarly comprises a synthesizable or compilable core software product  in an embodiment the licensee  instantiates the application technology  and the secondary technology  in an integrated circuit design such that the application technology  and the secondary technology  are embedded in one or more integrated circuits this embodiment is referred to as an integrated solution and is applicable in any integrated circuit operation or initiative this embodiment is advantageous because it enables the licensee  to more efficiently and economically achieve high volumes of products  particularly when compared to nonintegrated solutions accordingly this integrated embodiment of the invention provides further incentive and motivation for the adoption of the licensor s primary technology  and the secondary technology  particularly in the context of the licensing methodology  of fig a  the licensing methodology of the invention shall now be further described with reference to an example embodiment involving wireless products the operation of this wireless licensing embodiment is illustrated in flowchart  of fig  reference in flowchart  to wireless technology is for illustrative purposes only and is not limiting the invention is applicable to any technology as will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts based on the teachings contained herein  flowchart  shall be described with reference to the example licensing scenario  shown in fig b wherein primary technology  represents a wireless transceiver module and the secondary technology  represents a baseband processor bbp andor a media access controller mac the transceiver module baseband processor and media access controller may be those described elsewhere herein or may be others that are commercially available now or in the future  in step  the licensor  obtains rights to a transceiver module  step  corresponds to step  in fig a in an embodiment the transceiver module  is based on heterodyne communication technology in an alternative embodiment the transceiver module  is based on direct conversion technology in an embodiment the transceiver module  is implemented using dd direct conversion technology from parkervision inc of jacksonville fla dd

licensor  obtains rights to bbp andor mac ip  step  is similar to step  in fig a the bbpmac ip  is operable with the transceiver module   in step  to enhance the market of the licensor s transceiver module  the licensor  provides the bbpmac ip  to the licensee  at favorable terms step  corresponds to step  in fig a  the licensee  uses the bbpmac ip  to produce a product  for example the licensee  may instantiate the bbpmac ip  into a bbpmac modules in the product  in a manner that the bbpmac modules operates with other components in the product  see for example fig  and the associated discussion above such design development and fabrication of the product  will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts  in step  if the licensee  uses the licensor s transceiver module  with the bbpmac module  in the product  then the licensee  pays a second license fee  to the licensor  for example if the licensee  integrates combines connects couples or otherwise provides the licensor s transceiver module  with the bbpmac module  in the product  then the licensee  pays a second license fee  to the licensor  step  corresponds to step  in fig a  in step  if the licensee  uses some other transceiver module  with the bbpmac module  in the product  then the licensee  pays a third license fee  to the licensor  for example if the licensee  integrates combines connects couples or otherwise provides some other transceiver module  with the bbpmac module  in the product  then the licensee  pays a third license fee  to the licensor  preferably the third license fee  is lower than the second license fee  step  corresponds to step  in fig a  if the licensee  does not couple any transceiver technology to the bbpmac module  in the product  but enables access to the bbpmac module  in the product  such that a third party  could couple a transceiver  or other device to the bbpmac module  perhaps via an access point  then in step  the licensee  pays a fourth license fee  to the licensor  preferably the fourth license fee  is lower than the second license fee  step  corresponds to step  in fig a  the wireless technology licensing example of the invention shall now be further described with reference to flowchart  shown in fig  flowchart  shall be described with reference to the example licensing scenario  shown in fig   in step  to enhance the market of the licensor s transceiver module  the licensor  licenses the bbpmac ip  to the licensee  at favorable terms step  is similar to step  in fig a in the example scenario  of fig  the transceiver module  includes a second digital interface a an example of which is described elsewhere herein it is noted that the interfaces   are preferably digital interfaces but may also comprise analog or hybrid combinations of digital and analog interfaces  in step  the licensee  uses the bbpmac ip  to produce a product  for example the licensee  may instantiate embed integrate install couple etc the bbpmac

associated discussion above such design development and fabrication of the product  will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts the product  includes a first digital interface  for enabling access to the bbpmac module  from outside the product  an example of first digital interface  is described elsewhere herein  in step  t is determined whether the licensee  has coupled a transceiver to the bbpmac module  in the product  via the first digital interface  more generally it is determined whether the licensee  has coupled a second interface  to the first digital interface  in the product  if the licensee  has coupled some device to the bbpmac module  in the product  via the first digital interface  then step  is performed  in step  it is determined whether the licensee  has coupled the licensor s transceiver module  to the bbpmac module  in the product  such coupling would have been achieved by coupling the second digital interface a of the transceiver module  to the first digital interface  of the bbpmac module  if the licensee  has coupled the licensor s transceiver module  to the bbpmac module  in the product  then step  is performed in step  the licensee  pays a second license fee  to the licensor   if in step  it is determined that the licensee  has coupled some other transceiver module  to the bbpmac module  in the product  then step  is performed such coupling would have been achieved by coupling the second digital interface b of the transceiver module  to the first digital interface  of the bbpmac module  in step  the licensee  pays a third license fee  to the licensor   if in step  it is determined that the licensee  has not coupled a transceiver to the bbpmac module  in the product  or more generally has not coupled a second digital interface  to the first digital interface  then step  is performed in step  it is determined whether the licensee  has enabled access to the bbpmac module  such access may be enabled for example by including and activating the first digital interface  in the product  if the licensee  has enabled access to the bbpmac module  then step  is performed in step  the licensee  pays a fourth license fee  to the licensor   preferably both the third license fee  and the fourth license fee  are greater than the second license fee  there are embodiments however when the second license fee  is equal to or greater than the third license fee  andor the fourth license fee  for example this may be the case where the licensor s transceiver module  is superior to other technologies andor has gained commercial success  the discussion so far has focused on the license fees paid by the licensee  to the licensor  in some embodiments however the licensor  receives licensing revenue from other sources for example the licensor  may receive a fifth license fee  andor a sixth license fee  from the parties who produce the other transceiver modules   having the second digital interfaces b c this may be the case for example where the licensor  exerts control over the intellectual property related to the pertinent transceiver bbpmac andor interface technologies through the use of patents trade secrets trademarks or other vehicles or combinations thereof  the use of the first digital interface  and the second digital interface  provides the present invention with additional advantages for example by using a digital interface the transceiver   or  can be positioned independent of the position of the bbpmac module  this is described elsewhere herein in greater detail because of this advantage there is additional incentive and motivation for the adoption of the licensor s bbpmac  and transceiver module   in the example scenarios described above the licensor  has access to at least two technologies the primary technology  and the secondary technology  see fig b for example with reference to fig  the licensor  has access to the transceiver module  and the bbpmac   this illustrates another advantage of the invention it is often the case that customers must interact with multiple suppliers to gain access to the technologies needed to design and implement a given product such suppliers may not cooperate with one another andor may not design their respective technologies for use with the technologies of others accordingly customers are faced with the sometimes difficult tasks of acquiring the technologies and then integrating the technologies for use with each other  in contrast according to the invention the licensor  is a single source for the primary technology  and the secondary technology  accordingly it is much easier for customers to gain access to the primary technology  and the secondary technology  since they need only interface with the licensor  also in embodiments the primary technology  is designed for easy andor enhanced operation with the secondary technology  thus integration of the primary technology  with the secondary technology  is simplified also performance advantages are gained by using the primary technology  with the secondary technology   thus embodiments of the invention exhibit additional advantages to further encourage adoption of the licensor s primary technology  and secondary technology   viii conclusion  the present invention has been described above with the aid of functional building blocks illustrating the performance of specified functions and relationships thereof the boundaries of these functional building blocks have been arbitrarily defined herein for the convenience of the description alternate boundaries can be defined so long as the specified functions and relationships thereof are appropriately performed any such alternate boundaries are thus within the scope and spirit of the claimed invention one skilled in the art will recognize that these functional building blocks can be implemented by discrete components application specific integrated circuits processors executing appropriate software and the like andor combinations thereof  when used herein the terms “connected” andor “coupled” are generally used to refer to electrical connections such electrical connections can be direct electrical connections with no intervening components andor indirect electrical connections through one or more components  while various embodiments of the present invention have been described above it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only and not limitation thus the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by any of the abovedescribed exemplary embodiments but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents   previous patent system architecture and communications for an asset

quality  value  meets expectations  how sweet the sound is a book about the worst things in the world written in the best way possible thats what i told my friend the night she asked me what i was reading i cant summarize the plot that would ruin the twists and turns that come with souls being revealed i cant quote enough passages to show you the full power of the writing you need to absorb it for yourself the way amy sorrells writes it doesnt feel like this story is just being told it feels like its being unfolded in front of you word by word starting on thanksgiving day  and stretching almost two years this is anni and comforts story anniston is a harlan family granddaughter comfort is her aunt being a harlan means having a legacy of hardearned money pristine reputations and a lovely pecan plantation thats how it looks to the outside on the inside its a legacy of parental disconnection bitterness spiritshattering child abuse and shame held close to the chest that world as the harlans knew it is about to fall apart and anni and comfort will need their abba father to knit the fractured crushed pieces together into a pattern of healing amy sorrells has taken the biblical story of tamar and given it new life as she said shes not satisfied with the ending of tamars story and we shouldnt be either the idea of tamar spending the rest of her days as a silent abandoned woman is not good enough thats why she dedicated this book to the silent ones the ones whove yet to recover their voices you will probably have to set this book down from time to time squeeze it in your hand and pray that the light that amy shines into this story would pour clearly into every darkness youll have to pause and reread sentences that make you feel the weather and smell the air and taste the food youll long for comfort to see herself as her god and her beloved solly see her youll want anni to have a chance to make a true friend may every comforttamar find real hope and believe the truth about herself and may every anni receive the wise guidance that she needs to find her special place in the world last thought i did love ernestine as a character shes the kind of lady i want to grown up and be intelligent calm wise and ready to reach out her hands and do for those she loves thank you david c cook for my review copy was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate iola new zealand age  gender female  stars out of  excellent debut april   iola new zealand age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  annis childhood comes to an end the day her uncle rapes his sister then witnesses her uncle murdering her father in a confrontation about the attack sunny and her mother move in with her grandparents who are themselves grieving the loss of their two sons but in different ways vaughan tries to comfort anni and her mother but princella seems to think everything is the fault of annis father the story is told from the viewpoints of anni and comfort annis aunt its written in first person but the two viewpoints are so different there is no chance of confusing them anni is thirteen so her scenes are filtered through her adolescence and first love while comforts scenes are bleak to begin with but thaw as the novel progresses as she begins to hear from god and accept his healing how sweet the sound isnt a light read it moves between the present and the past and as we read we learn more about the histories of the characters and the events that have shaped them into the people we see i have to say that i didnt think a teenager anni should be exposed to some of these facts but shes had to grow up fast princella was a fascinating character one i find difficult to understand even now this is the debut novel from amy k sorrells and ill certainly be keen to see what comes next her writing is excellent particularly the feel of her words and her use of imagery and she dealt with some difficult subjects in a sensitive manner worth

who have lost their voice march   melissa quality  value  meets expectations  first of all isnt this cover beautiful i love the soft colors they draw me in as lovely as the cover is the real treasure lies inside this is my kind of book my kind of story my kind of healing and redemption this is much more than a novel it is a voice for those who have suffered under the hands of abuse its a song for those who have lost their melody under the weight of their shame so many times in this book i wanted to cry there are many powerful moments sentences that stopped me in my tracks and had me praising or praying or simply saying yes amy is an extremely talented author who has a very real grasp of the pain of abuse the silence and deceit that follows her words are lyrical and drenched in the spirit i loved so much the conversations that comfort had with abba the words amy wrote are words abba has spoken over me like a healing balm for my wounded soul and even though anni is only thirteen i could still relate to her i so wanted her to find hope and for the truth to come out in revealing truth there is freedom i could say so much more about this book but i will stop here you need to check this
