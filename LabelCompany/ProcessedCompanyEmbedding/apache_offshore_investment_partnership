partnership and the operating partnership the term “partnership” as used herein refers to the investment partnership or the operating partnership as the case may be these financial statements have been prepared by the partnership without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec they reflect all adjustments that are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods on a basis consistent with the annual audited financial statements all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature certain information accounting policies and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations although the partnership believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the partnership’s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december    which contains a summary of the partnership’s significant accounting policies and other disclosures       summary of significant accounting policies as of september    the partnership’s significant accounting policies are consistent with those discussed in note  of its consolidated financial statements contained in the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december    use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the estimate of proved oil and gas reserve quantities and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom and the assessment of asset retirement obligations actual results could differ from those estimates oil and gas property the partnership follows the fullcost method of accounting for its oil and gas property under this method of accounting all costs incurred for both successful and unsuccessful exploration and development activities and oil and gas property acquisitions are capitalized the net book value of oil and gas properties may not exceed a calculated “ceiling” the ceiling limitation is the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves discounted at  percent per annum estimated future net cash flows are calculated using endofperiod costs and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous  months held flat for the life of the production except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements for a discussion of the calculation of estimated future net cash flows please refer to note supplemental oil and gas disclosures to the consolidated financial statements contained in the partnership’s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december      any excess of the net book value of proved oil and gas properties over the ceiling is charged to expense and reflected as “additional depreciation depletion and amortization” in the accompanying statement of consolidated operations such limitations are tested quarterly the partnership recorded noncash writedowns of the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties totaling  during the third quarter of  and  during the first nine months of            new pronouncements issued but not yet adopted   in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update “asu”  statement of cash flows topic  asu  seeks to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted the partnership is currently evaluating the provisions of asu  and assessing the impact if any it may have on its statement of consolidated cash flows   in june  the fasb issued asu  financial instruments  credit losses  the standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments including trade and other receivables heldtomaturity debt securities and loans and requires entities to use a new forwardlooking expected loss model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year beginning after december   including interim periods within that fiscal year  the partnership does not expect to adopt the guidance early entities will apply the standards provisions as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted the partnership is evaluating the new guidance and does not believe this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements   in february  the fasb issued asu  a new lease standard requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for most leases classified as operating leases under previous us gaap the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted the partnership will be required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements the partnership is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements   in may  the fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb issued a joint revenue recognition standard asu  the new standard removes inconsistencies in existing standards changes the way companies recognize revenue from contracts with customers and increases disclosure requirements the guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in march  the fasb issued asu  which provides further clarification on the principal versus agent evaluation the guidance is effective for the annual and interim periods beginning after december   the standard is required to be adopted using either the full retrospective approach with all prior periods presented adjusted or the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings on the opening balance sheet the partnership is currently evaluating the level of effort needed to implement the standard the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements and whether to use the full retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach         receivable from  payable to apache corporation the receivable frompayable to apache represents the net result of the investing partners’ revenue received and expenditures paid in the current month generally cash in this amount will be paid by apache to the partnership or transferred to apache in the month after the partnership’s transactions are processed
