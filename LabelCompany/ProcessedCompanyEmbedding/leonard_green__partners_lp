boom the s leveraged buyout and the venture capital bubble the s dotcom bubble to the credit crunch v t e leonard green was founded by leonard i green in  after separating from gibbons green and van amerongen ltd gibbons green a merchant bank which he had cofounded in  with edward i gibbons and lewis w van amerongen the firms eponymous founder leonard i green died in  leaving the firm to be run by john g danhakl peter j nolan and jonathan d sokoloff who had been greens bankers at drexel burnham lambert and donaldson lufkin  jenrette prior to joining the firm the firms predecessor gibbons green had completed over  transactions with an aggregate purchase price of over  billion from  through its dissolution in  and was among the earliest practitioners of the leveraged buyout and management buyout among its most notable transactions were the purchase of budget rent a car  from transamerica in  as well as the acquisition of kash n karry food stores the firm completed the  buyout of purex industries but had to withdraw from the  buyout of insurer argonaut due to the stock market crash in that year the dissolution of gibbons green and the formation of leonard green  partners is primarily attributed to the failure of two buyouts ohio mattress company and shellerglobe corporation ohio mattress company – on march   ohio mattress company known for its sealy and stearns  foster brands was sold to gibbons green for  billion a price that many observers at the time believed too high in august  the junk bond market collapsed leaving first boston unable to redeem hundreds of millions it had lent for the leveraged buyout of ohio mattress the amount lent  million was  percent of first boston’s equity capital and the bank was forced to seek a bailout from credit suisse leading subsequently to the takeover of first boston and the formation of cs first boston the incident became known as the burning bed and ultimately gibbons green was forced to offer a significant equity stake in the company in order to secure financing shellerglobe corporation – gibbons green bought shellerglobe jointly with united technologies from knoll international when the company faced an immediate cash squeeze united technologies stepped in to buy out the shares owned by gibbons green with no other options gibbons green realized a  million loss on its investment

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
