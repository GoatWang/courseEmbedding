charter time warner cable time charter cable twc maxx remember that whole thing where time warner cable was going to install really fast internet upgrades and try to suck a whole lot less yeah that well like the twc brand itself the plan to upgrade cities to “maxx” internet speed is now being left in the dust thanks to the acquisition by charter in  and  twc made much ado of its plans to upgrade its cable and broadband services to a new service called “twc maxx” maxx was to give users speeds up to  mbps where previously twc’s broadband options had maxed out at around  mbps austin was up first followed by charlotte — both conveniently enough google fiber cities new york and los angeles were also both on the list but as tech news site dsl reports first noticed those plans have been put on hold hard dsl reports first noticed the pause in june but it started even earlier than that in late may charter has its own upgrade plans it plans to put in place across the twc footprint they now own but those plans offer slower speed at higher prices than the maxx rollout promised charter’s offering a   mbps option and a   mbps one where twc’s upgrade plans topped out at  mbps and claimed not to increase prices above what subscribers were earlier paying to get  mbps and even that charter and twc customers should perhaps not hold their breath waiting for the company’s cfo said in a recent earnings call that the twc digital strategy is “largely put on hold” as the company works on charter’s all digital strategy in “the beginning of next year” it makes sense that charter would be putting a hold on any twconly programs since now they are faced with the complicated task of trying to integrate and unify three companies’ worth of systems — and they’ve long since said they’re killing off the twc brand in order to bring all subscribers together as charter spectrum customers analysts have also long supposed that in the immediate aftermath of the merger customers could expect service and customer care to languish with improvements on the mediumtolong term horizon at best related better faster stronger time warner cable promises free internet speed boost to charlotte customers before

is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first
