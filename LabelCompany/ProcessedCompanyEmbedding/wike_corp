consumer need society and government their products range from consumer products to military weaponry and private space travel in the past ocp gambled in markets traditionally regarded as nonprofit such as hospitals prisons and space exploration ocp has sought to fully privatize detroit michigan into delta city a manufactured municipality governed by a corporatocracy with fully privatized services — such as police — and with residents exercising their representative citizenship through the purchase of shares of ocp stock they also serve as part of the militaryindustrial complex according to ocp executive dick jones we practically are the military as a compensation and as a way to privatize it ocp intended to give something back to the city and shared a contract to run local law enforcement their projects included ed robocop and robocop  ocp owns and operates a privatized detroit police department and have been known to secretly work with criminals to achieve their goals however the city owed them  millions and as a result ocp cut the salary of the police officers to  as the old man explained to mayor marvin kuzak that the debt was in ocps favor in the event of default ocp shall have the uncontested right of foreclosure on all city assets kanemitsu takeoveredit ocp was eventually bought by a japanese zaibutsu the kanemitsu corporation as a kanemitsu subsidiary ocp remains in charge of the destruction of old detroit and the construction of delta city by the end of the movie ocps brutal policies concerning delta city are brought to light many of ocps majority shareholders sell their stock and ocp itself is forced into bankruptcy ocp was shut down and went bankrupt for good after robocop  by the time of robocop prime directives ocp is shown being manipulated by a brash young executive who through murder and reallocation of resources ascends to power to automate delta city under a new artificial intelligence called saint this is manipulated by the cyberterrorist david kaydick who seeks the destruction of the human race through a virus called legion that can be introduced to computers and human beings alike in a flashback robocop remembers working with john cable during the conversation cable claims that detroit is a cesspit and murphy suggests well maybe this whole ocp thingll do some good get some more money in the department some more cops on the street to which john replies you really wanna trust your life to a conglomerate murphy what a smart man this series ignores robocop  and  this is why ocp is still around and not bankrupt like at the end of robocop  ocp from prime directives is an alternate reality from robocop has nothing do with robocop  or  divisionsedit lowe technologies mediabreakmedianet

kanemitsu zaibatsu must have detroit gone in order to make way for delta city he appears to be more aggressive than the previous ceo as he fires one of the employees for insulting the big boss donald johnson johnson is still working for ocp but obviously just doesnt have what it takes to get to the top he is now ocps senior vice president he does threaten sgt warren reed near the end of the movie implying that reed would lose his job if he didnt join the rehabs this is one of his darker moments had ocp continued he may have been ceo one day jeff fleck the apparent head of security concepts after having his ass chewed by the ceo he pays a visit to dr marie lazarus and robocop he decides that robocop should not have the right to make a choice and wants his emotions removed later on he is

distributors reported a net loss of  on average dateline nbcedit in  dateline nbc featured a critical report based on a yearlong undercover investigation of business practices of quixtar the report noted that the average distributor makes only about  per year and that many of the high level distributors singing the praises of quixtar are actually making most of their money by selling motivational books tapes and seminars not quixtars cosmetics soaps and electronics in fact about twenty high level distributors are part of an exclusive club one that those hundreds of thousands of other distributors dont get to join for years only a privileged few including bill britt have run hugely profitable businesses selling all those books tapes and seminars things the rank and file distributors cant sell themselves but are told over and over again they need to buy in order to succeed the program said that a quixtar recruiter featured in the report made misleading and inconsistent statements about quixtar earnings during a recruitment meeting and had an outstanding arrest warrant for cocaine possession from the mids in a response to the dateline report quixtar published a dateline quixtar response on its official website in its response quixtar among others stated we learned that two dateline producers had registered as ibos and for months had been conducting undercover research for the story which included using a hidden camera to videotape meetings and conversations with ibos the producers did not identify themselves as working for dateline instead feigning interest in building a business powered by quixtar the site also stated that datelines story on quixtar boiled down to the complaints of three former independent business owners ibos – one of whom is a competitor – and ignored the hundreds of thousands of ibos powered by quixtar who are achieving their goals see alsoedit companies portal multilevel marketing referencesedit  amway

distributors reported a net loss of  on average dateline nbcedit in  dateline nbc featured a critical report based on a yearlong undercover investigation of business practices of quixtar the report noted that the average distributor makes only about  per year and that many of the high level distributors singing the praises of quixtar are actually making most of their money by selling motivational books tapes and seminars not quixtars cosmetics soaps and electronics in fact about twenty high level distributors are part of an exclusive club one that those hundreds of thousands of other distributors dont get to join for years only a privileged few including bill britt have run hugely profitable businesses selling all those books tapes and seminars things the rank and file distributors cant sell themselves but are told over and over again they need to buy in order to succeed the program said that a quixtar recruiter featured in the report made misleading and inconsistent statements about quixtar earnings during a recruitment meeting and had an outstanding arrest warrant for cocaine possession from the mids in a response to the dateline report quixtar published a dateline quixtar response on its official website in its response quixtar among others stated we learned that two dateline producers had registered as ibos and for months had been conducting undercover research for the story which included using a hidden camera to videotape meetings and conversations with ibos the producers did not identify themselves as working for dateline instead feigning interest in building a business powered by quixtar the site also stated that datelines story on quixtar boiled down to the complaints of three former independent business owners ibos – one of whom is a competitor – and ignored the hundreds of thousands of ibos powered by quixtar who are achieving their goals see alsoedit companies portal multilevel marketing referencesedit  amway

about  per year and that many of the high level distributors singing the praises of quixtar are actually making most of their money by selling motivational books tapes and seminars not quixtars cosmetics soaps and electronics in fact about twenty high level distributors are part of an exclusive club one that those hundreds of thousands of other distributors dont get to join for years only a privileged few including bill britt have run hugely profitable businesses selling all those books tapes and seminars things the rank and file distributors cant sell themselves but are told over and

meeting and had an outstanding arrest warrant for cocaine possession from the mids in a response to the dateline report quixtar published a dateline quixtar response on its official website in its response quixtar among others stated we learned that two dateline producers had registered as ibos and for months had been conducting undercover research for the story which included using a hidden camera to videotape meetings and conversations with ibos the producers did not identify themselves as working for dateline instead feigning interest in building a business powered by quixtar the site also stated that datelines story on quixtar boiled down to the complaints of three former independent business owners ibos – one of whom is a competitor – and ignored the hundreds of thousands of ibos

distributors reported a net loss of  on average dateline nbcedit in  dateline nbc featured a critical report based on a yearlong undercover investigation of business practices of quixtar the report noted that the average distributor makes only about  per year and that many of the high level distributors singing the praises of quixtar are actually making most of their money by selling motivational books tapes and seminars not quixtars cosmetics soaps and electronics in fact about twenty high level distributors are part of an exclusive club one that those hundreds of thousands of other distributors dont get to join for years only a privileged few including bill britt have run hugely profitable businesses selling all those books tapes and seminars things the rank and file distributors cant sell themselves but are told over and over again they need to buy in order to succeed the program said that a quixtar recruiter featured in the report made misleading and inconsistent statements about quixtar earnings during a recruitment meeting and had an outstanding arrest warrant for cocaine possession from the mids in a response to the dateline report quixtar published a dateline quixtar response on its official website in its response quixtar among others stated we learned that two dateline producers had registered as ibos and for months had been conducting undercover research for the story which included using a hidden camera to videotape meetings and conversations with ibos the producers did not identify themselves as working for dateline instead feigning interest in building a business powered by quixtar the site also stated that datelines story on quixtar boiled down to the complaints of three former independent business owners ibos – one of whom is a competitor – and ignored the hundreds of thousands of ibos powered by quixtar who are achieving their goals see alsoedit companies portal multilevel marketing referencesedit  amway

incorporation the birthplace of apple computer in  steve jobs cofounded the company in the garage of his childhood home on crist drive in los altos california apples first product the apple i invented by apple cofounder steve wozniak was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a keyboard monitor and case the owner of this unit added a keyboard and wooden case the apple ii introduced in  was a major technological advancement over its predecessor apple computer company was founded on april   by steve jobs steve wozniak and ronald wayne the companys first product was the apple i a computer singlehandedly designed and handbuilt by wozniak and first shown to the public at the homebrew computer club apple i was sold as a motherboard with cpu ram and basic textualvideo chips which was less than what is now considered a complete personal computer the apple i went on sale in july  and was marketpriced at   in  dollars adjusted for inflation apple computer inc was incorporated on january   without wayne who sold his share of the company back to jobs and wozniak for  multimillionaire mike markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of  during the incorporation of apple during the first five years of operations revenues grew exponentially doubling about every four months between september  and september  yearly sales grew from  to m an average annual growth rate of  the apple ii also invented by wozniak was introduced on april   at the first west coast computer faire it differed from its major rivals the trs and commodore pet because of its character cellbased color graphics and open architecture while early apple ii models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices they were superseded by the introduction of a  ¼ inch floppy disk drive and interface called the disk ii the apple ii was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer app of the business world visicalc a spreadsheet program visicalc created a business market for the apple ii and gave home users an additional reason to buy an apple ii compatibility with the office before visicalc apple had been a distant third place competitor to commodore and tandy by the end of s apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line the company introduced the apple iii in may  in an attempt to compete with ibm and microsoft in the business and corporate computing market jobs and several apple employees including jef raskin visited xerox parc in december  to see the xerox alto xerox granted apple engineers three days of access to the parc facilities in return for the option to buy  shares  splitadjusted shares of apple at the preipo price of  a share jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface gui and development of a gui began for the apple lisa in  however he was pushed from the lisa team due to infighting jobs took over jef raskins lowcostcomputer project the macintosh a race broke out between the lisa team and the macintosh team over which product would ship first lisa won the race in  and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a gui but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles on december   apple went public at  per share generating more capital than any ipo since ford motor company in  and immediately creating  millionaires – success with macintosh see also timeline of macintosh models the macintosh released in  was the first massmarket personal computer that featured an integral graphical user interface and mouse in  apple launched the macintosh the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language its debut was signified by  a  million television commercial directed by ridley scott that aired during the third quarter of super bowl xviii on january   the commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for apples success and was called a masterpiece by cnn and one of the greatest commercials of all time by tv guide the macintosh initially sold well but followup sales were not strong due to its high price and limited range of software titles the machines fortunes changed with the introduction of the laserwriter the first postscript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price and pagemaker an early desktop publishing package it has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market the macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive macintosh gui in  a power struggle developed between jobs and ceo john sculley who had been hired two years earlier the apple board of directors instructed sculley to contain jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products rather than submit to sculleys direction jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at apple sculley found out that jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which apples board of directors sided with sculley and removed jobs from his managerial duties jobs resigned from apple and founded next inc the same year the macintosh portable released in  was apples first batterypowered portable macintosh personal computer after jobs departure the macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points the socalled highright policy named for the position on a chart of price vs profits jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a  price for the macintosh which they were unable to meet newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in power although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market the highright policy was in full force by the mids notably due to jeanlouis gassées mantra of fiftyfive or die referring to the  profit margins of the macintosh ii this policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on pc clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the macintosh but at far lower price points the company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their highpriced products the christmas season of  was the first in the companys history that saw declining sales and led to a  drop in apples stock price gassées objections were overruled and he was forced from the company in  later that year apple introduced three lower cost models the macintosh classic macintosh lc and macintosh iisi all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand in  apple introduced the powerbook replacing the luggable macintosh portable with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops the same year apple introduced system  a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities it remained the architectural basis for the classic mac os the success of the powerbook and other products brought increasing revenue for some time apple was doing incredibly well introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process the magazine macaddict named the period between  and  as the first golden age of the macintosh apple believed the apple ii series was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the lowend macintosh in the s apple released the macintosh lc and began efforts to promote that computer by advising developer technical support staff to recommend developing applications for macintosh rather than apple ii and authorizing salespersons to direct consumers towards macintosh and away from apple ii the apple iie was discontinued in  – decline and restructuring see also timeline of the apple ii family the penlite was apples first attempt at a tablet computer created in  the project was designed to bring the mac os to a tablet – but was shelved in favor of the newton the success of apples lowercost consumer models especially the lc also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines to address this management introduced several new brands selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets these were the highend quadra the midrange centris line

san jose previously used by maxim integrated in an  million deal stores main article apple store the first apple stores were originally opened as two locations in may  by thenceo steve jobs after years of attempting but failing storewithinastore concepts seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the companys products he began an effort in  to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers and hired ron johnson in  jobs relaunched apples online store in  and opened the first two physical stores in  despite initial media speculation that apple would fail its stores were highly successful bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached us billion in annual sales becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so over the years apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage with  stores across  countries worldwide as of july  strong product sales have placed apple among the toptier retail stores with sales over  billion globally in  in may  angela ahrendts apples current senior vice president of retail unveiled a significantly redesigned apple store in union square san francisco featuring large glass doors for the entry open spaces and rebranded rooms in addition to purchasing products consumers can get advice and help from creative pros – individuals with specialized knowledge of creative arts get product support in a treelined genius grove and attend sessions conferences and community events with ahrendts commenting that the goal is to make apple stores into town squares a place where people naturally meet up and spend time the new design will be applied to all apple stores worldwide a process that has seen stores temporarily relocate or close many apple stores are located inside shopping malls but apple has built several standalone flagship stores in highprofile locations it has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores designs and construction specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes the success of apple stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers who have lost traffic control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at apple stores apples notable brand loyalty among consumers causes long lines of hundreds of people at new apple store openings or product releases due to the popularity of the brand there are numerous job applications many of which from young workers although apple store employees receive aboveaverage pay are offered money toward education and health care and receive product discounts there are limited or no paths of career advancement a may  report with an anonymous retail employee highlighted a hostile work environment with harassment from customers intense internal criticism and a lack of significant bonuses for securing major business contracts apples new store design in union square san francisco new store design in new town plaza hong kong fifth avenue new york city london paris sydney ifc mall store in hong kong barcelona cologne corporate affairs see also list of mergers and acquisitions by apple braeburn capital and filemaker inc corporate culture apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after apple became a fortune  company by the time of the  television commercial apples informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors according to a  report in fortune this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation as the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives it has arguably lost some of its original character nonetheless it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers particularly after jobs returned to the company numerous apple employees have stated that projects without jobss involvement often took longer than projects with it to recognize the best of its employees apple created the apple fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company the apple fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including bill atkinson steve capps rod holt alan kay guy kawasaki al alcorn don norman rich page and steve wozniak steve wozniak and andy hertzfeld in  at apple employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise jobs saw this as a means of having bestinclass employees in every role for instance ron johnson—senior vice president of retail operations until november  —was responsible for site selection instore service and store layout yet had no control of the inventory in his stores this was done by cook who had a background in supplychain management apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability each project has a directly responsible individual or dri in apple jargon as an example when ios senior vice president scott forstall refused to sign apples official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned maps app he was forced to resign unlike other major us companies apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other ceos like country club fees or private use of company aircraft the company typically grants stock options to executives every other year in  apple had  fulltime employees this increased to  fulltime employees the next year a notable hiring decrease largely due to its first revenue decline apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail though its  sec filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base an editorial article in the verge in september  by technology journalist thomas ricker explored some of the publics perceived lack of innovation at apple in recent years specifically stating that samsung has matched and even surpassed apple in terms of smartphone industrial design and citing the belief that apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products he goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole stating yes iteration is boring but its also how apple does business  it enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success he acknowledges that people are wishing for the excitement of revolution but argues that people want the comfort that comes with harmony furthermore he writes that a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem specifically mentioning that walkman didnt have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along but how apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the icloud cloud service with features including universal clipboard in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device as well as interconnected device functionality including auto unlock in which an apple watch can unlock a mac in close proximity he argues that apples ecosystem is its greatest innovation apple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy and has an antileak global security team that recruits from the national security agency the federal bureau of investigation and the united states secret service manufacturing the companys manufacturing procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large profitsapping inventories in  apples profit margins were  percent compared with between  and  percent for most other hardware companies cooks catchphrase to describe his focus on the companys operational arm is nobody wants to buy sour milk during the macs early history apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware instead creating their own this trend was largely reversed in the late s beginning with apples adoption of the pci bus in the  power macs apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as usb agp hypertransport wifi nvme pcie and others in its products firewire is an appleoriginated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as ieee  and is a legally mandated port in all cable tv boxes in the united states apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the indian market in july  during a conference call with investors ceo tim cook said that he loves india but that apple saw larger opportunities outside the region indias requirement that  of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as really adds cost to getting product to market in october  indian apple executives unveiled a plan for selling devices through instalment plans and storewithinastore concepts in an effort to expand further into the market the news followed cooks acknowledgment of the country in july when sales results showed that iphone sales in india grew  during the second quarter of  in march  the times of india reported that apple had sought permission from the indian government to sell refurbished iphones in the country however two months later the application was rejected citing official country policy in may  apple opened an ios app development center in bangalore in february  apple once again requested permission to sell used iphones in the country the same month bloomberg reported that apple was close to receiving permission to open its first retail store in the country in march the wall street journal reported that apple would begin manufacturing iphone models in india over the next two months and in may the journal wrote that an apple manufacturer had begun production of iphone se in the country while apple told cnbc that the manufacturing was for a small number of units labor practices further information criticism of apple inc § labor practices the company advertised its products as being made in america until the late s however as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the s almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad according to a report by the new york times apple insiders believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their american counterparts that made in the usa is no longer a viable option for most apple products in  the mail on sunday reported on the working conditions of the chinese factories where contract manufacturers foxconn and inventec produced the ipod the article stated that one complex of factories that assembled the ipod and other items had over  workers living and working within it employees regularly worked more than  hours per week and made around  per month a little over half of the workers earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company apple immediately launched an investigation after the  media report and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions in  apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding workers rights slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply yearly progress reports have been published since  in  apple admitted that its suppliers child labor practices in china had worsened the foxconn suicides occurred between january and november  when  foxconn chinese  employees attempted suicide resulting in  deaths—the company was the worlds largest contract electronics manufacturer for clients including apple at the time the suicides drew media attention and employment practices at foxconn were investigated by apple apple issued a public statement about the suicides and company spokesperson steven dowling said apple is saddened and upset by the recent suicides at foxconn  a team from apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made the statement was released after the results from the companys probe into its suppliers labor practices were published in early  foxconn was not specifically named in the report but apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws including apples own rules and some child labor existed in a number of factories apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides also in  workers in china planned to sue iphone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean lcd screens one worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses after a high suicide rate in a foxconn facility in china making ipads and iphones albeit a lower rate than that of china as a whole workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves workers in factories producing apple products have also been exposed to nhexane a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products a  bbc investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted despite apples promise to reform factory practice after the  foxconn suicides the pegatron factory was once again the subject of review as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees while the bbc maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since  apple publicly disagreed with the bbc and stated we are aware of no other company doing as much as apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions in december  the institute for global labour and human rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the  workers at a zhen ding technology factory in shenzhen china which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for apples iphone and ipad according to the report workers are pressured into hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks they are also made to reside in primitive dark and filthy dorms where they sleep on plywood with six to ten workers in each crowded room omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers environmental practices and initiatives

consumer as of update apple states that  of its us operations run on renewable energy  of apples data centers run on renewable energy and  of apples global operations run on renewable energy however

netherlands luxembourg and the british virgin islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world according to the new york times in the s apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in hightax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of lowtax subsidiaries on other continents sidestepping income taxes in the late s apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the double irish with a dutch sandwich which reduces taxes by routing profits through irish subsidiaries and the netherlands and then to the caribbean british conservative party member of parliament charlie elphicke published research on october   which showed that some multinational companies including apple inc were making billions of pounds of profit in the uk but were paying an effective tax rate to the uk treasury of only  percent well below standard corporation tax he followed this research by calling on the chancellor of the exchequer george osborne to force these multinationals which also included google and the cocacola company to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their uk revenues elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of uk tax it is a matter of public record that apple inc is the single largest taxpayer to the department of the treasury of the united states of america with an effective tax rate of approximately of  as of the second quarter of the apple fiscal year  in  reuters reported that apple had earnings abroad of  billion which were untaxed by the irs of the united states under us tax law governed by the irc corporations dont pay income tax on overseas profits unless the profits are repatriated into the united states and as such apple argues that to benefit its shareholders it will leave it overseas until a repatriation holiday or comprehensive tax reform takes place in the united states on august   after a threeyear investigation by the eus competition commissioner that concluded that apple received illegal state aid from ireland the eu ordered apple to pay  billion euros  billion plus interest in unpaid taxes specifically the commissioner found that apple had benefitted from irish department of revenue tax rulings that allowed it to split the profits recorded by apple sales international internally between its irish branch and a stateless head office entity lacking employees or premises permitted under irish law until  the chancellor of austria christian kern put this decision into perspective by stating that every viennese cafe every sausage stand pays more tax in austria than a multinational corporation ownership apple inc is a jointstock company registered with the sec as of  december
