call to remind me about the delivery i also received a reminder via email i went on yelp to read the reviews the night before and based on what i read i got really worried  i really did expect the worst  well the day arrived and i couldnt be more pleased the called  mins before  arrived unboxed the tv installed the stand plugged it in and left all within  mins  so i wanted to at least come on here and put a positive review to help tell folks out there to relax a bit  give this company a chance zero zero zerodefinitely not worth the one star this company isnt even worth the chewed piece of gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe but unfortunately its the only rating option i have available please readrun for the hills if you hear the letters xpo out of any companies mouth for shipmentdelivery because frankly it wont happen after  days you will talk to countless representatives and supposed supervisors all of which will lie through their teeth and try and pass the buck to the next guy you may get lucky and get the occasional empty apology that wastes even more of your time because again they dont follow through with anything they say they will and please by any means dont hold your breath waiting for them to pick up their phones and contact you because that phone call will never comeany communication we have exchanged with this company was initiated by myself or my husband im not sure how a company that is run so poorly stays in business we are contemplating taking legal action against them for the atrocious customer service experience and fraudulent services that has led to a mountain of unnecessary distress perhaps when theyre in court under oath theyll have to tell the truth even if it strikes them dead right there lengthy discussion prior to delivery of a fridge via a best buy sales manager about hauling away a fridge  feet down a hall and relocating a fridge  feet up the hall and hooking up the new fridge charge  the sales mgr fails to indicate to xpo how to enter the gate i confirm the delivery  day prior and reiterate i will need to be called to let them thru the gate staying home from work and reading previous bad reviews was anxiety producing but nobody is prepping for brain surgery and i am no fridge virgin xpo calls  minutes out  tailgates into the subdivision rings doorbell not following instructions yet am believer measure twice cut once the man who would not give me his name is a hothead unhinged does not begin to describe his trump like behavior he calls the warehouse with the intent of hauling off the old fridge but not delivering the new one that is sitting in the street all the food i unloaded from the inoperable fridge is packed in ice for  more hour and then a smorgasbord for all after  minutes of calls and his whining about his packet will get him in hot water clueless about this ruining his day it is his job to deliver appliances and best buy is on the phone speaking not to the driver but to me saying make him deliver he tells me now i will be required to sign a waiver not happening i explain that i watched the movers put the fridges in the house and not one door had to be removed asked him to leave the new in line filter intact on the fridge being hauled off he promptly cuts it in two  blown he is pissed i am praying he is not packing i offer him and his buddy who speaks little english a cold drink he declines again he demands i sign a waiver as i will hold him accountable for the dings he is going to put in floors and walls i tell him go slow and no damage will occur he does put the new fridge in the kitchen refuses to install it and drives away i had taken many photos while all of his antics were going on he missed a good tip hope he did not kick the dog when he got home he refused to give me his name until he needed me to sign the completed delivery  hours of lousy cs hubs got on phone with best buy and samsung getting instructions as to why the bad actor failed to hook up the fridge already done a best buy survey at their urgency seems nobody has good luck with this outfit but they all use them in the future supposedly geek squad will do all appliance installations wont repeat this scenario life is too short if the option was zero stars that is what id pick we are still in the middle of this nightmare i attempted to replace a refrigerator for my tenant the existing frig is not cooling or freezing properly our first delivery attempt the delivery man from xpo last mile courier measured the space and said the frig would not fit he did not bring the frig up the stairs to the second floor the frig is similar in size to the existing one i asked if the documented his measurements apparently not at least no record after much measuring and discussion we decided to not risk keeping the the original purchase and pick a smaller frig so we purchase and wait for a call from xpo last mile courier they called that evening with  hour window they arrive after the estimated time unbox the frig and see it is damagaed with a big dent in the back side of the frig the driver recommends we refuse delivery due to damage which we agreed to i return to the store for the third time the ridder park store did not have the same model in stock and recommend i go to the newhall store because they had  in stock why couldnt it be ordered by the store im at no i have to drive to the storereally same company but do not share inventory i drive to newhall store purchase new frig then attempt to get refund from newhall store no i must drive back to the store i purchased the frig really are you separate stores yupp not like sears or home depot i will never make this kind or purchase a lowes ever ever again but were not done yet this frig still needs to be delivered to my tenant who is not so patiently waiting for a frig that will keep her food cold  days later eating out with her children now its saturday i get the call for delivery between  to pm on sunday then i get another call changing time to pm to pm then they call tenant and tell her  to  at  they call are running behind schedule and no eta but guaranteed that it would be delivered today next call is cancelling deliver for that day apparently they dont pay over time but they will call on monday in the pm with an eta at this point im attempted to cancel but my tenant needs a frig asap to add to all this she took one day off work to accept deliver that didnt happen the biggest complaint is with xpo last mile courier service but lowes needs to take responbility for doing business with an unreliable company sure wish i had read this earlier horrible customer service very unprofessional they have delivered a washer machine to my house and i specifically asked them before coming to my house to make sure to take off their shoes or use those plastic covers for their shoes because i have an infant baby crawling all over the house and im keeping it clean and in the living room there is a light grey rag which i try to keep clean because every stain or mark is noticeable and they didnt listen to me i wasnt home at the moment when they have arrived and they walked inside with shoes on dirty shoes on and didnt even care after i called them to ask why didnt they do what i asked and they hanged up the phone and never answered back very rude and unprofessional ordered washing machine from lowes in san jose got a call the night before delivery that they would come at  pm on drum roll a friday night during game  of the  nba finals i accepted anyways cause i really needed a washing machine friday night rolls around im watching the game and i waited  pm nothing  pm nothing  pm nothing  pm nothing complete no show totally disturbed the game as i tried to call lowes and xpo delivery called lowes the next day to find out that the delivery company couldnt find the item at lowes due to it being out of stockthey never called me about this as this is some vital information i would have been waiting the entire weekend i called xpo and they never answer the phone at one point in time i was on hold for an hour in the end i went to pick it up myself at another lowes and just installed it myself if you want something done right do it yourself it seems horrible experience to say the least zero stars i purchased a refrigerator washer and dryer from lowes i actually purchased more expensive appliances specifically because they were in stock and guaranteed for delivery on sunday instead of waiting a week we just bought a house and needed a fridge washer and dryer immediately as there were none in the house i get an automated call on saturday saying delivery is confirmed for sunday from   pm we frantically unpack to clear space for the appliances and  rolls around i get another automated call saying delivery is now from    pm ok fine it gets to be  and i call xpo to make sure my delivery is still on track we are living out of a cooler waiting on our new fridge so we really need it that day chris the customer service rep for xpo says that yes the driver is still confirmed for delivery but that he had bad traffic not unheard of in metro atlanta so i wasnt upset and reassured me the delivery was still on track then pm rolls around and no show i call back and was told the driver is mia all day and they dont know where he is hes not answering his phone and they arent sure if he has the delivery items or not what are you telling me you actually dont know where your employee is if hes got my items or not that i already bought and paid for from lowes and that your excuse is hes not answering his phone she then tells me that hes probably not coming since it is  on a sunday and she can reschedule the delivery for tuesday the whole reason i purchased these specific appliances at a higher cost than i would have paid for other models that could have been delivered thursday was because they were available for next day delivery i explain this to her and say that tuesday delivery is unacceptable she then says ill talk to my manager and hangs up on me ive spent the last  hours moving a house unpacking boxes and waiting on my delivery only to be unceremoniously hung up on after being told that their delivery driver essentially made off with my appliances and they dont know where he is fast forward to the next day we go to the lowes store we bought them from and big shocker herethe appliances were returned to the store at  pm last night by the delivery driver he literally made zero deliveries yesterday and just drove around with them in the truck all day and returned them to the store now lowes is telling me that the earliest they can deliver them is on thursday because we have a lot of other deliveries to deal with and they are already scheduled are you kidding now we are renting a uhaul and taking off work to pick up our appliances directly from the store im not living out of a cooler for another  days after multiple conversations with customer service lowes has agreed to reimburse us for the cost of the truck rental and im still arguing with them about price matching us for the lower cost washer and dryer we wanted to purchase in the first place but didnt since they wouldnt be delivered until thursdaythe new delivery time for our guaranteed on sunday delivery xpo logistics has the worst customer service from a company i have ever experienced completely uncommunicative no regard for your time or effort and clearly im not the only one who has experienced this from now on if i ever have the need for delivery ill be asking each store who they contract with for delivery service if it is xpo ill be shopping elsewhere thats how bad they are the worst company stay away from xpo we were supposed to have a pergola delivered yesterday  we drove an hour stuck in atlanta traffic to be home on time and they call us last minute to cancel due to weather it wasnt even raining i called and spoke with tiffany and asked her to reschedule it for sunday last night we get a phone call saying theyre coming today  its friday and i schedule it for sunday i just called them again and they said that they cant reschedule delivers for more than  dayso why tiffany  didnt mention that yesterday because she doesnt care they dont care about you your delivery or your time  period i just spoke with a rep named kathy who was totally unhelpful and rude i had to call the company where i originally purchased the items in order for them to release the items to xpo the company said the items were released to xpo on saturday its now tuesday the furniture store rep was helpful and contacted xpo to resolve this issue they said everything was processed as it should have been on saturday and that i should call to schedule delivery unfortunately im told by kathy that it would take  hours to assign someone to deliver the furniture and i cant schedule delivery till then just tell me the truth and dont be nasty about it  someone forgot to do something at xpo with this order or youre short staffed or whatever i can handle anything if youre not a jerk on the phone spend your money on another service it better be  and sunny with nothing more than a light breeze and parking better be wide open and you better have an elevator and moving sidewalk in your building that goes right into your apartment for these guys to deliver ikea used xpo logistics as the deliveryassembly company for a couch we ordered and paid to have deliveredassembled xpo showed up and their drivers immediately said they wouldnt park in the delivery parking spot in front of our building and would be leaving in min if they couldnt find a better place to park i got them to stay to deliver after fighting with the driver for  min then he said he was leaving without assembling which i paid for then when he started the delivery he said he wasnt going to deliver because my building doesnt have an elevator and he had to walk up stairs  a delivery company who wont deliver unless conditions are perfect what a joke oh and they dont do refunds for the assembly i paid  for but didnt receive the worst delivery company i have ever seen rescheduled  times and paid extra for time stop but my order was still nowhere to be found waited for the whole day for delivery and call multiple times during the day to make sure they knew about the time stop but still no use i dont understand why they are still in business for this if you cannot keep your promises and deliver on time then dont do it huge waste of my time after reading reviews about this company i was rather concerned about a delivery i was expecting from amazon i received a text message the day before the scheduled delivery date to confirm all was on schedule at  the next morning i received a text to confirm my order had left their crick depot and was on its way about am i received a phone call to inform me they would be with me in approximately  minutes  very well mannered young men delivered my order from amazon so for all the negative reviews i cannot fault the company and award them  stars well done and thank you x if apathy were an olympic event xpo would win the gold medal oh where do i begin lets start with the scorecard  out of four deliveries xpo managed to find a unique way to mess up each and every one i ordered various large pieces for a home solar project the wholesaler had no longer based on these events an exclusive with xpo much like the cable company xpo calls you prior and provides a time window to be available for delivery fair enoughcant fault them for that however i took time off to be available from the pm arrivaland nada after pm i called to inquire the response we had a new driver and he was afraid to come down your street sigh simple followup question i asked is there a reason you didnt call to tell me this their answer was essentiallythats not my job seriouslyzero effort to minimize my frustration i eventually asked to speak to this gentlemans supervisor he actually was quite good he tracked down the error and made certain the shipment would arrive first thing between am the next day sonext day i waitedagainpatiently from am nada nothing zillch again i called to inquire as to the whereabouts this time a different yet equally dismissive customer service rep said it would be delivered between pm and whomever told me it would be between am was wrong once againis there a reason you didnt call to tell me this you guessed the answerthats not my job the order did arrive intact hooray the driver was polite and efficient but i needed to make one more purchasedelivery this time the order was scheduled again between pm the timing was perfectjust one small problemonly half the order was there the driver had no clue where the other half was so i called xpo i seemed to irritate them inquiring as to where the other half was their response wasits probably on a truck somewherebut we wont know until some truck has one extra box leftover check back in a week meanwhile i have workers whose very paycheck and lives depend on getting this order and proceeding with the project there was zero empathy zero apology it is as though they have a monopoly and you are simply at their mercy so one week went by and i heard nothing i again called they were able to find it in their warehouse seemingly based only on my call i arranged for shipping the following day nopea few hours later there was a driver pounding on my unoccupied door fortunately my solar installer was able to come over and sign on my behalf we have several other projects that would involve xpo we contacted our wholesaler who is keeping track of such complaints and has arranged to now also allow shipping via ups it may cost a fraction morebut it is so very worth it we got a call yesterday that our patio furniture we bought from home depot was being delivered today between am  pm homedepots website said expect delivery   i couldnt find tracking so i called the phone number this morning left by xpo i spoke with a young man who was very professional  he said that we were  on the list and that wed receive a call about  minutes before they arrive sure enough about  minutes later we received a call from a very friendly man who said theyd be here in  minutes  finished with god bless you they arrived about  minutes later were friendly  professional  the furniture was exactly what we had ordered  a full  days before we expected it i have bought my furniture from ikea on  and scheduled delivery for  between  pm at delivery day i was called and asked if they could come earlier and i accepted driver has come around  the street was narrow and the driver had a phone call about  mins the truck was in the middle of the street meantime told he couldnt block the road and gone advising me to reschedule i did so i rescheduled for  between  pm i went to boston city hall and got moving truck permission for  dollars that day i went the adress earlier and started to wait the delivery around  pm i called ikea to ask and i was told the truck had  more deliveriea and would be at the adress around  at  pm i called ikea and told that the driver has come but gone because he couldnt find a parking space even though i was waiting in front of the building and had a moving truck permition from city and now neither ikea nor xpo take responsibility for that just rent a truck for your next delivery had to have some furniture delivered set up the appointment  all i can say is at least they delivered within the  hour window they said they would however we did get a call saying they were leaving the facility  would be there in x amount of minutes we were outside waiting for them to arrive for an hour  a half past the time they said they would be there for when they arrived the doors opened  the smell of weed just poured out well guess i know why your were so latethey were nice  all but definately not professionally dressed  the vehicle was not a regular delivery vehicle but a sketchy unmarked beat up old truck i wont even give these fools a star the most unprofessional irresponsible pathetic business which is unfortunately used by a lot of stores around the bay to deliver i recently bought a a huge tv stand with cabinets they called me to tell me they wont be delivering as scheduled because of the rain and also that the truck broke down my furniture was already in their truck i called customer service to reschedule for a sunday and they call us  minutes prior on a saturday and tell us they are on their way the furniture was not padded for protection the two movers were careless while moving it inside our home and dropped and dragged it causing damage i have been on the phone almost everyday with these fools for some compensation they just started a stupid worthless escalation report and have not returned any calls stay away from them ask the store you are buying from which company will deliver and if its these fools just do it yourself they do have a ridiculous charge for delivery too total waste of time and money xpo was the assigned delivery company for my baby dresser i have never worked with a delivery company as unorganized and incompetent as them i initially received  separate phone calls to arrange a delivery never received a phone all on the first scheduled day so i called them they told me that unfortunately the dresser was not on the schedule for delivery that day i asked the operator what happened and she had no answer so we rescheduled it for a second delivery date and again the delivery had not been scheduled now my husband had taken time off work to receive it and no package when we talked to the operations manager he said he had no idea what happened and i have talked to xpo again and they cannot explain how i had two scheduled deliveries that were actually never scheduled by them they are blaming the vendor which i find very hard to believe we would give them zero stars but it is not an option we receive packaged goods from a plethora of trucking firms on a regular and daily basis we never have any issues but when it comes to xpo logistics the drivers seem to be above deliveries the driver named matt is the worst we have had several bad experiences with himsuper rude and thinks that he is large and in charge we will never use this company ever again and we note to all of our vendors that we will not accept deliveries from xpo logistics if you want to have a good day and a great delivery experience steer clear of these folks they delivered my new washer and dryer but instead of giving us the information and the opportunity to take off the power cord they took it with them despite the fact that it has been discussed up front that i was going to keep it when i called them to try and rectify the situation all they did was give me the runaround and a response of too bad so sorry their customer service was awful thankfully the sears outlet that i purchased the units from stepped up and did the right thing xpo logistics unclaimed this business has not yet been claimed by the owner or a representative

friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow k k stop following k k  lengthy discussion prior to delivery of a fridge via a best buy sales manager about hauling away a fridge  feet down a hall and relocating a fridge  feet up the hall and hooking up the new fridge charge  the sales mgr fails to indicate to xpo how to enter the gate i confirm the delivery  day prior and reiterate i will need to be called to let them thru the gate staying home from work and reading previous bad reviews was anxiety producing but nobody is prepping for brain surgery and i am no fridge virginxpo calls  minutes out  tailgates into the subdivision rings doorbell not following instructions yet am believer measure twice cut once the man who would not give me his name is a hothead unhinged does not begin to describe his trump like behavior he calls the warehouse with the intent of hauling off the old fridge but not delivering the new one that is sitting in the street all the food i unloaded from the inoperable fridge is packed in ice for  more hour and then a smorgasbord for all after  minutes of calls and his whining about his packet will get him in hot water clueless about this ruining his day it is his job to deliver appliances and best buy is on the phone speaking not to the driver but to me saying make him deliver he tells me now i will be required to sign a waiver not happening i explain that i watched the movers put the fridges in the house and not one door had to be removed asked him to leave the new in line filter intact on the fridge being hauled off he promptly cuts it in two  blown he is pissed i am praying he is not packing i offer him and his buddy who speaks little english a cold drink he declines again he demands i sign a waiver as i will hold him accountable for the dings he is going to put in floors and walls  i tell him go slow and no damage will occur he does put the new fridge in the kitchen refuses to install it and drives away i had taken many photos while all of his antics were going on he missed a good tip hope he did not kick the dog when he got home he refused to give me his name until he needed me to sign the completed delivery  hours of lousy cshubs got on phone with best buy and samsung getting instructions as to why the bad actor failed to hook up the fridge already done a best buy survey at their

of in metro atlanta so i wasnt upset and reassured me the delivery was still on track then pm rolls around and no show i call back and was told the driver is mia all day and they dont know where he is hes not answering his phone and they arent sure if he has the delivery items or not what are you telling me you actually dont know where your employee is if hes got my items or not that i already bought and paid for from lowes and that your excuse is hes not answering his phone she then tells me that hes probably not coming since it is  on a sunday and she can reschedule the delivery for tuesday the whole reason i purchased these specific appliances at a higher cost than i would have paid for other models that could have been delivered thursday was because they were available for next day delivery i explain this to her and say that tuesday delivery is unacceptable she then says ill talk to my manager and hangs up on me ive spent the last  hours moving a house unpacking boxes and waiting on my delivery only to be unceremoniously hung up on after being told that their delivery driver essentially made off with my appliances and they dont know where he is fast forward to the next

just drove around with them in the truck all day and returned them to the store now lowes is telling me that the earliest they can deliver them is on thursday because we have a lot of other deliveries to deal with and they are already scheduled are you kidding now we are renting a uhaul and taking off work to pick up our appliances directly from the store im not living out of a cooler for another

year those are scary words for the freight forwarding industrywhen companies raise capital it is often a warning sign for investors if as in the case of many small oil exploration and production companies this year it is to tide them through tough times an equity issue can seriously dilute the existing stock while issuing new debt adds to ongoing expenses the fact that this news barely registered as a blip on xpo’s chart this week then indicates that investors have remarkable confidence in jacobs and his teamthat confidence is understandable and fairly easily explained firstly it doesn’t come as a surprise xpo have announced two major acquisitions in the last few months at the end of april they released plans to buy norbert dentressangle sa and then just a few days later revealed that they would be acquiring bridge terminal transport services inc incidentally the scope and potential of the dentressangle deal may be lost on many americans but as a european i am only too aware of the ubiquity of that company’s trucks on the other side of the pondhowever takeovers like that need capital so news of new equity and debt was expected it is a measure of confidence in the company that all of that new stock was purchased by existing shareholders and that moody’s gave the new debt issue a b rating in part that is down to the track record of the ceo jacobs was the founder of united waste systems and cofounder of united rentals both of which adopted aggressive but ultimately very successful growth by acquisition strategies he clearly knows what he is doing here a belief that is further evidenced by the timing of the deal it took advantage of dollar strength before the exchange rate began to turn adding value almost instantlysooner or later of course even the most aggressive growth company has to make money to make it all worthwhile but if most estimates are to be believed that shouldn’t pose a problem for xpo they are generally expected to move to profit later this year and the fact that a large part of the capital scheduled to be raised from the latest offering is to bolster the acquisition fund indicates that profitability can be maintained while still pursuing yet more growth in the futurefor a growth strategy to be attractive to investors one of two requirements must be met it must have proven to be effective in the past and there must be confidence in the ability of the management team to handle the rapid expansion xpo meets both of those requirements so despite the stock doubling in the last year the best may yet be to come the views

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
