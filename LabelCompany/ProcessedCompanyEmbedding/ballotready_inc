director of emerging technologies rob wiebusch and director of innovations shari little spent  days at omahas straight shot accelerator honing this idea using data to help election administrators run their polling locations more efficiently the companys almost ubiquitous presence on election day uniquely positions them to gather data about it wiebusch and little believe this data could help polling admins solve an enduring problem knowing which times of day to bulk up on staffing wiebusch told epley that the product called election insights will be rolled out in the next two to five
