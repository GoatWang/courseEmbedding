any condition that damages the kidney can cause ckd but diabetes and high blood pressure account for most cases because the loss of function is gradual most people do not develop symptoms until there is irreversible kidney damage ckd is diagnosed using tests that measure levels of waste products in blood and urine diagnosis includes using a staging system to determine how far the disease has progressed because kidney damage is irreversible treatment aims to slow the progression of the disease by controlling underlying causes and making adjustments in diet and lifestyle once the kidneys have failed dialysis transplant and supportive care are the remaining treatment options anemia bone disease and edema are common complications of ckd but the effects of kidney damage cause problems in all organ systems measures that can help prevent ckd include preventing and treating known causes if you have ckd seek support to cope with the physical demands and emotional stress of a challenging disease full description chronic kidney disease ckd describes the gradual loss of kidney function over a long period of time any disease or condition that affects the kidney and causes kidney damage can cause ckd diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes but birth defects infections obstructions and medications can also cause ckd because the loss of function is gradual most people do not develop symptoms until there is irreversible kidney damage nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and appetite loss appear early on but as the disease progresses more severe symptoms appear including itching swelling easy bruising and decreased mental sharpness the kidneys remove wastes and fluid from the blood so ckd is diagnosed by measuring the levels of waste products in blood and urine the level of creatinine a waste product in the blood is an important marker high creatinine levels reflect poor kidney function diagnosis includes determining how far along the disease has progressed using a staging system stages  based on the glomerular filtration rate gfr the gfr is a calculated number that reflects kidney function because kidney damage is irreversible treatment aims

reflect the effects of kidney damage on other organ systems including the nervous system dementia neuropathy heart and blood vessels pericarditis congestive heart failure reproductive system infertility and miscarriage and immune system reduced immunitymeasures that can help prevent ckd include controlling existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes and making lifestyle changes to prevent developing conditions that harm the kidney you can be an active participant in preventing or delaying complications by working with a dietitian to make changes to reduce
