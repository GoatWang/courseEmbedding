a member of the board of directors effective july of  and became chairman effective november of  he has a bachelor’s degree in finance from millikin university company brief for more than  years caterpillar inc wwwcaterpillarcom has been making sustainable progress possible and driving positive change on every continent with  sales and revenues of  billion caterpillar is the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment diesel and natural gas engines industrial gas turbines and dieselelectric locomotives the company also is a leading services provider through caterpillar financial services caterpillar remanufacturing services and progress rail services what is the secret to caterpillar’s consistent success there is a real deep commitment to the same set of values around the world part of cat’s secret sauce is that every one of our employees and our distributor’s employees as well as those of most of our suppliers all understand that it is a level playing field the second secret to our ongoing success is a commitment to a dealership model where we sell almost all of our catbranded product to nearly  dealerships around the world and they resell to their customers and contractors this allows those dealers to provide service  virtually anywhere on the planet with the size and scale of your business how do you maintain your innovative edge we have a real propensity to develop new products through our businesses we expect those business leaders who are responsible for getting product to our customers to do what they have to do through innovation or other means to make sure we stay ahead of our competitors for example our new hybrid excavator is truly helping our customers lower their owning and operating costs we just won an edison award for that machine which recognized the innovation behind it do young people entering the workforce understand the type of career that caterpillar can offer when you talk about hightech and compare us to companies making an ipad or a space shuttle no but when you think about the level of technology inside each one of our machines and what we’re doing with that technology we’re able to hire the top electrical engineers and software engineers who appreciate that we’re very creative anytime you can get a person on a bulldozer and give him or her the experience of pushing dirt and creating things people get into it quickly it’s fun stuff does the us still offer strong growth opportunity or will much of the growth come from international and emerging markets yes and yes  to  percent of our sales are outside the us – those are the fastest growing economies with the fastest growing population base and where we are least represented this represents our longterm future but the us and even europe and japan are still solid stable and mature markets – there is a lot of infrastructure development that we participate in going on in all three of those areas so they’re not dead by any means given the state of the us economy we’re growing at  to  percent in the developed world and we’re growing at  to  percent in the developing world you have been very clear on your strategy through caterpillar’s vision  what are the key elements of that program our vision here is pretty simple it’s about getting the balance among customers employees and shareholders right we have to deliver the highest quality products in this industry which we are doing today but part of our dna is to create cat products and machines that will outlast anybody else’s when it comes time to sell them they will have a higher resale value than anybody else’s – we have to maintain that edge our service is also one of our critical advantages – making sure we do the basics right every single day ours is a highquality product – if it breaks down or needs maintenance it’s serviced very rapidly with parts that make it there within a few hours so that the contractor can get back to work that has defined our company for more than  years we plan to ensure that those business standards are adhered to elsewhere in the world because they work everywhere however that’s not always easy when we’re operating in a remote place like western china or a tough place like siberia it doesn’t work quite as easily but we always strive to be better than our competition we ask for a higher price for our products up front but in the end they make more money for our clients how do you define your target client market and how much can that market expand the largest construction equipment market in the world is china and it is well underexcavated today as a country beijing and shanghai are not but there are hundreds of millions of people that live in the western part of china and there is still excavation and modernization to do there – it’s the same in most of the developing world there aren’t many countries with roads per capita even close to america and europe but eventually that will develop as those countries grow new customers are formed construction companies are growing and productivity is required so we’re going to be there for them what are the key markets you’re most focused on certainly the wellknown markets like china and india but also the other developing parts of asia like indonesia indonesia is expected to spend about  billion in infrastructure this year alone with more to come there is a huge redevelopment program there we have been active there for more than  years and we’ll participate in that in thailand we just opened two plants we’re also focused on latin america and we continue to grow in brazil and russia essentially there is opportunity in almost every developing country there are seven billion people on the planet and when i joined caterpillar in  there were maybe  to  billion people on the planet less than  billion people were open to caterpillar type products and services russia china and india were closed the vietnam war was over but the aftermath of that conflict still kept much of southeast asia closed for business to the us latin america was bankrupt we had only a few people in the world to sell to – less than  billion today with the seven billion people on the planet there are probably only  million that we can’t sell to all of these seven billion people want to live as progressively and modern as we do and all of that requires infrastructure from roads to bridges to electric power which is where we are the challenge for us is to make sure we do in overseas markets as well as we’re doing in modern markets along with your investments in the latest technologies how do you ensure that your people continue to emphasize the value of personal relationships it’s still a people and relationship business compared to automobiles computers or movies we have a relatively few number of customers around the world and ours is a capital good that people use to make money for the most part so while we’re working on social media to introduce ourselves to more customers our model – including our product from the factory and our dealer support – have to connect with the guy in the dirt using the equipment to support what he’s doing it requires a lot of oneonone time because somebody from the dealer’s work site who represents us has to go service that tractor – that is person to person how high up do you need to be working with your customers and is it at different levels within their organization yes for example there are many customers for which i will call on their ceo and top management team regularly but the vast majority of customers are small contractors with a small number of machines trying to grow their business and become bigger there is also another group of them in the emerging markets who may start with one or two machines and go from there so we have to be on the ground with a lot of representation from the dealers we have serving those territories is it critical that your workforce mirrors your diverse customer base our china management team for example is mostly comprised of our chinese caterpillar people we have about  employees in brazil and there are only a handful of expats to speak of there so we have had some great success but we have a lot more work to do with diversity how important is corporate responsibility to the culture of caterpillar do the areas you support align with the business the caterpillar foundation provides support in the areas of environmental sustainability access to education and basic human needs sometimes that comes in the form of disaster recovery – be it tornadoes in oklahoma or flooding in our hometown of peoria illinois we support groups that will go in and help alleviate a situation and we’ll match employee donations it’s the right thing to do and cat equipment can play a role in recovery are you concerned that the us is losing its competitive edge the us is not doing enough to maintain its global leadership we have breakdowns in three critical areas first our education system we do not turn out people with an appreciation for stem like we did when i came out of high school second our fiscal situation in the us will continue to weaken our country third our tax system in this country is no longer appropriate and competitive that said we are still competitive for example we are moving some production from japan to the us the fact that for the past  years we have had such high productivity in the us has helped us all but there is a limit to it based on education our fiscal situation and our tax system is it tough to remain optimistic in terms of what is taking place in washington it’s tough when you listen to the chatter but i talk to employees and customers around the country and there is still innovation going on there are still wonderful things happening – we can do this even with that dysfunction in washington imagine what we could do here if we had less dysfunction the world right now is looking for leadership and we could supply that but we can’t seem to get it together if someone told you when you started with caterpillar that you would one day lead the company would you have believed him i would have thought he was crazy when i came here i had a thick car payment book and a huge amount of student loans and what i had in mind was getting ahead of that i’m not sure i had ever met a ceo or knew what a ceo did in  but it has worked out for me beautifully and i’m so proud of this company i love my job every day what has kept you with caterpillar i started my career in international finance and i had some fascinating assignments early on the next one was more fascinating than the last and hooked me in for another two to five years pretty soon i looked up and i had  years and then  years behind me and i was still loving it when i became an officer of the company i went into the engine business which i had never experienced and that was fun at a company this size there are many opportunities that are as diverse as other companies can offer the challenge for me and our management team is to make sure that we recognize those people that want to do that and give them those experiences with your expertise in so many areas is it challenging to step back and be less engaged i’ve never considered myself a micromanager and i strongly believe in teams and in leaders leading those teams so one of the first things we did in early  was reorganize the company around very strong teams with a very strong leader at the corporate level i make sure that they get all of the tools and i hold them accountable and i try not to influence or micromanage them what are the areas you feel you need to work on my biggest obligation as chairman and ceo is to make the right strategic moves during my short tenure here so that whoever is at my desk in  years says i don’t know who he was but he did a great job – that’s what i say looking at my predecessors they set me up so the biggest weight on my shoulders are the strategic pieces – are we doing the right things to be sure we’ll be here for a long time also what i worry about is not so much the things within our four walls but what is going on out there – things i can’t control or don’t see coming we have to make sure we can handle anything that comes at us if i was talking to some of those who have worked with you without you in the room and i asked what it was like to work with douglas oberhelman what would they say i hope they would say that he let me run my business but he held me accountable• click

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples
