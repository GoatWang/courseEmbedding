lanasa tate donovan wes brown and ella rae peck tv show description       no one is really surprised when a wealthy socialite and notorious party girl vivian bowers is found dead of an overdose she’s the heiress to the bowers pharmaceutical empire and has been tabloid fodder for years she’s wild pretty privileged and now dead at the age of  for ambitious and nononsense fbi agent will moreno laz alonso things don’t add up with this suspicious dynasty he’s convinced the troubled girl’s death was a homicide and he has a clever plan to get to the truth her name is detective joanna padget locasto meagan good a san francisco narcotics detective who is also will’s former partner twenty years ago joanna was vivian’s best friend and practically grew up inside the bowers’ home when she appears at vivian’s funeral the family reembraces her and no one is the wiser robert bowers victor garber is the family patriarch and ceo of bowers pharmaceuticals he’s a loving father an unfaithful husband and a ruthless businessman the only thing in the way of his ambition is his troubled children sofia katherine lanasa is the ultraglamorous second wife of robert and the mother of mia bowers sofia will go to great lengths to get what she wants through whatever means necessary — no matter who stands in her way edward bowers tate donovan is the eldest bowers son and the cfo of bowers pharmaceuticals a product of the best schools and unimaginable access edward was a rising star before his life came to a screeching halt one one night  years ago julian wes brown is the sexy hedonistic playboy of the bowers family and a fixture on new york’s most exclusive party circuit he’s also a key member of the bowers pharmaceutical leadership and the first love of joanna whipsmart and smartmouthed mia bowers ella rae peck is the daughter of robert and sofia bowers and the halfsister to vivian julian and edward unlike her conspicuous older siblings mia has always preferred to keep a low profile earning straight a’s at her elite upper east side prep school and hanging out at downtown gallery openings when dark family secrets begin to come to light mia questions whether anyone in her family can be trusted back in the world that she thought she’d left behind joanna quickly uncovers dark secrets and clues about why vivian’s life was very much in danger at the same time she rekindles an old romantic relationship and rediscovers the allure of the luxurious lifestyle she once knew she’s about to see once again just how the other half lives — and dies series finale      episode  — i’ll start with the hillbilly as the bowers sit down with meredith vieira to discuss the closure of vivian’s murder case joanna looks on with guilt vivian would still be alive if joanna didn’t rat her out to her parents for running away from home at age  nevertheless joanna is compelled to stay on the investigation positive audrey cruz didn’t murder vivian from the hospital julian calls joanna and updates her on edward’s mental state edward’s not ready to let go of his samantha who’s brain dead with a signed dnr julian asks joanna to move in with him everything and everyone is crazy and all he wants to do is come home to her will’s enjoying the fame that comes with solving a high profile case which includes plans for a dinner party in his honor joanna finds him in his office posing for photos for empire state magazine once alone joanna insists will keep the case open citing audrey cruz’s lack of motivation for murdering vivian vivian needed to be alive for audrey’s plan to work joanna thinks haverstock had vivian killed but will thinks she’s crazy joanna approaches haverstock on her own and demands he provide an alibi for the night of vivian’s death haverstock says he was at the white house sleeping in the lincoln bedroom not only is joanna’s theory shot but also haverstock reveals he has known joanna was a cop all along sofia is at an upscale manhattan supermarket trying to buy edward a baked ham even though mia finds the gesture absurd furthermore mia thinks sofia’s plans to attend will moreno’s big soiree when samantha is languishing in the hospital are obscene spying wyatt sofia orders mia to get in line at the register wyatt hisses into sofia’s ear he fully intends to ruin her life for what she did to him spitting mad sofia attacks wyatt and when the managers step in she starts throwing every grocery she can lay hands on meanwhile robert visits the hospital in a bid to patch things up with edward but edward’s had enough of his family at the bowers estate an emotional and delusional beverly confronts julian thinking he’s robert she scolds him for killing his first wife catherine asking how he can live with himself julian is stunned will finds a suspect who matches the description of the guy who shot edward’s wife edward is brought in to view the lineup but when he sees the man he refuses to identify him knowing something’s up will presses but edward remains mum determined to take the law into his own hands back at the office joanna asks gabe for the file of witnesses he interviewed that were present at the motel on the night of vivian’s death he claims they’re all crazy drug addicts mentioning one guy who clutched a suitcase but she runs across a witness named jeff – the same guy who just gave mia heroin joanna visits jeff a visit at his house surprised to discover he’s a family man by day jeff admits to providing vivian with heroine on the night she died he remembers she gave him back the heroin and left the motel at  in the morning although joanna knows the coroner declared midnight as vivian’s time of death jeff suggests vivian may not have died at the hotel energizing joanna with new possibility at the police station will questions wyatt about the incident in the grocery store wyatt brings up the past when he and sofia “decided” he would take the rap for beating her father to death when will asks sofia about her relationship with wyatt and whether vivian knew anything about it sofia refuses to answer and threatens to call her lawyer meanwhile edward’s vigilantism leads him to an albanian social club where he asks a group of mobsters to bring him his wife’s killer for  he’ll do the rest will visits haverstock to question him about sofia haverstock tells will that vivian definitely knew about sofia and wyatt because he told her… but isn’t vivian’s case closed will won’t say but it’s clear he’s beginning to give joanna’s theories some credence and haverstock gets the idea that sofia is the new prime suspect at that night’s party for will julian naively introduces will to joanna and it’s hellishly awkward after will leaves julian gives joanna a copy of the bracelet he once gave vivian – that she was wearing on the night of her murder – and is surprised to see joanna’s wearing the original on her wrist joanna excuses herself this revelation too compelling to ignore at the hospital edward tells mia he’s afraid of who he’ll become without his wife in his life anymore since recent events have aged mia a bit she offers some advice edward is remaining in the same limbo samantha’s in and he has two children to consider suddenly kyle shows up despite their terrible breakup he just wants her “to have someone” mia doesn’t do any talking she just embraces kyle and kisses him deeply back at will’s party haverstock confronts sofia if she had anything to do with vivian’s death… he’ll grind her into dust joanna tells will about her discovery about vivian’s bracelet which joanna just found in the wine cellar the other day but if vivian was killed at the bowers’ house how did sofia get her back to the hotel joanna assumes it would be the same way anything gets into a hotel – via a suitcase after all vivian was only  pounds joanna and gabe track down the crazy witness with the suitcase he found outside the motel where vivian’s body was found joanna’s confident that the suitcase will yield the dna evidence they need to nail robert and gabe offers to transport it into evidence at the party julian asks his father about the events surrounding his mother’s death but before he can get any real answer robert’s phone rings and he has to go at the hospital a flashback prolongs edward’s brutally necessary decision a little longer he thinks back to happier days when his wife had just given birth and the world was full of opportunity and warmth the memory doesn’t last long as edward returns to the present moment and gives the doctors the go ahead to pull samantha’s plug edward leaves the hospital full of vengeance he comes facetoface with his wife’s killer whom the albanian mob has tracked down and apprehended looking him in the eyes edward orders them to cut both his hands off the ones used to kill edward’s wife the rest is up to them gabe was the one who called robert during his talk with julian at the roosevelt island tram station gabe tells robert about the suitcase he now knows robert used him to protect himself and eliminate audrey how he murdered his own daughter and stuffed her in a suitcase robert is caught out and gabe is holding the key – or in this case the suitcase back at the bowers’ estate mia tells joanna her mother is lying as they watch the meredith viera interview together on the night of vivian’s death sofia passed out drunk on merlot robert left the house after an argument so she just assumed he spent the night with his sleazy assistant mia remembers her father packing a suitcase joanna calls will with big news robert killed vivian back at the tram station robert isn’t prepared to give up so easily he bribes gabe with an obscene amount of money and the promise of a stellar career convincing the now dirty detective to strategically “lose” the suitcase gabe is reluctant but he agrees since his career is at stake robert flashes back to the night of vivian’s murder when she came home with a bruise on her cheek asking to sit down for a talk the next morning will and joanna are despondent when gabe explains the property clerks lost the suitcase that was their one piece of evidence pinning robert to the crime – without it they’re back to square one joanna and gabe are called to a meeting with senator haverstock the senator is about to be promoted to attorney general – that’s why he was at the white house the night vivian died he plans to use his power to bring robert down but he’ll need evidence now that he’s effectively will’s boss and has taken a special interest haverstock reopens the investigation to continue and demands joanna keep working undercover at the house that night at the bowers’ house edward returns to the fold having nowhere else to go joanna sends julian out the window when robert knocks on her door to set the record straight he always wins robert asks joanna to join the family for dinner but someone’s missing… wyatt has kidnapped mia recap courtesy nbc first aired march
