law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a physician attention please see professional use information andor patient information brochure for a complete list of potential risks of indications and warnings and precautions indications for use the raindrop® near vision inlay is indicated for intrastromal implantation to improve near vision in the nondominant eye of phakic presbyopic patients  to  years of age who have manifest refractive spherical equivalent mrse of  diopters d to  d with less than or equal to  d of refractive cylinder who do not require correction for clear distance vision but who do require near correction of  d to  d of reading add summary of important information the raindrop® near vision inlay may not eliminate the need for reading glasses implantation of the raindrop® near vision inlay has the potential to cause vision and eye symptoms dry eyes decreased vision decreased contrast sensitivity problems with the cornea such as clouding thinning scarring and inflammation eye infection increased eye pressure and the need for another eye surgery such as removal or replacement of the inlay or other treatment you should not have the raindrop® near vision inlay implanted if you have severe dry eye have an active eye infection or active inflammation have signs of corneal disease characterized by general thinning and coneshaped protrusion in the center of the cornea keratoconus or keratoconus suspect have abnormal features of the outer part of the eye cornea to be implanted have active abnormal immune response autoimmune or connective tissue diseases do not have enough corneal thickness to safely have the procedure performed have a recent herpes eye infection or problems resulting from a previous infection have uncontrolled buildup of high pressure in the eye glaucoma have uncontrolled high blood sugar diabetes there are nonsurgical alternatives to the raindrop® near vision inlay which include reading glasses or contact lenses before having the raindrop® near vision inlay procedure you should have a complete eye examination and talk with your eye care provider about alternative treatments potential

your eye to refocus on objects that are up close making everyday tasks like reading menus or your phone a challenge signs and symptoms of presbyopia as we age near vision issues can happen seemingly overnight or can be more gradual more often than not people compensate by moving hard to see items further away to attempt to focus on smaller print or details over time most people suffering from
