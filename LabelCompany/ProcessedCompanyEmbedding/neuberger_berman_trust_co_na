defendants hgg and edward s schlesinger schlesinger a former partner at hgg background decedent irma croll died in  in her will she named nb and schlesinger as coexecutors of her estate nb and schlesinger were also cotrustees of her iv trust hgg served as counsel to nb and schlesinger in the administration of the estate and the trust by letter dated december   counsel for three of the trust beneficiaries informed nb that the generation skipping transfer gst tax may have been incorrectly calculated on the federal estate tax return filed in  resulting in a tax overpayment after confirming that the estate had overpaid its taxes by  million nb commenced the supreme court action transferred here against hgg and schlesingers estate while not disputing the tax error hgg moved to dismiss nbs malpractice claim as timebarred meanwhile nb petitioned for judicial settlement of its accounts as coexecutor and as cotrustee when schlesinger died on april   the fiduciary of his estate petitioned for judicial settlement of schlesingers account as co    trustee hggs motion for a protective order in november  nb served a subpoena duces tecum and ad testificandum upon jerry persampieri a certified public accountant who advised hgg in  regarding the gst tax calculation mr persampieri produced the subpoenaed documents prior to his deposition which was scheduled for january   however on january   hgg filed the instant motion seeking to stay mr persampieris deposition until the court ruled on hggs motion to dismiss the transferred action and the beneficiaries completed their examination of nb in the accounting proceedings on march   hggs motion for a protective order was denied as moot in light of this courts contemporaneous denial of hggs motion to dismiss to the extent that hgg seeks to stay the deposition until after nbs examination in the accounting proceedings hgg fails to explain why the examination of mr persampieri at this juncture would prejudice any party to those proceedings nb is entitled to go forward with its examination of mr persampieri on issues relevant to its malpractice claims nbs crossmotion nbs crossmotion seeks to compel the production of two categories of documents the first category consists of hggs client files in  nb amended its complaint to add a claim of replevin to recover possession of the files on june   the court ordered hgg to produce the files the  order nb alleges that hgg did not fully comply with the  order as demonstrated by the lack of emails or other electronically stored information esi in the files already produced the second category consists of documents requested by nb in a subpoena duces tecum served upon hgg pertaining to legal work performed by hgg for the estate andor the trust    including documents pertaining to hggs  inquiry into the accuracy of the gst tax nb alleges that hgg has failed to comply with the subpoena the two categories of documents largely overlap nb insists that it needs the documents in order to narrow the issues and to determine whether hgg and schlesinger concealed the gst tax error hgg asserts that its files did not contain any esi created prior to august  in response nb points to deposition testimony ofhggs former information technology partner as evidence that hgg maintained email systems and servers dating back to  however the partner testified that although he was able to locate the email archives of schlesinger and of another hgg attorney who worked on the estate and trust matters he was unable to access theemails themselves second hgg maintains that it did not search for postaugust  esi because by that time it no longer represented nb and schlesinger as fiduciaries nb contends that hggs representation continued until some time in  third hgg argues that it is not required to produce documents created after december   because on that date counsel for the beneficiaries first raised concerns over the gst tax at which point hgg became the object of a potential malpractice claim hgg asserts that all documents created after that date constitute workproduct prepared in anticipation oflitigation nb counters that hgg cannot reasonably have anticipated litigation simply based on the letter from beneficiaries counsel which merely requested an explanation as to how the tax was calculated and noted their inability to reconcile the numbers nb asserts that it was not until may  when nb and hgg received another letter from the beneficiaries counsel pointing to    the incorrect gst calculation and directing nb and hgg to preserve all relevant documents that hgg had a reasonable basis for anticipating litigation in support of its claim that hgg was still acting as its counsel during march and april of  nb submits emails between nb and hgg during that time regarding the tax calculation however those emails merely demonstrate a joint effort to respond to the beneficiaries inquiry and do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that hgg was still representing nb after receiving the first letter from beneficiaries counsel hgg could have reasonably anticipated that it might be subject to liability on the tax issue therefore the court cannot discount the possibility that an otherwise responsive document generated after december   might be deemed privileged the court directs hgg to produce all documents and esi that are either responsive to the subpoena duces tecum or subject to the courts  order to the extent that hgg withholds any document on the ground that it is privileged it must submit a privilege log containing the identifying information set forth in cplr b  hgg is further directed to submit a detailed affidavit describing its efforts to search for any responsive esi generated after decedents death in  the affidavit must state whether any such electronic documents exist and to the extent that they are inaccessible an explanation as to why that is so if hgg takes the position that with respect to a particular time period it is not possible to determine whether any documents including esi still exist hggs affirmation must provide a thorough and accurate explanation for such conclusion nbs crossmotion for contempt contempt is a drastic remedy rarely used in the context of ordinary discovery disputes lopez v new york city tr auth  ad  st dept  in order to prevail on a motion    for civil contempt the movant must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the party has intentionally engaged in conduct that violated an order containing an unequivocal and explicit mandate bernardcadet v gobin  add   d dept  miller v miller  add  d dept  hog turned over several boxes of documents shortly after the court issued its  order in response to the subpoena hog informed nb that hog did not have any responsive documents and that in any event documents created after december   were attorney workproduct moreover after being served with the subpoena hog produced a former hog partner for an examination on the firms esi retention policies it cannot be concluded that hggs response to either the  order or nb s subpoena rose to the level of contempt thus the motion for contempt is denied as is nb s request for legal fees and costs  • this decision constitutes the order of the court suritogate dated lnjfjmly o   search this case google scholar google books legal
