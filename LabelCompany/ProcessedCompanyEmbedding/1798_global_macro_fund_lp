bonds owned morningstar combines credit rating information provided by the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose

with at least a year history morningstar calculates a morningstar rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure against other funds in the same category this measure takes into account variations in a funds monthly performance and does not take into account the effects of sales charges placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the weights are  year rating for

composite includes all accounts that are managed according to the firm’s global macro hedge fund strategy over which the manager has full discretion this hedge fund strategy has a broad and flexible mandate the strategy strives to grow and protect client capital through an activelymanaged prudentlydiversified multiassetclass portfolio of liquid global securities the manager follows a multidisciplinary valuebased investment process with risk controls the strategy blends topdown macroeconomic analysis with bottomup fundamental valuation the investment team’s macroeconomic analysis includes the valuation of currencies commodities industries and markets in order to develop global macroeconomic themes that guide positions and exposures the largest asset class exposure is large and midcap global equities long and short with a long bias the manager trades and invests in individual equities as well as exchangetraded funds and related options the manager also takes long and short positions in currencies commodities and fixed income securities primarily through liquid exchangelisted futures and options contracts the manager may take limited positions in overthecounter derivatives the strategy employs a moderate amount of leverage within constraints based on the investment team’s assessment of market risks and opportunities the strategy’s bottomup approach to equity valuation starts with a proprietary fundamental quantitative model that was originally built in  by the firm’s chief investment officer kevin c smith cfa the model applies an innovative and robust discountedfreecashflow methodology to produce daily valuations of the top  largest and mostliquid global equities that trade on a us exchange the fundamental quant model has been consistently refined and applied to managing this strategy since its inception the investment team performs additional qualitative analysis to validate buy and sell signals generated by the model and to integrate modeldriven ideas with the firm’s macro themes the goal of the strategy is to generate high riskadjusted returns as measured by alpha sortino ratio omega ratio and gainloss ratio that are in the top  of all global hedge fund managers across diverse investment disciplines benchmarks the sp  index is perhaps the most commonly followed stock market index it is considered representative of the us stock market at large it is a marketcapweighted index of the  largest and most liquid companies listed on the nyse and nasdaq exchanges while the companies are us based most of them have broad global operations therefore the index is representative of the broad global economy it is a suitable benchmark for the crescat global macro hedge fund composite which has also traded extensively in large highlyliquid global equities through uslisted securities the hfrx global hedge fund index represents a broad universe of hedge funds with the capability to trade a range of asset classes and investment strategies across the global securities markets the index is weighted based on the distribution of assets in the global hedge fund industry it is a tradeable index of actual hedge funds it
