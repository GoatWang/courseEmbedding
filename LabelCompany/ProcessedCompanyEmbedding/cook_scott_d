get everyone involved by scott cook  comments credit courtesy company in 9 after scott cook and his wife were talking about the tedium of paying bills he got the idea to create personalfinance software to automate that task the next year he founded intuit which has since produced many applications including quickbooks and turbotax that simplify accounting tasks intuit now has annual sales of  billion and employs about  people q how can i incubate new ideas while staying focused on daytoday revenue generation mitch hendersoncoceobnp mediatroy michigan this is the central operational challenge for most businesses if you want to be great now and in the future you have to learn to do these two things at once first of all the key to maintaining focus on daytoday results is making sure that employees know which output metric they are responsible for and how it is measured with that knowledge they can learn what drives these numbers up or down and work only on things that move the needle in the right direction when it comes to innovation our theory is that you should enable a lot of your employees  not just a small group  to invent business ideas or product features we encourage this by allowing our engineers and product managers in most of our divisions to devote 0 percent of their workweeks to new ideas thats how we developed many of our products and features with this sort of ongoing innovation its important to run cheap quick tests to make sure you are on the right track for example our payments group wanted to find a new way to help businesses pay each other they had three theories about what customers wanted another department said that one of the three wasnt going to work they could have argued the point for weeks but instead they let the customers vote through customer surveys we quickly had our answer when you are developing ideas remember to think big for innovations to succeed they must solve a large enough problem for the customer in the 990s we created a product quicken financial planner that helped customers create a financial plan to save for retirement or college we quickly took 9 percent of the market share but the category was tiny we eventually killed the project the product manager who was a very smart guy said that we should have figured it out earlier because when we looked for a focus group we couldnt find enough people who had done a financial plan we werent solving a big enough problem focus the organization on tackling big problems and you will have a better shot at getting big results published on nov  9 executive

research centers” are edging out traditional approaches to rd advertisement mit smr frontiers this article is part of an mit smr initiative exploring how technology is reshaping the practice of management as internetdriven apps began to overwhelm packaged software business models intuit founder scott cook painfully but successfully reengineered his multibilliondollar company’s culture around design experimentation in fact he became an experimentation evangelist cook says he “wondered why google beat yahoo at search” until “a yahoo executive told me that google succeeded by installing the system and culture to decentralize decisionmaking” and change it to decisionbyexperiment a few years ago google said it ran  to  search experiments a year — when you use google you are a part of those experiments today that number may be at least 0 times higher cook explicitly links a culture of experimentation to empowerment a great business experiment has to inspire the same degree of topmanagement enthusiasm and engagement as a great business plan instead of running experiments that validate existing plans and analyses see them as methods to acquire creative insight and information that’s when the “aha moment” occurs when google engineers have an idea they don’t need approval to pursue it they let the experiment make the decision google understands that innovators want to take their idea build it and see it work in today’s realtime online environment good ideas matter less testable hypotheses matter more tomorrow’s innovations and strategies will increasingly be the products — and byproducts — of realtime experimentation and testing since the  popping of the internet bubble digital networks have successfully evolved into virtual research centers laboratories and design studios for entrepreneurs and enterprises to fieldtest hypotheses that typically required dedicated teams and facilities as a result traditional innovation investment paradigms emphasizing research  development rd increasingly yield to practices supporting experiment  scale es the new economics of experimentation collaborative open platforms radically reduce cost risk and time required to productively run business experiments crucially networked experiments — always ongoing in borndigital enterprises — can swiftly scale into new products new services and better user experiences this effectively converts innovation from longterm fixedcost investment to variable or marginalcost investment call it the “exponential economics of networks” these new economic models elevate the value of digital experimentation making it more compelling to mainstream businesses as experimentation gains acceptance datadriven top management must rethink innovation opportunity and riskinvestment strategies to emulate digital business leaders our work strongly suggests that es has become an innovation best practice for digitally sophisticated enterprises they make experimentation both a core competency and a cultural value amazon google microsoft netflix facebook intuit and capital one are just a few highprofile market leaders that publicly attribute innovation prowess to their ongoing commitment to digital experimentation firms like these expect innovators to experiment often and freely experimental quantity is almost as important as quality as amazon founder jeff bezos famously observed “if you double the number of experiments you do per year you’re going to double your inventiveness” networked enterprises can more than double the number of annual experiments with only incremental increases in cost amazon’s recommendation engines for example weren’t launched as a grand vision to transform digital shopping they serendipitously emerged through rapid agile digital experimentation and scaling — not strategic planning as former amazon intrapreneur greg linden recalls realworld results from fast cheap and iterative experiments were vital in persuading reluctant top managers to invest in recommendation advertisement conquering management resistance this highlights a painful insight the biggest challenges are not technical or financial but cultural and organizational at most firms management overwhelmingly favors planning programs projects and pilots over the realworld benefits of experimental knowledge and insight most don’t realize how exponential economics of experimentation can bolster their innovation investment portfolios executives frequently resist easy opportunities to costeffectively experiment because they fear challenges to their hardwon professional intuitions and authority datadriven digital experiments might undermine pet hypotheses or business perspectives but preserving protecting and defending the status quo may prove even more costly frontiers email updates get periodic email updates on how technology is reshaping the practice of management sign up please enter a valid email address thank you for signing up privacy policy to be sure significant technical distinctions exist for example between ab and multivariate designs some organizations define experiments as simply comparing options ie does blue outperform red others devise portfolios of fast digital experiments to test rigorously defined strategic business hypotheses either way commitment to experiment early and often — and act on the outcomes and insights — is necessary creativity in the cloud the growing dominance of cloud architectures creates global enterprise environments that can further amplify experimental opportunities and effectiveness successful clouds are constructed with simple and easy scalability in mind similarly the devops movement — linking software development and operations — is explicitly designed to encourage iterative seamlessness between software capabilities and their network deployment in addition the rise of big data and effective realtime management of terabytes and petabytes guarantees a wealth of interesting and important correlations worthy of experimental exploration perhaps the most profound and potentially disruptive change in the analyticsexperimentation ecosystem is machine learning leadingedge data scientists have begun training machinelearning systems to generate interesting hypotheses for experiments that is the systems are being trained to recommend datadriven business hypotheses for marketers managers and innovators to experimentally test in the very near future the most important experiments — such as improving user experience or identifying lead users or suggesting new featuresfunctions — will come from exceptionally welltrained machinelearning systems recommendation engines will drive experimental agendas until then we advise enterprises to consider eight key learnings from our research as follows analyze less experiment more emphasize learning from experiments over predictive analytics for innovation explorations testable hypotheses over good ideas present testable hypotheses for experimental andor analytical development celebrate creative constraints constraints can be sources of enterprise ingenuity — for instance something that works on a mobile device an event actuated by a swipe or a colorchange make experiments social data scientists don’t have to own all experiments extend them to enterprise chats or dialogues around innovation inviting comments and critiques socialization — sometimes including suppliers channels and customers — will keep constituents aware of ongoing results prioritization matters eventually the challenge shifts to prioritizing the portfolio and balancing tensions that typically emerge between marketingcustomerfacing managers and technical managers about what to test first insights over solutions initially emphasize insights over solutions perfectionist engineering is suppressed in favor of quicker iterative sensibilities track the hypothesis trajectory don’t just track outcomes chart the focus of the business hypotheses over time do the bulk of hypotheses reflect concerns about customers or suppliers channels or partners what value paths and trajectories do the hypotheses appear to be on are they more tactical or strategic people aren’t lab rats ethical considerations and concerns around experiments can’t be ignored facebook for example created a firestorm of bad publicity and regulatory interest when it tweaked user newsfeeds — without their knowledge or consent — to explore hypotheses around networked emotional contagion assuring that customers are respectfully treated is
