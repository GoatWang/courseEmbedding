register sign in equinox chesapeake strategy fund provides mutual fund investors with access to expertise of legendary turtle trader jerry parker february    et  source equinox funds princeton nj feb   globe newswire  in september  equinox funds a leading provider of alternative investments teamed with legendary trader jerry parker to launch the equinox chesapeake strategy fund the fund nasdaqeqchx the fund provides access to a longterm trendfollowing strategy managed by chesapeake capital corporation the strategy utilizes robust trading systems across a broadly diversified set of futures markets with the goal of providing capital preservation and positive annual returns as of december   the fund returned  annualized since inception and  for the year a period when most futures trading strategies struggled jerry parker is regarded as perhaps the most successful of the original group of  turtle traders commented robert j enck president and ceo of equinox funds the term turtle traders originated from a bet between legendary traders richard dennis and bill eckhardt on whether or not trading skills were home grown much like turtles on a turtle farm or innate  much like the bet between mortimer and randolph in the classic comedy movie trading places in  at about the same time the movie was released ads were running in the wall street journal looking to hire individual traders for a training program run by mr dennis and mr eckhardt the turtle traders seemed to prove that trading skill could be learned in five years the  trader trainees earned significant profits employing systems taught to them by mr dennis and mr eckhardt one of the trainees was jerry parker jerry was one of thousands of hopeful candidates who had responded to the wall street journal advertisements screened applicants were given a truefalse test and a select few were interviewed for employment after five years of successful trading for richard dennis jerry founded chesapeake capital corporation and launched the chesapeakes diversified program in  prior to the launch of the equinox chesapeake strategy fund our trading expertise was only available to institutional money managers and high net worth individuals through private funds and separately managed accounts explained jerry parker we are now pleased to offer mutual fund investors what we believe to be a compelling combination of pedigree performance and price added mr enck the price reference refers to equinox funds and chesapeakes recent decision to significantly reduce overall fund fees making it a potentially more attractive option for investors especially feesensitive institutions and large rias mr enck continued the equinox chesapeake strategy fund offers investors access to in our view jerry

asset classes by taking either long or short positions as a trend is underway price trends are created when investors are slow to act on new information or sell prematurely and hold on to losing investments to long price trends continue when investors continue to buy an investment that is going up in price or sell an investment that is going down in price alternative investments are not suitable for all investors there is no guarantee that the investment objectives of the equinox sponsored funds will be achieved or maintained the successful use of forward and futures contracts draws upon chesapeake capitals skill and experience with respect to such instruments and is subject to special risk considerations futures and forward contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes the possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a forward or futures contract and the resulting inability to close a forward or futures contract when desired the use of futures contracts forward contracts and derivative instruments will have the economic effect of financial leverage financial leverage magnifies exposure to the swings in prices of an asset class underlying an investment and results in increased volatility international trading activities are subject to foreign exchange risk as a general rule there is less legal and regulatory protection for investors in foreign markets than that available domestically additionally trading on foreign exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls expropriation
