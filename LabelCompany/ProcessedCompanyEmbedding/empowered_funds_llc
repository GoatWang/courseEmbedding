transaction fee on investors purchasing or redeeming creation units the “transaction fee” the transaction fee will be borne only by purchasers and redeemers of creation units and will be limited to amounts that have been determined appropriate by the advisor to defray the transaction expenses that will be incurred by a fund when an investor purchases or redeems creation units all orders to purchase creation units will be placed with the distributor by or through an authorized participant and the distributor will transmit all purchase orders to the relevant fund the distributor will be responsible for delivering a prospectus “prospectus” to those persons purchasing creation units and for maintaining records of both the orders placed with it and the confirmations of acceptance furnished by it  shares will be listed and traded at negotiated prices on a stock exchange and traded in the secondary market applicants expect that stock exchange specialists or market makers “market makers” will be assigned to shares the price of shares trading on the stock exchange will be based on a current bidoffer in the secondary market transactions involving the purchases and sales of shares on the stock exchange will be subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges  applicants expect that purchasers of creation units will include institutional investors and arbitrageurs specialists or market makers acting in their unique role to provide a fair and orderly secondary market for shares also may purchase creation units for use in their own market making activities applicants expect that secondary market purchasers of shares will include both institutional and retail investors applicants expect that arbitrage opportunities created by the ability to continually purchase or redeem creation units at their nav per share should ensure that the shares will not trade at a material discount or premium in relation to their nav  shares will not be individually redeemable and owners of shares may acquire those shares from a fund or tender such shares for redemption to the fund in creation units only to redeem an investor must accumulate enough shares to constitute a creation unit redemption requests must be placed by or through an authorized participant  neither the trust nor any fund will be marketed or otherwise held out as a “mutual fund” instead each fund will be marketed as an “actively managed exchangetraded fund” in any advertising material where features of obtaining buying or selling shares traded on the stock exchange are described there will be an appropriate start printed page statement to the effect that shares are not individually redeemable  the funds web site which will be publicly available prior to the public offering of shares will include a prospectus and additional quantitative information updated on a daily basis including on a per share basis for each fund the prior business days nav and the market closing price or midpoint of the bidask spread at the time of the calculation of such nav “bidask price” and a calculation of the premium or discount of the market closing price or bidask price against such nav on each business day before commencement of trading in shares on the stock exchange the fund will disclose on its web site the identities and quantities of the portfolio instruments held by the fund that will form the basis for the funds calculation of nav at the end of the business day applicants legal analysis  applicants request an order under section c of the act for an exemption from sections a a d and e of the act and rule c under the act under sections c and b of the act for an exemption from sections a and a of the act and under section dj of the act for an exemption from sections da and b of the act  section c of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class of persons securities or transactions from any provisions of the act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a of the act if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general provisions of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision of section d if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors sections a and a of the act  section a of the act defines an “openend company” as a management investment company that is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer section a of the act defines a redeemable security as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon its presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately a proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent because shares will not be individually redeemable applicants request an order that would permit each fund to redeem shares in creation units only applicants state that investors may purchase shares in creation units from each fund and redeem creation units from each fund applicants further state that because the market price of creation units will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities investors should be able to sell shares in the secondary market at prices that do not vary materially from their nav section d of the act and rule c under the act  section d of the act among other things prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security that is currently being offered to the public by or through a principal underwriter except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus rule c under the act generally requires that a dealer selling redeeming or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a price based on its nav applicants state that secondary market trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices not at a current offering price described in the prospectus and not at a price based on nav thus purchases and sales of shares in the secondary market will not comply with section d of the act and rule c under the act applicants request an exemption under section c from these provisions  applicants assert that the concerns sought to be addressed by section d of the act and rule c under the act with respect to pricing are equally satisfied by the proposed method of pricing shares applicants maintain that while there is little legislative history regarding section d its provisions as well as those of rule c appear to have been designed to a prevent dilution caused by certain risklesstrading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers b prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers resulting from sales at different prices and c assure an orderly distribution system of investment company shares by eliminating price competition from brokers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption price  applicants believe that none of these purposes will be thwarted by permitting shares to trade in the secondary market at negotiated prices applicants state that a secondary market trading in shares does not involve the funds as parties and cannot result in dilution of an investment in shares and b to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day or from day to day such variances occur as a result of thirdparty market forces such as supply and demand therefore applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers finally applicants contend that the proposed distribution system will be orderly because arbitrage activity should ensure that the difference between the market price of shares and their nav remains narrow section e of the act  section e of the act generally prohibits a registered investment company from suspending the right of redemption or postponing the date of payment of redemption proceeds for more than seven days after the tender of a security for redemption applicants observe that settlement of redemptions of creation units of global funds is contingent not only on the settlement cycle of the us securities markets but also on the delivery cycles present in foreign markets in which those funds invest applicants have been advised that under certain circumstances the delivery cycles for transferring portfolio instruments to redeeming investors coupled with local market holiday schedules will require a delivery process of up to  calendar days applicants therefore request relief from section e in order to provide payment or satisfaction of redemptions within the maximum number of calendar days required for such payment or satisfaction in the principal local markets where transactions in the portfolio instruments of each global fund customarily clear and settle but in all cases no later than  calendar days start printed page following the tender of a creation unit  applicants state that section e was designed to prevent unreasonable undisclosed and unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption proceeds applicants assert that the requested relief will not lead to the problems that section e was designed to prevent applicants state that allowing redemption payments for creation units of a fund to be made within a maximum of  calendar days would not be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of section e applicants state each global funds statement of additional information “sai” will disclose those local holidays over the period of at least one year following the date of the sai if any that are expected to prevent the delivery of redemption proceeds in seven calendar days and the maximum number of days needed to deliver the proceeds for each affected global fund applicants are not seeking relief from section e with respect to global funds that do not affect redemptions inkind section d of the act  section da of the act prohibits a registered investment company from acquiring shares of an investment company if the securities represent more than  of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company more than  of the total assets of the acquiring company or together with the securities of any other investment companies more than  of the total assets of the acquiring company section db of the act prohibits a registered openend investment company its principal underwriter or any other broker or dealer from selling its shares to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than  of the acquired companys voting stock or if the sale will cause more than  of the acquired companys voting stock to be owned by investment companies generally  applicants request relief to permit investing funds to acquire shares in excess of the limits in section da of the act and to permit the funds their principal underwriters and any broker to sell shares to investing funds in excess of the limits in section dlb of the act applicants submit that the proposed conditions to the requested relief address the concerns underlying the limits in section d which include concerns about undue influence excessive layering of fees and overly complex structures  applicants submit that their proposed conditions address any concerns regarding the potential for undue influence to limit the control that an investing fund may have over a fund applicants propose a condition prohibiting the adviser of an investing management company “investing fund

subadvisor or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the investing fund subadvisor “investing funds subadvisory group”  applicants propose a condition to ensure that no investing fund or investing fund affiliate  except to the extent it is acting in its capacity as an investment adviser to a fund will cause a fund to purchase a security in an offering of securities

shares of an investing fund will not exceed the limits applicable to a fund of funds as set forth in nasd conduct rule   applicants submit that the proposed arrangement will not create an overly complex fund structure applicants note that a fund will be prohibited from acquiring securities of any investment company or company relying on section c or c of the act in excess of the limits contained in section da of the act except to the extent permitted by exemptive relief from the commission permitting the fund to purchase shares of other investment companies for shortterm cash management purposes  to ensure that an investing fund is aware of the terms and conditions of the requested order the investing funds must enter into an agreement with the respective funds “fof participation agreement” the fof participation agreement will include an acknowledgement from the investing fund that it may rely on the order only to invest in a fund and not in any other investment

may be deemed to be under common control with any other registered investment company or series thereof advised by an advisor an “affiliated fund”  applicants request an exemption under sections c and b of the act from sections a and a of the act to permit inkind purchases and redemptions of creation units by persons that are affiliated persons or second tier affiliates of the funds solely by virtue of one or more of the following a holding  or more or in excess of  of the outstanding shares of one or more funds b having an affiliation with a person with an ownership interest described in

engage in the inkind transactions that would accompany such sales and redemptions with certain investing funds of which the funds are affiliated persons or secondtier affiliates  applicants assert
