exchange will be based on a current bidoffer in the secondary market transactions involving the purchases and sales of shares on the stock exchange will be subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges  applicants expect that purchasers of creation units will include institutional investors and arbitrageurs specialists or market makers acting in their unique role to provide a fair and orderly secondary market for shares also may purchase creation units for use in their own market making activities applicants expect that secondary market purchasers of shares will include both institutional and retail investors applicants expect that arbitrage opportunities created by the ability to continually purchase or redeem creation units at their nav per share should ensure that the shares will not trade at a material discount or premium in relation to their nav  shares will not be individually redeemable and owners of shares may acquire those shares from a fund or tender such shares for redemption to the fund in creation units only to redeem an investor must accumulate enough shares to constitute a creation unit redemption requests must be placed by or through an authorized participant  neither the trust nor any fund will be marketed or otherwise held out as a âmutual fundâ instead each fund will be marketed as an âactively managed exchangetraded fundâ

stock exchange the fund will disclose on its web site the identities and quantities of the portfolio instruments held by the fund that will form the basis for the funds calculation of nav at the end of the business day applicants legal analysis  applicants request an order under section c of the act for an exemption from sections a a d and e of the act and rule c under the act under sections c and b of the act for an exemption from sections a and a of the act and under section dj of the act for an exemption from sections da and b of the act  section c of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class of persons securities or transactions from any provisions of the act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a of the act if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general provisions of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision of section d if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors sections a and a of the act  section a of the act defines an âopenend companyâ as a management investment company that is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer section a of the act defines a redeemable security as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon its presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately a proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent because shares will not be individually redeemable applicants request an order that would permit each fund to redeem shares in creation units only applicants state that investors may purchase shares in creation units from each fund and redeem creation units from each fund applicants further state that because the market price of creation units will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities investors should be able to sell shares in the secondary market at prices that do not vary materially from their nav section d of the act and rule c under the act  section d of the act among other things prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security that is currently being offered to the public by or through a principal underwriter except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus rule c under the act generally requires that a dealer selling redeeming or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a price based on its nav applicants state that secondary market trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices not at a current offering price described in the prospectus and not at a price based on nav thus purchases and sales of shares in the secondary market will not comply with section d of the act and rule c under the act applicants request an exemption under section c from these provisions  applicants assert that the concerns sought to be addressed by section d of the act and rule c under the act with respect to pricing are equally satisfied by the proposed method of pricing shares applicants maintain that while there is little legislative history regarding section d its provisions as well as those of rule c appear to have been designed to a prevent dilution caused by certain risklesstrading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers b prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers resulting from sales at different prices and c assure an orderly distribution system of investment company shares by eliminating price competition from brokers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption price  applicants believe that none of these purposes will be thwarted by permitting shares to trade in the secondary market at negotiated prices applicants state that a secondary market trading in shares does not involve the funds as parties and cannot result in dilution of an investment in shares and b to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day or from day to day such variances occur as a result of thirdparty market forces such as supply and demand therefore applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers finally applicants contend that the proposed distribution system will be orderly because arbitrage activity should ensure that the difference between the market price of shares and their nav remains narrow section e of the act  section e of the act generally prohibits a registered investment company from suspending the right of redemption or postponing the date of payment of redemption proceeds for more than seven days after the tender of a security for redemption applicants observe that settlement of redemptions of creation units of global funds is contingent not only on the settlement cycle of the us securities markets but also on the delivery cycles present in foreign markets in which those funds invest applicants have been advised that under certain circumstances the delivery cycles for transferring portfolio instruments to redeeming investors coupled with local market holiday schedules will require a delivery process of up to  calendar days applicants therefore request relief from section e in order to provide payment or satisfaction of redemptions within the maximum number of calendar days required for such payment or satisfaction in the principal local markets where transactions in the portfolio instruments of each global fund customarily clear and settle but in all cases no later than  calendar days start printed page following the tender of a creation unit  applicants state that section e was designed to prevent unreasonable undisclosed and unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption proceeds applicants assert that the requested relief will not lead to the problems that section e was designed to prevent applicants state that allowing redemption payments for creation units of a fund to be made within a maximum of  calendar days would not be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of section e applicants state each global funds statement of additional information âsaiâ will disclose those local holidays over the period of at least one year following the date of the sai if any that are expected to prevent the delivery of redemption proceeds in seven calendar days and the maximum number of days needed to deliver the proceeds for each affected global fund applicants are not seeking relief from section e with respect to global funds that do not affect redemptions inkind section d of the act  section da of the act prohibits a registered investment company from acquiring shares of an investment company if the securities represent more than  of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company more than  of the total assets of the acquiring company or together with the securities of any other investment companies more than  of the total assets of the acquiring company section db of the act prohibits a registered openend investment company its principal underwriter or any other broker or dealer from selling its shares to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than  of the acquired companys voting stock or if the sale will cause more than  of the acquired companys voting stock to be owned by investment companies generally  applicants request relief to permit investing funds to acquire shares in excess of the limits in section da of the act and to permit the funds their principal underwriters and any broker to sell shares to investing funds in excess of the limits in section dlb of the act applicants submit that the proposed conditions to the requested relief address the concerns underlying the limits in section d which include concerns about undue influence
