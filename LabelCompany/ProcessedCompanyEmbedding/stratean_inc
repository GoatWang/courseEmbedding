include but are not limited to company overview stratean inc is in the business of acquiring licensing and marketing patents and technology to create renewable energy from solid waste the company plans to turn todays landfill dilemma into tomorrows energy solution stratean incs technology converts any organic material into syngas syngas can be used as clean renewable environmentally friendly warming fuel for power plants motor vehicles and as feedstock for the generation of dme dimethyl ether dme is the premier energy carrier and offers a range of important benefits  simple and low cost of production  an environmentallybenign propellant and coolant  cleanburning and high energy efficiency  lower transportation and distribution costs  easily converted into other fuels and chemicals the stratean gasifier converts the following materials into clean reusable renewable and affordable energy  municipal solid waste msw  municipal sewage sludge  food and cooking waste  petroleum sludge and oily wastes  animal manures  cellulosic and noncellulosic biomass  energy crops  scrap tires  coal table of contents the process involves the grinding drying separating mixing and then pelletizing of solid waste these pellets constitute the feedstock for the gasifier gasifying the pellets produces syngas syngas can be converted into multiple forms of energy including motor vehicle and jet fuels the syngas produced is so clean that it generally does not require hotgas cleanup syngas is mostly hydrogen and carbon monoxide hydrogen and carbon monoxide are primary building blocks for fuels and chemicals syngas is a clean burning fuel suitable for use in duelfuel diesel engines gas turbines and steam boilers the company believes that the stratean process will turn the worlds waste problem into an abundant renewable resource of energy the stratean production can be adapted to the specific energy requirements of a given area communities are expected to benefit from the countless options created including inexpensive green electric power for homes cleanburning fuel for garbage trucks street maintenance equipment or for resale to other municipalities because of the modular nature of the components intrinsic to the process the plant could provide one energy source then be converted to provide a different energy product a stratean facility could produce additional electric power during the peak demand part of the day and produce fuels during the rest of the day the companys market segmentation is vast as the company expects to apply its technology to anything that is carbon based the markets for which the company has focused its efforts include the electric utility market municipal waste processing plants the refining sector stranded natural gas fields and canadian oil sands the company has begun pursuing opportunities to utilize the assets and intellectual properties purchased the company aims to further develop these technologies in order to pursue licensing manufacturing and direct sales agreements for its gasifier technology the technologies and prototype will begin undergoing clinical lab testing to further establish its capability of producing large volumes of clean renewable energy from any carbon compound municipal solid waste msw coal sewage sludge into clean synthesis gas the companys gasifier is still under development and a commercially viable gasifier is not expected to be sellable until the first or second quarter of  in december of  the company executed an agreement with combustion resources llc to independently test the companys production model prototype combustion was engaged to independently test the gasifers performance and certify the results of its performance the company believes the results of these independent tests will provide the results needed to prove its commercial viability at which time the company would begin to actively market its gasifer units the company has not engaged in any significant negotiations to sell its gasifier products to any major customers once completed the company intends to distribute its products through advertisements and sales calls on potential customers with demonstrations of how the products work the failure to acquire customers to generate revenues will negatively affect the companys financial performance results of operations for the three months ended december   and

or at all off balance sheet arrangements as of december   there were no off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting polices in the management discussion and analysis the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain going concern  the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has incurred cumulative net losses of  since its inception and requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place the companys ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown the obtainment of additional financing the successful development of the companys contemplated plan of operations and its transition ultimately to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the company to continue operations the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements of the company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties use of estimates  the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of assets liabilities revenues and expenses such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements accordingly upon settlement actual results may differ from estimated amounts revenue recognition  the company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition in financial statements and no  revenue recognition in all cases revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability is reasonably assured for the periods ended december   and  the company reported revenues of  and  respectively longlived assets  in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounts standard codification asc asc  property plant and equipment the carrying value of intangible assets and other longlived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment the company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset impairment losses if any are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value table of contents

reactor stratean inc announces successful initial operation of reactor dec    et from stratean inc salt lake city dec   prnewswire  stratean inc otcqb srtn is pleased to announce the successful trial operation of its patented stratified downdraft gasification system  stratean has completed preliminary development and begun the pilot scale testing of a gasifier for processing various waste materialscarbonaceous feedstocks into a clean synthesis gas using various catalysts the clean synthesis gas syngas may then be converted into highgrade synthetic liquid transportation fuels such as diesel gasoline jet fuel or other useful chemicals and may also be used as fuel to create electricity petersen inc of ogden ut manufactured the stratean gasifier and has verified the mechanical operation of the gasifier they have been assisting throughout the testing of the gasifier the current project is separated into individual tasks to demonstrate and evaluate the stratean gasifier using coal and wood pellets as a feedstock the results of the project will also provide direction and insights as to whether additional testing of the gasifier is required prior to commercial deployment combustion resources inc and utah state university are in the process of performing the tests analyzing the data and test results and will generate a final independent project report on november   and again on december   personnel from stratean combustion resources utah state university and endigit inc performed  preliminary test runs and analysis of the  tons per day stratified downdraft gasifier these tests were performed at the usu carbon energy innovation center in helper utah objectives and tasks of independent testing verify functional operation of the gasifier control programs and associated equipment and auxiliary components verify and measure reactions and operational performance against engineering assumptions and design verify measure and document production gas quantities composition and qualities verify and measure feedstock input and waste product volume ratios initial findingsfunctional operation was successful at both cold and reaction temperatures the reaction commenced at approximately  degrees c  degrees f escalating to  degrees c  degrees f in less than seven minutes positively exceeding the anticipated exothermic reaction temperature assumptions the reactor continued operating under the high temperature conditions  for approximately  hours following shutdown the reactor core maintained a temperature exceeding  degrees c  degrees f further demonstrating the properties of our patented ceramic refractory lining the production gases and other products were collected analyzed and flared ignition and combustion of the production gas was visually verified at the flare the flared gas produced a clear flame during optimal reaction temperatures the gases produced were analyzed via the gas analyzer provided by combustion resources the gases identified and measured are as follows production gas composition carbon dioxide  ≤  ppm methane  none hydrogen – hydrogen production was in excess of measuring equipment capability sulphur dioxide  none carbon monoxide ≥  ppm tars  none feedstockfeedstock used for the tests consisted of highgrade steam coal sourced locally from the skyline mine approximately  lbs of coal was processed and consumed in the reactor which produced a dry fly ash of approximately  lbs  during the december   test wood pellets were used to establish baselines for that particular feedstock next steps perform a teardown inspection and analysis of the physical components of the system and replacerepairupgrade components as needed verify system operation and calibrations perform intermediate run testing draft intermediate testing report summarythe stratean gasifier performance and quality of gasses produced exceeded expectations and engineering assumptions  although we experienced some minor issues with the feed conveyor and two thermocouples the performance of the reactor was remarkable clean quality gasses were produced without any feedstocksorbent blends the overall the reaction process and reactor capability exceeded expectations we were guardedly optimistic for this initial run having worked extensively with our engineering team  to say that the results operation and cleanliness were a success would be a massive understatement stated michael barrett strateans chief operations officer  based on the preliminary results postprocess gascleanup appears to be totally

technology  clean spark select page technology state of the art unique proprietary the technology used in our downdraft gasifier is state of the art unique and proprietary it is the technology that ultimately separates our equipment from other currently proposed and used methods computer controls and remote sensing capabilities ensure that the equipment will operate efficiently and flawlessly with minimum cost in operation competitive comparisoncosts stratean inc”s gasifier has been engineered with improvements over the proof of concept design facilitating a commercial unit with enchanced function and utility in use the principal advantages of the stratean inc stratified downdraft gasifier are modular concept allows for parallel processing so any facility could be easily expanded or reduced without risk or changing the basic structure by simply adding or removing module units it also allows for multiple end product processing producing electricity ethanol and fuels simultaneously and for universal parts which reduces maintenance costs modular concept ensures the quality and allows a facility utilizing out gasifier to be constructed and commissioned within  to months compact size allows waste to be dealt with where is it created and the electricity and fuels to be generated where it is needed thereby eliminating costly shipping fees the direct heat transfer of the gases to the material being gasified is efficient and as a natural consequence of the process the product gas is stripped of its impurities eliminating the costly hot gas clean up associated with other gasifiers pollutant absorbing binder aids in efficiency cracking hydrocarbons acting as a catalyst and absorbs the pollutants oxidizes carbon eliminating water vapor and all but  –  carbon dioxide which in our estimation will eliminate the need for carbon sequestration the process is largely selfregulating which provides a high degree of automation and the one stage process is very simple and does not require highly qualified engineers to operate produces an acceptable alternative to natural gas ash by product makes an excellent road and cement aggregate green energy credits may be available for our customers for federal tax purposes process is nearly  environmentally friendly any and all liquid and solid organic wastes can be utilized and disposed of producing no residual wastes due to the outstanding characteristics mentioned above use of this reactor will have the impact of reducing capital outlay and operational costs of synthesis gas processes relative to either multitubular or “conventional” slurry reactors several unique factors affect the capitalization and longterm cost factors of energy production using our “waste to energy” technology feedstocks are considered waste and are likely to be furnished at no cost in fact the payment of a standard “tipping” fee is charged to discharge the waste to a disposal facility or to one of our waste to energy facilities the system utilizes approximately  of its energy production to run itself this means that  of product is available for sale with no additional energy bill for operation operating costs are limited to minimal operators catalyst and feedstock preparation into uniform pellet form disposal of byproducts is incorporated in an aggregate product which is used to cast building blocks barriers light poles and similar cement formed products all these are saleable and produce additional income consideration of the above items when combined with initial capital cost and income projections shed a more than favorable picture of the cost factors of implementing the stratean inc system of alternative green fuel production we are ready to revolutionize an industry with our technology stratean inc creates renewable energy through new gasification technology that will make significant contributions in solving the growing global climate change and waste management problems these technologies
