wiest wiest for the collection of two promissory notes in late march of  wiest filed his answer admitting that he signed the promissory notes but alleged he was fraudulently induced to enter into the promissory notes by statements of howard palmer palmer a vice president and loan officer for the bank advising the wiest of facts that were not true and palmer knew they were not true wiest subsequently filed an amended answer and thirdparty complaint against lou burckhardsmeier burckhardsmeier on december   the thirdparty complaint alleged burckhardsmeier and palmer induced wiest into entering into the promissory notes through fraud a trial was held before the honorable frank racek on july   posttrial briefs were submitted to the court following trial the findings of fact conclusions of law and order for judgment were filed on september   the trial court held that wiest was induced by actual fraud on the part of palmer as agent of the bank in obtaining wiests consent to sign the  promissory note and as a result the bank could not collect on it the court found the bank could collect on a portion of the  promissory note which was expended by the bank at wiests direction lastly the court found that wiest did not have a thirdparty claim against palmer because he was acting as an agent of the bank this appeal followed by the bank wiest asks this court to affirm the decision of judge racekÂ¶ statement of factsÂ¶ wiest is an orthopedic surgeon who has practiced in fargo since  p  l  the thirdparty defendant palmer has been in the banking business since  at all times material herein he was employed by the bank as a commercial loan officer and vice president palmer originally worked at the banking location in bismarck and subsequently worked at the minot location palmer left the employment of the bank in july  p  l  burckhardsmeier was the owner of burckhardsmeier financial solutions bfs burckhardsmeier has been a car salesman truck salesman and since  he has operated as a venture capitalist and financial consultant p  l  burckhardsmeier had a number of customers that were mainly affiliated with the trucking business p  l  Â­ p  l  wiest knew burckhardsmeier for approximately  to  years as someone who has lived in the neighborhood attended the same church and who had children at the same school p  l Â¶ in the spring of  wiest had his first business dealing with burckhardsmeier burckhardsmeier needed shortterm financing for a customer known as greenberg burckhardsmeier asked wiest to personally loan greenberg  which would be collateralized by trucks and equipment exhibit  appellees appendix hereinafter referred to as appendix p  p  l  p  l  greenberg paid  to wiest early in  and an additional  was repaid in december  p  l  in february  burckhardsmeier managed a second loan for the greenbergs with wiest wiest personally loaned  to the greenbergs and   months later p  l  Â­ p  l Â¶ in the late s wiest had been a minority shareholder in a business called glass recycling midwest this business collected glass containers that would otherwise be placed in a landfill and processed them into other material p  l  glass recycling midwest was manufacturing a product that was used in making sandpaper this enterprise was marginal and required a number of cash infusions from wiest and other investors in  wiest and his partners decided to exit the recycling business and sold the business to the person who owned the building that the recycling business occupied p  l Â¶ sometime around  wiest mentioned to burckhardsmeier after a high school basketball game that this subsequent owner wished to retire and may be interested in trying to sell the recycling business in  burckhardsmeier arranged to have the recycling business sold to duane miller a bismarck cpa p  l  the business was renamed glass blast media gbm and was located in west fargo wiest was not involved in this transaction miller deferred to burckhardsmeier to run gbm operations p  l  p  l Â¶ wiest dr howard berglund an orthopedic surgeon associate of his and craig johnson a fargo attorney purchased a burner unit used to process glass for recycling p  l  they purchased it at an auction sale and had less than  invested in the burner unit early in  burckhardsmeier approached wiest and his partners to purchase the burner unit p  l  p  l  in march of  they sold the burner unit to gbm for  when it came time to settle wiest and bergland were paid  each and given a note for the balance and craig johnson received  each of these three individuals also received a  percent interest in gbm p  l  p  l  burckhardsmeier was a financial consultant for gbm pÂ¶ in late in the may of  burckhardsmeier contacted kevin johnson the owner of gateway building systems and the brother of attorney craig johnson and requested that gateway build a  x  steel building for gbm in west fargo north dakota p  l  p  l burckhardsmeier paid gateway a  deposit for the building p  l  the building was completed in december  p  l  there were to be periodic progress payments made as the construction proceeded p  l  gbm was unable to make any of the payments p  l  the ultimate purchase price of the building was to have been approximately  p  l  gbm was unable to complete this purchase eventually craig johnson kevin johnson wiest and bergland formed wbj for the purpose of buying and owning this building and rented it to gbm p  l  p  l Â¶ when wjb was looking to finance the building burckhardsmeier introduced the wjb partners to palmer a vice president of commercial lending at american bank center bank p l p l palmer proposed a pace loan which is a loan partially subsidized by the north dakota development fund this was the best financing proposal for wbj and a  pace loan was completed for the purchase of the building p  l Â­ p  l Â¶ burckhardsmeier had a long standing lending relationship with palmer that was not disclosed to wiest burckhardsmeier was operating as the financing consultant not only for gbm but also for js express hightman manufacturing travis peterson river oaks express johnson trucking mattson innovations trucks unlimited a t trucking custom cruiser starkey road leonard greenberg and pure class p  l  Â­ p  l  between principally december   and march   less than  months burckhardsmeier arranged through palmer fiftyfive different loans to various individuals and entities with whom burckhardsmeier was associated these original loans totaled  all of the loans were to have been collateralized p  l  Â­ p  l  p  l  p  exhibit  appendix p Â¶ burckhardsmeier arranged for investors in his various business enterprises basically to make good on promises to other investors p  burckhardsmeier had a number of customers mainly in the trucking business who were struggling financially burckhardsmeier would entice people or banks to loan money to burckhardsmeier or one of the various companies he was consulting repayment of the sums invested required burckhardsmeier to find other investors or other financing to cover these debts when no more investors could be found the entire enterprise collapsed exhibit  appendix p  p  l Â¶ one of the ways burckhardsmeier raised money was pledging trucks and trailers as collateral that were not owned by the entity pledging them or that had already been pledged as collateral on other obligations exhibits  appendix p   appendix p   appendix p   appendix p   appendix p   appendix p  p Â¶ in addition to financing a number of these trucking operations burckhardsmeier also tried to arrange to get work for these companies to make them appear viable because gbm needed to haul glass from landfills they became a huge source of business for burckhardsmeiers other trucking operations p  l burckhardsmeier arranged for the trucks to haul glass back to gmb on return routes from the minneapolis area p  l the glass was stockpiling without customers and ultimately craig johnson directed that no further glass be hauled to fargo for storage p  Â¶ the specifics related to the two notes at issue in this case begin in approximately august  p  l burckhardsmeier needed additional capital to keep all these various entities afloat and keep the many burckhardsmeier related loans at the bank current p  l  in late october of  palmer on behalf of the bank and burckhardsmeier approached wiest in fargo p  l  during the course of the meeting palmer and burckhardsmeier requested that wiest apply for a loan at the bank in the amount of  for the purpose of providing interim financing for the purchase of a number of semitrucks and trailers by gbm p  p  l  both palmer and burckhardsmeier told wiest that the financing would only be in place for less than a month p  l  p  l  they assured wiest it was a very safe venture because they were in the process of forming a new corporation which would obtain an sba loan through the bank and the loan proceeds from the sba loan would be used to pay off wiests loan p  l  p  l  p  l  palmer and burckhardsmeier advised wiest that the purpose of purchasing these trucks was to haul glass processed by gbm p  l  wiest understood the loan would be secured by the trucks worth  and the trucks and trailers would be the primary source of repayment for the loan in the event of a default p  l Â¶ palmer assured wiest that the bank would hold the titles to the trucks and trailers p  l  at the time the loan exhibit  appendix p  was taken out a security agreement was executed by gbm pledging specific vehicles as collateral for that loan exhibit d appendix p  burckhardsmeier knew that this property was not owned by bfs at the time he proposed to pledge it to wiest p  l  palmer never asked burckhardsmeier for the titles which should have already been in burckhardsmeiers possession if bfs owned the property nor did he check ownership of the property p  l Â¶ palmer and burckhardsmeier were scrambling to raise additional capital to continue to service the enormous debt that burckhardsmeiers related companies had piled up at the bank p  l  an examination of the bank records indicate the loan proceeds were used to pay overdrafts in the gbm checking account and the balance was disbursed to the companies controlled by burckhardsmeier exhibit  appendix p  on november   wiest signed a note at the bank exhibit  appendix p  wiest orally authorized the deposit of these funds in gbms account to purchase the trucks and trailers burckhardsmeier and palmer represented would be the collateral for the note p  l  in order to pay the overdrafts palmer drove the deposit check from minot to bismarck and deposited the check in gbms account that was overdrawn by  exhibit  appendix p   appendix p  p  l  p  the check was never made payable to wiest exhibit  appendix p  p  p  both palmer and burckhardsmeier knew that this money would not go to purchase trucks and equipment p  l  p  l  at the time the loan was closed titles were not collected for wiests loan by palmer and palmer claimed he later learned the trucks were property of star trailer sales in mankato mn exhibit  appendix p Â¶ wiest never signed an authorization for the disbursement of the  exhibit  appendix p  although wiest did believe that the money ultimately would be placed in gbms account it was his specific instruction that it would be used to purchase vehicles and that the bank would secure the titles p  l  p  l  palmer never informed wiest that he had not collected the titles from burckhardsmeier on the first two hundred fifty thousand dollar  loan as he represented p  l Â¶ less than  months later on december   palmer acting for the bank closed a  loan to gbm which was purchased by the north dakota state development credit corporation to gbm exhibit  appendix p  p  as collateral for that loan gbm pledged the exact same trucks and equipment which were to have been pledged to wiest as collateral for his loan exhibit  appendix p  gbm never owned these vehicles p  l  the loan was sold to the north dakota development fund as a purchase money security interest p  l  p  l  the funds for the  loan were not disbursed in accordance with the instructions of the ndsdcc p  l  Â­ p  l  palmer disbursed the loan proceeds to various accounts which precluded a purchase money security interest from ever being perfected exhibit  appendix p  p  l  p  palmer knew these proceeds were not being used to purchase trucks and equipment p  l  ultimately the bank had to repurchase this loan because the collateral was never procured p  l  p  l  p  l Â¶ subsequently in january  palmer traveled to fargo for a meeting with craig johnson kevin johnson wiest and bergland p  l  at that time palmer proposed that each of these four individuals take out a line of credit for  from the bank to cover various operating expenses for gbm p  l  palmer stated some of the funds would be used to increase each of the members ownership percentage in gbm to  percent and funds were needed to pay building expenses which was now owned by wbj p  l  these two items amounted to about  per individual p  l  p  l  the remainder of the line of credit was to be available to pay future expenses p  as a result of palmers presentation wiest dr howard berglund craig johnson and kevin johnson each took out a  line of credit from the bank neither palmer nor burckhardsmeier informed the members of wbj of all of the loans of gbm p  l  p  l  p  l Â¶ for each of wiests two loans at the bank the loan for  and the loan for  palmer was required to make a presentation to the banks loan committee exhibit  appendix p   appendix p  palmer concocted an elaborate story for the  loan that wiest was involved in hauling potatoes and sugar beets that he had a large trucking operation including dispatchers exhibit  appendix p   appendix p  palmer stated that the reason for wiests success in trucking was that he paid his truck drivers more than other operators exhibit  appendix p   appendix p  palmer listed each and every truck and trailer that wiest was to purchase with the  exhibit  appendix p   appendix p  at trial palmer stated that he knew wiest would never be purchasing the trucks with the money palmer stated that wiest was to put the money into gbm and burckhardsmeier was to convey the truck titles to wiest p  p  the presentation by palmer to the loan committee was devoid of almost any truthful statement wiest had never been in the trucking business had never been involved in beets or potatoes and did not have any drivers or dispatchers p  l  p  l Â¶ when palmer prepared the loan committee presentation for wiests line of credit he again referenced the exact same collateral that he knew wiest had never received for the first two hundred fifty thousand dollar  loan and that was offered to be pledged for the loan to the north dakota development fund as a purchase money security interest exhibits  appendix p   appendix p  the loan presentations made by palmer on behalf of dr howard bergland and craig johnson contained similar material misrepresentations exhibits  appendix p   appendix p Â¶ palmer also prepared the loan package that was to be sold to the north dakotadevelopment fund that included the exact same collateral as was in wiests original loan which he knew or should have known was already pledged to wiest exhibit d appendix p Â¶ on march   palmer sent burckhardsmeier an email addressed to gentlemen owners investors concerning titles to the trucks and trailers that were supposed to have been pledged to wiest and then to the north dakota development fund exhibit d appendix p  p  l  the email acknowledged the trucks continued to be subject to a lien of mankota trailer sales id p  l Â­ p  l palmer was getting a great deal of pressure from the north dakota development fund to supply the titles for this loan although the email was addressed to the owners and inventors the email was not shared by burckhardsmeier with the members of wbj p  l  palmer suggested that bergland wiest craig johnson and kevin johnson take out a letter of credit for  each to cover this loan in lieu of providing the titles to the trucks and trailers exhibit d appendix p  p  l  at this time palmer knew gbm did not own these trucks and if gbm did not own these trucks they could not meet the equity requirements for an sba loan exhibit  appendix p   appendix p  p  l  p  l  p  l Â¶ palmer continued to inform wiest that he was working on an sba loan applicationfor the refinance of gbm p  l  p  l  wiest never knew the extent to which gbm was indebted palmer said it was critical that there be no red flags that could endanger the sba financing so it was important that all of gbms obligations be current p  l  on march   palmer got wiest to authorize an advance of  from his line of credit which was to cover overdrafts for gbm as well as make a number of payments on the loans for burckhardsmeiers related entities exhibit  appendix p  p  l p  l  p  l  p  l  also on may   palmer got wiest to authorize advances in the amount of  all of which were to avoid red flags exhibit  appendix p  p  l  p  l  this money was used to make payments on various loans held at the bank for burckhardsmeiers related entities not gbm expenses as wiest authorized p Â¶ wiest made payments on his line of credit totaling  exhibit  appendix p   appendix p   appendix p  advances on this line totaled  exhibit  appendix p  on the  loan for trucks gbm made two payments on this loan for wiest one in the amount of  and another for  exhibit  appendix p Â¶ in july  palmer and burckhardsmeier met with wiest bergland craig johnson and kevin johnson to attempt to get additional funding from these four individuals when they declined palmer returned to minot to find the bank was conducting an audit of palmers files the bank asked him to take a leave of absence until it had been completed and palmer resigned he took a job with wells fargo p  l  p  l Â¶ at all times material herein palmer was in the employment of the bank and was operating as one of its loan officers p  l  palmer in processing the loans involving burckhardsmeiers various businesses violated a number of the internal rules of the bank including not properly perfecting security interests p  l  p  l  p  l  not disclosing to the loan committee the association between the various entities that burckhardsmeier was representing p  l  p  p  l p  l not getting loan committee approval when a customer went over one hundred thousand dollars  aggregate in loans p  l  p  l  not truthfully stating the facts and purpose of the loans in loan committee presentations p  l  p  l  p  l  p  l  not properly disbursing loan proceeds to perfect security interests p  l  not informing the loan committee that the funds were ultimately disbursed for a different purpose than that which was represented in the loan approval documents p  l  p  l Â¶ subsequent audits by the bank revealed most of the collateral palmer was to secure for these loans was never perfected existed as property of the various debtors p  l   p  l  ultimately the bank charged off  of these loans exhibit  appendix p  the bank has been able to recover  approximately  percent from collateral the bank ended up charging off almost all of palmers book of business other than the  building loan to wbj is still performing and was not charged off by the bank kevin johnson paid a loan in full dr bergland has a loan that is still performing and has not been charged off and some of the other loans were actually lines of credit that were never advanced p  l  p  l  all of the charged off loans were affiliated with burckhardsmeier or companies he

dakota agency lawÂ¶ palmer and burckhardsmeier induced wiest to enter into the  loan in october  by making statements of a fact that were not true when they did not believe those facts were true asserting facts which were untrue when they had no reasonable grounds to believe it to be true the assertion of facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of a fact as well as promises without any intention to perform when wiest was visited by palmer and burckhardsmeier palmer was acting as a loan officer for the bank p  l  during the course of that meeting palmer and burckhardsmeier requested that wiest apply for a loan at the bank in the amount of  to provide interim financing for the purchase of semitrucks and trailers by gbm p  l  p  l  wiest was assured by palmer that the financing would be for a short term not more than a month and that the value of the trucks would more than adequately secure the loan p  l  p  l p  l  palmer assured wiest that if the titles for the trucks and trailers would be held by the bank and adequately secure the loan p  l Â¶ at the time a  loan was taken out palmer did not advise wiest that the purpose of the loan was to cover a large overdraft which had accumulated in the companys bank account at the related bismarck branch of the bank exhibit  appendix p   appendix p  p  l p  of the total amount of outstanding debt which gbm owed to the bank that palmer had no intention of disbursing the loan funds in a manner which would insure perfection of the security interest in the trucks and trailers p  l  p  l  and that palmers underlying purpose was to have wiest fund the corporate operations to the extent necessary to qualify gbm for an sba  loan p  l  the sba  loan would have provided sufficient funding to pay off the nearly  in short term debt gbm had accumulated in loans made by palmer and as a result take palmer and bank off the hook for the inadequately collateralized  outstanding loans made by the banks to gbm prior to october of  p  l  Â¶ at the time the january   line of credit loans were taken out by wiest and the other gbm investors palmer failed to disclose to wiest and the other investors that no titles were ever obtained to perfect the banks security interest in the trucks which were to be allegedly purchased by gbm with wiests  loan p  l  of the existence of the  north dakota state development credit corporation ndsdcc loan made in late december which was secured by the same trucks and trailers as wiests loan p  l  p  l  exhibit  appendix p  exhibit  appendix p  the fact that the december loan was disbursed in such a manner that the purchase money security interest required by the ndsdcc was not disbursed in a manner as to allow perfection of the collateral p  l  and that the equipment as shown on gbms balance sheet was either not paid for or nonexistent p  l  wiest testified that if he had been aware of these facts he would have refused to enter into the  line of credit transaction p  l Â¶ following the january  meeting and the execution of the  line of credit palmer and burckhardsmeier contacted wiest on at least two separate occasions and requested that he make advances on his line of credit to pay bills of gbm and make payment on the burckhardsmeier related loans exhibits  appendix p   appendix p  both wiest and palmer testified that palmer requested these payments be made so the burckhardsmeier related loans remained current which was a necessary element to remain qualified for the sba  loan as well as keep palmers loan portfolio looking current for the banks credit committee p  l  at the same time the evidence including exhibit  appendix p  showed that on march th palmer was aware that the trucks and trailers were subject to other liens and that the  loan made by the ndsdcc had not been made in accordance with its terms further by including this equipment on gbms financial statements palmer knew that any financial statements used in an sba loan application would be false p  l  Â­ p  l Â¶ at all times during the course of these transactions palmer was the vice president of the bank and was acting within the general scope of his authority ie making loans on behalf of the bank p   p  l  as a result the bank is chargeable with the knowledge and fraud of palmerÂ¶  the trial court properly granted rescission of the  loan agreement between wiest and the bankÂ¶ an essential element of a contract is consideration ndcc Â§  failure of consideration arises when a valid contract has been formed but the performance bargained

enforceable contract from ever being formed id citing harrington v harrington  nwd   nd  the determination of whether there has been a failure of consideration is a question of fact id a failure of consideration may be either partial or total id a total failure of consideration occurs when a party failed to perform a substantial part of its obligation so as to defeat the very object of the agreement id the remedy for a total failure of consideration is to excuse the nonbreaching party from the performance of its obligations under the agreement id where a partial failure of consideration occurs the proper remedy is to grant appropriate damages to the nonbreaching party idÂ¶ wiests consideration for the october   loan was that first priority security interest would be obtained by the bank for certain trucks fully securing wiests note because proceeds were used to pay an overdraft and the bank took no steps to secure the loan as presented to wiest wiest was exposed to liability on the entire amount wiest would not have agreed to take out the note with the bank if there was not adequate collateral to secure the note p  l  p  l  at the time the january   loan was taken out wiest

other which justice may requireÂ Â¶ typically the plaintiff must give notice to the defendant of the rescission and must make an offer to restore in compliance with ndcc Â§  schaff v kennelly  nwd   nd  altons v long  nwd   stating ndcc Â§  sets forth the statutory requirements governing rescission however an offer to restore is not required when nothing exists to restore or the party seeking rescission has received nothing of value volk v volk  nwd   nd  in pursuing equitable relief there is no requirement to offer restoration barker  nd  at p citing kracl v loseke  neb   nwd   neb  see also knaebel v heiner  pd   alaska  stating because equitable rescission rather than legal rescission was sought restoration was not required prior to suit by the plaintiff in equity the suit is not on rescission but for rescission it is not a suit based upon the rescission already accomplished by the plaintiff but a suit to have the court decree a rescission id quoting dobbs Â§  at  in equity the suit is not on rescission but for rescission it is not a suit based upon the rescission already accomplished by the plaintiff but a suit to have the court decree a rescission id quoting dobbs Â§  at a court of equity has wide and extensive powers if thereÂ were no provisions in the statutes speaking upon the powers of the court of equity such court would nevertheless have and does have inherent power to grant such relief in cases in which the equitable power of the court is invoked as to the court shall seem proper in order to do justice between the parties    to place the parties in status quo and do equity between them barker v ness  nd Â p citations and quotations omittedÂ¶ in this case wiest received nothing in consideration for the signing of the notes when wiest was fraudulently induced to enter into the  loan in october of  the loan proceeds were used to pay gbm overdrafts and other bills and not used to purchase trucks and trailers as wiest was advised wiest received no consideration for that transactionÂ¶ the same holds true for the  line of credit wiest used a portion of the proceeds to pay obligations of wjb and to purchase stock in gbm the trial court found that the advances totaled  including a  payment toward a previous loan made by wiest  to gbm it increase wiests ownership interest in gbm  in fees and wiest authorized payments to thirdparty vendors of gbm    totaling  banks appendix p  another  was advanced to wbj and  to bfs id of these amounts wiest made payments of  leaving a balance of  exhibit  appendix p   appendix p   appendix p   appendix p  equitable rescission would require this balance to be repaid as the funds were advanced at wiests direction id in this case this court should affirm the trial courts decision allowing wiest to rescind both loans as he was fraudulently induced to enter into the loansÂ¶  the trial court properly found a fiduciary relationship existed between palmer and wiestÂ¶ palmer owed a fiduciary duty to wiest because wiest placed faith confidence and trust in palmer and the bank p  l  p  l  p  l  the trial court recognized that in certain situations a banking relationship may create a duty to disclose material facts see first national bank  trust of williston v bracken  nw d   nd  where the court recognizing that while a bank may not have a general duty to disclose a customers financial condition to anyone the duty to in part full fair and truthful information may arise if the bank responds to an inquiry about a customers credit status or if there is a fiduciary relationship this court also found that a fiduciary relationship may arise in a situation where the customer places his faith and confidence and trust in the bank with a resulting domination or control exercised by the bank over the borrowers affairs or if the party reposing the confidence was in a position of dependence weakness or lack of knowledge idÂ¶ the supreme court of south dakota held in buxcel v first fidelity bank that in certain situations a fiduciary duty can arise in banking relationships creating a duty to disclose material facts  nwd   sd  in buxcel the plaintiffs clifford and elain buxcel were looking to make additional income id at  first fidelity bank the defendant in the action encouraged the buxcels to purchase a grocery store of its banking customers that were looking to sell their business id a senior vice president and manager of first fidelity told the buxcels that deans market represented the buxcels could earn a good living and present owners of deans market were selling the business because they wanted to retire id at  the reality was that the store was heavily indebted to first fidelity the store had a longterm record of poor performance and first fidelity wanted to sell the grocery as a going concern rather than liquidating through a foreclosure action id first fidelity were persuaded to obtain an sba loan that guaranteed  of first fidelitys loan and conducted an internal appraisal valuing the grocery at  the buxcels made several improvements to the store but faced serious financial trouble within months of taking over and eventually defaulted on their note id upon foreclosure the sba valued the store at  idÂ¶ the buxcels sued first fidelity claiming it intentionally failed to disclose the complete and troubled financial history of the market id at trial the jury was instructed no duty existed for first fidelity to disclose the sellers financial information before the sale of the store and granted a motion for a directed verdict on the buxcels breach of fiduciary claim finding as a matter of law that no fiduciary duty was created id at Â¶ on appeal the court held the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that first fidelity had a duty to disclose with the facts presented in the case the court noted that as a general rule a party to a transaction has no duty to disclose material facts to another special circumstances may arise that would create the duty id citing klein v first edina natl bank  nwd   minn  the court found special circumstances existed under the facts presented in the case that created a confidential or fiduciary duty requiring first fidelity to disclose the true financial history of the grocery store id at Â¶ the court looked to several factors showing the bank assumed an active role and was integrally involved in the sale of the grocery store including the grocery stores poor performing loan history over a year period of time the banks internal notes stating it would be in the banks best interest to sell the bank as a going concern instead of liquidating the first meeting discussing the purchase of the store was at the bank and the banker presented the acquisition and financing package to the buxcels which included an offer agreement appraisal cash flow and sba application id at  the banker testified he had financed grocery stores in the past and knew they were a hard business and that the bank had written off the previous loan to the previous owners of the grocery until the buxcels came along with the backing of the sba id at  the bank wrote a letter to the sba in its application which stated the current owners lost interest in the business and the store needed to be arranged and a good cleaning and with proper management had potential id the court stated in shepherding this sba loan application bank clearly acted on behalf of buxcels and certainly invited reliance by buxcels a duty to disclose arose when this bank negotiated an sba loan for this prospective buyer of this sunken ship also known as a grocery store id the court found the buxcels clearly placed their trust and confidence in first fidelity and that they relied on the banker and believed he was representing their interest and found under these circumstances a duty to disclose arose id at Â¶ the iowa supreme court considered a similar case in first nat bank in lenox v brown  nw d   iowa  in brown the defendant signed a promissory note to purchase a onehalf interest in a business after being encouraged to do so by the president of the plaintiff bank id the bank did not disclose that the business was heavily indebted to the bank and the business assets were encumbered by several liens id when the defendant borrowed the money from the bank and used it to purchase the interest in the business the banker used a portion of the purchase price to pay down the business loans id at  when the defendant discovered the bank loans and the liens he left the business and failed to pay the note id the iowa supreme court in upholding the trial courts judgment held that because the banker had superior knowledge and familiarity with the operative facts the plaintiff had an duty of disclosure id at  further by failing to disclose the facts the bank lured defendants into a borrowing transaction by failing to reveal its own interest id at  the court in affirming the trial courts decision found that the bank breached a duty to the defendant which amounted to fraud in the inducement allowing the right of avoidance on the part of the defendant idÂ¶ in this case there are any numbers of factors that indicate that palmer was far more than a lender representing the bank palmer presided over all the meetings with wiest and the gbm investors and formulated the lending strategy for financing gbm and all the related companies p  l  p  l  wiest placed his trust and confidence in palmer p  l  p  l  palmer was intimately involved in the discussions with wiest as well as the other investors regarding what were the necessary requirements for gbms financial success p  l palmer had complete knowledge of the nature and amount of the loans taken out by gbm and all of the burckhardsmeier related companies including the lack of collateral p  l  Â­ p  l  p  exhibits  appendix p   appendix p  palmer knew that the required collateral was not present on the wiest loan the  nddf loan and the dozens of loans he had made to the burckhardsmier related companies exhibits  appendix p   appendix p  p  l  p  l  p  l  p  l  p  l  palmer was aware that the trucks pledge to nddf did not belong to gbm and that gbm would not meet the equity requirements for an sba loan p  l  p  l  wiest did not receive a copy the march   email which showed that palmer was aware that gbm would not be acquiring the trucks and that palmer was fully aware that the trucks were not assets of gbm exhibit  appendix p  this occurred prior to the advances that palmer requested wiest make on his line of credit to prevent red flags exhibits  appendix p   appendix p  p  l  p l  these payments only benefitted the bank and were given wiests lack of knowledge of the true facts of no benefit to wiest exhibit  appendix p   appendix p  p  l  Â­ p  l  p  l  Â­  p  l  p  l  p  l  p  l    by these actions palmer was apparently attempting to persuade wiest and the other investors to save the banks sunken shipÂ¶ palmers role went well beyond that of a lender and as a result palmer had a duty to make full disclosure to wiest and the other investors of the nature and amount of the loans taken out by gbm the lack of collateral for the loans the involvement of all of the burckhardsmeier related companies and loans with the bank so that wiest and the other investors could make an informed decision based on the actual facts of gbms precarious financial position the trial court found that this breach amounted to fraud in the inducement and the remedy for such a breach was avoidance on the part of wiest brown  nwd at  banks appendix p Â¶ the bank attempts to distinguish dewey v lutz arguing that the bank was unaware of palmers activities and that wiests actions in paying on the various promissory notes exhibits  appendix p  and  appendix p  prevented the bank from discovering palmers fraud appellants brief Â¶  that however is not the case dawn maus a lending officer who had been with american bank center for  years and who was chairman of the loan committee throughout the calendar year  testified that red flags began to pop up in the bank on palmers loans  months prior to july p  l  p Â¶ it is clear at the time the bank had reasonable suspicion that something was wrong with palmers loans including wiest making payments on all of the burckhardsmeier related loans to prevent red flags further the bank was the beneficiary of palmers fraud in that it received the proceeds from wiest loans to clear overdrafts and make payments on the burckhardsmeier related loansÂ¶ conclusionÂ¶ the trial court properly found a fiduciary relationship existed between palmer and wiest because palmers actions went beyond a traditional lending relationship between banker and customer wiest placed his trust and confidence in palmer and palmer had a duty to disclose his relationship with burckhardsmeier and the lack of collateral for the loans the trial court properly granted rescission of the  loan agreement between wiest and the bank because wiest was induced to enter the loan through the fraud of palmer the fraud was properly imputed from american bank center because palmer was employed by the bank and acting as an agent on its behalf david l wiest respectfully requests this court to affirm the judgment of the district court for the reason it is supported by the

new york  thestreet  it is a victory for common sense tracking the trading behavior of company executives directors and large shareholders in the stocks of firms theyre registered in as insiders has proven to be profitable according to both academic studies and more importantly the experience of professional investors below are lists of the top  mainly openmarket insider purchases and sales filed at the securities and exchange commission tuesday july   as ranked by dollar value please note however that these are only factual lists not buy and sell recommendations dollar value is only one metric to assess the importance of an insider transaction and frankly often not even the most important metric that determines if an insider transaction is significant we should also relay that july is a seasonally slow filing period for insider transactions so the dollar values of the records below are likely smaller than they will be in august at insider insights we find significant insider signals just about every day using screens like these to determine where we should focus our subsequent fundamental and technical analysis and while stocks dont or shouldnt move up or down based on insider activity alone insiders tend to be good indicators of when real stockmoving events like earnings surprises corporate actions and new products may be in the offing so use these regular top
