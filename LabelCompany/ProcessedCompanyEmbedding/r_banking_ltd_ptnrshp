agent of the bank in obtaining wiests consent to sign the  promissory note and as a result the bank could not collect on it the court found the bank could collect on a portion of the  promissory note which was expended by the bank at wiests direction lastly the court found that wiest did not have a thirdparty claim against palmer because he was acting as an agent of the bank this appeal followed

other investors in  wiest and his partners decided to exit the recycling business and sold the business to the person who owned the building that the recycling business occupied p  l ¶ sometime around  wiest mentioned to burckhardsmeier after a high school basketball game that this subsequent owner wished to retire and may be interested in trying to sell the recycling business in  burckhardsmeier arranged to have the recycling business sold to duane miller a bismarck cpa p  l  the business was renamed glass blast media gbm and was located in west fargo wiest was not involved in this

 burckhardsmeier had a number of customers mainly in the trucking business who were struggling financially burckhardsmeier would entice people or banks to loan money to burckhardsmeier or one of the various companies he was consulting repayment of the sums invested required burckhardsmeier to find other investors or other financing to cover these debts when no more investors could be found the entire enterprise collapsed exhibit  appendix p  p  l ¶ one of the ways burckhardsmeier raised money was pledging trucks and trailers as collateral that were not owned by the entity pledging them or

without customers and ultimately craig johnson directed that no further glass be hauled to fargo for storage p  ¶ the specifics related to the two notes at issue in this case begin in approximately august  p  l burckhardsmeier needed additional capital to keep all these various entities afloat and keep the many burckhardsmeier related loans at the bank current p  l  in late october of  palmer on behalf of the bank and burckhardsmeier approached wiest in fargo p  l  during the course of the meeting palmer and burckhardsmeier requested that wiest apply for a loan at the bank in the amount of  for the purpose of providing interim financing for the purchase of a number of semitrucks and trailers by gbm p  p  l  both palmer and burckhardsmeier told wiest that the financing would only be in place for less than a month p  l  p  l  they assured wiest it was a very safe venture because they were in the process of forming a new corporation which would obtain an sba loan through the bank and the loan proceeds from the sba loan would be used to pay off wiests loan p  l  p  l  p  l  palmer and burckhardsmeier advised wiest that the purpose of purchasing these trucks was to haul glass processed by gbm p  l  wiest understood the loan would be secured by the trucks worth  and the trucks and trailers would be the primary source of repayment for the loan in the event of a default p  l ¶ palmer assured wiest that the bank would hold the titles to the trucks and trailers p  l  at the time the loan exhibit  appendix p  was taken out a security agreement was executed by gbm pledging specific vehicles as collateral for that loan exhibit d appendix p  burckhardsmeier knew that this property was not owned by bfs at the time he proposed to pledge it to wiest p  l  palmer never asked burckhardsmeier for the titles which should have already been in burckhardsmeiers possession if bfs owned the property nor did he check ownership of the property p  l ¶ palmer and burckhardsmeier were scrambling to raise additional capital to continue to service the enormous debt that burckhardsmeiers related companies had piled up at the bank p  l  an examination of the bank records indicate the loan proceeds were used to pay overdrafts in the gbm checking account and the balance was disbursed to the companies controlled by burckhardsmeier exhibit  appendix p  on november   wiest signed a note at the bank exhibit  appendix p  wiest orally authorized the deposit of these funds in gbms account to purchase the trucks and trailers burckhardsmeier and palmer represented would be the

instruction that it would be used to purchase vehicles and that the bank would secure the titles p  l  p  l  palmer never informed wiest that he had not collected the titles from burckhardsmeier on the first two hundred fifty thousand dollar  loan as he represented p  l ¶ less than  months later on december   palmer acting for the bank closed a  loan to gbm which was purchased by the north dakota state development credit corporation to gbm exhibit  appendix p  p  as collateral for that loan gbm pledged the exact same trucks and equipment which were to have been pledged to wiest as

proposed that each of these four individuals take out a line of credit for  from the bank to cover various operating expenses for gbm p  l  palmer stated some of the funds would be used to increase each of the members ownership percentage in gbm to  percent and funds were needed to pay building expenses which was now owned by wbj p  l  these two items amounted to about  per individual p  l  p  l  the remainder of the line of credit was to be available to pay future expenses p  as a result of palmers presentation wiest dr howard berglund craig johnson and kevin johnson each took out a  line of credit from the bank neither palmer nor burckhardsmeier informed the members of wbj of all of the loans of gbm p  l  p  l  p  l ¶ for each of wiests two loans at the bank the loan for  and the loan for  palmer was required to make a presentation to the banks loan committee exhibit  appendix p   appendix p  palmer concocted an elaborate story for the  loan that wiest was involved in hauling potatoes and sugar beets that he had a large trucking operation including dispatchers exhibit  appendix p   appendix p  palmer stated that the reason for wiests success in trucking was that he paid his truck drivers more than other operators exhibit  appendix p   appendix p  palmer listed each and every truck and trailer that wiest was to purchase with the  exhibit  appendix p   appendix p  at trial palmer stated that he knew wiest would never be purchasing the trucks with the money palmer stated that wiest was to put the money into gbm and burckhardsmeier was to convey the truck titles to

did not have any drivers or dispatchers p  l  p  l ¶ when palmer prepared the loan committee presentation for wiests line of credit he again referenced the exact same collateral that he knew wiest had never received for the first two hundred fifty thousand dollar  loan and that was offered to be pledged for the loan to the north dakota development fund as a purchase money security interest exhibits  appendix p   appendix p  the loan presentations made by palmer on behalf of dr howard bergland and craig johnson contained similar material misrepresentations exhibits  appendix p   appendix p ¶ palmer also prepared the loan package that was to be sold to the north dakotadevelopment fund that included the exact same collateral as was in wiests original loan which he knew or should have known

supposed to have been pledged to wiest and then to the north dakota development fund exhibit d appendix p  p  l  the email acknowledged the trucks continued to be subject to a lien of mankota trailer sales id p  l ­ p  l palmer was getting a great deal of pressure from the north dakota development fund to supply the titles for this loan although the email was addressed to the owners and inventors the email was not shared by burckhardsmeier with the members of wbj p  l  palmer suggested that bergland wiest craig johnson and kevin johnson take out a letter of credit for  each to cover this loan in lieu of providing the titles to the trucks and trailers exhibit d appendix p  p  l  at this time palmer knew gbm did not own these trucks and if gbm did not own these trucks they could not meet the

be current p  l  on march   palmer got wiest to authorize an advance of  from his line of credit which was to cover overdrafts for gbm as well as make a number of payments on the loans for burckhardsmeiers related entities exhibit  appendix p  p  l p  l  p  l  p  l  also on may   palmer got wiest to authorize advances in the amount of  all of which were to avoid red flags exhibit

resigned he took a job with wells fargo p  l  p  l ¶ at all times material herein palmer was in the employment of the bank and was operating as one of its loan officers p  l  palmer in processing the

necessary to qualify gbm for an sba  loan p  l  the sba  loan would have provided sufficient funding to pay off the nearly  in short term debt gbm had accumulated in loans made by palmer and as a

the burckhardsmeier related loans exhibits  appendix p   appendix p  both wiest and palmer testified that palmer requested these payments be made so the burckhardsmeier related loans remained current which was a necessary element to remain qualified for the sba  loan as well as keep palmers loan portfolio looking current for the banks credit committee p  l  at the same time the evidence including exhibit  appendix p  showed that on march th palmer was aware that the trucks and trailers were subject to other liens and that the  loan made by the ndsdcc had not been made in accordance with its

case wiest received nothing in consideration for the signing of the notes when wiest was fraudulently induced to enter into the  loan in october of  the loan proceeds were used to pay gbm overdrafts and other bills and not used to purchase trucks and trailers as wiest was advised wiest received no consideration for that transaction¶ the same holds true for the  line of credit wiest used a portion of the proceeds to pay obligations of wjb and to purchase stock in gbm the trial court found that the advances totaled  including a  payment toward a previous loan made by wiest  to gbm it increase wiests ownership interest in gbm  in fees and wiest authorized payments to thirdparty vendors of gbm    totaling  banks appendix p  another  was advanced to wbj and  to bfs id of these amounts wiest made payments of  leaving a balance of  exhibit  appendix p   appendix p   appendix p   appendix p  equitable rescission would require this balance to be repaid as the funds were advanced at wiests direction id in this case this court should affirm the trial courts decision allowing wiest to rescind both loans as he was fraudulently induced to enter into the loans¶  the trial court properly found a fiduciary relationship existed between palmer and wiest¶ palmer owed a fiduciary duty to wiest because wiest placed faith confidence and trust in palmer and the bank p  l  p  l  p  l  the trial court recognized that in certain situations a banking relationship may create a duty to disclose material facts see first national bank  trust of williston v bracken  nw d   nd  where the court recognizing that while a bank may not have a general duty to disclose a customers financial condition to anyone the duty to in part full fair and truthful information may arise if the bank responds to an inquiry about a customers credit status or if there is a fiduciary relationship this court also found that a fiduciary relationship may arise in a situation where the customer places his faith and confidence and trust in the bank with a resulting domination or control exercised by the bank over the borrowers affairs or if the party reposing the confidence was in a position of dependence weakness or lack of knowledge id¶ the supreme court of south dakota held in buxcel v first fidelity bank that in certain situations a fiduciary duty can arise in banking relationships creating a duty to disclose material facts  nwd   sd  in buxcel the plaintiffs clifford and elain buxcel were looking to make additional income id at  first fidelity bank the defendant in the action encouraged the buxcels to purchase a grocery store of its banking customers that were looking to sell their business id a senior vice president and manager of first fidelity told the buxcels that deans market represented the buxcels could earn a good living and present owners of deans market were selling the business because they wanted to retire id at  the reality was that the store was heavily indebted to first fidelity the store had a longterm record of poor performance and first fidelity wanted to sell the grocery as a going concern rather than liquidating through a foreclosure action id first fidelity were persuaded to obtain an sba loan that guaranteed  of first fidelitys loan and conducted an internal appraisal valuing the grocery at  the buxcels made several improvements to the store but faced serious financial trouble within months of taking over and eventually defaulted on their note id upon foreclosure the sba valued the store at  id¶ the buxcels sued first fidelity claiming it intentionally failed to disclose the complete and troubled financial history of the market id at trial the jury was instructed no duty existed for first fidelity to disclose the sellers financial information before the sale of the store and granted a motion for a directed verdict on the buxcels breach of fiduciary claim finding as a matter of law that no fiduciary duty was created id at ¶ on appeal the court held the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that first fidelity had a duty to disclose with the facts presented in the case the court noted that as a general rule a party to a transaction has no duty to disclose material facts to another special circumstances may arise that would create the duty id citing klein v first edina natl bank  nwd   minn  the court found special circumstances existed under the facts presented in the case that created a confidential or fiduciary duty requiring first fidelity to disclose the true financial history of the grocery store id at ¶ the court looked to several factors showing the bank assumed an active role and was integrally involved in the sale of the grocery store including the grocery stores poor performing loan history over a year period of time the banks internal notes stating it would be in the banks best interest to sell the bank as a going concern instead of liquidating the first meeting discussing the purchase of the store was at the bank and the banker presented the acquisition and financing package to the buxcels which included an offer agreement appraisal cash flow and sba application id at  the banker testified he had financed grocery stores in the past and knew they were a hard business and that the bank had written off the previous loan to the previous owners of the grocery until the buxcels came along with the backing of the sba id at  the bank wrote a letter to the sba in its application which stated the current owners lost interest in the business and the store needed to be arranged and a good cleaning and with proper management had potential id the court stated in shepherding this sba loan application bank clearly acted on behalf of buxcels and certainly invited reliance by buxcels a duty to disclose arose when this bank negotiated an sba loan for this prospective buyer of this sunken ship also known as a grocery store id the court found the buxcels clearly placed their trust and confidence in first fidelity and that they relied on the banker and believed he was representing their interest and found under these circumstances a duty to disclose arose id at ¶ the iowa supreme court considered a similar case in first nat bank in lenox v brown  nw d   iowa  in brown the defendant signed a promissory note to purchase a onehalf interest in a business after being encouraged to do so by the president of the plaintiff bank id the bank did not disclose that the business was heavily indebted to the bank and the business assets were encumbered by several liens id when the defendant borrowed the money from the bank and used it to purchase the interest in the business the banker used a portion of the purchase price to pay down the business loans id at  when the defendant discovered the bank loans and the liens he left the business and failed to pay the note id the iowa supreme court in upholding the trial courts judgment held that because the banker had superior knowledge and familiarity with the operative facts the plaintiff had an duty of disclosure id at  further by failing to disclose the facts the bank lured defendants into a borrowing transaction by failing to reveal its own interest id at  the court in affirming the trial courts decision found that the bank breached a duty to the defendant which amounted to fraud in the inducement allowing the right of avoidance on the part of the defendant id¶ in this case there are any numbers of factors that indicate that palmer was far more than a lender representing the bank palmer presided over all the meetings with wiest and the gbm investors and formulated the lending strategy for financing gbm and all the related companies p  l  p  l  wiest placed his trust and confidence in palmer p  l  p  l  palmer was intimately involved in the discussions with wiest as well as the other investors regarding what were the necessary requirements for gbms financial success p  l palmer had complete knowledge of the nature and amount of the loans taken out by gbm and all of the burckhardsmeier related companies including the lack of collateral p  l  ­ p  l  p  exhibits  appendix p   appendix p  palmer knew that the required collateral was not present on the wiest loan the  nddf loan and the dozens of loans he had made to the burckhardsmier related companies exhibits  appendix p   appendix p  p  l  p  l  p  l  p  l  p  l  palmer was aware that the trucks pledge to nddf did not belong to gbm and that gbm would not meet the equity requirements for an sba loan p  l  p  l  wiest did not receive a copy the march   email which showed that palmer was aware that gbm would not be acquiring the trucks and that palmer was fully aware that the trucks were not assets of gbm exhibit  appendix p  this occurred prior to the advances that palmer requested wiest make on his line of credit to prevent red flags exhibits  appendix p   appendix p  p  l  p l  these payments only benefitted the bank and were given wiests lack of knowledge of the true facts of no benefit to wiest exhibit  appendix p   appendix p  p  l  ­ p  l  p  l  ­  p  l  p  l  p  l  p  l    by these actions palmer was apparently attempting to persuade wiest and the other investors to save the banks sunken ship¶ palmers role went well beyond that of a lender and as a result palmer had a duty to make full disclosure to wiest and the other investors of the nature and amount of the loans taken out by gbm the lack of collateral for the loans the involvement of all of the burckhardsmeier related companies and loans with the bank so that wiest and the other investors could make an informed decision based on the actual facts of gbms precarious financial position the trial court found that this breach amounted to fraud in the inducement and the remedy for such a breach was avoidance on the part of wiest brown  nwd at  banks appendix p ¶ the bank attempts to distinguish dewey v lutz arguing that the bank was unaware of palmers activities and that wiests actions in paying on the various promissory notes exhibits  appendix p  and  appendix p  prevented the bank from discovering palmers fraud appellants brief ¶  that however is not the case dawn maus a lending officer who had been with american bank center for  years and who was chairman of the loan committee throughout the calendar year  testified that red flags began to pop up in the bank on palmers loans  months prior to july p  l  p ¶ it is clear at the time the bank had reasonable suspicion that something was wrong with palmers loans including wiest making payments on all of the burckhardsmeier related loans to prevent red flags further the bank was the beneficiary of palmers fraud in that it received the proceeds from wiest loans to clear overdrafts and make payments on the burckhardsmeier related loans¶ conclusion¶ the trial court properly found a fiduciary relationship existed between palmer and wiest because palmers actions went beyond a traditional lending relationship between banker and customer wiest placed his trust and confidence in palmer and palmer had a duty to disclose his relationship with burckhardsmeier and the lack of collateral for the loans the trial court properly granted rescission of the  loan agreement between wiest and the bank because wiest was induced to enter the loan through the fraud of palmer the fraud was properly imputed from american bank center because palmer was employed by the bank and acting as an agent on its behalf david l wiest respectfully requests

trading behavior of company executives directors and large shareholders in the stocks of firms theyre registered in as insiders has proven to be profitable according to both academic studies and more importantly the experience of professional investors below are lists of the top  mainly openmarket insider purchases and sales filed at the securities and exchange commission tuesday july   as ranked by dollar value please note however that these are only factual lists not buy and sell recommendations dollar value is only one metric to assess the importance of an insider transaction and frankly often not even the most important metric that determines if an insider transaction is significant we should also relay that july is a seasonally slow filing period for insider transactions so the dollar values of the records below are likely smaller than they will be in august at insider insights we find significant insider signals just about every day using screens like these to determine where we should focus our subsequent fundamental and technical analysis and while stocks dont or shouldnt move up or down based on insider activity alone insiders tend to be good indicators of when
