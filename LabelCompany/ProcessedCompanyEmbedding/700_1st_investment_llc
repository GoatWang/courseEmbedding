contact us corporations compared to llcs knowledge centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm life insurance medical reimbursement plans medical

crazeno reception desk or smiling gatekeeper greets you at the entrance of satori investment partners llcs office there is just one big red oriental rug courtesy of the feng shui consultant who helped the new hedgefund firm incorporate the five zen elements into its office the red rug signifies fire the loftlike offices concrete walls are earth and overhead ducts are metal how to incorporate water is an open question but the partners have nixed cheesy fountains to find the fifth element wood you only have to walk ahead to the heart of the evolving business where two lightcolored tables are pushed backtoback—placeholders for a round maple centerpiece being handcrafted by an artisan it will anchor a semicircle of desks each a chairspin distance away so satoris founding partners can swing around anytime for impromptu meetings “trying to take ego out of the equation will be a key to our success” says the head of trading a former big ten football player named john kiple its all part of an effort to distinguish satori as a softer more “sustainable” hedge fund and to summon the collaborative spirit mr kiple and his four partners say they felt early in their careers at pioneering chicago options trading firm oconnor  associates and a branded successor that was before an explosion of growth in the industry changed the marketplace and the nature of their jobs “weve all worked together for a long period of time and so we do know like and trust each other” says rich excell chief investment officer and primary pitchman satori investment partners llcs john kiple from left patrick whalen michael taylor rich excell and chris dardanes photo manuel martinezwith every decision from incorporating feng shui to adopting the name “satori” which is a japanese zen buddhist word meaning “awakening” or “enlightenment” they are intent on distancing themselves from the stereotypical image of megalomaniac hedgefund managers “most hedge funds are autocratic and singlepartner entities with strong hierarchies where the employees are just contracted and functionaries” says patrick whalen a new york transplant who is chief operating officer ”we are building a team approach where everyone is asked to contribute in numerous ways” to be clear theres no mistaking these middleaged traders for new age gurus they cant always remember all five zen elements and the vibe theyre going for doesnt extend to socially conscious investing and while being distinct is one thing raising  million from investors as satori aims is quite another drinker biddle  reath llp attorney david matteson who has long worked with hedge funds says its easy to launch a fund the challenge is luring investors “its just hard to be successful” he says “to attract the capital necessary to make it a viable concern” at satori theres no ceo and no dress code on a recent tuesday one partner wears a tshirt stamped with the word “intrepid” and another a longsleeved golf shirt sometimes they say a meeting shifts at the last minute to the golf course a place where the future partners hatched the idea for the firm both  mr excell and mr kiple have known each other since  when they started at oconnor the same day they collaborated on and off over the next  years even as their firm went through a tumble of transactions it was acquired in  by swiss bank corp which in turn was absorbed in  by ubs ag switzerlands biggest bank through it all oconnor employees grouped together eventually the two men went on to other companies but by  each had returned to the “oconnor” fund at ubs over lunch one day they reflected on how much the firm—and the industry—had changed from the independent days when trading managers pulled together and shared in gains and losses that spirit they agreed had faded as teams grew more specialized and siloed in their work with certain groups rewarded for performance more than the whole “at some point in time the structure of the hedgefund industry changed collaboration was lost along that path” mr kiple explains quotejohn kiple head of tradingtrying to take ego out of the equation will be a key to our success their shop talk spilled over onto golf rounds with another oconnor pal chris dardanes  who had left the firm along with mr kiple in  to found statistical consulting firm van buren advisors theyre still stakeholders but no longer in management they also reached out to michael taylor  an oconnor portfolio manager who sat near mr excell at the office for years casual talk soon turned into long lunch meetings at monks pub on wells street to make up for squatting at a table for hours intently brainstorming how to recapture that old oconnor rhythm they left big tips for monks waitresses then in  prompted by financial losses and intense postcrisis government scrutiny of the industry ubs began a massive restructuring mr kiple mr excell and mr taylor exited one by one they wont say whether their departures were voluntary mr excell notes only that ubs is generous in its breakups they began seriously plotting their firm soon mr dardanes came on board at the suggestion of a big bank sales manager they contacted mr whalen  a new yorker whose views of the industry were similar and who had worked for oconnor early in his career before shifting to such wall street firms as morgan stanley and lehman bros holdings inc with a divorce in the works and his four kids in high school or college he agreed to sign on as satori chief operating officer and chief compliance officer and move to chicago for what they consider the culminating chapter of their careers each of the five partners ponied up equal investments for equal ownership stakes to start satori “all endeavors require taking risk—especially startups” mr taylor sayshedge funds largely are a phenomenon of the past  years with the amount of capital invested in them rising nearly every year since  at the end of the second quarter of  an astounding  trillion had been invested in the early days hedge funds mainly catered to highnetworth clients who sought steady strong returns—and who wanted to avoid extreme swings in the market—through the funds hedging techniques under federal law such funds are open only to individual investors with a net worth of at least  million excluding their primary residence or  in annual income thats because theyre generally less transparent with fewer federal disclosure requirements than say mutual funds theyre riskier too because there are fewer limits on the types of investments they make in their first decade hedge funds demonstrated impressive early returns often of plus percent so gradually they attracted a flood of big institutional investors such as pension funds and endowments with the influx firms swelled and grew more bureaucratic new funds proliferated niche funds copycat funds but returns mellowed in  the average return for hedge funds was  percent according to chicagobased hedge fund research inc while the sp  index was up  percent “the total industry has grown but much of it is in the most wellestablished funds” says ken heinz head of chicagobased hedge fund research “to become established is the challenging part” thats because institutional investors often have a strong bias toward wellknown names such as chicago giant citadel llc nearly  percent of hedgefund capital last year flowed into funds that already have  billion under management the remainder mainly went to funds with less than  million satori is the latest in a long line of oconnor spinoffs trying to gain a foothold successful local spawn include peak investments lp getco llc chicago trading co and wolverine trading llc there doubtless have been failures too but those are mostly forgotten in  almost as many hedge funds liquidated as launched with  starting up and  closing down mr heinz argues that the bulk of failures are at funds started by novices who rely on friends and family for investments new managers who can call on former customers are much more likely to succeed he says still its tough to find investors willing to take firstfund risk mr taylor satoris head of research sees an advantage for smaller firms like satori over larger ones where rules and bureaucracy have choked the mission “somewhere along the line those rules kind of distort or lose sight of the fact that theres this end consumer this investor for whom we need to deliver the best product” he sayssatoris partners are in constant communication they frequently text each other business ideas to the point that mr excells teenage daughter tells her father that he spends more time messaging his partners than she does her friends to build the firm its all about luring capital right now—the trading comes later in addition to their own contact lists theyve hired morgan stanley goldman sachs group inc and bank of america corp as brokers to introduce them to prospective investors so far theyve contacted some  prospects since midmarch meeting some and calling or emailing others but its a steep climb mr excell says one potential investor told him he looks at  to  new funds each year quotenearly as many hedge funds liquidated in  as launched for now theyre meeting mainly with investment firms that put together funds made up of hedge funds—such as chicagobased grosvenor capital management lp they are also meeting with managers that invest for wealthy families and with institutional investors though the latter are harder to lure in the early stages they decline to name any of the prospects the ask a minimum  million to  million investment with the goal of collecting  million new york is the epicenter of fundraising so the partners have spent most of their time there but theyve made the occasional trips to california and texas the hard part mr kiple says is that its a “long slow iterative process” with an average of six to nine meetings or other “touchpoints” over as many months before someone writes a check that slow burn is not the kind of work these chicago traders know theyre all about fast outcomes good or bad “its an immediate” says mr kiple snapping his fingers “the market tells you how smart or how dumb you are every single day” being on the sixth meeting with four or five big investors is “great” but interest is still hard to gauge he says the satori partners wont get to invest and trade until later this year theyre developing a strategy that takes long and short positions in stocks and stock options with an interdisciplinary approach that draws from all of their skills mr excell is the bigpicture guy scanning the world for economic and geopolitical trends while mr kiple focuses on eventdriven ripples in the markets like acquisitions mounting in certain industries mr taylor drills down monitoring headwinds and tailwinds in industries and at companies mr dardanes is the “quant man” poring over data from world economies and industries for patterns as for mr whalen he tends the operations overseeing accounting and human resources among other things following the bernie madoff scandal in which investors were bilked of  billion potential customers want to know the business is sound he says to demonstrate their commitment the partners tell prospects that theyve personally got a majority of their “liquid net worth” wrapped up in the fund they wont say how much that is but its likely at least millions of dollars thanks to each of their two decades of earnings while theyre asking a standard  percent to  percent annual management fee on capital invested and  percent of returns early investors may be able to negotiate better deals on the cost side some vendors are allowing a longterm payment schedule satoris partners arent locking themselves into any particular growth goal but theyre optimistic they draw inspiration from their headquarters previous tenant a software company that grew so fast it tripled its staff and was forced to seek bigger digsrelated meet

centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm life insurance medical reimbursement plans medical insurance premiums and parking shareholderemployees of a c corporation do
