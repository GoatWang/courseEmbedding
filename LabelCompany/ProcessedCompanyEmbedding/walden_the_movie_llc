i jason k salad dressings “i am a member of weight watchers at yesterdays meeting another member mentioned that she had discovered your salad dressings at weight watchers we turn our food into a certain number of points i cant speak for anyone else but i certainly got excited to hear that  portion  tablespoons of your salad dressing is zero points so i decided to try it…that afternoon i bought the blue cheese flavor i must admit that when i saw the zeros all over the nutrition label   calories  fat  i automatically assumed it might also be “” in flavor boy was i happy to be wrong it is delicious i am assuming that your other flavors are too so i intend to try them as well these will now be my permanent salad dressings” p winters “i cant believe that there are no calories carbs or fat in your salad dressings am i dreaming because they are the best dressings ive ever tasted even my kids love them” c gil “i just recently discovered your salad dressings and i cant tell you how fabulous they are eating local a lot of salads is now a pleasure with your dressings i just had to tell you what a great product you have i of course have told everyone i know including my diet doctor

barbeque sauces ive been on a diet for  weeks today and have lost  pounds so far i cant do it without your barbeque sauce and salad dressings lemon pepper on my grilled chicken just wasnt doing the

for life no name “i love your products i have been using them for a while now and they have really helped me lose a lot of weight im now using the bbq sauce as a marinade its incredible so now the big question  how soon will you be making pizza or ice cream thanks” tony m “ive been using your zero calorie products for a couple of months now theyre great ive been dieting and eating a lot of low

the weight off” roger m pasta sauces “just received my shipment of your products and tried both the herb  garlic and tomato  basil pasta saucesi was in heaven i already thoroughly enjoyed your salad dressings and dips but these two products surpassed my already high expectations i plan to order many more bottles” c cauthron “i just had to write i recently happened to find your alfredo pasta sauce

interested to try your other products now i am very impressed even my husband liked the sauce keep up the good work” l saari chocolate syrup “i found your chocolate syrup and i have to say this is the best diet syrup on the market its every bit as good in flavor and texture as the highsugar syrups” diane l “i love your chocolate syrup i have just gone from  lbs to lbs its not miss america weight yet but its the first time in over a dozen years ive been under  being diabetic disabled and a chocoholic is a lousy combination and your great chocolate syrup is a dream come true great great” pearl u “i really love your fruit syrups they are delicious over sugar free ice cream and incredible in fruit smoothies thanks for thinking of the weightconscious among us ann f “i have to send a huge compliment to walden farms i am a bodybuilder and very strict about what i eat i finally got my body to where i am satisfied with it however i was having a hard time because i love chocolate so much then i found your chocolate syrup and dip and i am completely amazed i feel like i am cheating” willie b “i spent a large amount of money on pancake syrup figuring id hold on to the receipt in case it was a bust i am absolutely shocked as this pancake syrup was just wonderful worth every penny i cant believe someone can do this make it have the right taste  texture to pull itself off as being just as good as the light syrup i was using but when one is dieting  calories of syrup is a lot considering theres no nutritional value please tell whoever made that caloriefree pancake syrup that they have a new fan in me i am so excited thanks” sue g dips for fruit “i recently purchased your marshmallow fruit dip and it was perhaps the greatest thing that i have ever enjoyed with my strawberries in my entire life thank you so very much for this product i genuinely do appreciate this product and based on my viewing of your website the entire company thanks marc b it is delicious i’m on my second jar great on ice cream i also bought the caramel  chocolate fruit dips yum…well we went back to the store and i bought multiples of all these tasty treats because i don’t ever want to be without them” jo r “i thought i would try the marshmallow fruit dip with no calories how bad could it be i thought and with no calories or sugar i’m game well by the time i got home from the store my husband was driving i dipped all my grapes some pretzels rice crackers and a few blue berries and would have done more had we not pulled into the driveway “ i just wanted to let you know how much i enjoy your products especially the caramel fruit dip which right now is so good on my honey crisp apples i no longer feel deprived except when i run out…which i just did thank you so much for all the choices you offer to a dieter who has to watch sugar” andrea m fruit jam  jelly we opened our first jar of fruit spread this morning and it is delicious even though my husband does not have diabetes like i do i have been trying to get him to eat the “sugar free” products that i do even he commented on how good your fruit spread is thank you so very much for developing these quality products nell m i think you guys are a blessing for helping me lose fat i am a big fan of your fruit spreads i love them for breakfast on an english muffin and discovered they’re also fabulous over sugar free ice cream i still can’t believe they are calorie free – so delicious frank f i found your calorie free fruit spreads at our local supermarket the fruit spreads are delicious and one would never know they are “diet” foods it certainly made my life much more easier after being put on a  calorie per day diet by my physician i also enjoy so many of your other delicious products and still can’t believe that have no calories or fat i can pretty much eat all i want without going over my  calories…thanks to you folks lois s veggie  chip dips “i stumbled across one of your products in my local grocery it was your blue cheese veggie dip not being a person who falls for gimmicky packaging i decided to give it a try after all it is guaranteed delicious when i got home i broke out the blue cheese dip and some veggies then opened the dip definitely not what i expected it wasnt runny or watery it was actually thick and creamy and it was sooooo good now how can i get my grocer to stock more of your product line i tried it once and now im hooked calorie free  wow im still amazed thanks for nothing” laura v “i am amazed i am always looking for different products that will fit in my diet i have diabetes and high cholesterol i just recently discovered your wonderful calorie free ranch and bacon dips they are delicious my husband who hates anything low fat loved them on his chips i will be purchasing more of your products as they become available in our area or from your website thanks for the great healthy taste treats” karen n single serve packets “as a register dietitian my patients just loved the sample single serve packets of salad dressings chocolate syrup and pancake syrup i was quite impressed with the pancake syrup myself usually i use sugarfree syrup but dislike the fact that there are sugar alcohols in them that can cause gastrointestinal side effects “i also like the fact that your caloriefee items have very recognizable ingredients – it’s not a whole bunch of preservatives or added chemicals  i am sure that many of my patients will purchase walden farms products after trying the samples packets from my office” elizabeth m rd “my husband is diabetic and i need to lose weight so naturally salads are a big part of our diets so far we’ve tried the walden farms russian french cole slaw cesar creamy bacon italian and…best of all…the honey mustard can’t wait to try the others and the little packets are a stroke of genius i took one with me to our favorite steak house last night…just yummy and so convenient” ann h “ive recently started a weight loss program and discovered walden farms i work in a holistic chiropractors office and refer a lot people to walden farms i appreciate the quality of products great job thank you for making the dressing in packets going out to eat is difficult because i dont want to take my bottle of dressing with me” julia m condiments “im a certified ketchup addict and didnt think id even be able to tolerate let alone like your ketchup i was so pleased with how great it tastes my sister is on a sugarrestricted diet and ill definitely be recommending your products to her” ed p “your seafood sauce is better than any on the market i wouldn’t be without walden farms products and i think they are more than worth the cost thank you so much for developing your line and making it available on line to all of us” pat c
