products partner of research and marketsvaccinating  children in  why choose research and markets worlds largest selection trusted by the best customer focused safe  secure i recently ordered a book from research and markets via their website shortly after ordering the book i received a message from the research and markets orders department stating that payment had not been received for the book my first thought was credit card fraud i called orders department and was connected immediately with maria o’toole maria was extremely helpful in resolving the payment question maria suggested that since research and markets is located in dublin ireland and i am located in seattle washington my credit card company might have placed a hold on the payment i checked with my card company and this was indeed the case i corrected the hold on the payment and informed maria maria confirmed that the payment transaction had been completed and assured me that the book would be delivered in a timely manner i truly appreciate the ease with which i was able to contact a live person quickly and resolve the issue easily i highly recommend research and markets for their depth and breadth of research
