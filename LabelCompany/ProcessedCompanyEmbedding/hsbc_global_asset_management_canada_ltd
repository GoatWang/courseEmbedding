conditions investments in foreign markets involve risks such as currency rate fluctuations potential differences in accounting and taxation policies as well as possible political economic and market risks these risks are heightened for investments in emerging markets which are also subject to greater illiquidity and volatility than developed foreign markets frontier markets generally have smaller economies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging markets and therefore investing in frontier markets can magnify the risks of investing in emerging markets fixed income is subject to credit and interest rate risk credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed income security that result from changes in the general level of interest rates in a declining interest rate environment a portfolio may generate less income in a rising interestrate environment bond
