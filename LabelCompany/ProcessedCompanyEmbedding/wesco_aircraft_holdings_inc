mean the year ending or ended september  for example fiscal year  or fiscal  means the period from october   to september   executive overview we are the worlds leading distributor and provider of comprehensive supply chain management services to the global aerospace industry based on annual sales our services range from traditional distribution to the management of supplier relationships quality assurance kitting justintime jit delivery and pointofuse inventory management we supply over  active stockkeeping units skus including cclass hardware chemicals electronic components bearings tools and machined parts we serve our customers under both  longterm contractual arrangements contracts which include jit contracts that govern the provision of comprehensive outsourced supply chain management services and longterm agreements ltas that typically set prices for specific products and  ad hoc sales founded in  by the father of our current chairman of the board of directors wesco has grown to serve over  customers which are primarily in the commercial military and general aviation sectors including the leading original equipment manufacturers oems and their subcontractors through which we support nearly all major western aircraft programs we also service industrial customers which include customers in the automotive energy pharmaceutical and electronics sectors industry trends affecting our business we rely on demand for new commercial and military aircraft for a significant portion of our sales commercial aircraft demand is driven by many factors including the global economy industry passenger volumes and capacity utilization airline profitability introduction of new models and the lifecycle of current fleets demand for business jets is closely correlated to regional economic conditions and corporate profits but also influenced by new models and changes in ownership dynamics military aircraft demand is primarily driven by government spending the timing of orders and evolving us department of defense strategies and policies aftermarket demand is affected by many of the same trends as those in oem channels as well as requirements to maintain aging aircraft and the cost of fuel which can lead to greater utilization of existing planes demand in the military aftermarket is further driven by changes in overall fleet size and the level of us military operational activity domestically and overseas supply chain service providers and distributors have been aided by these trends along with an increase in outsourcing activities as oems and their suppliers focus on reducing their capital commitments and operating costs commercial aerospace market over the past three years major airlines have ordered new aircraft at a robust pace aided by strong profits and increasing passenger volumes at the same time volatile fuel prices have led to greater demand for fuelefficient models and new engine options for existing aircraft designs the rise of emerging markets has added to the growth in overall demand at a table of contents stronger pace than seen historically more recently several airlines have slowed the pace of orders with large commercial oems in response to rapidly changing macroeconomic conditions in spite of this development large commercial oems have indicated that they continue to expect a high level of deliveries primarily due to their unprecedented level of backlogs business aviation has lagged the larger commercial market reflecting a deeper downturn in the last recession and an uncertain economic outlook overall business aviation production levels remain well below their prerecession peak though newer models have seen a greater acceptance in the marketplace than older and previously owned aircraft military aerospace market military buildrates have declined for the past few years and they may continue to decline going forward which has negatively affected this portion of our business we believe the diversity of the military aircraft programs we support can help mitigate the impact of new program delays changes or cancellations in particular we believe the services we provide the joint strike fighter program will benefit our future business as production for that program increases increased sales for other established aircraft programs that directly benefit from such changes also help moderate buildrate declines other factors affecting our financial results fluctuations in revenue there are many factors such as changes in customer aircraft build rates customer plant shut downs variation in customer working days changes in selling prices the amount of new customers consigned inventory and increases or decreases in customer inventory levels that can cause fluctuations in our financial results from quarter to quarter to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete shortterm periods as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons ad hoc business tends to vary based on the amount of disruption in the market due to changes in aircraft build rates new aircraft introduction customer or site consolidations and other factors fluctuations in our ad hoc business tend to be partially offset by our contract business as most of our ad hoc revenue comes from our contract customers we will continue our strategy of seeking to expand our relationships with existing ad hoc customers by transitioning them to contracts as well as expanding relationships with our existing contract customers to include additional customer sites additional skus and additional levels of service new contract customers and expansion of existing contract customers to additional sites and skus sometimes leads to a corresponding decrease in ad hoc sales as a portion of the skus sold under contracts were previously sold to the same customer as ad hoc sales we believe this strategy serves to mitigate some of the fluctuations in our net sales our sales to contract customers may fail to meet our expectations for a variety of reasons in particular if industry build rates are lower than expected or for certain newer jit customers if their consigned inventory which must be exhausted before corresponding products are purchased directly from us is greater than we expected if any of our customers are acquired or controlled by a company that elects not to utilize our services or attempt to implement insourcing initiatives it could have a negative effect on our strategy to mitigate fluctuations in our net sales additionally although we derive a significant portion of our net sales from the building of new commercial and military aircraft we have not typically experienced extreme fluctuations in our net sales when sales for an individual aircraft program decrease which we believe is attributable to our diverse base of customers and programs fluctuations in margins our gross margins are impacted by changes in product mix generally our hardware products have higher gross profit margins than chemicals and electronic components we also believe that our strategy of growing our contract sales and converting ad hoc customers into contract customers could negatively affect our gross profit margins as gross profit margins tend to be higher on ad hoc sales than they are on contractrelated sales however we believe any potential adverse impact on our gross profit margins is outweighed by the benefits of a more stable longterm revenue stream attributable to contract customers our contracts generally provide for fixed prices which can expose us to risks if prices we pay to our suppliers rise due to increased raw material or other costs however we believe our expansive product offerings and inventories our ad hoc sales and where possible our longerterm agreements with suppliers have enabled us to mitigate this risk some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies and fixed prices in these contracts can expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with the us dollar table of contents fluctuations in cash flow our cash flows are affected by fluctuations in our inventory when we are awarded new programs we generally increase our inventory to prepare for expected sales related to the new programs which often take time to materialize and to achieve minimum stock requirements if any as a result if certain programs for which we have procured inventory are delayed or if certain newer jit customers consigned inventory is larger than we expected we may experience a more sustained inventory increase inventory fluctuations may also be attributable to general industry trends factors that may contribute to fluctuations in inventory levels in the future could include  strategic purchases a to take advantage of favorable pricing b made in anticipation of the expected industry growth cycle c to support new customer contracts or d to acquire highvolume products that are typically difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities  changes in supplier lead times and the timing of inventory deliveries  purchases made in anticipation of future growth particularly growth in our mro business and our accounts receivable balance as a percentage of net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter these fluctuations are primarily driven by changes from quarter to quarter in the timing of sales within the quarter and variation in the time required to collect the payments the completion of customer contracts with accelerated payment terms can also contribute to these quartertoquarter fluctuations similarly our accounts payable may fluctuate from quarter to quarter which is primarily driven by the timing of purchases or payments made to our suppliers segment presentation we conduct our business through two reportable segments north america and rest of world we evaluate segment performance based on segment income or loss from operations each segment reports its results of operations and makes requests for capital expenditures and acquisition funding to our chief operating decision maker codm our chief executive officer serves as our codm key components of our results of operations the following is a discussion of the key line items included in our financial statements for the periods presented below under the heading results of operations these are the measures that management utilizes to assess our results of operations anticipate future trends and evaluate risks in our business net sales our net sales include sales of hardware chemicals electronic components bearings tools and machined parts and eliminate all intercompany sales we also provide certain services to our customers including quality assurance kitting jit delivery and pointofuse inventory management however these services are provided by us contemporaneously with the delivery of the product and as such once the product is delivered we do not have a postdelivery obligation to provide services to the customer accordingly the price of such services is generally included in the price of the products delivered to the customer and revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product at which point we have satisfied our obligations to the customer we do not account for these services as a separate element as the services generally do not have standalone value and cannot be separated from the product element of the arrangement we serve our customers under both contracts which include jit contracts and ltas and ad hoc sales under jit contracts customers typically commit to purchase specified products from us at a fixed price on an ifandwhen needed basis and we are responsible for maintaining high levels of stock availability of those products ltas are typically negotiated price lists for customers or individual customer sites that cover a range of predetermined products purchased on an asneeded basis ad hoc customers purchase products from us on an asneeded basis and are generally supplied out of our existing inventory in addition contract customers often purchase products that are not captured under their contract on an ad hoc basis income from operations income from operations is the result of subtracting the cost of sales and selling general and administrative sga expenses from net sales and is used primarily to evaluate our performance and profitability table of contents the principal component of our cost of sales is product cost which was  and  of our total cost of sales for the six months ended march   and  respectively the remaining components are freight and expediting fees import duties tooling repair charges supplies and contract labor costs product cost is determined by the current weighted average cost of each inventory item except for chemical parts for which the firstin firstout method is used and includes charges if any to write down excess and obsolete eo inventory to its net realizable value the charge to write down eo inventory is calculated by comparing our forecasted demand for each part
