statements in connection with and because we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we caution readers regarding certain forwardlooking statements in this prospectus and in any other statement made by us or on our behalf whether in future filings with the sec or elsewhere forwardlooking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations strategies financial results prospects outlooks or other developments some forwardlooking statements may be identified by the use of terms such as expects believes anticipates intends judgment or other similar expressions forwardlooking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control and many of which with respect to future business decisions are subject to change examples of such uncertainties and contingencies include among other important factors those affecting the insurance industry generally such as the economic and interest rate environment federal and state legislative and regulatory developments including but not limited to changes in financial services and tax laws and regulations market pricing and competitive trends relating to insurance products and services acts of terrorism or war and the availability and cost of reinsurance and those relating specifically to our business such as the level of our insurance premiums and fee income the claims experience persistency and other factors affecting the profitability of our insurance products the performance of our investment portfolio and changes in our investment strategy acquisitions of companies or blocks of business and ratings by major rating organizations of our insurance subsidiaries these uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf  risk factors an investment in the offered securities involves a degree of risk prospective investors should carefully evaluate the following considerations in addition to the other information in this prospectus including the information in the documents incorporated by reference before purchasing any of the securities offered hereby risks related to us and our business reserves established for future policy benefits and claims may prove inadequate we establish reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses relating to our insurance products these reserves are calculated using various generally recognized actuarial methodologies and are based upon assumptions that management believes are appropriate and which vary by type of product annually external actuarial experts also review our methodologies assumptions and the resulting reserves the estimation process is complex and involves information obtained from companyspecific and industrywide data as well as general economic information the most significant assumptions made in the estimation process for future policy benefits relate to mortality morbidity claim termination and discount rates the reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses are determined on an individual basis for reported claims and estimates of incurred but not reported losses are developed on the basis of past experience the most significant assumptions made in the estimation process for unpaid claims and claim expenses are the trend in loss costs the expected frequency and severity of claims changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date and expected costs to settle unpaid claims the assumptions vary based on the year the claim is incurred disability reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses are discounted using interest rate assumptions based upon projected portfolio yield rates for the assets supporting the liabilities the assets selected to support these liabilities produce cash flows that are intended to match the timing and amount of anticipated claim and claim expense payments excess workers compensation claim reserves are discounted using interest rate assumptions based on the riskfree rate of return for us government securities with a duration comparable to the expected duration and payment pattern of the claims at the time the claims are settled the rates used to discount reserves are determined annually the methods and assumptions used to establish reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses are continually reviewed and updated based on current circumstances and any resulting adjustments are reflected in earnings currently our projected ultimate insurance liabilities and associated reserves are estimates which are subject to variability this variability arises because the factors and events affecting the ultimate liability have not all taken place and thus cannot be evaluated with certainty moreover under the actuarial methodologies discussed above these estimates are subject to reevaluation based on developing trends with respect to our loss experience such trends may emerge over longer periods of time and changes in such trends cannot necessarily be identified or predicted at any given time by reference to current claims experience whether favorable or unfavorable if our actual loss experience from our current or discontinued products is different from our assumptions or estimates our reserves could be inadequate in such event our results of operations liquidity or financial condition could be materially adversely affected the market values of our investments fluctuate the market values of our investments vary depending on economic and market conditions including interest rates and such values can decline as a result of changes in such conditions increasing interest rates or a widening in the spread between interest rates available on us treasury securities and corporate debt for example will typically have an adverse impact on the market values of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio if interest rates decline we generally achieve a lower overall rate of return on investments of cash generated from our operations in addition in the event that investments are called or mature in a declining interest rate environment we may be unable to reinvest the proceeds in securities with comparable interest rates we may also in the future be  required or determine to sell certain investments at a price and a time when the market value of such investments is less than the book value of such investments declines in the fair value of investments that are considered in the judgment of management to be other than temporary are reported as realized investment losses we evaluate among other things the financial position and prospects of the issuer conditions in the issuers industry and geographic area liquidity of the investment changes in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the investment and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating agency to determine if and when a decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost is other than temporary the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment is lower than its amortized cost and our ability and intent to retain the investment to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments fair value are also considered we have experienced and may in the future experience losses from other than temporary declines in security values such losses are recorded as realized investment losses in the income statement our investment and financing strategy exposes us to default and other risks the management of our investment portfolio is an important component of our profitability since a substantial portion of our operating income is generated from the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and in the case of asset accumulation products the interest credited on policyholder funds and in the case of our other products for which reserves are discounted the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves we are subject to the risk among others that the issuers of the fixed maturity securities we own will default on principal and interest payments a major economic downturn or any of the various other factors that affect issuers ability to pay could result in issuer defaults because our investments consist primarily of fixed maturity securities and shortterm investments such defaults could materially adversely affect our results of operations liquidity or financial condition we continually monitor our investment portfolio and attempt to ensure that the risks associated with concentrations of investments in either a particular sector of the market or a single entity are limited at june   mortgagebacked securities comprised  of our total invested assets mortgagebacked securities subject us to a degree of interest rate risk including prepayment and extension risk which is generally a function of the sensitivity of each securitys underlying collateral to prepayments under varying interest rate environments and the repayment priority of the securities in the particular securitization structure we seek to limit the extent of this risk by emphasizing the more predictable payment classes and securities with stable collateral through our insurance subsidiaries we maintain a program in which investments are financed using advances from various federal home loan banks at june   we had outstanding advances of  million of which  million were obtained during the second quarter of  these advances which were obtained at a fixed rate have a weighted average term to maturity of  years a total of  million of these advances will mature during the remainder of  in addition we have utilized reverse repurchase agreements futures and option contracts and interest rate swap contracts from time to time in connection with our investment strategy these transactions require us to maintain securities or cash on deposit with the applicable counterparty as collateral as the market value of the collateral or contracts changes we may be required to deposit additional collateral or be entitled to have a portion of the collateral returned to us the types and amounts of investments made by our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile each of these states has comprehensive investment regulations in addition delphis revolving credit facility also contains limitations with which we are currently in compliance in all material respects on the composition of our investment portfolio almost half of the voting power of delphi is controlled by robert rosenkranz one of the selling shareholders whose interests may differ from those of other securityholders  each share of our class a common stock entitles the holder to one vote and each share of our class b common stock entitles the holder to a number of votes per share equal to the lesser of  the number of votes such that the aggregate of all outstanding shares of class b common stock will be entitled to cast  of all of the votes represented by the aggregate of all outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock or  ten votes each share of class b common stock is convertible at any time into one share of class a common stock the holders of the class a common stock vote as a separate class to elect one director of the company as of august   mr robert rosenkranz our chairman president and chief executive officer and one of the selling shareholders by means of beneficial ownership of the corporate general partner of rosenkranz  company and direct or beneficial ownership had the power to vote all of the outstanding shares of class b common stock which as of such date represented  of the voting power of the common stock holders of a majority of the combined voting power of our stockholders have the power to elect all of the members of our board of directors other than the director elected by the holders of class a common stock and to determine the outcome of fundamental corporate transactions including mergers and acquisitions consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets we are a party to consulting and other agreements with certain affiliates of rosenkranz  company which are expected to continue in accordance with their terms because delphi is a holding company its ability to pay dividends on the class a common stock and service delphis debt will depend on receipt of funds from subsidiaries and delphis other financial resources because delphi is a holding company its ability to pay dividends on the class a common stock and make payments in respect of delphis indebtedness will depend upon receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries as well as our financial resources at the holding company level we had approximately  million of financial resources available at the holding company level at june   which was primarily comprised of investments in the common stock of delphis investment subsidiaries fixed maturity securities balances with independent investment managers and shortterm investments the assets of the investment subsidiaries are primarily invested in balances with independent investment managers other sources of liquidity at the holding company level include dividends paid from subsidiaries primarily generated from operating cash flows and investments our insurance subsidiaries are permitted without prior regulatory approval to make dividends payments totaling  million during  of which  million has been paid during the first half of  in general dividends from our noninsurance subsidiaries are not subject to regulatory or other restrictions we had  million of borrowings available to us under delphis revolving credit facility as of june   a shelf registration statement is also in effect under which we may issue securities yielding proceeds of up to  million our current liquidity needs in addition to funding our operating expenses include principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings under delphis revolving credit facility interest payments on our  senior notes due  the  senior notes and distributions on our capital securities and our floating rate capital securities the maximum amount of borrowings available under delphis revolving credit facility which expires in december  is  million the  senior notes mature in their entirety in may  and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements but are redeemable by us at par at any time on or after may   the junior subordinated debentures underlying the capital securities are not redeemable prior to march   the junior subordinated debentures underlying the  capital securities are redeemable in whole or in part beginning may   our financial position exposes us to interest rate risks because our primary assets and liabilities are financial in nature our consolidated financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates we manage this risk by active portfolio management focusing on minimizing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by matching our invested assets and related liabilities and by periodically adjusting the crediting rates on our annuity products  profitability of certain group employee benefit products is also affected by the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves we manage this risk by adjusting the prices charged for these products our ability to reduce our exposure to risks depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance we transfer our exposure to some risks through reinsurance arrangements with other insurance and reinsurance companies under our reinsurance arrangements another insurer assumes a specified portion of our losses and loss adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums the availability amount cost and terms of reinsurance may vary significantly based on market conditions any decrease in the amount of our reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any increase in the cost of such reinsurance will absent a decrease in the reinsurance amount reduce our premium income in either case our operating results could be adversely affected unless we are able to accordingly adjust the prices or other terms of our insurance policies or successfully implement other operational initiatives as to which no assurance can be given furthermore we are subject to credit risk with respect to reinsurance we obtain reinsurance primarily through indemnity reinsurance transactions in which we are still liable for the transferred risks if the reinsurers fail to meet their financial obligations such failures could materially affect our results of operations liquidity or financial condition some reinsurers experienced significant losses related to the terrorist events of september   as a result of this and other market factors higher prices and less favorable terms and conditions continue to be offered in the reinsurance market these market conditions are reflected in the terms of the replacement reinsurance arrangements entered into during  for our excess workers compensation and longterm disability products it is likely that in the future our reinsurers will continue to seek price increases although the extent of such increases cannot currently be predicted also there has been significantly reduced availability of reinsurance covering risks such as terrorist and catastrophic events accordingly substantially all of our coverages of this nature were discontinued in  which would result in us retaining a higher portion of losses from such events if they occur we have not been able to replace such coverages on acceptable terms due to present market conditions and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future however under the terrorism act the federal government will pay  of our covered losses relating to acts of international terrorism from property and casualty products directly written by safety national casualty corporation above our annual deductible the occurrence of a significant catastrophic event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition the insurance business is a heavily regulated industry our insurance subsidiaries like other insurance companies are highly regulated by state insurance authorities in the states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they conduct business such regulations among other things limit the amount of dividends and other payments that can be made by such subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval and impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments such subsidiaries may have these regulations also affect many other aspects of our insurance subsidiaries businesses including for example riskbased capital requirements various reserve requirements the terms conditions and manner of sale and marketing of insurance products claimshandling practices and the form and content of required financial statements these regulations are intended to protect policyholders rather than investors the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to continue to conduct their businesses is dependent upon the maintenance of their licenses in these various states from time to time increased scrutiny has been placed upon the insurance regulatory framework and a number of state legislatures have considered or enacted legislative measures that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies in addition to legislative initiatives of this type the national association of insurance commissioners and insurance regulators are continuously involved in a process of reexamining existing laws and regulations and their application to insurance companies furthermore while the federal government currently does not directly regulate the insurance business federal legislation and administrative policies and  court interpretations thereof in a number of areas such as employee benefits regulation age sex and disabilitybased discrimination financial services regulation and federal taxation can significantly affect the insurance business it is not possible to predict the future impact of changing regulation on our operations and those of our insurance subsidiaries our insurance subsidiaries can also be required under solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business to pay assessments to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insurance companies that become insolvent the financial services industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous other insurance and financial services companies many of these organizations have substantially greater assets higher ratings from rating agencies larger and more diversified portfolios of insurance products and larger agency sales operations than us competition in asset accumulation product markets is also encountered from the expanding number of banks securities brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries marketing alternative savings products such as mutual funds traditional bank investments and retirement funding alternatives we may be adversely impacted by a decline in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries ratings with respect to claimspaying ability and financial strength have become an increasingly important factor impacting the competitive position of insurance companies each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings of companies periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained or improved in the future claimspaying and financial strength ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyowners and are not directed toward protection of investors downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect sales of their products and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  where you can find more information we have filed with the sec under the securities act of  as amended the
