certain reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation  all reclassifications have been applied consistently to the periods presented     f cable tv international inc notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies continued   estimates and assumptions management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with general accepted accounting principles  those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported revenues and expenses   actual results could vary from the estimates that were assumed in preparing these financial statements the most significant estimates and assumptions include the   • impairment useful lives and salvage values of our machinery and equipment   • reserve for excess and obsolete inventory   • loss contingencies   • allowance for doubtful accounts   • derivative liabilities it is reasonably possible that these above significant estimates we make may change in the future and could have a material effect on our financial statements financial instruments the company’s financial instruments include cash accounts receivable accounts payable accrued liabilities convertible debt notes payable and related party debt the carrying amounts of these financial instruments are considered by management to approximate their fair value due to their short term maturities fair value of financial instruments the company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the marketbased risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement     f cable tv international inc notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements    summary of significant accounting policies continued   level  – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  – observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level  – inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability the company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit certificates of deposit money market accounts and investment grade commercial paper that are readily convertible into cash and purchased with original maturities of three months or less   accounts receivable accounts receivable represents receivables net of allowances for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance as of march   and december   we had allowance for doubtful accounts of  we determine the allowance based on historical experience and other currently available information when a specific account is deemed uncollectible the account is written off for the three months ended march   and  we had no write offs of accounts receivable the company factors substantially all of its invoices for certain customers approved by the third party factor without recourse to us and paid factoring fees of  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively under our factoring agreement invoices for products are generated and transmitted to our customers with copies to the factor as products are shipped to our customers  the factor collects the amounts due and remits collected funds to us less factoring fees the invoiced amounts are reported as accounts receivable on our balance sheets

customers during the three months ended march   other than the customers mentioned above no customer accounted for  or more of the company’s total net sales for the three months ended march   and  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market inventory cost is determined on a weighted average cost method the company maintains reserves to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market including reserves for excess and obsolete inventory evaluation of longlived assets the company periodically reviews its longterm assets and makes adjustments if the carrying value exceeds fair value based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets assets identified as impaired are carried at estimated fair value due to the changing technology and market conditions it is possible that future impairment reviews may indicate additional impairments of our longlived assets which could result in charges that are material to the company’s results of operations    property plant and equipment   property and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation expenditures that extend the life

considered finished with preproduction efforts when management determines that it has achieved acceptable levels of scrap and yield which vary by project expenditures related to ongoing production are recorded in cost of sales total rd costs were  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively income taxes the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes  under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be reversed an allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized basic and diluted net loss per common share   basic loss per common share equals net loss divided by weighted average common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per share includes the impact on dilution from all contingently issuable shares including options warrants and convertible securities the common stock equivalents from contingent shares are

management’s plans which may alleviate doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern asu  is effective for years beginning after december   we do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  going concern the companys financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business however the company has suffered recurring losses from operations and had a working capital deficit and accumulated deficit at march   these factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern   under the going concern assumption an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations accordingly assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise capital to meet its obligations and attain profitable operations  the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern the company’s management is

the exchange transaction the selling shareholders acquired approximately  of our issued and outstanding common stock cable tv became our whollyowned subsidiary and the company acquired the business and operations of cable tv this is treated as a reverse merger because there was a complete change in board of directors to cable tv directors there was a complete change in management to cable tv

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations including the discussion on liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements which have been

statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty   results of operations   the following discussion of the financial condition results of operations cash

ended march   we incurred a net loss of  compared to a loss of  for the same period ended march     net sales for the three months ended march   totaled  a decrease of  from  for the three months

unable reach the equipment   cost of goods sold for the three months ended march   was  cost of goods sold decreased  from  for the three months ended march   the cost of goods sold decreased due to lower sales and inventory adjustments   general and administration expenses for the three months ended march   increased to  compared to  for the three months ended march   the increase was due primarily to an increase of  in stock based compensation and  in employee salaries   research and development expenses for the three months ended march   increased to  compared to  for the three

substantial amount of cash will be used as working capital and to execute our strategy and business plan  as such we further anticipate that we will have to raise additional capital of approximately  to fund our operational and research and development needs over the next twelve months        liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash of  and a working capital deficit of   during the threemonth period ended march   we funded our operations from advances and loans from third parties   for the threemonth period ended march   we used net cash of  in operations compared to  for the threemonth period ended march   the increase was primarily due to the increased operating loss for the threemonth period ended march   we used net cash of  for investing activities compared to  for the threemonth period ended march   the decrease was primarily due to reduced spending on equipment for the threemonth period ended march   we had net cash provided by financing activities of  compared to  for the threemonth period ended march   the increase was primarily due to proceeds from notes payable and proceeds from convertible debt our current cash requirements are significant based upon our plan to develop and market new product lines to grow our business  we estimate a need for  in additional capital over the next  months which we expect will be provided by the financing  while we do not have any shortterm plans to conduct any debt or equity financings beyond the financing commitment we presently have we may in the future use debt and equity financing to fund operations as we look to expand and fund development of our products and services and changes in our operating plans increased expenses acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek such financing sooner than anticipated  there are no assurances that we will be able to raise such required working capital on terms favorable or that such working capital will be available on any terms when needed  the terms of such working capital may result in substantial dilution to existing shareholders  any failure to secure additional financing may force the company to modify its business plan  in addition we cannot be assured of profitability in the future offbalance sheet arrangements   at march   there are no offbalance sheet arrangements   item            quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk   at this time this is not applicable   item            controls and procedures   our management with the participation and under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule ae or de of the exchange act rule a as of the end of the period covered by this report  based upon that evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of the end of such period our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of march   in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms  this conclusion is based on findings that constituted material weaknesses  a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis      management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   in performing the abovereferenced assessment our management identified the following material weaknesses    i we have insufficient quantity of dedicated resources and experienced personnel involved in reviewing and designing internal controls as a result a material misstatement of the interim and annual financial statements could occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis     ii we do not have an audit committee or an independent audit committee financial expert while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee or independent audit committee financial expert it is the management’s view that to have an audit committee comprised of independent board members and an independent audit committee financial expert is an important entitylevel control over our financial statements    iii we did not perform an entity level risk assessment to evaluate the implication of relevant risks on financial reporting including the impact of potential fraudrelated risks and the risks related to nonroutine transactions if any on our internal control over financial reporting lack of an entitylevel risk assessment constituted an internal control design deficiency which resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material error would not have been prevented or detected and constituted a material weakness    iv   we lack personnel with formal training to properly analyze and record complex transactions in accordance with us gaap  v we have not achieved the optimal level of segregation of duties relative to key financial reporting functions we are currently reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes as our financial situation allows including identifying specific areas within our governance accounting and financial reporting processes to add adequate resources and personnel to potentially mitigate these material weaknesses our present management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements as necessary and as funds allow because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate  all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations  therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation   changes in internal controls over financial reporting   there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended march   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting      part ii – other
