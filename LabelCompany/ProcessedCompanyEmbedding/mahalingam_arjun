capture storage is acceptable as a technology given the ethical considerations of risk impositionrisks uncertainties and knowledge gapsleakage during transportationleakage from underground storageco leakage into marine systemsgeological effectsconsequentialisman action is morally evaluated solely by its consequencescost benefit analysisa establishment of causal correlation between action and possible harmb assessing the probability for harmduong and loisel an actuarial approachanalogues such as natural gas pipelines and existing coal fired power plantswere used for risk estimation from ccsprimary finding was that a few hundred fatalities per year should be expected contrary to most published literature they suggest that risk of leakage is the least important with respect to ‚Äòobjectively expected fatalities‚Äôcentralized decisions that impose risks demand a justification consent of affected people neededbest method to judge moral acceptabilityconsent to risk ‚Üí example of unpleasant wayconsent to gamble not consent to loss similarly consent to ccs ‚Äònot consent to damage from ccs‚Äôkoornneef et al focuses on several important knowledge gaps in literaturesecond step of ccs chain absence of dispersion models for leakage final step of chain  the storage  no certainty in terms of quantifiable estimates of probabilities of leakage involvedrights bar others from doing anything to us without our consent  ccs cannot be imposed by governments without consent from peopleif equal distribution of risk then cba coincides with hypothetical consent with ccs risk not equally distributed while benefits are cba is illequipped to deal with uncertaintyrisk imposition is morally possible if and only if everybody subjected to risk accepts the risk‚Äòharm to you cannot be straightforwardly compensated by benefits to me‚Äô  lenmanin the case of ccs matters are more troublesome when some will benefit more than othersformulating a system of risk taking where everyone is benefited is not practically possible given the case of ccs  hanssenconclusionthough contractualist approach is able to rule out situations where everyone benefits it does not provide a solution to the risk imposition in the context of ccs implementationgiven existing knowledge and estimations using analogues cost benefit analysis indicates that risks are comparable to those of existing technologies however when epistemic uncertainties come into the picture cba has little to sayconventionalismprima facie rightsa prima facie right is a right that cannot be outweighed by other considerationsevery individual has a prima facie right not to be subjected to risky activitywhen benefits from the risk are high risk imposition is acceptedit is still unclear whether the degree of benefits would outweigh the amount of risk taken when ccs is implementedprima facie rights not to be subjected to risk is a moral outcome of finding consent importantconsequentialist no compensation needed when one has approved the risk in the first place prima facie right compensation not appropriate for overridingapplying prima facie rights to environmental issues like ccs is not helpful because everyone does not benefit equally for a given riskdutybased ethics  based on normsall actions entail a certain amount of riskavoiding all risks  leading to paralysisnot known for sure if the risks involved in implementation of ccs  than choosing not to do soparalysis maybe avoided when there is a facility to recompense those whose rights have been violatedissues with compensation  who will compensate and how much and to whom  distributive justicehow would the amount of risk being subjected or harm being inflicted by enumerated in certain cases where the consequences of the risk are not great compensation may also be seen as an incentive to be subjected to greater amounts of risk for monetary benefitsconventionalism argues that while discussing risk there is an intuitive element that contributes to making a certain risk imposition more or less morally problematicrisks with large catastrophic effects and risks with irreversible effects are more problematic and more compelling to people  risk perception literature risks and uncertainties large scale leakage associated with ccs have both these characteristicsfreefloating fear  immediate reflex to possible threat those are exposed to risk but not harmed will not be compensated despite having to live with the fear of harm that might possibly be inflicted on themconclusion  either measures against the pervasive nature of free floating fear are to be adopted or ccs must not be adopted at allafa considers geoengineering an evil so the burden of proof that ccs is harmless lies on those advocating ccsafa doesn‚Äôt say how it is an evil when it is unclear if it is an evil in itself how can pp be appliedits application has other shortcomings  can we apply pp if only a small community anticipates a risk in implementing ccsthere is no established basis where pp can be applied like when and how‚Äúprecaution‚Äù is vague there is ambiguity in language  chances of misinterpretation are largewidespread statement version gives a totally different interpretation for the pp resulting in totally disparate outcomesconclusion  ccs proposed as a mitigation measure but applying pp to a solution to a problem something doesn‚Äôt add upadds to the skepticismeffective involvement of the public in the decisionmaking process involving risk managementmainly to estimate the accepted levels of risks methods compare with existing levels of accepted riskcompare with standard levels used as a measurewhether the existing levels of risk are best possible levelsshould we bother about this now based on goal  common good or social acceptanceconclusions involve the people who are subjected to risk in the joint decision making bodyproper mix of technocratic and democratic viewpoints is imperativeconventionalist  compelling argument against the implementation of ccs unless consent is obtained from people exposed to risk under objective information disseminationrebuttal of reviewsnot all aspects from the first part of the paper end up being actually represented in the decision treeto formulate a logical and coherent decision tree we only consider ethical approaches that are most relevant at each of the nodesthe authors seem to treat risk uncertainties and knowledge gap as almost interchangeable notion it might be helpful to distinguish theseknowledge gaps refer to epistemic uncertainty and these have been clearly demarcated from risks of ccs although the terms themselves have not been clarified individuallyhow do you deal with public opinion being dependent on a large number of exogenous factors and how is this addressed in your paperthis is a ubiquitous factor throughout the decision tree we give it a special mention and do not deal with it extensivelywhat is your counterfactual if not ccs then what at least some consideration should be given to the alternativesthe objective of this paper was to assess the justifiability of implementation of ccs attention to alternatives would in itself demand a separate discussionccsobjective to analyze the justifiability of risk imposed by carbon capture and storage from an ethical standpointfull transcriptmore presentations by arjun mahalingam headline
