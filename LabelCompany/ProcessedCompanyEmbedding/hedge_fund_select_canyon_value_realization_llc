fund firm in the us by britt erica tunick page  of  by britt erica tunick     mitch julis between josh and myself we spanned the spectrum from leveraged buyouts to leveraged dieouts  photographs by bryce duffy when radio one a leading us broadcaster with an africanamerican urban audience wanted to buy out other equity holders to gain a controlling stake in one of its tv properties it turned to an unlikely place for the money hedge fund canyon capital advisors of los angeles unlike traditional institutional investors canyon didn’t need to worry about getting a rating agency’s seal of approval and in february quickly put together a private debt offering of  million collateralized by the assets of the cable tv station being purchased with a junkbondlike  coupon and a fiveyear maturity the deal snared canyon the kind of returns that hedge funds salivate over canyon a  billion firm with  billion in hedge fund assets has become the th largest hedge fund firm in the us in part because it doesn’t shy away from originating such deals we often will approach a company that we understand and we’ll design a piece of paper that really solves their problems and really works for us says mitch julis the yearold former new yorker who cofounded canyon with yearold massachusetts native josh friedman buddies since rooming together at harvard university the two men formed canyon in 0 right after the firm where they worked drexel burnham lambert blew up in a cloud of scandal the drexel philosophy—not to mention the west coast location where the duo once fashioned deals with infamous sera junk bond king mike milken—still heavily influences the unusual investment approach taken by canyon the firm has also benefited from its drexel connections and the network that grew out of it says one rival hedge fund manager they have proprietary deal flow that other people just would never see in the radio one deal for example canyon’s ties to moelis  co the investment bank that served as the offering’s underwriter reach back to drexel the firm’s founder ken moelis was a colleague of friedman and julis there     josh friedman our broad mandate gives us a bit more flexibility we knew the management team the assets and the financial advisor so rather than wait for the market to scramble around and then go out and do it we provided a solution ourselves says friedman such deals are an important part of canyon’s investment strategy and one that investors find attractive because they’re a big enough player they have the ability to source their own deals and they’re not just playing in the secondary market and tagging along on other people’s deals says bruce guiot chief investment officer of miami university and a canyon investor they are proactive in going out to companies and saying you’ve got this capital or debt structure but we think we can put this arrangement in place to improve your balance sheet and provide an opportunity for us and other investors’ and i think that gives them an opportunity set that’s bigger than many others friedman and julis credit their time at drexel with teaching them the approach that has become the backbone of canyon capital structure matters that’s their mantra and one they say their mentor milken taught them well we saw financial innovation and design that was premised very much on that idea and could see very quickly where opportunities arose to satisfy the needs of both an issuer and an investor explains julis you also saw the life cycle of companies and how to recycle ideas between josh and myself we spanned the spectrum from leveraged buyouts to leveraged dieouts and beyond credit we understood the dynamics of balance sheets how they change and how to capitalize on them from an investor’s standpoint the philosophy has paid off for canyon a debtfocused multistrategy fund with a bent towards distressed or highyielding securities in such disparate areas as residential mortgagebacked securities—which comprise some  billion to  billion of the firm’s total assets—airline leases gaming companies financial institutions and media entities among others   fact file canyon capital advisors assets under management  billion flagship canyon value realization fund performance  annualized founded 0 offices los angeles manhattan london founders mitch julis  josh friedman the firm’s  billion flagship canyon value realization fund has returned  since inception with only two down years 8 when it lost  and 8 when it fell  since 8 the distressed environment has been good to canyon which has been on a roll in  it gained  net of fees that performance was followed by gains of  in  and  through the end of april comparatively the ar multistrategy index was up 8 in   in  and  through april this year canyon’s returns in bank debt and highyield which account for the biggest chunk of the portfolio are also outdoing their respective indices the firm appears equally cautious and optimistic we find ourselves in an environment characterized by a tugofwar between stability which encourages risktaking and fragility which encourages caution canyon wrote to investors on may  as a result canyon said that the portfolio remains unlevered and credit shorts via cds are near alltime highs canyon has five hedge funds the onshore version of the flagship fund was launched in  followed by the addition of its offshore counterpart in  prior to  canyon’s hedge fund activities consisted solely of separately managed accounts the flagship has a broad mandate that allows it to invest opportunistically across a wide variety of asset classes as does the  billion canyon balanced fund which was launched in  and has the distinction that it can invest in a more concentrated way in strategies with more equitylike returns the firm’s remaining funds are the canyon distressed opportunity fund a pure distressed credit fund canyon capital arbitrage fund a convertible and equity arbitrage strategy and canyon special opportunities fund a limitedlife fund that has run its course and will return capital to investors by june 0 in addition the firm runs a number of separately managed accounts     clockwise from top left john plaga canyon’s chief financial officer dominique mielle a senior portfolio manager senior portfolio manager allen ba and patrick dooley canyon’s director of research the firm also has a controversial real estate–lending portfolio while not part of its hedge funds and less than  of the firm’s overall assets that group’s capital structure approach—and its focus on originating its own deals—has also had a downside a couple of its loans led to lawsuits with accusations of unfair lending practices distressed mortgages make up a big portion of canyon’s business these days but there’s nothing distressed about canyon’s flashy address 0 avenue of the stars los angeles built on property that was formerly the home of th century fox studios the squarefoot structure which was completed in 8 looks like a futuristic ice cube with a hole in the middle behind it are two triangular highrises known as the century park towers in canyon’s luxurious new digs where it has resided for three years the fund is surrounded by stars the creative artists agency which represents such hollywood alist names as oprah winfrey george clooney and steven spielberg is on the floor below unlike new york where hedge fund managers are treated like kings los angeles is a place where the canyon founders can toil in virtual obscurity that’s how they like it the fund’s west coast presence has helped keep canyon among the most secretive of hedge funds the pair also argue it allows them to think differently from the new york pack being in california gives us a little bit of freshness in the way we approach things while we miss some things because we aren’t headquartered in the middle of manhattan or greenwich i think we pick up a lot more than welose says friedman distance from the world’s largest hedge fund hub has also enabled canyon to attract and hang on to professionals who want to make it home in time for dinner with their families unlike hedge funds based in the new york metropolitan area canyon faces few competitors that can lure its talent away to hear canyon’s founders tell it their hedge fund partnership might never have happened if bronx ny–born julis hadn’t put such importance on his childhood friendships declining the opportunity to attend harvard university and instead choosing princeton university because that’s where his best friend since grade school had been accepted another close friendship led julis to alter his longtime law school career path for a joint degree in business and law at harvard law school and harvard business school once there he met friedman who had just received his undergraduate degree in physics at harvard julis had initially envisioned himself an international lawyer perhaps specializing in soviet studies and friedman imagined working in the tech corridor that surrounds route 8 outside boston those plans were upended when julis took a summer internship with a bankruptcy firm in los angeles where he assisted the firm’s attorneys on cases involving entertainers like tom petty unhappy working as a lawyer julis began writing magazine articles in his spare time about the creative ways bankruptcy was being used in the entertainment industry to revitalize debtburdened companies i was basically sending messages in a bottle saying somebody save me from this career’ says julis an assignment to write an article for los angeles magazine on getting rich in a recession—it was 8—led him to interview henry wilf a drexel employee whose name he had come across in an article on distressed investing wilf who served as the retail liaison between milken’s department and the drexel system quickly assessed that julis was not a journalist and suggested that drexel should be
