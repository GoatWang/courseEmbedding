incorporated on march   in the state of nevada the company is a development stage company with nominal operations the principal activities of the company are the provision of managerial assistance services including funding administrative and it support services for small and medium enterprises “smes” and money lending service in hong kong through its whollyowned subsidiaries gushen holding limited “gushen holding” a company incorporated in the republic of seychelles and gushen credit limited “gushen credit a company incorporated in hong kong the company attempts to assist the smes which are recently established and at an early stage of operations but will not participate in board of the smes or making business decision the primary purpose behind focusing on providing services to companies at this early stage of development will be for the company to establish and nurture longterm relationships with clients during their growth and development   on august   gushen holding

though the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period financial statements of all prior periods are retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information no goodwill was recognized for these acquisition transactions under common control   gushen inc and its subsidiaries are herein after referred to as the “company”   note   going concern uncertainties   the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future   as of january   the company suffered an accumulated deficit of  and incurred a continuous net operating loss of  for the nine months ended january   although the company has generated revenues from its money lending services the company’s cash position may not be significant enough to support the company’s daily operations the continuation of the company as a going concern through april   is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from its stockholders management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the company’s obligations as they become due   these and other factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern these condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the company not being able to continue as a going concern     f             gushen inc notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended january   currency expressed in united states dollars “us” unaudited   note   summary of significant accounting policies   the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and

“us gaap”   basis of consolidation   the condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation   use of estimates   management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the reported revenue and expenses during the periods reported actual results may differ from these estimates   plant and equipment plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses if any depreciation is calculated on the straightline basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational   categories   expected useful life furniture fixtures and office equipment    years leasehold improvement    years   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand demand deposits placed with banks or other

represent loan amount due from customers loans receivables are recorded at unpaid principal balances and net of an allowance that reflects the company’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected as of january   the loans receivables portfolio consists of personal loans   allowance for loan losses   management’s policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb estimated probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio the loan loss allowance is a valuation allowance established to provide for estimated incurred credit losses in the portfolio of loans at the balance sheet the company may incur losses in connection with loans if borrowers fail to pay their monthly loan payments the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries and is decreased by chargedoff loans when the loans become uncollectible a chargeoff will be recorded by reducing both loan balance credit and allowance for loan losses debit   the company provides for incurred losses on loans with an allowance for loan losses in accordance with accounting standards codification  “receivables” “asc” a loan is impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement   an insignificant delay or insignificant shortfall in amount of payments does not require application of this statement a loan is not impaired during a period of delay in payment if the creditor expects to collect all amounts due including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay   the allowance for loan losses which management evaluates on a periodic basis represents an estimate of potential credit losses inherent in the portfolio and is based on a variety of factors including the composition and quality of the loan portfolio delinquency levels and trends indication of credit deterioration deterioration of the fair value of the loan collateral and the inability of the borrower to provide additional collateral to make up for the shortfall   determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subjective complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain   for the nine months ended january   there was no

recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as earned loans are placed on nonaccrual status when any portion of scheduled loan principal or interest payments is impaired or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectability of outstanding principal or interest when loans are placed on nonaccrual status all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income income on nonaccrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash is received loans are written off when deemed uncollectible loans return to accrual status
