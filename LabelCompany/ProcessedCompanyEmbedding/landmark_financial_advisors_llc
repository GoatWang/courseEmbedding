every advisor should be able to answer whatever your priorities this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life at one time or another we all face major turning points in our lives—getting married becoming a parent receiving a lifechanging promotion getting ready to retire at times like these many people feel a need for financial help and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense thats when the search begins the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future someone wholl be there for you for years to come and who can provide more than just stock recommendations to find an advisor who can help you with those decisions dont be afraid to ask the following tough questions—theyll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you  what types of clients do you work with some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession others might have particular knowledge in a specialty such as sustainable investing or retirement planning ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future  what is your track record no advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance and beware those who do but an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty  how often will we talk an advisor should be committed to conversations in person by phone or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require every client has different needs and expectations be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances  how realistic are my goals even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances timelines and investing preferences more insights wondering what its like to work with an advisor tune in to a candid conversation on “the value of advice” watch the webcast  how will we keep my strategy on course even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change an advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift  what happens if the markets are volatile will you call me when markets get scary theres nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone one of an advisors most vital functions is to reach out at such times hear your concerns offer perspective and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy  what if im upset about a service issue or an investment as life becomes increasingly automated theres nothing like a human voice and quick response when youre concerned about a financial matter advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues  who will i actually be working with many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide ask who youd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience beyond the immediate team does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources  how do i pay you for your work its never easy to ask but the right advisors will welcome this question clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences what can an advisor do for you watch making

federal govt status in government by landmark financial advisors llcjuly   comments the congressional budget office cbo reported a june budget surplus for the federal government which is typically a positive month  here are a few points from the release federal receipts rose  yy led by a pickup in individual income tax receipts federal outlays rose a smaller  yy  spending on national defense and income security continue to contract additionally net interest payments declined  yy partly because low inflation reduced the principal of tips fiscal yeartodate the deficit totaled  billion down  from the same period a year ago the cbo projects a deficit of  billion this fiscal year a couple of key takeaways tax increases have been a big hit for the federal government  we would question why additional increases are needed when the growth rate is this high interest rates won’t stay low forever  our debt has mushroomed in the last  years but yet our interest debt service has declined  this has been a huge positive for the federal government and will not be repeated going forward in summary the risks in our fiscal house have declined significantly thanks in large part to a substantial tax increase  the cbo still forecasts deficits into the foreseeable future which is not good or sustainable  in effect our politicians have borrowed some time to make some tough decisions  if they elect to go the easy route of increased taxes again to solve the problem this could spell trouble  a mix of controllingconstrainingcutting entitlements will be needed in our opinion one lesson from the greek drama of the last few weeks… debt works until it doesn’t subscribe to landmark financial advisorskeep up to date on our latest thoughts—subscribe below share thisclick to email this to a

usdisclosurehome objective asneeded feeonly financial planning and advice what is financial planning   financial planning is the process of organizing your finances and resources to ensure that you live within your means protect and provide for yourself and your family and enjoy a dignified retirement  free from insecurity or dependence on others most importantly its a process of taking control of your circumstances and achieving genuine financial peace of mind why plan   because planning helps to ensure that you will achieve your most cherished lifetime financial objectives and because failing to plan is an expensive alternative consider the following   independent research by the consumer federation of america found that americans with financial plans accumulate twice the savings of those without and that americans of all income levels are more comfortable confident and are making more progress toward their goals    if they have a financial roadmap      why choose landmark   because we help our clients make better financial decisions which improve the quality of their lives   here are three important reasons why we feel landmark financial is your best choice for professional financial planning and advice and why we ask you to consider us   we do more for youwe treat your finances like our ownwe save you money   f we do more for you plenty of people call themselves financial advisors few of them are genuine financial planners there are important differences between financial advisors and financial planners and what each is able to do for you financial advisors often limit their advice to some specific aspect of your financial situation like managing your investments for instance financial planners by comparison are broadlyskilled to deal with the entirety of your financial life we are financial planners    f we treat your finances like our own in a manner of speaking we eat our own cooking we recommend to you the same approaches and services that weve found to be effective for our own planning and investing needs and we help you to implement them in the same lowcost way by working with us you eliminate the need for expensive brokers agents and other advisors   f we save you money to be blunt we believe there is a significant conflict of interest if an advisor stands to gain financially from any advice or recommendations you may follow unlike the majority of financial advisors and financial planning firms we receive no commissions from the sale of products landmark financial is a strictly feeonly financial planning and investment advisory firm which means that we are compensated solely and directly by the client because we do not sell investments or insurance of any kind we are able to maintain absolute objectivity and are completely free to help you implement your investment and insurance solutions in the most economical way possible including the use of lowcost noload mutual funds and life insurance where available     you dont have to do it yourself   whether you have a simple concern that requires an immediate objective solution or you are looking to transform your life through comprehensive financial planning we can help you we know youll find our approach to conflictfree financial planning and advice a refreshing alternative to pricey commissionbased advisors and brokers please call us

able to answer whatever your priorities this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life at one time or another we all face major turning points in our lives—getting married becoming a parent receiving a lifechanging promotion getting ready to retire at times like these many people feel a need for financial help and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense thats when the search begins the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future someone wholl be there for you for years to come and who can provide more than just stock recommendations to find an advisor who can help you with those decisions dont be afraid to ask the following tough questions—theyll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you  what types of clients do you work with some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession others might have particular knowledge in a specialty such as sustainable investing or retirement planning ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future  what is your track record no advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance and beware those who do but an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty  how often will we talk an advisor should be committed to conversations in person by phone or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require every client has different needs and expectations be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances  how realistic are my goals even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances timelines and investing preferences more insights wondering what its like to work with an advisor tune in to a candid conversation on “the value of advice” watch the webcast  how will we keep my strategy on course even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change an advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift  what happens if the markets are volatile will you call me when markets get scary theres nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone one of an advisors most vital functions is to reach out at such times hear your concerns offer perspective and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy  what if im upset about a service issue or an investment as life becomes increasingly automated theres nothing like a human voice and quick response when youre concerned about a financial matter advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues  who will i actually be working with many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide ask who youd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience beyond the immediate team does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources  how do i pay you for your work its never easy to ask but the right advisors will welcome this question clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences what can an advisor do for you watch making the leap to see how one couple
