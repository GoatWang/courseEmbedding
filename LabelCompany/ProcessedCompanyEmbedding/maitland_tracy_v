stewardship of the pension funds and more broadly the comptroller’s office again and again mr thompson reaped political gains from those he awarded city business continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story as he oversaw the city’s  billion pension system mr thompson steered the funds into a diverse range of new investment categories expanding from heavy concentrations in stocks and bonds into private equity real estate and niche funds yet performance was lackluster nationwide more than half of large public pension funds outperformed the five city funds’ combined  percent return from  through  according to a widely used yardstick compiled by wilshire associates an investment advisory firm meanwhile the city’s roster of fund managers and their fees tripled — and mr thompson collected more than  in campaign donations from themmr thompson’s credentials as comptroller and a seasoned manager are central to his mayoral campaign in which he has portrayed himself as the grownup in the democratic field — less liberal strident and showy but best prepared for the sober task of managing an unruly citybut interviews and a review of thousands of pages of records — schedules emails pension statements and campaign finance reports — suggest frequent overlap of mr thompson’s political ambitions and the comptroller’s operation and that like many pension overseers at the time he raised campaign money aggressively from those seeking business from his officetiming of meetingsroutinely mr thompson’s political fundraisers arranged for him to meet investment managers pursuing city business sometimes within days of when the donors made their contributions to his campaign in some cases he met those investment managers in his government offices

out the vote by stephen farrell on publish date august    watch in times video » embed moreover previously undisclosed draft audits prepared in  near the end of his first term show that mr thompson’s handling of the city’s pension funds had been so worrisome that state regulators suggested his office be stripped of responsibility for investing them a finding that casts his managerial record in an unflattering new lightin an interview mr thompson emphasized that he was not the only one with influence over investment decisions and that political support played no role in the process while the comptroller’s office makes recommendations for which investment managers to hire the selections are reviewed by outside consultants and boards of trustees for the pension funds though former and current officials say the comptroller’s recommendations are almost always followed“no one received any favor based on a contribution” mr thompson said in an interview “everything was done on the merits” the  draft audits he said were a politically motivated attack aimed at his predecessor whose term covered more than half of the period the auditors examined “that had little to do with me” he said advertisement continue reading the main story after mr thompson was elected in  he vowed to overhaul the bureau of asset management the key arm of the comptroller’s office that invests the holdings of the five city pension funds which now total more than  billion the bureau then was in dire need of modernizing but records show his efforts were slow and delivered mixed resultshe created a new position for a chief investment officer but he had difficulty recruiting and keeping anyone in the job one appointee left after several weeks another lasted  monthshe also spent more than  on consultants to diagnose the bureau’s problems and recommend solutions their report delivered in august  suggested the place was being run almost by instinct and guesswork the investment unit still lacked an overall strategy standard operating procedures and a riskmanagement strategy the lack of clear governance policies the report said compounded the structural challenges of having five separate boards of trustees each with representatives from different agencies and unionsmr thompson said that diffuse structure made overhauling the office difficult “what did i do wrong here” he asked “i was responsible i moved forward took stock of where we were at and performed in the best interest of our fund”a harsh assessmentthe city pension funds are periodically audited by the state and in  under gov george e pataki a republican examiners from the state insurance department undertook routine reviews of the city funds covering  to  but their findings were unusually critical and their conclusion anything but routinein draft audits prepared in mid halfway through mr thompson’s tenure the examiners reported among other things that investment decisions were made without the comptroller’s opinion on whether they would meet the funds’ goals that little attention was paid to expenses and that investment policies seemed to be discussed only when hiring companies to manage the money raising concerns that the “the policies might have been adjusted to justify the choice of a particular provider”“as a result” auditors concluded each of the five funds “should consider other alternatives to the new york city comptroller for management of its investment assets prior to delegating its investment powers in the future” photo mr thompson jr in  with eduardo castell then a deputy comptroller credit james estrinthe new york times the drafts were not made public final audits were not issued until  — after gov david a paterson a democrat had taken over — and proved significantly milder some problems had been addressed no mention was made of replacing the comptroller as investment manager advertisement continue reading the main story mr thompson asserted that the auditors’ harsh early assessment was inaccurate and called it an attempt by the pataki administration to embarrass alan g hevesi then the state comptroller and a democrat who had preceded mr thompson

us anytime in looking back at his tenure mr thompson said he was proud of diversifying the pensions’ portfolios into a large number of private equity funds and other investment vehicles he said this had reduced exposure to market risk and helped weather the turmoil on wall street in but the push into new investments also allowed mr thompson to forge new relationships with fund managers and the often politically connected placement agents they hired to help gain access to pension officialsnowhere was mr thompson’s embrace of those investment firms more evident than on the guest list to his second swearingin in january  the  names included a small number of relatives union leaders and elected officials more than  lobbyists and another  fund managers placement agents and others who stood to gain from the city’s pension fundsmr maitland was onethe comptroller’s office had not previously invested in convertible bonds which generally have lower yields but higher fees than ordinary corporate bonds mr thompson’s move into convertibles in  when mr maitland has said few pensions had an appetite for them gave advent a huge new client mr thompson invested  million and his successor comptroller john c liu invested an additional  million today the funds’  million — the investments have done well growing on average by just over  percent — represents more than  percent of advent’s assets under managementmr thompson made no apologies for investing with mr maitland calling him “probably one of the two best in the world” in convertibles and adding “he’s done well for the city”he said mr maitland was “an acquaintance” and had not raised money for him this year he said mr maitland was not involved in his wife’s talks with the aspca‘open door’ policymr maitland in an interview said he could not recall details of the fundraiser he held for mr thompson in  and cautioned against drawing any link between that and mr thompson’s first investments with advent seven years later “if we were counting on that we’d be out of business” he said photo mr thompson announcing his reelection bid for comptroller in  credit don hogan charlesthe new york times but mr maitland said a mutually beneficial relationship was not necessarily bad “we’ve done well by the city and the city’s done well by us” he said “that’s how it’s supposed to work” advertisement continue reading the main story friends say mr maitland made calls seeking support for mr thompson’s current mayoral bid but mr maitland played down any role “if someone asks me do i think he’s a good guy do i think he’s competent i say yes” he said but he added “i’m not supporting any one person”other donors who were invited to the swearingin ceremony gained from pension business■ richard c dresdale president of fenway partners

donors who won pension business mr thompson said he had an “open door” policy but emphasized that “any investment that was done went through multiple hurdles” the practice of investment firms and their placement agents flooding public pension overseers with political contributions attracted the attention of federal and state prosecutors and the securities and exchange commission after a series
