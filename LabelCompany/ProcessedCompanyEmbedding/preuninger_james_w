with that i will turn the call over to our ceo jim preuninger james w preuninger thanks lisa and thank you all for joining us today first quarter nongaap total revenue was  million and nongaap operating loss was  million both of which are ahead of our guidance we completed our acquisition of ecvision and were already benefiting from our combined offerings we witnessed strength in our asia markets and we delivered our strongest bookings performance ever in the us midmarket hover on the enterprise side of our businesses we did not meet our first quarter’s new booking objectives and we experienced a slowdown in a few professional service projects let me discuss this in more detail we continue to drive more deals into the sales pipeline and are closing new deals across all businesses segments however a few larger transactions targeted for close in late march were pushed out i believe much of this is due to the size and the scope of these projects being considered and i remain optimistic that these deals will close later this year our first quarter if typically our lowest quarter from a bookings perspective and the one where we would typically have the most variability we believe we have enough good pipelines to be in the range of our original subscription bookings target for the remainder of the year however a booking weakness in q creates a subscription and professional services revenue impact that’s difficult to make up in the next few quarters based on our revenue recognition rules in addition our service revenue for the year is expected to be impacted by the lengthening of certain implementations with a few clients as a result of these factors our current expectation is that we will not grow revenue in  as fast as weve previously expected and were tempering our fullyear guidance in accordance while we are disappointed in this i would like to spend a little bit of time discussing several topics that give us great confidence in our businesses moving forward on march  we announced our acquisition of ecvision a cloud based sourcing and collaborative supply chain solution software company these products help many of the largest brand companies in the world to effectively manage their relationships across multiple geographies with product suppliers raw material vendors product testing and social compliance audit firms and global logistics companies shortly after the announcement we held several comprehensive webinars and seminars for amber road and ecvision customers to elaborate on the combined offering these events were a great success and weve already identified and initiated a number of new sales cycles within our installed base of customers as well as potential customers within our sales pipeline our expectation for this businesses in  have not changed they have only gotten better in recent research note gartner wrote that they have and “in predicting the continued convergence of gtm or global trade management and its traditional domains of logistics and compliance with other supply chain areas global trade is a natural extension of sourcing and together they form the order to delivery process enterprise fires are more frequently exploring acquiring all of these capabilities on one platform” the report continues state that our acquisition is a positive development for customers of both companies we believe that ecvision not only expands our portfolio of global trade solutions but with offices in hong kong and china it extends our presence in asia which i have said many times before is a strategic priority for us we continue to gain momentum in the region and during the quarter we expanded our relationships with two very important customers and were seeing many others expanding the number of factories in china that are using our solutions we also signed a health number of new clients in china as the number one exporter and the number two importer in the world china is a very significant market for our solutions outside of china im thrilled to announce that we sold our first trader automation deal in taiwan it was sold to a large semiconductor company were clearly seeing the success as we grow our presence in china and asia and we will continue to invest in extending our solutions to other south east asia countries we continue to see demand from our us enterprise segment as the largest companies need to manage increasingly complex regulations in growing the cost of global trade in order to remain competitive during the quarter we closed a deal with a very large package delivery company and global provider of specialized transportation and logistics services we will be supplying them with our global knowledge trade content and our trade engines to power internal systems as a replacement to far less complete and inaccurate content that they have been collecting on their own their team realized that they had not been keeping pace with the rapid and complex changes to trade regulations and tariffs and they selected us due to our superior capabilities and the quality processes we maintain in keeping our information current further our trade engines will give our content far more automation possibilities within their company we also want a competitive deal for our newly released united states foreign trade zone module with a leader in the marine proportion systems and services businesses foreign trade zone offer us manufacturers the ability to greatly reduce the duties they pay but without automation foreign trade zones are very difficult to manage our foreign trade zone module provides a completely automated approach for managing bonded warehousing and foreign trade zone operations to drive lower improving costs enhanced inventory control and provide supply chain velocity this is an important piece of our overall offering as this newer solution has a strong value proposition in the market and we believe it presents new opportunities for amber road building on the success we had addressing the french market from foreign locations we decided to open a sales office in france last fall and as you may remember in our q earnings call i announced the signing of a large transaction with the french based tire and automotive supply company in this first quarter i visited the region and attended a seminar in paris that we hosted we cohosted actually with supply chain magazine concerning global supply trends and trade compliance for french based companies close to  executives from french companies were in attendance now is in the followup on several engaging sales visits afterwards since then we have added many french companies to our sales pipeline and im optimistic about the near term contribution from this country in our investments finally the us market delivered tremendous results and had their highest bookings quarter ever it also gave us our largest midmarket contract to ever close which was well in excess of  million in total contract value weve made significant progress in driving awareness around the benefit of our solutions and due to the success we are having you should continue to expect us to make investments in this area as i mentioned last quarter we began setting up operations to address global trade needs of european midmarket companies it’s still early in this process but im optimistic in our ability to successfully enter this market and look forward to updating on future calls so we continue to see multiple avenues in our business to drive topline growth and believe that we have the correct strategies in place to capitalize on our large market opportunity with that let me turn it over to tom thomas e conway thanks jim i’ll start with a more detailed overview of our first quarter  financial performance and then i will provide some commentary on our second quarter and fullyear  outlook following my closing remarks we will open up the call to your questions looking at the first quarter results beginning with the statement of operations on a gaap basis we generated revenue in the quarter of  million up  yearoveryear this  million was inclusive of  of contribution from ecvision subscription revenue in the quarter was  million in line with the first quarter of  professional services revenue in the quarter was  million an  increase from the same period a year ago on a nongaap basis total revenue was  million which includes an adjustment of  related to the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment associated with our acquisition of ecvision our trailing  months recurring revenue retention rate in the quarter was  we believe this continues to demonstrate the longterm value of our customer relationship with regard to revenue and billing visibility on a gaap basis our gross profit was  million or  of total revenue compared to  million or  of total revenue in the prior year period subscription gross profit was  million or  of subscription revenue compared to  million or  of subscription revenue in the first quarter of  our gross profit on professional services was  million or  of professional services revenue compared to  million or  of professional services revenue in the same period last year turning the focus operating expenses we continue to execute on our stated strategy of making ongoing investments across our business particularly in sales and marketing and rd as well as in china and europe as we establish our midmarket sales office at germany research and development expenses grew  yearoveryear to  million primarily driven by ecvision’s rd platform as well as investments to further strengthen our own solution sales and marketing expenses increased  yearoveryear to  million or  of revenue due to the expansion of our sales force to address our growing opportunities and investments in demand generation marketing programs general and administrative expenses were  million in the quarter compared to  million in the year ago period for the first quarter gaap operating loss was  million compared to a gaap operating loss of  million in the first quarter of last year which included  million in restricted stock expense on a nongaap basis operating loss was  million in the quarter compared to an operating loss of  in the yearago period nongaap operating loss for the first quarter of  excludes stockbased compensation affordable stock compensation and changes in the fair value of contingent liability purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment acquisition compensation costs and acquisition related costs gaap net loss attributable to common stockholders was  million for the first quarter of  and this number compares to a gaap net loss attributable to common shareholders of  million in the prior year period gaap net loss per share was  in the first quarter of  compared to a net loss per share of  in the first quarter of  these numbers were based on  million and  million shares outstanding respectively on a nongaap basis net loss was  million for the first quarter of  this compares to a nongaap net loss of  in the prior year period nongaap net loss per share was  in the first quarter of  compared to a loss of  per share in the prior year period these numbers were based on  million and  million outstanding shares respectively our adjusted ebitda for the quarter was loss of  million compared to adjusted ebitda loss of  in the same period last year turning the focus to our balance sheet as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  million compared to  million as of december   and  million as of march   we used  million in cash from our balance sheet to fund the acquisition of ecvision cash use and operating activities for the first quarter of  was  million and free cash flow used was  million let’s turn our focus to guidance our expectation for nongaap revenue for the second quarter and fullyear includes the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment our expectations of nongaap loss from operations and nongaap loss per basic share for the second quarter and fullyear exclude stock based compensation affordable stock compensation changes in fair value of contingent consideration liability acquisition compensation costs purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue and acquisition related costs i’ll start with our thoughts on the second quarter of  total nongaap revenue in the second quarter of  is expected to be in the range of  million to  million our nongaap adjusted operating loss is expected to be in the range of  million to  million our nongaap adjusted net loss per share is expected to be in the range of  to  those per share amounts assumed  million basic shares outstanding from a  fullyear perspective we expect total nongaap revenue to be in the range of  million to  million we expect nongaap adjusted operating loss to be in the range of  million to  million nongaap adjusted net loss per share is expected to be in the range of  to  assuming  million basic shares outstanding our q and fullyear guidance reflects the impact of our q bookings performance impact that will have remainder of the year as well as the services revenues that jim discussed on the expense side the market opportunity in front us is a significant and we are committed to extending our leadership positions we are very excited about our prospect in china and in the rest of asia and you should expect to continue to see as invest both there and in europe as we establish a sales presence to address the midmarket we also remain focused on driving the awareness and adoption across the business but we will be looking at areas in which we can prudently manage our expenses the net of this is that we are expecting a modest cash firm exclusive of acquisition related costs of approximately  million to  million in  in summary we remain excited about our large and growing market opportunity and building a business that can achieve sustainable long term growth with that we’re happy to take your questions operator please open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we’ll take our first question from richard davis from canaccord dj hynes hey thanks guys this is dj hynes on for richard so maybe first jim on some of these enterprise deals can you give us a little more color on the ones that pushed out kind of where we stand are these deals still being competitively contested is it delays in contracting or customers looking for budget for this type of stuff just kind of what’s the hang up and the likelihood at that you can push across the finish line here over the next couple of quarters james w preuninger yes i think it’s relatively high so by the way our win rate in the quarter remain very high consisted with our fullyear of  win rate so we didn’t lose many deals we just a few of them slide and as i noted in my comments i think it’s really due to kind of the size and scope companies are working hard to make sure that they have the right resources and commitment before they execute an agreement and we’re making sure that we have the right understanding of the project so that we’re giving them good information about timeline and things like that so we didn’t lose this business it’s just been deferred perhaps one to two quarters and i should comment the booking shortfall really amounted to probably two enterprise deals so we closed a lot of business us midmarket did very well we did great in asia we had signings in europe in the us with some really interesting companies but i needed two more deals to close in on our targets and that’s where we came up short dj hynes and then on the services side curious if any of this implementation business is related to uge relationship and then the followup to that would be why are these services engagements being pushed out james w preuninger yes so we didn’t have any service engagement stop but we do have clients that are slowing down their rate of services investment frankly in many cases it doesn’t mean that we’re slowing down our implementation though we’re finding ways of being more efficient of doing things faster of utilizing more of our customer’s resources and lots of our resources but we had really came down to two projects where through some budget cutting and the efficiencies that i’ve talked about the projects look like they’re not going to be as large as they had been right so in q q and q we’re looking at those project plans and the budgets associated with them and we’re seeing a market difference so we took the time to understand that and adjust our guidance accordingly dj hynes got it and then maybe one last one for tom on the gross margins a pretty significant sequential drop off there is a lot of moving parts in that obviously you got some of our your service utilization stuff and now we’re moving ecvision into the next help us think about gross margins going forward it would be great if you could give us color on both lines i mean the subscription and the professional services for both to be sequential drops so how do those look going forward if we think about building models thomas e conway yes thanks dj we should see gross improvement as we go if you recall from the last call and the call prior to that the large customer loss that we had in  we were committed to not necessarily cutting out certain costs we were going to grow through the overhang of certain dedicated facility and personnel so we were expecting and talked to as much to the fact that the first half of  indiscernible was going to be challenging from a gross margin perspective but that you should see improving margins as we go throughout the year on the services side of the equation the lower than expected with a couple of these service projects moving around in phasing led to some utilization issues so we expect though that those margins should also begin to improve sequentially quarteroverquarter as we move through  so i think the trajectory is in fact the same as we stated earlier starting low in q and growing through it’s just that we’re starting off with a maybe a couple points lower here due to the services side dj hynes okay got it okay thanks for the color guys thomas e conway thank you dj operator we’ll go next to tom roderick from stifel thomas m roderick hey gentlemen good afternoon so i got to apologize i missed the first four minutes of your comments jim as i was jumping from another call and so i missed some of the commentary around the bookings push outs but i heard your answer to dj’s question there so kind of equates to a couple eenterprise deals which maybe you could sort of help quantify the way we think about guidance relative to where most of our models were which i guess at the midpoint is maybe  million lower or so is it fair to think about this as maybe sort of half of that being subscription based revenue and half being related to professional services and i’ll leave it at that and then ill come back for followon thanks james w preuninger yes so tom that’s roughly right and the issue you have is this one quarter you don’t want to miss your bookings target its q because that’s where you have the most number of months of revenue recognition and while were pretty bullish i think about our ability to hit the fullyear bookings target more weighted towards q and q as you probably know bookings in q and q had almost nothing to revenue in the current fiscal year so q miss in booking is trough it’s hard to recover were going to work real hard but i have to somewhat cautious and prudent when im giving guidance here and think that you know those bookings don’t happen until the back half of the year in which time they don’t impact revenue as well but the missed booking impacts subscription revenue and it also impacts the corresponding services that you would have done for those bookings and then we are taking an impact on a couple of these projects where people are just slowing down a little bit on their rate of spend thomas m roderick so i think back to last quarter you had highlighted there was  if not actually push outs but you had a few deals that closed late in the quarter and that impacted the timing of some revenue this quarter you see a couple of deals that are pushing out with no decisions is there something broader going on in the environment of the macro decision making capabilities your customers set is lower or is there a competitive freeze being put in place by some of the bigger erp vendors that can freeze that process what do you think it is or this just maybe you need to tighten up the forecasting and or create some greater incentives for the sales force what do you think sort of fixes some of these challenges james w preuninger yes so our businesses can be a bit lumpy because look at it a typical quarter is about four to seven large enterprise deals and anywhere between  and  either midmarket transactions or smaller tuckin deals right and really generally speaking those enterprise deals are going to account for about  of the total so a slip of one deal or two deals has the meaningful impact and that’s what we saw in q now i didn’t lose the businesses in fact our win rate is very high i mean i don’t think that’s another enterprise software company in the world that wouldn’t want to trade me win loss rates right now so we see our pipeline growing we got great demand both within markets where weve had the presence for some time and some of these new markets are really encouraging i commented on our visibility what’s happening in france and other places so i think were just seeing a little bit of lumpiness and unfortunately it’s come at a bad time you know q thomas m roderick understood one last quick followup from me you have been pretty open past couple of quarters talking about the pipeline where you have a small handful of somewhat transformational deals that would be multiples of a typical enterprise customer can you provide us with an update on what that large transformational deal pipeline looks like you still feel pretty good that we could see you know one maybe even two of those this year are those decision making cycles sort of extending a little bit as well james w preuninger no i think we will have more to talk about later this year with some deals that will have some meaningful impact to our businesses particularly as we look at our revenue growth rates in  so we are competing and we are doing well there thomas m roderick great we’ll stay tuned thanks for the help i appreciate it james w preuninger thank you tom operator we’ll go next to brendan barnicle from pacific crest securities brendan j barnicle thanks so much jim obviously there are some changes in the business this year that have taken the revenue growth down to more like  after  growth the last couple of years as we start to think longer term about this business is this still a  growth business james w preuninger i think so we’ve hit a difficult couple of quarters here both first with the nonrenewable and now with a miss in our q bookings but the fundamentals haven’t changed the market is big underpenetrated we’re a very strong competitor our price points are not going down in many cases we’re seeing better price points we’re seeing larger deal sizes we’re entering new markets we got better sales coverage we got a bigger solution portfolio i mean that the ad we have with ecvision has given us some tremendous strength in an area that we had no capability in before and im pretty excited about the number of cross sell opportunities that popped up almost immediately after we made the announcement and got out and talked to with our customer base in ecvision so we have so many levers to be pulling here to drive growth i just need to continue to work those opportunities this year and show you those results as we start to move into  brendan j barnicle and so given it is a little bit of a lag from when you sign things before they show up in revenue as reflected in the downtick to the guidance we think about  could that be a year that goes back to  or high teens at least james w preuninger so we’re not in a position yet to be guiding on  but i can tell you our investments and the business models that we’re running are all built around a growth rate in that neighborhood for sure brendan j barnicle and then with that is it fair to assume that this year is where the losses bottom in terms of the cash flow and operating income adjusted ebitda thomas e conway yes brendon tom speaking i would say that’s fair again not giving guidance for  but based on what we feel with the investments we’re making in the geographies we’re in with the product suite and solution set we have i think that’s the right way to think about it brendan j barnicle great guys thanks for the clarity i appreciate it james w preuninger thank you brendan operator we’ll go next to eric lemus from raymond james eric c lemus hi guys thanks for taking the question another question on this two larger deals it sounds to me like these deals are just fairly large and more complicated in nature so they are being pushed out but was there any other issues there as far as these prospects looking to push out the closing of these deals whether it be just fear the overall macro environment of the geo location that they are located in anything other than just the complicated nature of those deals james w preuninger no i don’t think so eric c lemus okay james w preuninger i mean they are good deals we’re very competitive they are multimodules they are at great price points the value proposition i think is well recognized by the prospects maybe these are large enterprises and as you know companies like that decision making isn’t generally put in one person’s hands there is a committee and then there is a sign up process and people want to do it right we want to do it right too so i know as a public company everybody wants to push wants to push for the quarter get all the business in and in our business as well as most application software business it does come down to the very end of the quarter where you get the most viewer bookings but we don’t want to make a mistake at the very end just to drive a deal and i don’t think any of our customers do either so we’ll do it we will do it right it would be right for the longterm particularly when i look at you know our customer retention excluding the conversation we had last november is pretty darn long right so we want to get it right out of the gate eric c lemus sure absolutely thanks for that and then you have couple of months now with ecvision under your belt i believe your original estimate was about  million in revenue contribution from that given what you are hearing in a positive response that you’ve heard from customers is that still somewhere around where you are guys are expecting ecvision to come into for the year james w preuninger yes that’s right i mean there are some good upsides potential but look at only having owned the business for  days or so i’m still digesting and we’re trying to get our arms around everything but the customers that they do have in play right now are tremendous references great help in the sales cycles lot of them do have some new opportunity for us with our traditional gtm suite so there’s a lot there that to go get our arms around and we’re going to do our best to make it happen this year but i don’t see risk in the  guidance that we’ve already talked about brendan j barnicle okay great operator operator instructions we’ll go next to glenn mattson from ladenburg thalmann glenn g mattson hi good afternoon i think did you guys mention that there was one deal signed in taiwan and is that the extent of the business there as of now i’m just curious if that’s on track with plan or ahead or behind and given kind of somewhat higher burn than you may have expected previously are there still plans to rollout other asian specific country modules james w preuninger okay good two questions one is just so you understand we don’t have a sales office in taiwan and there are other south east asia countries that will  occasionally there will be an opportunity that will popup that we’ll look to see where to service it from it could be from one of our china offices it could be from the european office but we qualified the deal hard and we take a good look at it to make sure that we’re the right solution and then we’ll engage very selectively so we’re not trying to go harvest a lot of new business out of taiwan but this deal came to us and that looked great and we thought if we could a light house account someone that would represent a good subset of our total suite and be very productive with it it’s an opportunity for us then to go build on that and perhaps think about opening more sales presence in the region right so this was our first deal in taiwan we’ve had users of our technology in taiwan for years but those were deals that were sold either in the us or europe right we do have till plans of expanding our china trade management solution to other countries in that region i think we’ve talked in the past about the work we’ve done there and we have several other countries that we’re expanding into so it’s a big market it’s a big opportunity for us and i think we’re making the right select investments both from a product perspective and engaging in sales and marketing where it really makes sense glenn g mattson okay great just curious little bit about the little competition out there is it the same at it’s been and then i think you mentioned that you won the foreign trade zone deal as a competitive  you took it either incumbent or headtohead against someone could you just talk about maybe who that was and just that better landscape in general james w preuninger the competitive landscape really hasn’t changed this is a great market it’s got a lot of eyes on it and people making investments to try to catch us thankfully we are not standing still and we are making our investments to enhance our suite and bring our new modules the acquisition we made i think has further extended our differentiation but the same kind of competitors glenn that we’ve talked about in the past are the ones that are showing up in deals and again we are winning well better than our fair share of them glenn g mattson okay great thanks good luck james w preuninger thank you glenn thomas e conway thanks glenn end of qa operator and at this time i would like to turn the call back over to jim preuninger for any additional or closing remarks james w preuninger thank you operator well in closing i’m pleased with many of the accomplishments we had in the quarter we made our first acquisition as a public company we grew our presence in asia and added a significant new solutions set to our portfolio we closed several big deals in the us in europe grew our pipeline in those markets as well we closed our first big deal in taiwan and we sold our largest us midmarket delever and saw our us midmarket group consistently now hit their quarterly objectives quarteroverquarteroverquarter well our q bookings did not meet our expectations we have a good pipeline heading into the rest of  that includes several large transactions i’m very confident on our ability to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us we appreciate your support and i
