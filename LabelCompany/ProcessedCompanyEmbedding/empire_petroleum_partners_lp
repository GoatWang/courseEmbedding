distributes fuel to more than  gas stations and convenience stores across  states and the district of columbia hopes to raise  million with the ipo according to a report by lawempire distributes motor fuel to  sites operated by independent dealers  sites operated by independent consignment agents where it sells motor fuel directly to consumers but do not operate the sites and  companyoperated sites the motor fuel distribution network serves retail fuel outlets primarily in its four core markets of texas the southeast the great lakes and the midatlantic regionswe believe that our longterm fixedmargin motor fuel supply agreements with independent dealers … provide us with stable and predictable cash flow that will support consistent distributions to our unitholders we intend to grow our business primarily through acquisitions of wholesale fuel supply agreements which we believe will add to the scale stability and diversification of our motor fuel distribution network the company said in the sec filingthe company intends to capitalize on the highly fragmented distributor market as of january  there were approximately  domestic wholesale fuel distributors it said citing data from petroleum trends international inc reflecting the fragmented nature of the industry in addition in recent years major oil companies have been increasing the minimum volume scale and credit requirements for their motor fuel distribution partnersas a result we believe there is considerable opportunity for consolidation in our industry given the large number of wholesale fuel distributors with limited scale that may consider selling their businesses said the companysince  we have pursued an acquisition growth strategy and have successfully completed  acquisitions increasing our annual volume of distributed motor fuel at a compound annual growth rate of  from  million gallons in  to  million gallons in  empire saidwe believe that targeting acquisitions in and around our current core markets will allow us to improve our purchasing power with major oil companies and leverage our existing personnel in these markets in addition we have a proven ability to expand into and quickly achieve scale in new markets and we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in new markets we intend to pursue highquality assets in attractive markets and focus on the acquisition of longterm wholesale motor fuel supply agreement portfolios the company said“following the accumulation of significant assets this is the culmination of their objective which is to file for an ipo and officially become a publicly traded mlp which others recently gpm have done and lehigh gas before them  its a trend by market standards these are very small mlps and ipo issues but the returns for the general partners are significant” said ken shriber managing director of petroleum equity group chappaqua ny  these small mlps that come onto the market represent a significant movement towards the continued consolidation in the industry and in the future some of the mlp might merge or sell as well thats a realistic option down the roadin other company news jeff goodwin has joined empire
