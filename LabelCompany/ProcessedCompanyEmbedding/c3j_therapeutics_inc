commercialization of novel therapeutics aimed at reengineering the human microbiome today announced the development of two new formulations of its lead candidate cg a novel peptidebased drug for the prevention of dental caries tooth decayin phase  trials conducted in  the company demonstrated that a novel dental varnish formulation containing cg achieved significant reductions of streptococcus mutans which is recognized as the major causative agent of dental caries a single varnish application outperformed multiple tooth gel applications delivered by custom dental tray or by brushing the varnish formulation of cg is a product candidate for inoffice treatment similar to fluoride varnishes commonly applied by dentists or hygienists and is therefore potentially wellsuited for the inoffice treatment of high risk caries prone populationsgiven the efficacy demonstrated to date of this professionally applied product and recognizing the need for an additional convenient athome dosing method cj therapeutics has also developed an innovative tooth strip product for delivery of the drug to the tooth surface biofilm the company has successfully manufactured room temperature stable tooth strips in preparation for the upcoming phase  clinical trials“the clinical results obtained to date demonstrate that tooth surface contact and drug concentration are both key to effective therapy” said todd patrick president and ceo of cj therapeutics “the trials evaluating the varnish show that this formulation delivers superior microbiology results compared to other applications we believe that just a few doses of the drug will have the potential to reengineer the oral microbiome thereby providing longterm protection additionally we feel the tooth strip formulation has the potential to become a convenient athome application for multiple treatments the excellent safety profile greatly enhances the therapeutic window of this investigational product”cj therapeutics anticipates initiating clinical trials in the first quarter of  to explore the efficacy of both tooth strips and varnish in commercially relevant treatment paradigms these studies include evaluation of the varnish applied at a frequency appropriate for populations with high disease burden and the varnish in combination with tooth strips the combination of varnish plus tooth strips enables an inoffice professional varnish treatment to be followed with selfapplication of tooth strips at home  results from the phase  studies are expected by the third quarter of  and preliminary data will be
