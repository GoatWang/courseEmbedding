 evasion with the com  endgame request demo blog  our blogendpoint security simplified blog all technical blog executive blog request demo how to hunt detecting persistence  evasion with the com blake strom mitre paul ewing september   after adversaries breach a system they usually consider how they will maintain uninterrupted access through events such as system restarts this uninterrupted access can be achieved through persistence methods adversaries are constantly rotating and innovating persistence techniques enabling them to evade detection and maintain access for extended periods of time a prime example is the recent dnc hack where it was reported that the attackers leveraged very obscure persistence techniques for some time while they evaded detection and exfiltrated sensitive data the number of ways to persist code on a windows system can be counted in the hundreds and the list is growing the discovery of novel approaches to persist is not uncommon further the mere presence of code in a persistence location is by no means an indicator of malicious behavior as there are an abundance of items usually over a thousand set to autostart under various conditions on a standard windows system this can make it particularly challenging for defenders to distinguish between legitimate and malicious activity with so many opportunities for adversaries to blend in how should organizations approach detection of adversary persistence techniques to address this question endgame is working with the mitre corporation a notforprofit rd organization to demonstrate how the hunting paradigm fits within the mitre attck™ framework the attck™ framework—which stands for adversarial tactics techniques  common knowledge—is a model for describing the actions an adversary can take while operating within an enterprise network categorizing actions into tactics such as persistence and techniques to achieve those tactics endgame has collaborated with mitre to help extend the attck™ framework by adding a new technique – com object hijacking – to the persistence tactic sparking some great conversations and insights that we’ve pulled together into this post thanks to mitre for working with endgame and others in the community to help update the model and a special thanks to blake strom for coauthoring this piece now let the hunt for persistence begin   hunting for attacker techniques hunting is not just the latest buzzword in security it is a very effective process for detection as well as a state of mind defenders must assume breach and hunt within the environment continually as though an active intrusion is underway indicators of compromise ioc are not enough when adversaries can change tool indicators often defenders must hunt for neverbeforeseen artifacts by looking for commonly used adversary techniques and patterns given constantly changing infrastructure and the increasingly customized nature of attacks hunting for attacker techniques greatly increases the likelihood of catching today’s sophisticated adversaries persistence is one such tactic for which we can effectively hunt defenders understand that adversaries will try to persist and generally know the most common ways this can be done hunting in persistence locations for anomalies and outliers is a great way to find the adversary but it isn’t always easy many techniques adversaries use resemble ways software legitimately behaves on a system adversary persistence behavior in a windows environment could show up as installing seemingly benign software to run upon system boot when a user logs into a system or even more clever techniques such as utilizing windows management instrumentation wmi smart adversaries know what is most common and will try to find poorly understood and obscure ways to persist during an intrusion in order to evade detection mitre has provided the community with a cheat sheet of persistence mechanisms through attck™ which describes the universe of adversary techniques to help inform comprehensive coverage during hunt operations it includes a wide variety of techniques ranging from simply using legitimate credentials to more advanced techniques like component firmware modification approaches the goal of an advanced adversary is not just to persist  it is to persist without detection by evading common defensive mechanisms as well these common evasion techniques are also covered by attck™ mitre documented these techniques using indepth knowledge about how adversaries can and do operate like with com hijacking for persistence to demonstrate the value of hunting for specific techniques we focus on component object model com hijacking which can be used for persistence as well as defense evasion   so what’s up with the com microsoft’s component object model com has been around forever – well not exactly – but at least since  with ms windows  com basically allows for the linking of software components this is a great way for engineers to make components of their software accessible to other applications the classic use case for com is how microsoft office products link together to learn more microsoft’s official documentation provides a great comprehensive overview of com like many other capabilities attackers use com is not inherently malicious however there are ways it can be used by the adversary which are malicious as we discussed earlier most adversaries want to persist therefore hunters should regularly look for signs of persistence such as anomalous files which are set to execute automatically adversaries can cleverly manipulate the com to execute their code specifically by manipulating software classes in the current user registry hive and enabling persistence but before we dive into the registry let’s have a quick history lesson messing with the com is not an unknown technique by any means even as early as  adversaries were utilizing internet explorer to access the machine’s com to cause crashes and other issues check out cve or some of cert’s vulnerability notes discussing exactly this problem com object hijacking first became mainstream in  at the virus bulletin conference when jon larimer presented “the dangers of peruser com objects” hijacking is a fairly common term in the infosec community and describes the action of maliciously taking over an otherwise legitimate function at the target host session hijacking browser hijacking and searchorder hijacking to name a few it didn’t take long for adversaries to start leveraging the research presented at virus bulletin  for example in  the zeroacess rootkit started hijacking the com while in  gdata reported a new remote administration tool rat dubbed compfun which persists via a com hijack the following year gdata again presented the use of com hijacking with comrat seen persisting via a com hijack the roaming tiger advanced persistent threat apt group reportedly also used com hijacking with the bbsrat malware these are just a few examples to demonstrate that com hijacking is a real concern which hunters need to consider and handle while looking for active intrusions in the network   the challenges and opportunities to detect com hijacking today com hijacking remains relevant but is often forgotten we see it employed by persistent threats as well as included in crimeware fortunately we have one advantage  the hijack is fairly straightforward to detect to perform the hijack the adversary relies on the operating system to load current user objects prior to the local machine objects in the com this is the fundamental principle to the hijack and also the method to detect easy right well there are some gotchas to watch out for  most existing tools detect com hijacking through signatures a com object is identified in the system by a globally unique identifier called a clsid  a signaturebased approach will only look at and alert on specific clsids which reference an object that has been previously reported as hijacked this is nowhere near enough because in theory any com object and any clsid could be hijacked second for us hunters the presence of a user com object in general can be considered anomalous but some thirdparty applications will generate such objects causing false positives in your hunt to accurately find com hijacks a more indepth inspection within the entire current user and local machine registry hive is necessary in our single default windows  vm we had  clsids within the local machine hive to perform the inspection you will need to dust off your scripting skills and perform a comparative analysis within the registry this could become difficult and may not scale if you are querying thousands of enterprise systems which is why we baked this inspection into the endgame platform   so many objects to hijack at endgame we inspect the registry to hunt exactly for these artifacts across all objects within the registry and this investigation scales across an entire environment this is critical because hunters need to perform their operations in a timely and efficient manner please reference the following video to see a simple com hijack and automatic detection with the endgame platform endgame enumerates all known persistence locations across a network enriches the data and performs a variety of analytics to highlight potentially malicious artifacts in seconds  com hijacking detection is one capability of many in the endgame platform   video of threat hunting endgame persistence demo hunting for com hijacking using endgame   conclusion persistence is a tactic used by a wide range of adversaries  it is part of almost every compromise the choice of persistence technique used by an adversary can be the most interesting and sophisticated aspect of an attack this makes persistence coupled with the usual defense evasion techniques prime focus areas for hunting and subsequent discovery and remediation furthermore we can’t always rely on indicators of compromise alone instead defenders must seek out anomalies within the environment either at the host or in the network which can reveal the breadcrumbs to follow and find the breach without a framework and intelligent automation the hunt can be timeconsuming resourceintensive and unfocused mitre’s attck™ framework provides an abundance of techniques that can guide the hunt in a structured way with this as a starting point we have explored one persistence technique in depth com hijacking com hijacks can be detected without signatures through intelligent automation and false positive mitigation getting beyond many challenges present if an analyst would need to find com hijacks manually this is just one way in which a techniquefocused hunt mindset can allow defenders to detect prevent and remediate those adversaries that continue to evade even the most advanced defenses related posts august   endpoint malware

simplified blog all technical blog executive blog request demo hunting for exploit kits joe desimone september   email spam and browser exploitation are two very popular avenues used by criminals to compromise computers  most compromises result from human error such as clicking a malicious link or downloading and opening an attachment within an email and enabling macros  email filtering can offer effective protections against the delivery of widespread malicious spam and user training can be reasonably effective in reducing the number of employees willing to open an unknown document enable macros and selfinfect protection against browser exploitation is more difficult which occurs simply by visiting a website  users are prone to clicking links to malicious sites and much worse criminals actively exploit well trafficked sites directly through web server exploitation or indirectly via domain squatting ad injections or other techniques and cause the user’s browser to covertly visit an exploit server the user’s browser gets hit a malicious payload such as ransomware is installed and the user has a bad day the hardest part of this for attackers is the exploitation code itself  fortunately for criminals a thriving underground market for exploit kits is available  these occasionally contain zero days but more often exploit kit authors rapidly weaponize new vulnerabilities which will allow for exploitation of users who fail to rapidly patch their systems   exploit kits are often key components of crimeware campaigns which is estimated to be a  billion global market capturing these often evasive exploit kits is essential to advance research into protecting against them but samples are hard to obtain for researchers to solve this problem we created maxwell an automated exploit kit collection and detection tool that crawls the web hunting for exploits for researchers maxwell significantly decreases the time it takes to find exploit kits samples and instead enables us to focus on the detection and prevention capabilities necessary to counter the growing criminal threat of exploit kits   exploit kits in the wild the angler exploit kit  responsible for a variety of malvertising and ransomware compromises  is indicative of just how lucrative these exploit kits can be by some estimates angler was the most lucrative compromise platform for crimeware reeling in  million annually in ransomware alone earlier this year a russian criminal group was arrested in connection with the lurk trojan this coincided with an end of angler exploit kit activity a battle for market share has ensued since with rig and neutrino ek jockeying for the market leading position a typical business model for exploit kit authors is malware as a service the authors rent access to their exploit kits to other criminals for several thousand dollars a month on average other criminal groups instead opt to focus more on traffic distribution services or gates and set out to compromise as many web servers as possible once compromised they can insert iframe redirections to websites of their choosing the users of exploit kits can pay for this as a service to increase the amount of traffic their exploit kits receive and drive up infections   the exploitation process the graphic below depicts a highlevel overview of the six core steps of the exploitation process there are numerous existing case studies on exploit kits such as one on nuclear that provide additional very low level details on this process   a user visits a legitimate web page their browser is silently redirected to an exploit kit landing page this stage varies but focuses on traffic redirection either the attacker compromises the website and redirects the user by adding javascript or an iframe or the attacker pays for an advertisement to perform the redirection the exploit kit sends a landing page which contains javascript to determine which browser plugins and versions the user is running neutrino ek is a little different in that this logic is embedded in a flash file that is initially sent if the user’s configuration matches a vulnerability to a particular exploit eg an outdated flash version the user’s browser will be directed to load the exploit the exploit’s routines run and gain code execution on the user’s machine the exploit downloads and executes the chosen malware payload today this is usually ransomware but it can also be banking trojans click fraud or other malware   how to catch an exploit kit introducing maxwell there are numerous motivations for collecting and analyzing exploit kits as a blue teamer you may want to test your defenses against the latest and greatest threat in the wild as a red teamer you may want to do adversary emulation with one of the big named exploit kits eg neutrino rig magnitude or maybe you have some other cool research initiative how would you go about collecting new samples and tracking activity if you work for a large enterprise or av company  it is relatively easy as your fellow employees or customers will provide all the samples you need  you can simply set up packet collection and some exploit kit detections at your boundary and sit back and watch  but what if you are a researcher without access to that treasure trove of data that’s where maxwell comes in maxwell is an automated system for finding exploit kit activity on the internet it crawls websites with an army of virtual machines to identify essential information such as the responsible exploit kit as well as related ips and domains   the maxwell architecture maxwell consists of a central server which is basically the conductor or brains of the operation connecting to a vsphere or other cloud architecture to spin up and down virtual machines rabbitmq and elasticsearch provide the means for message queuing and indexing the malicious artifacts the virtual machine consists of a variety of python agent scripts to enable iterative development as well as a pipe server that receives messages from the instrumentation library filters those that match a whitelist and forwards the remaining messages to a rabbitmq server flux is our instrumentation library which is a dll loaded to new processes with a simple appinit dll key flux hooks the usual functions for dropping files creating registry keys process creation etc the hooking is done only in usermode at the nt function level the hooks must be at the lowest possible level in order to capture the most data flux also has some exploit detection capabilities built in and shellcode capturing which will be discussed shortly moving to outside the virtual machine the controller is a python script that listens on a rabbitmq channel for new jobs including basic information like the website to visit a uuid and basic config information once a new job is received the controller is responsible for spinning up a virtual machine and sending the job information and the plugin to execute which is currently only flux the controller uses ssh to copy files into the virtual machine the results server is also a python script that listens on a different rmq channel this script receives data from the virtual machines during execution the data is forwarded to an elasticsearch index for permanent storage and querying once a job has completed the results server determines if any malicious activity has occurred if so it executes post processing routines finally all extracted data and signature information is sent in a notification to the researcher an important design decision worth noting is to stream events out of the virtual machine during execution as opposed to all at once after a timeout the latter is susceptible to losing information after ransomware wreaks havoc in the virtual machine when configuring your virtual machine it’s important to make it an attractive target for attackers who work by market share and target the most popular software such as windows  internet explorer and flash be sure to also remove vmtools and any drivers that get dropped by vmware you can browse to the drivers folder and sort by publisher to find vmware drivers finally you should consider patch levels and pick plugin versions that are exploitable by all major exploit kits while also disabling any additional protections such as ie protected mode   exploit detection in maxwell as mentioned earlier maxwell automates exploit detection while previously rop detection was reliable enough it is no longer effective at detecting modern exploit kits the same is true for stack pivot which basically checks esp to see if it points to the heap instead of the stack and is easily evaded by angler and other exploit kits in flux we throw guard pages not only on the export address table but also the iat and mz header of critical modules we also use a small whitelist instead of a blacklisting technique enabling us to catch shellcode that is designed to evade emet even better we can detect memory disclosure routines that execute before the shellcode when a guard page violation is hit we also save the shellcode associated with it for later inspection similar to all sandboxes flux can log when files are dropped new processes are created registry keys are written to or even when certain files are accessed file access can be used to detect javascript vmdetection routines before an exploit is even triggered however these are all too noisy on their own so we must rely heavily on the whitelist capability essentially every typical fileregistryprocess action that is observed from browsing benign pages is filtered leaving only malicious activity caused by the exploit kit even if they evade our exploit detection techniques we will still detect malicious activity of the payload as it is dropped and executed if malicious activity is detected the postprocessing step is activated by executing tcpflow on the pcap to extract all sessions and files next regular expressions are searched across the getpost requests to identify traffic redirectors such as eitest ek landing pages and payload beacons finally any dropped files shellcode and files extracted from the pcap are scanned with yara the shellcode scanning allows for exploit kit tagging based on the specific shellcode routines used in each kit which are very long lasting signatures if you are protecting a network with snort rules for a component of the ek process you need to know when maxwell stops flagging a signature building robust signatures limits the necessity to frequently update them there are a few tricks for writing robust signatures such as comparing samples over time to extract commonalities or creating signatures from flash exploits themselves both of these may result in longer lasting signatures you can also take advantage of social media and compare samples in maxwell against those posted on twitter by researchers such as kafeine malwaretraffic and broadanalysis   hunting for exploit kits with the architecture and detection capabilities in place it’s time to start hunting but which websites should be explored to find evil stuff a surprisingly effective technique is to continually cycle through the alexa top  or top  websites which can be streamlined by browsing five websites at a time instead of one and get a x boost on your processing capability in less than  hours you can crawl through  websites with just a handful of virtual machines the only down side is losing the ability to know exactly which of the five websites was compromised without manually looking through the pcap if you have a good traffic anonymizing service you can just reprocess each of the five websites at derbycon  recharge the maxwell research was presented for the first time and we released the code under an mit license you can find it on github we look forward to to comments contributions and suggestions for advancements maxwell has proven extremely useful in fully automating the detection and analysis of exploit kits and watering holes ideally maxwell can help both red and blue teamers test an organization’s defenses without requiring extensive resources or significant time it also greatly simplifies a key pain point for researchers  actually collecting the samples by hunting for exploit kits with maxwell researchers can spend more time analyzing and building defenses against exploit kits instead of searching for them related posts august   endpoint malware detection for the hunt realworld considerations view details may   hunting on the cheap
