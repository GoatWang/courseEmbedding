jones was an eclectic physician whose main work was published in  over the course of his long career he treated  patients with cancer he claimed an  success rate for the last several years i have been working with various herbalists to recreate some of the products jones used in his practice these are available on an experimental basis and feedback on their use would be much appreciated effective june   these products have only been available through licensed practitioners if interested in these products please have your practitioner contact us given the confidence dr jones had in his compound syrup scrophularia this was the first product we developed he left his recipe for posterity saying it has been the earnest study of my life to find such a combination which i could leave as a help to my brother physicians in their efforts to cure the more desperate forms of this disease i have the utmost faith in the curative power of this combination    great care should be taken to get fresh herbs to make the syrup dr jones recommended that patients take one tablespoon of the syrup three times a day it took two years to find quality sources of the herbs and make them exactly as jones directed using a steam displacement process we have now been producing this syrup for quite a few years not surprisingly it is my personal favorite of all the formulas we produce i like it better than even my own formulas which include the much more popular indigo drops whales tears and feathered turtle crème besides tasting delicious it seems as the name would suggest to offer great relief for conditions that are characterized by swelling and lumps scrofula was the word used in times past to describe lumps and bumps in the lymphatic system that were believed to be related to tuberculosis other infections and tumors both benign and malignant it is my conviction that syrups such as this one are superior to tinctures and teas because the process used in making them assures that more parts of the herbs go into the medicine both the alcohol and water soluble constituents are captured and the sweetness assures quick uptake into the bloodstream darkfield microscope examinations of the blood suggest that this as well as the trifolium syrup—our sundance elixir—are excellent blood purifiers the syrup is available in  oz bottles there is also an extract that does not contain any honey it comes in  oz bottles it is produced under the name of seneca elixir for more information on this and other products based on the legacies of dr eli jones see my book and the list below pages  of my book contain material on jones and his methodology his escharotic formulae poultice powder healing salve and recipe for compound syrup scrophularia can be found in the appendix on pages  the

the thth centuries who claimed to be able to treat cancer he is the author of cancer  its causes symptoms and treatment giving the results of over forty years experience in the medical treatment of this disease and definite medication 　　jones studied conventional medicine and practiced for five years before deciding that the medicine of the day was harmful due to its dependence upon harsh cathartics like calomel he then turned to eclectic medicine which relied upon herbal extracts including those of the native americans went back to school graduated and practiced eclectic medicine for another five years he decided to learn homeopathy went back to school and then practiced as a homeopath he next turned to physiomedicalism and after studying practiced that for another five years and finally he studied dr willhelm heinrich schüsslers biochemic cell salts which is similar to homeopathy but relies upon salts found in the body and practiced that  after his forays into the various medical schools of his time jones developed a syncretic practice using all the schools he had learned he tended to use a low dosage herbal tinctures or homeopathic mother tinctures in high doses his definite medication proposed ow dosage herbal extracts and engendered opposition from nonhomeopaths 　　jones also published a journal of therapeutic facts for the busy doctor which gave doctors the pro
