mission statement employment opportunities central appalachia northern appalachia western bituminous illinois basin other nonmining mining methods safety  environmental demand transportation glossary transportation we ship coal to our customers by rail truck or barge for the year ended december   the majority of our coal sales tonnage was shipped by rail the majority of our coal is transported to customers by either the csx railroad or the norfolk southern railroad in eastern kentucky and by the ohio central railroad or the wheeling  lake erie railroad in ohio in addition in southeastern ohio we use our own trucking operations to transport coal to our customers where rail is not available we use thirdparty trucking to transport coal to our customers in utah shipments from our new pennyrile mine in western kentucky are transported to our customers via barge on the green river as our pennyrile property is adjacent to this waterway  in addition coal from certain of our other mines is located within economical trucking distance to the big sandy river andor the ohio river and can be transported by barge it is customary for customers to pay the transportation costs to their location we believe that we have good relationships with rail carriers and truck companies due in part to our modern coalloading facilities at our loadouts and the working relationships and experience of our transportation and distribution employeescoal used for domestic consumption is generally sold freeonboard at the mine and the purchaser normally bears the transportation costs export coal however is usually sold at the loading port and coal producers are responsible for shipment to the export coalloading facility with the buyer paying the ocean freight most electric generators arrange longterm shipping contracts with rail or barge companies to assure stable delivered costs transportation can be a large component of a purchasers total cost although the purchaser pays the freight transportation costs still are important to coal mining companies because the purchaser may choose a supplier largely based on cost of transportation railroads account for a significant portion of transportation of us coal shipments while truck movements account for a much smaller portion trucks and overland conveyors haul coal over shorter distances while barges great lake carriers and ocean vessels move coal to export markets and domestic markets requiring shipment over the great lakes most coal mines are served by a single rail company but much of the powder river basin is served by two competing rail carriers the burlington northern santa fe railway and the union pacific railroad rail competition in this major coalproducing region is important because rail costs constitute a significant portion of the delivered cost of powder river basin coal in eastern markets home  about us  management  operations  industry  markets  contact us  site map web design by elink design inc a

primarily consumed by utilities to generate electricity it is also used by steel companies to make steel products and by a variety of industrial users to heat and power foundries cement plants paper mills chemical plants and other manufacturing and processing facilities in general coal is characterized by end use as either steam coal or metallurgical coal steam coal is used by electricity generators and by industrial facilities to produce steam electricity or both metallurgical coal is refined into coke which is used in the production of steel steam coal is used by electric utilities throughout the united states to generate power for industrial commercial and residential consumption for the year ended december   data from the us energy information administration eia showed that the united states relied on coal for approximately  of its power generation compared to approximately  for natural gas over the past ten years eia data shows that coal averaged approximately  as the source of power generation in the united states compared to an average of approximately  for natural gas we believe the decreased use of coal for power generation in the united states during  was driven by historically low prices for natural gas which caused utilities to switch from coal to cheaper natural gas for power generation our assumption indicates as natural gas prices return to more normal levels the use of steam coal for power generation will increase from  levels however we suspect that the use of steam coal for power generation in the united states will likely not return to historical levels due to government regulations of coalfired power generation plants coal has historically been the lowest cost fossil fuel used for baseload electric power generation being less expensive than natural gas or fuel oil coalfueled generation is also competitive with nuclear power generation on a total cost per megawatthour basis thus our belief is steam coal will remain a significant source of power generation in the united states in the future in addition the eia reports that coal will remain the primary source of power generation worldwide as developing countries across the globe are projected to increase power generation in the future as a result our expectation is that steam coal exports from the united states to developing countries will increase in the future as worldwide power generation is forecast to grow through the year  for metallurgical coal we believe recent economic weakness in europe and asia has caused a decrease in the production of steel which has had a negative effect on the worldwide demand and price of metallurgical coal used in the steel making process we feel that when economic conditions improve in these areas steel production will increase and worldwide demand for metallurgical coal will also increase home  about us  management  operations  industry  markets  contact us  site map web design by elink design inc a

for growth we continue to keep our debt at historically low levels while we have invested capital dollars during the first quarter to expand our met coal production capabilities in our central

continually focus on safety as we have increased our yearoveryear coal production capabilities to meet our committed sales during  our commitment to safety was recently evident as our sands hill operation in ohio received recognition for the prevention of accidents in the workplace and celebrated over  hours of injuryfree operations from june  through december  we are very proud of the employees that received this recognition and their commitment to a safe working environmentthe continued resurgence in coal prices particularly met coal prices allowed us to execute favorable sales contracts for  that provide us with substantial upside opportunity if we can continue to control our costs we invested additional capital at our central appalachia mining complexes in the first

forwardlooking statements all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this press release that address activities events or developments that rhino expects believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forwardlooking statements including the statements and information included under the heading coal operations update these forwardlooking statements are based on rhinos current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on rhinos business operating results financial condition and similar matters while management believes that these forwardlooking statements are reasonable as and when made there can be no assurance that future developments affecting rhino will turn out as rhino anticipates whether actual results and developments in the future will conform to expectations is subject to significant risks uncertainties and assumptions many of which are beyond rhinos control or ability to predict therefore actual results and developments could materially differ from rhinos historical experience present expectations and what is expressed implied or forecast in these forwardlooking statements important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following rhinos inability to obtain additional financing necessary to fund its capital expenditures meet working capital needs and maintain and grow its operations and its related ability to continue as a going concern or its inability to obtain alternative financing upon the expiration of its amended and restated senior secured credit facility rhinos future levels of indebtedness liquidity and compliance with debt covenants volatility and recent declines in the price of rhinos common units sustained depressed levels of or decline in coal prices which depend upon several factors such as the supply of domestic and foreign coal the demand for domestic and foreign coal governmental regulations price and availability of alternative fuels for electricity generation and prevailing economic conditions declines in demand for electricity and coal current and future environmental laws and regulations which could materially increase operating costs or limit rhinos ability to produce and sell coal extensive government regulation of mine operations especially with respect to mine safety and health which imposes significant actual and potential costs difficulties in obtaining andor renewing permits necessary for operations the availability and prices of competing electricity generation fuels a variety of operating risks such as unfavorable geologic conditions adverse weather conditions and natural disasters mining and processing equipment unavailability failures and unexpected maintenance problems and accidents including fire and explosions from methane poor mining conditions resulting from the effects of prior mining the availability and costs of key supplies and commodities such as steel diesel fuel and explosives fluctuations in transportation costs or disruptions in transportation services which could increase competition or impair rhinos ability to supply coal a shortage of skilled labor increased labor costs or work stoppages rhinos ability to secure or acquire new or replacement highquality coal reserves that are economically recoverable material inaccuracies in rhinos estimates of coal reserves and nonreserve coal deposits existing and future laws and regulations regulating the emission of sulfur dioxide and other compounds which could affect coal consumers and reduce demand for coal federal and state laws restricting the emissions of greenhouse gases rhinos ability to acquire or failure to maintain obtain or renew surety bonds used to secure obligations to reclaim mined property rhinos dependence on a few customers and its ability to find and retain customers under favorable supply contracts changes in consumption patterns by utilities away from the use of coal such as changes resulting from low natural gas prices changes in governmental regulation of the electric utility industry defects in title in properties that rhino owns or losses of any of its leasehold interests rhinos ability to retain and attract senior management and other key personnel material inaccuracy of assumptions underlying reclamation and mine closure obligations and weakness in global economic conditionsother factors that could cause rhinos actual results to differ from its projected results are described in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including its annual report on form k quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k readers are
