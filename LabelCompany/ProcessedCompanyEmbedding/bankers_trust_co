in the amount of  to the named beneficiary richard sica sica designated by plaintiff dulien steel products inc dulien in a letter of credit issued on its instructions and confirmed by defendant dulien seeks to recover from bankers the amount so paid dulien is a washington corporation bankers a new york corporation jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship  usc §  dulien makes two claims the first is that since bankers repeatedly requested instructions it should not have paid sica in disregard of instructions not to pay the alternative claim is that bankers was negligent in failing to give notice that it would disregard these instructions and pay sica involved in this latter claim is an assertion of some form of estoppel against bankers in that the requests for instructions led dulien to believe bankers would not pay sica dulien moved for summary judgment pursuant to rule  frcivp  us ca on its first claim only bankers crossmoved for summary judgment on both claims the district court denied plaintiffs motion and granted defendants motion we affirm the motions were submitted on affidavits supplemented by depositions with one exception there is no dispute as to the facts sometime in early  dulien entered into a contract to sell scrap steel through the office commun des consummateurs de ferraillie o c c f the purchasing authority for the european iron  steel community payment to dulien in an amount in excess of  was to be accomplished through several letters of credit established in its favor an organization known as marco polo group projects ltd tangiers marco polo was apparently entitled to a commission from dulien for having arranged the transaction payment to marco polo was to be made through two letters of credit only one of which is involved here on june   seattlefirst national bank seattle seattle washington sent its irrevocable letter of credit to bankers trust company in the amount of  the letter of credit was addressed to richard sica and authorized him to value on bankers for the account of dulien to the extent of  it provided that this money would be available to him on his simple receipt reading as follows received from the bankers trust co of new york the sum of sixty thousand five hundred dollars u s currency for services rendered through the marco polo group projects ltd of tangier    and upon the following condition    and a written notification from the seattle first national bank of seattle washington    andor an official telegraph advice from the seattle first national bank at seattle to the bankers trust company foreign department new york city wherein such written notification or telegraphic advice indicates reveals or confirms that the dulien steel products inc of washington seattle washington has negotiated official documents for payment against any of the letters of credits established to the name of dulien steel products inc of washington seattle washington which letters of credits cover contract no namc as issued to the name of dulien steel products inc of washington seattle washington by the o c c f at  rue ravenstein bruxelles belgium — the letter of credit also provided payment in full as outlined herein shall be made without question    drafts to be negotiated not later than september   it further provided except as expressly stated negotiations under this credit are subject to the uniform customs and practice for commercial documentary credits fixed by the thirteenth congress of the international chamber of commerce on july   bankers confirmed the obligation by advising sica that we bankers confirm the credit for its present validity of september   and for its present amount of  and thereby undertake that all drafts drawn and presented as specified in the credit will be duly honored bankers confirmation charge for undertaking this obligation to make payment of  to sica the beneficiary was  on september   sicas attorney delivered to bankers along with a letter a simple receipt signed by sica which admittedly satisfied the description of the receipt required in the letter of credit he also enclosed a draft the original letter of credit and bankers confirmation he requested bankers to request telegraphic advice from seattle when the documents were negotiated as required by the letter of credit on october   bankers wired seattle as follows refer your credit  our reference  simple receipt for  called for in credit has been presented to us with request to notify you immediately by wire and receive your authenticated wire instructions to either honor or dishonor the presentation please wire may we pay against simple receipt on october   seattle replied as follows reur bankwire today regarding your ref no  our credit  drawing for  our answer is you may not pay no documents have been negotiated against any of the letters of credits established to the name of dulien steel products inc of washington seattle washington letters of credit cover contract no namc as issued to the name of dulien steel products inc of washington seattle washington by the o c c f at  rue ravenstein bruxelles belgium we understand letter of credit  will be amended showing expiry october   seattle first natl bank seattle a foreign dept prior to october  however completely unknown to bankers dulien had completed negotiations with marco polo looking toward among other things a modification of earlier understandings between them these negotiations culminated in a letter from marco polo dated august   agreeing to substantial amendments to the terms and conditions of the outstanding letter of credit under the proposed amendments the face amount was to be reduced from  to  and payment of this reduced amount was to await full payment to dulien by o c c f seattle received the marco polo letter of modifications through dulien with its approval about september   on september  seattle wrote dulien suggesting changes in the proposed modifications which are not significant here and also stating it would be preferable to issue an entirely new letter of credit    but if this is not possible the foregoing amendments undoubtedly would serve the same purpose    if you approve please sign and return the enclosed copy or advise us of any objections you may have neither dulien nor seattle advised bankers as to these communications nor sent copies to bankers at this time and bankers was wholly unaware of them until october on october   the day after the seattle bank had advised bankers that dulien had not negotiated the documents but that it understood that the credit in favor of sica would be extended it wrote bankers at duliens request that the credit to sica had been extended to october  and that all other terms and conditions remain unchanged the extension was authorized by a vicepresident of dulien upon a request by marco polo at the time the officers of dulien familiar with the transactions in question were absent from seattle and marco polo took advantage of the vicepresidents ignorance of the new arrangements bankers thereupon made the corresponding change in its credit and confirmed the credit as thus extended to sicas attorney thus the original letter of credit was extended at duliens own request for another month without modification had this extension not been requested by dulien the present controversy would never have arisen the original letter of credit could not have been paid and sica would not have been in a position to force payment on october   bankers again wired seattle bank for advice as to whether dulien had negotiated the documents under the o c c f credits and asked may we pay the next day october  the seattle bank replied that dulien had negotiated the designated documents thus at this point the conditions of the letter had been met and bankers trust was required to honor drafts of sica against the original letter of credit as extended without modification in the october  wire however seattle bank although it had been aware of the proposed modifications since september  for the first time notified bankers that dulien    has requested that payment be deferred    because of arrangements between them and the marco polo group projects ltd    it listed the proposed amendments and concluded with a request that bankers contact sica for acceptance of the proposal and amendments    in response to bankers advice to sica requesting acceptance of the proposed changes sicas attorney informed bankers by registered mail on october  that sica has not effected any modification of the original letter of credit    and therefore expects payment in the amount reflected in such original letter of credit bankers immediately notified seattle bank of sicas position quoting his attorneys letter in full its wire concluded with the word instruct upon receipt of his message seattle informed dulien of its contents and requested instructions as to what to advise bankers trust company dulien was also informed that if its instructions were to reject the request to pay you must supply us seattle bank with a letter of indemnity    to hold us harmless against any loss or damage whatsoever by reason of such rejection or refusal of payment dulien promptly agreed to the required indemnity stated that our obligation under this letter of credit lies with marco polo group projects ltd and not in richard sica as an individual and instructed seattle bank to reject payment except in accordance with the amendments fortified by the indemnity seattle bank wired bankers trust on october  do not pay quoted duliens letter to the effect that the obligation was to marco polo not to sica individually and advised that instructions to sicas attorney to accept the modifications would be forthcoming from italy no mention was made by dulien or seattle bank of duliens agreement to indemnify seattle not was any offer made to indemnify bankers if it failed to pay sica on october  three days later bankers replied to seattle that sica still refused to accept the amendments and was urgently pressing for payment it again asked may we pay seattle bank replied the same day our position remains the same    the next day bankers trust wired seattle bank your credit  paid today  stop informative we quote contents letter dated october  received from h g shields attorney for richard sica quote i have been authorized by mr richard sica to demand payment now due under the above numbered confirmation and letter of credit mr sica has authorized me to insist that payment be made forthwith and if it not be made then i have been authorized to institute action for the collection of same against you and the seattlefirst national bank unquote i plaintiffs claim of negligence is without merit plaintiff alleges that bankers failed to exercise that degree of care and prudence exercised by banks in comparable circumstances and to which plaintiff was entitled in conformity with established custom and usage in banks generally an additional claim is that there is a dispute as to whether bankers notified dulien that it was going to pay sica and this dispute should have been submitted to a jury involved here is an irrevocable letter of credit providing for payment without question once the following terms were met  presentation of a simple receipt and  notification from the seattle bank that certain documents had been negotiated both conditions were admittedly fulfilled the duties of a bank under a letter of credit are created by the document itself the bank being deprived of any discretion not granted therein but in any case the bank has the power and is subject to the limitations which are given and imposed by this authority if it keeps within the powers conferred it is protected in the payment of the draft if it transgresses those limitations it pays at its peril a customer having the right to prescribe and phrase limitations as he desires it it our duty to give to language its ordinary and sensible meaning which will neither destroy the protection which the customer has exacted nor on the other hand impose upon the bank some obligation not fairly warranted by the language which has been adopted by the parties laudisi v american exchange nat bank  ny    ne    plaintiff seeks to impose a further duty on bankers to go beyond the terms of the letter of credit and investigate the fraud being attempted against plaintiff but as chief judge hiscock points out in laudisi the bank is not obliged to assume the burdens of a controversy between the vendor and vendee and incur the responsibility of establishing as an excuse for not paying a draft that the vendees version is the correct one  ny    n e   see also omeara co v national park bank  ny   ne   alr   plaintiff cites but one case to support its position sztejn v schroder banking corp  misc   nysd  supct nyco that case involved a suit to restrain payment of a letter of credit and to have it declared null and void because it was alleged the seller had engaged in a scheme to defraud the buyer no doubt dulien could have used this case as authority for an action seeking to restrain bankers from paying sica but here bankers never had notice of the type of fraud sztejn seems to require duliens own behavior was indicative more of one merely suspicious of than one certain of fraud the rule in new york seems well established that a bank issuing or confirming a letter of credit is not concerned with the underlying contract between the buyer and seller in the absence of appropriate provisions in the letter of credit imbrie v nagase  co ltd  appdiv    nys   d dept  asbury park  ocean grove bank v national city bank of new york  nysd  supct nyco  affd  appdiv  st dept  it appears that sometime prior to september  dulien and marco polo agreed to amend the letter of credit to reduce the amount to  and in other respects dulien and seattle bank had some discussion of this but did not discuss any of this with bankers trust the original letter of credit expired on september   dulien could have caused to be issued a new letter of credit with the new terms agreed to by marco polo and with a new beneficiary if it so chose instead dulien on october   extended the expiration date of the original letter of credit to october   in extending the expiration date to october   bankers trust was instructed all of the terms and conditions are unchanged by this letter thus dulien placed upon bankers an almost absolute legal duty to pay sica upon demand whatever loss dulien suffered was not from the negligence of bankers trust the fact that dulien may have been beguiled into the extension by marco polo does not alter this conclusion dulien should have been put on guard by such conduct and taken action to protect itself beyond reliance upon an unjustified expectation that the party with the least knowledge of the transaction and the greatest obligation to pay would violate its legal duty as judge bryan stated this action is a belated attempt to shift duliens loss to a party who has no responsibility therefor ii there was no contract between plaintiff and defendant all of duliens negotiations were with seattle bank faced with this admitted lack of privity of contract between dulien and bankers trust plaintiffs second ground for relief is an effort to spell out either equitable or promissory estoppel the estoppel is said to arise from the action of the defendant in asking seattle bank may we pay and alleged belief of plaintiff that bankers trust would not pay dulien relies on the exchange of telegrams between bankers trust and seattle bank during the period from october   to october   there were no communications between bankers trust and dulien and therefore no representations by bankers trust to dulien in an effort to offset this absence of the requisite privity dulien asserts that seattle bank was its agent since seattle bank issued the letter of credit at its request the law is to the contrary kingdom of sweden v new york trust co  misc    nysd  supct nyco  the only fact in dispute is whether or not a last minute telephone call from bankers trust to seattle bank notifying them it was going to pay was transmitted to dulien by seattle bank whether or not this happened is of no significance here assuming arguendo that the contents of bankers wires to seattle were communicated to dulien they were not sufficient to justify a belief that payment would not be made it is true that bankers trust asked seattle to instruct in one telegram and may we pay in another nowhere is there any language for seattle or dulien to assume that bankers trust would not pay after all of the conditions had been met the amendments proposed by dulien had been rejected by sica and sica was demanding payment certainly bankers trust could not have been expected to subject itself to a lawsuit by sica on its firm obligation to pay without even an offer of indemnification seattle bank and dulien were aware of bankers trusts duty to pay sica indeed seatle went so far as to obtain indemnification for itself from dulien against loss or damage resulting from a rejection of the demand to pay this act however cannot be attributed to bankers and bankers cannot be responsible for whatever erroneous beliefs it may have created on duliens part bankers in fact neither requested nor received indemnification plaintiff again relies only upon sztejn v schroder banking corp  misc   nysd  supct nyco  this case merely supports duliens right to seek an injunction restraining payment to sica on the part of a bank otherwise obligated to do so but this is exactly what dulien failed to do there is no estoppel here there was no promise and it is therefore impossible to spell out promissory estoppel there is no equitable estoppel because there could be no valid reliance on an assumption that bankers trust would breach an enforceable obligation to pay sica affirmed footnotes  an affidavit by the assistant manager of the seattle banks foreign department is to the effect that before payment was made he received a telephone call from bankers vice president sime who told him that bankers would pay sica since all the conditions on the original credit had been met while there appears to be a dispute as to whether seattle advised dulien of the call we agree with judge bryan that it makes no difference here comment your name your email comments  characters remaining

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
