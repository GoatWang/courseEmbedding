syracuse and the st louis area dont have much in commondig a little deeper and theres deandre smith the running backs coach for the orangeits a bit of a surprise to see syracuse pop up on the list of schools area players are considering because it wasnt a place that had received much attention before but smith who went to university city for three years and finished at berkeley high before playing at missouri state plans to have a big presence  this season was the first in upstate new york after coaching stops at the university of nevada las vegas illinois new mexico and northern illinoisst louis kids fit our profile smith said good football players who are tough  smith spent about six weekends in the area mining for prospects and found a good one in treevon prater of east st louis the year before even with a late start area players mitch kimble a quarterback from jerseyville and corey winfield a wide receiver from riverview gardens inked with the orange smith says the orange plan to play prater at the cornerback he had seven interceptions for the flyers as a senior and made  tackles he also scored eight touchdowns as a wideoutright now we like him at db smith said hes what we call a threefer — a kid who can play three different positions hes very talented and his defensive ball skills fit the scheme we wantlisted at foot and pounds prater is a goodsized corner but still has the speed to stick at the position if he adds some size he would slot well at safetywere very glad to have him we hope it starts a trend well sell the things we feel make this university unique

room like a vintage side table while it’s certainly not the elephant in the room we’ll leave that business to the sofa vintage side tables are an easy way to plug a space with texture and score extra storage space in the process and who doesn’t love that perfect for housing drinks and table lamps vintage side tables also known as accent tables or end tables befriend club chairs effortlessly and add supreme function to a couch although they often come in matching sets be aware that pairs do have a knack for making a room look overtly formal so if scarlett o’hara isn’t your muse and you favor a bohemian or shabby chic vibe try mixing and matching used side tables by sticking to a similar color palette and general sense of scale it’s surprisingly easy to nail a look that looks expertly curated prior to buying it’s also wise to consider how a vintage end table will be used oftentimes—and especially if storage is a must—a vintage accent table can be fashioned out of an unexpected item below we’ve broken down some types of vintage side tables to consider including some objects that might not be traditionally considered pick your sides nesting tables ah the nesting table maybe it’s their sweet and homey name or the fact that they feel undeniably bogolike but these dainty tables pull at our heartstrings typically consisting of a larger table that houses one or two smaller tables in its canopy vintage nesting tables come in all styles ranging from english traditional to contemporary these theatrical tables are perfect for grand sofas that would easily dwarf a more petite side table or spacepressed interiors where a coffee table might not be in the cards pull the smallest of your nesters from its pack and place in front of the sofa for an instant cocktail table bar cart true the average side table can butler a drink just dandy but by upgrading to a bar cart you’ll have all of your spirits within arm’s reach too in addition to holding your bottles bar carts are also an excellent place to stow pretty coffee table books or magazines best yet most bar carts have rails surrounding each shelf making them ideal for minimizing party mishaps nightstand when you figure that nightstands stand alert on either side of the bed quite impressively why not translate them to the living room nightstands typically come equipped with drawers or an interior cabinet which colors them perfect for relaxed living rooms that double as playrooms one imperative to keep in mind when using a vintage nightstand scale nightstands tend to be blockier than your average vintage accent table so ensure that you’re not overpowering your other furniture by measuring twice and buying once to help aid your search keep an eye out for leggy nightstands the longer a table’s legs the less likely it will be to add mass to a sofa garden stool bring the outdoors in with a vintage garden stool these versatile stools—usually crafted of ceramic—are essential for a room in need of a bolt of color we love the look of a deep turquoisewashed stool next to a clean white sofa though cobalt blue or red would work magic as well garden stools might not offer up a bounty of surface space but fanciful details like cutouts and textural hobnails make them serious room jewelry as a bonus they also can double as seating make it your own with instaworthy details once you’ve decided on your side table it’s time to layer on the details we’re talking the obvious—lamps—and the notso obvious—ever notice that an end table is the perfect place to lean a smallscale painting other items we love are coasters stacked at the ready opt for coasters with pretty finished rims to ensure that they look just as great stacked as they do laid out for mugs of tea candles and greenery alternatively a large bone or lucite tray that’s flush with your accent table’s top can make protecting a precious surface like wood or marble terrifically easy while also providing a glamorous touch and lastly adding a

room like a vintage side table while it’s certainly not the elephant in the room we’ll leave that business to the sofa vintage side tables are an easy way to plug a space with texture and score extra storage space in the process and who doesn’t love that perfect for housing drinks and table lamps vintage side tables also known as accent tables or end tables befriend club chairs effortlessly and add supreme function to a couch although they often come in matching sets be aware that pairs do have a knack for making a room look overtly formal so if scarlett o’hara isn’t your muse and you favor a bohemian or shabby chic vibe try mixing and matching used side tables by sticking to a similar color palette and general sense of scale it’s surprisingly easy to nail a look that looks expertly curated prior to buying it’s also wise to consider how a vintage end table will be used oftentimes—and especially if storage is a must—a vintage accent table can be fashioned out of an unexpected item below we’ve broken down some types of vintage side tables to consider including some objects that might not be traditionally considered pick your sides nesting tables ah the nesting table maybe it’s their sweet and homey name or the fact that they feel undeniably bogolike but these dainty tables pull at our heartstrings typically consisting of a larger table that houses one or two smaller tables in its canopy vintage nesting tables come in all styles ranging from english traditional to contemporary these theatrical tables are perfect for grand sofas that would easily dwarf a more petite side table or spacepressed interiors where a coffee table might not be in the cards pull the smallest of your nesters from its pack and place in front of the sofa for an instant cocktail table bar cart true the average side table can butler a drink just dandy but by upgrading to a bar cart you’ll have all of your spirits within arm’s reach too in addition to holding your bottles bar carts are also an excellent place to stow pretty coffee table books or magazines best yet most bar carts have rails surrounding each shelf making them ideal for minimizing party mishaps nightstand when you figure that nightstands stand alert on either side of the bed quite impressively why not translate them to the living room nightstands typically come equipped with drawers or an interior cabinet which colors them perfect for relaxed living rooms that double as playrooms one imperative to keep in mind when using a vintage nightstand scale nightstands tend to be blockier than your average vintage accent table so ensure that you’re not overpowering your other furniture by measuring twice and buying once to help aid your search keep an eye out for leggy nightstands the longer a table’s legs the less likely it will be to add mass to a sofa garden stool bring the outdoors in with a vintage garden stool these versatile stools—usually crafted of ceramic—are essential for a room in need of a bolt of color we love the look of a deep turquoisewashed stool next to a clean white sofa though cobalt blue or red would work magic as well garden stools might not offer up a bounty of surface space but fanciful details like cutouts and textural hobnails make them serious room jewelry as a bonus they also can double as seating make it your own with instaworthy details once you’ve decided on your side table it’s time to layer on the details we’re talking the obvious—lamps—and the notso obvious—ever notice that an end table is the perfect place to lean a smallscale painting other items we love are coasters stacked at the ready opt for coasters with pretty finished rims to ensure that they look just as great stacked as they do laid out for mugs of tea candles and greenery alternatively a large bone or lucite tray that’s flush with your accent table’s top can make protecting a precious surface like wood or marble terrifically easy while also providing a glamorous touch and lastly adding a lidded basket or lacquer box to hide those unsightly remotes— well that’s just ingenious read more products  gsk gsk ellipta inhaler production line ware uk products we make a wide range of

for endusers sisense represents what a bi company should be intuitive and scaleable for large sets of data linkedintweet itvaluable features time to deployment was one of our most critical factors in choosing a bi vendor and i am not sure you can get to deployment faster than sisense on day one i was able to download it connect two disparate data sources with multiple tables and build meaningful dashboards other features that i found very valuable query speed querying a data source with more than  million records took on average less than  seconds after initial load speed of development it took less than a month to configure single sign on be fully embedded within our web product and to build a comprehensive data cube that covered all of our metrics ease of use for endusers building meaningful dashboards is no longer an it task sisense has done a great job at not over complicating dashboard building improvements to my organization we are no longer in the business of report changes and making a slight change to a report for a specific customer sisense is already reducing our development workload since customers are building their own reports instead of waiting on us room for improvement users with viewer access have less capabilities than similar users in tableau for example data discovery would be difficult with only a viewer license sisense limits the cube building to a very visual display that can get hard to analyze when you bring in many data sources it would be nice to have either an advanced view or alternate view that helps with many tables they do not currently have support for r but i hear that is coming in  use of solution about  months deployment issues none stability issues none so far scalability issues not yet but we did just start rolling this out customer service excellent i am confident i will receive a response within the same day and usually much sooner than that technical support technical support has been superb we had a fairly complicated security implementation and they helped guide our developers through all the nuances previous solutions we previously were on pentaho and we switched because we needed an easier platform to develop on building complex dashboards required a great deal of training and pentaho experience initial setup the initial setup could not have been any easier implementation team inhouse other solutions considered qlik and tableau other advice the sales process was excellent we opted to do a proof of concept and we were able to test all of our requested functionality prior to buying the product they also guided us through the proof of concept and offered a great deal of support the sales process was one of the best sales experiences we went through our customers love the product when
