exchange commission filing including our annual report on form k filed on december   central undertakes no obligation to publicly update these forwardlooking statements to reflect new information subsequent events or otherwise now ill turn the call over to john ranelli john john ranelli thank you steve good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us today after a very strong year in  in which we grew our adjusted earnings per share by over  we have hit the ground running in the first fiscal quarter of  both our garden and pet businesses outperformed on the top line and in operating profits for the quarter revenue grew  approximately half organic and half from acquisitions we earned an adjusted  per share for the quarter versus a loss of  per share in last years first quarter it was the first time in  years that consolidated earnings for the first fiscal quarter on an adjusted basis were positive this was above our expectation and was our eighth consecutive quarter of yearoveryear adjusted earnings growth our results indicate that our strategy and plan are right and working we are well along in achieving three key objectives first we are starting to demonstrate the potential of centrals operating leverage by increasing gross profits significantly more than sga second we are growing organically and demonstrating centrals organic growth potential and third we have shown our willingness and ability to manage and improve our portfolio by making accretive acquisition and divesting nonstrategic assets the central of today is very different than three years ago our plan when i joined in february  as ceo was to focus on our customers get our operations in order reduce costs increase earnings and then shift to top line growth our organic growth and acquisitions along with our lower cost structure have helped us produce adjusted profits in our latest fourth and first quarters this compares to losses we have incurred in those quarters over the last several years the progress we have made operationally over the last few years has enabled central to place increasing focus on growing revenues organically the revenue gains we have seen over the last several quarters reflect these efforts they include gaining distribution by focusing on our customers and improving our sales efforts developing new products faster increasing shelf space by providing superior customer service and becoming more competitive by lowering production cost in addition to our organic growth we recently closed several acquisitions at reasonable multiples after years of minimal activity these acquisitions are in growing categories that we know well we expect them to be accretive in the near term we acquired ims a producer of rawhide chews and treats about six months ago it is outperforming our expectations and is already accretive our most recent acquisition is dmc which is the largest producer of pet bedding in the united states we acquired this business in december of  and we expect it to be accretive in  we believe managing our portfolio is a key determinant of our future growth potential so at the same time that we are adding strategically important businesses we are also exiting categories whose growth dynamics are unfavorable or where we do not have a competitive advantage for example in early january  we exited our seasonal décor business which consisted of artificial christmas trees and other holiday décor products in addition to strengthening our portfolio we continue to actively manage cost over the last three years we substantially reduced our expenses while making the necessary investments to grow our businesses organically in the years ahead the results are reflected in our organic sales and profit increases together all of these actions make central a stronger company and give us confidence that we can produce sustainable revenue and profit growth as we go forward from a capital structure perspective we are wellpositioned as we decreased our leverage ratio from  times to  times we are investing on a strong cash flow and growth initiatives in the first quarter we refinanced  million of fixed rate debt extending the final maturity to  and saving  million in interest expense per year excluding onetime charges in addition as of the end of the first quarter we had approximately  million available on our assetbased line of credit key to the recent progress is the breadth and strength of our management sales and finance teams in each of our businesses they oversee the day to day operations including manufacturing marketing and sales my successor will be able to count on these dedicated and talented members of the central team to facilitate a smooth transition when i step down as ceo later this year our board continues to work hard on identifying ceo candidate that can build on the success that we are now achieving we are confident that we will have a strong leader in place to continue on our strategy and work alongside the management teams in our business unit i would like to take a minute to thank david chichester for stepping in as acting cfo his leadership and guidance over the past six months were invaluable at a time when central was busy refinancing its debt and making acquisitions we look forward to continuing to work with him in this board capacity now before i make some final comments i would like to turn the call over to howard machek our chief accounting officer who will review our financial results howard has  years of experience at central howard machek thank you john good afternoon everyone we issued a press release earlier today outlining our first quarter financial results id like to spend some time giving you some additional details around those results as john mentioned earlier the company recorded adjusted earnings of  per diluted share for the first quarter the adjusted numbers exclude the impact of  million in charges related to the refinancing of our fixed rate debt in november  ill go into the details of those charges a little bit later as a reminder the majority of our garden season spans our second and third fiscal quarters which have historically been the highest quarters for revenues and profits for our company our first quarter is typically the lowest revenue quarter due to seasonality of the garden business consolidated sales for the quarter increased  versus the prior year to  million due in part to strong organic growth and recent acquisitions especially in the pet business consolidated gross profit dollars rose  and our gross margin decreased  basis points to  sga expense for the quarter increased  or  million versus a year ago but as a percent of sales declined  basis points versus the prior year to  we benefited from greater utilization of our fixed resources due the higher sales volume during the quarter operating income for the quarter rose to  million compared to the  million a year ago our operating margin of  was up  basis points compared with the same period last year turning now to the pet segment pet segment sales for the quarter increased nearly  or  million to  million the inclusion of three months of our ims division and one month of our dmc division accounted for a little over half the sales increase in addition the dog  cat aquatics and equine businesses all had sizeable organic percentage increases versus the prior year sales of other manufacturer’s products were also up significantly pet segment operating income increased  million or  compared to the prior year although we had a lower gross margin operating margin rose  basis points to  on a favorable mix shift towards a higher percentage of dog  cat sale inclusive of our new acquisition and a lower percentage of sales of other manufacturer’s products while the profile of the recent acquisitions we made in the dog  cat category have lower gross margins they also have lower sga as a percentage of sales than our historical dog  cat category moving to garden for the quarter garden segment sales rose  or  million to  million grass seed revenues and higher sales of other manufacturer’s products aided organic growth the inclusion of almost three months of sales from our hydro organics acquisition also was a factor gardens operating loss improved  to  million and operating margin increased  basis points the improvement in both operating profit and margin were driven by smaller losses in grass seed and control as well as lower losses from the sale of other manufacturer’s products during this offseason period moving back to our consolidated results net interest expense increased  million from the prior year to  million due to onetime charges associated with the refinancing of our fixed rate debt in the first quarter we redeemed  million of  senior subordinated fixed rate notes and replaced them with a like amount of  senior unsecured notes the charges in the quarter which are reflected on the interest expense line consisted of  million for the payment of the call premium of the redeemed note  for the  days of overlapping interest payments and  million noncash charge for the writeoff of unamortized finances costs we expect the refinancing to save us an annualized  million in interest savings going forward excluding the impact of the refinancing interest expense for the quarter declined  million to  million our adjusted net income for the quarter was  and adjusted diluted earnings per share was  compared to a loss of  million or  a share in the first quarter of  regarding our income statement and balance sheet for the quarter cash flow used by operations was approximately  million compared to cash provided by operations of  million in the first quarter a year ago the companys inventory balance rose  million from a year ago to support increasing sales and from the impact related to the ims dmc and hydro organics acquisitions capex was  million versus  million in the first quarter of  depreciation and amortization for the quarter was  million up from  million a year ago cash and equivalents and shortterm investments decreased to  million from  million a year ago the decrease reflects the three acquisitions we made over the past  months at a cost of approximately  million as well as the redemption of  million of longterm fixed rate debt in the second quarter of  our total debt decreased  million from  million a year earlier our leverage ratio at quarter end declined  times down from  times last year and includes the impact from the three acquisitions at quarter end there was  million available under our assetbased credit facility as our focus is to invest in growth during the quarters we did not repurchase any of our outstanding stock and approximately  million remains available under the boardapproved stock repurchase program now ill turn it back over to john for some closing comments before we go to qa john ranelli thank you howard to summarize we feel very good about our performance where central is today and where it is going we are seeing better than expected success in growing revenues and profits organically as well as through acquisitions the progress on our strategy is on track results this quarter exceeded our expectations please keep in mind that the first quarter is typically our smallest we have our largest two quarters ahead of us with all the vagaries of weather including whatever el niño might bring still we are off to a great start and feel very positive about  we are now more comfortable with our projection for the year and are increasing our guidance for adjusted eps to  or higher representing at least a  increase over the prior year now we would be happy to answer any of your questions with howard and me on the call today are david chichester niko lahanas senior vice president of finance operations and reporting and jd walker evp and general manager of our garden brands operator please open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of brian nagel from oppenheimer please proceed with your question john ranelli hello brian brian nagel congratulations on a really nice quarter john ranelli thank you howard machek thank you brian nagel a couple questions first off just on weather weve all talked about weather wild weather lately i think you called it out in your comments that the garden segment benefits from somewhat from weather so i guess the question there is is there a way to quantify recognizing this as small quarter for garden but how much garden did benefit and then the followup to that is is if given the warmer temperatures we had for a while in the northeast which you benefited from does that  are those sales completely incremental or could they potentially pull sales in from future periods the next couple quarters or so and then ill ask another question jd walker hi brian this is jd walker ill be glad to address that question so im assuming youre speaking to q of this year and our portfolio if you look at our portfolio some segments of the portfolio are going to benefit from the milder than normal temperatures in q so our controls business and our grass seed business certainly benefited in q and we exited q with lower than normal inventories at retail so we feel like the sales were incremental sales and wont subtract from our upcoming season at the same time brian you have to look at our full portfolio so we have wild bird food business that actually benefits from a harsher winter conditions so while it benefited us in certain segments of our business there were other businesses that like wild bird where the pos was actually negatively impacted brian nagel got it thats really helpful and then the second question i have also on the garden segment looking at your press release and there was a comment i think john you were quoted in there saying youve made significant progress but theres still a lot of work to do particularly in the garden segment is there something specific with what youre referencing there or is that some specific fixture youre thinking about that we could start looking towards for that segment of the business jd walker brian this is jd again so i cant share any specifics with you but id say this in general when john started the resetting process  years ago in turning our businesses around he started first with pet and he spent the first year working with pet id say theyre further along the continuum than the garden segment of our business weve made great strides on the garden side of the business and i think our results you know speak for themselves last year was our second most profitable year but weve spent time in getting our operating rhythm improving our operating rhythm and focusing on operating profit so thats what weve done over the  and id say that our house isnt fully in order we have more work to be done there were working through that and as we continue to make progress then well shift outer attention to growth initiatives brian nagel got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of william reuter from bank of america please proceed with your question unidentified analyst hi this is jen in for bill today thanks for taking my questions could you perhaps elaborate on what caused the decline in both the garden and pet segments gross margins and the extent of the decline in each business howard machek sure this is howard speaking ill lead off the last two fiscal years remember our gross margin has improved also this quarter absent the impact of our acquisitions our gross net – our gross margin yearoveryear was relatively flat so our recent acquisitions have a different profile than our historical business as such they have a lower gross margin but they also have a lower sga as a percentage of sales they are still kicking off good operating profit so gross margin is just one of the indicators were focused on gross profit dollars and constantly trying to find that proper balance between gross margin and gross profit dollars unidentified analyst great thanks and then you also mentioned that strength in the pet segment was partially driven by organic growth in the dog cat and aquatic categories could you perhaps talk about what drove that strength in the quarter niko lahanas sure this is niko lahanas what drove the strength in that category were the two acquisitions they were both in dog  cat but then also our treats business where we had you know uptick in sales across a number of channels pet specialty the club channels indiscernible across the board really good quarter for our treats business the aquatics business really same thing very strong in the pet specialty channels due to our dollar a gallon promotions that continued on also had strength in the other channels as well so a lot of good breadth as far as growth within those two categories unidentified analyst great thank you and then last one from me on the last call you mentioned you were willing to temporarily take leverage to the top of three to four times range for a few months for the right acquisition now has this leverage target changed at all john ranelli no our leverage targets have not changed we feel very comfortable about where we are and we feel very comfortable about what our targets are for the future to provide the maximum amount of the earnings given the leverage ratio unidentified analyst great thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of bill chappell from suntrust please proceed with your question unidentified analyst hi this is actually stephanie on for bill i guess kind of looking at it your organic growth certainly outperformed this quarter so just trying to get a gage on what your outlook for organic growth is for the rest of the year not necessarily percentage terms but just kind of how sustainable these levels are going forward howard machek so stephanie ill speak for garden first then ill turn it over to niko in terms of growth for the rest of the year typically thats not something we disclose at the meeting i will say this though we do anticipate some headwinds on the garden side of the business we mentioned that we exited our seasonal décor business we also decided not renew a private label contract where we were producing professional fertilizers for a customer neither of those businesses were profitable so while we anticipate some headwinds on the top line it will have little to no effect on our bottom line but which keeps us on strategy of you know looking at our portfolio exiting unprofitable skews or businesses and focusing on operating profits niko lahanas this is niko on the pet side you know we go into every year thinking were going to really grow organically so the first quarter was you know we really knocked the cover off the ball so we feel very good about that is that kind of growth sustainable we dont know yet were going to have to look and really monitor pos things like that to see if thats really sustainable our intent would be to keep pushing the business and keep growing we feel very optimistic about the year we love where we are right now and just looking forward to really producing a very very strong year unidentified analyst got it no thats definitely really helpful and then also just quickly on kind of back to garden scott reported earlier today so kind of stronger top line growth so wondering if you guys lost any share there during the quarter jd walker stephanie its jd again so ill speak to that i saw their announcement without making a lot of comments about the competition ill tell you that its difficult for us to get to an organic number there because i believe that they had a change in the timing of their quarter six additional days and there were some acquisitions that were included in there as well but even if we can get past that to try to normalize that its still comparing its not applestoapples we compete in a couple of categories like wild bird feed and décor and we have a distribution business and scott competes in the soils and mulch categories where we dont compete so we dont match up headtohead but what i will say is in those areas where we do overlap grass seed fertilizers and controls were confident that we held or took share in each of those categories unidentified analyst got it no thats very helpful thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of karru martinson from deutsche bank please proceed with your question karru martinson good afternoon when you guys look at the dallas manufacturing company dmc what was the penetration kind of their product i mean is there a lot of opportunity for you guys to kind of quickly expand the distribution or is this going to be kind of a you know a multistep process to grow the business niko lahanas yes this is niko great question yes they  when we bought the business theyve got a fair amount of concentration in their top call it a customers with our distribution business we see a fair amount of opportunities to take product and penetrate the independent channel we also see growth happening in existing customer base as well which is what made the business really attractive to us when we started to look at it so kind of how the twopronged approach going on there karru martinson okay and just when you look at the customer base on the pet side in two of the large big box guys now you know in private equity hands i mean is anything changing on that market you guys called out growth on the online business but is that industry kind of still stable and its still having the kind of the growth characteristics that you guys have seen in the past niko lahanas yes i mean i were to comment i would say it’s stable there is always challenges and there is always change going on youve got amazon coming into the fray walmarts doing their thing in youve got the two ps ph youre seeing more private label so all of that kind of is that work we have to find ways to work within and navigate that environment but we feel like were doing all of it fairly well right now by participating in private labels as well as building our brand were seeing our ecommerce business grow and were seeing our business grow within the pets market pet co ph franchise karru martinson okay and just lastly as you guys invest on the brand i mean certainly getting a return on that investment but when you look at that investment versus share buybacks how should we think about it going forward i mean is there a point in time where you know one outweighs the other or where is other metrics we should look at there howard machek could you repeat your question again karru martinson when we think about investing in the brands versus you know share buybacks you guys have held off on buying back shares i mean how do you make that decision how much more investment do you guys need before you return to buying back shares john ranelli well our whole strategy is to invest in growth and so buying  repurchasing shares is not our priority right now what were doing with our capital is were investing in the working capital necessary to grow not only our brands but our private label business so i feel very comfortable that that is going on we are also investing in sga and gross to net side and getting increased returns primarily by investing in the store which we hadnt done as much as we had before and thirdly were investing our capital expenditures and our lowcost producer program and that program is a little bit of a misnomer because the whole concept behind low cost producer is that we want to own the markets that we believe are important to us and to be able to defend them and the way to do that is to be able to come up with the lowest possible costs so we can manufacture so we can invest in product development invest in additional promotions invest in additional displays invest in better packaging et cetera so essentially thats where our organic growth money is being spent as well as you can see and howard outlined we invested a significant amount in acquisitions over the last six months those acquisitions are very important to our growth strategy and the expansion of our company into adjacent categories we feel very comfortable with the acquisitions that theyve made  that weve made and that im very happy that they are essentially going to be accretive in the first year so all in all thats where we are directing our money again growth is our key objective both organic and acquisition karru martinson thank you very much guys i appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of gregg hillman from first wilshire securities management please proceed with your question gregg hillman yes good afternoon gentlemen great quarter yes my first question concerns the goal for the operating margin in the pet area i know when smucker bought big heart in i think march of last year it was doing like  ebitda margin and i think you were like  in the quarter you just reported for pet do you think the midpoint between those two numbers is a good goal for pet margin operating margin niko lahanas this is niko as far as a goal we dont really have a stated goal on operating margin i think we just try to do  get as high as we can in a given year the area where were always a little bit and i hate to use the word hamstrung but we have a distribution business that sits within pet and it does a fair amount of revenue and the margins there are south of  so typical distribution margins we have you know strategic reasons for keeping that business within pet but that typically tends to dilute the margin percent in pet so its a little bit of an apple and orange comparison gregg hillman okay and then moving right along to nylabone i notice that you seemed to increase your sales space in nylabone that seems to be doing really good can you talk about that and how will help that and also whether youre coming out with any innovative products in nylabone that will help improve the dog cleaning their teeth and bad breath in dogs niko lahanas yes nylabone is without a doubt our strongest brand in pet it continues to take shelf space in a number of channels the nylabone management team is one of our strongest teams that we have within pet and the thing they do really well is innovate so you can always look for continuous innovation new products coming out of there as far as you know our overall pet product pipeline usually its nylabone that dominates the amount of new products out there gregg hillman okay great and then finally could you comment on online you know sales on pet items like you know for pet items in the united states what percentage is online right now and is there any like limits in terms of what you can sell in that channel or is like the sky the limit on there niko lahanas there is certain products that have a better online profile because typically the online products get shift – get picked and pack as an each ingot ph shift and individual home so typically the higher dollar volume lower q ph pet product tend to do better for an online type of purchase the heavy bulky high q low value items would be a little tougher to do so we kind of have a little bit of both if you look at one of our better selling online items is our comfort zone behavior modification product that does extremely online that is kind of a high ticket item type product i think that you know there were lot of things to consider in terms of when youre growing online i just outlined a bunch but the other piece of it is the frustration free packaging and all the other stuff that goes along with chipping things to the mail gregg hillman right do you have a number right now what percentage of the pet industry is online right now niko lahanas we don’t… gregg hillman its less than  i would think niko lahanas we dont disclose our sales metric howard machek well total retail… gregg hillman i mean for the industry niko lahanas yes i dont have that number handy right now as far as the pet industry how much is online gregg hillman all right okay thanks for your comments operator our next question comes from the line of grant jordan from wells fargo please proceed with your question grant jordan thanks for taking the questions i just have two followups one i think there was a reference to some headwinds in the garden segment i was just wanting to make sure is that related to some of the programs youre discontinuing or is that something else jd walker grant this is jd so that related exactly to programs that were discontinuing so its the seasonal décor business that were exiting and its the  our decision not renew a contract on the private label business professional fertilizer it was just not profitable any longer so to be clear its top line headwinds only we see no impact to our bottom line niko lahanas and this is all part of our portfolio management strategy to improve our profits in the long haul grant jordan okay yes thats kind of what i thought i just wanted to confirm so thats helpful and then second i know youve talked a little bit about the succession plan and management search is there any sort of timeline you guys are working with niko lahanas the timetable that we outlined in our last call is – it continues we feel very comfortable with the timeline grant jordan okay thanks operator operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of hale holden from barclays please proceed with your question hale holden thank you for taking the call i appreciate it i just had three quick ones in terms of the portfolio rationalization is that something we should consider as just sort of exiting underperforming skews of business lines like seasonal and the private label fertilizer or is it potentially something where you consider heading off more significant assets niko lahanas i think its just our commitment to looking at our portfolio and any underperforming segments of our portfolio to make sure that were fully optimizing the portfolio i think that thats the direction weve moved in its the first time weve made a move like this in some period of time john ranelli we believe that the allocation of our portfolio and the structure of our portfolio is probably just as in your personal portfolio the biggest factor or the biggest driver towards your return so we are taking an active approach in looking at our portfolio adding growing businesses such as dmc and ims and also hydro organics so we feel comfortable that our whole strategy is to turn our portfolio into higher performing assets so that we can increase our company sales and returns over the future niko lahanas and to johns point weve spent an awful lot of time trying to turn some of those businesses around now its time for us to focus our time and energy and our capital on our core assets our core businesses to grow those john ranelli i would add that it is always our first choice to spend or invest or capital in growing our current businesses because thats the most immediate return so i dont want people to think that were challenging every business in our portfolio were not were just essentially evaluating our portfolio on our growth brands and looking at them strategically going forward our first goal is to improve all of our current businesses and then our second goal is to add other businesses to our portfolio that are growing hale holden understood and as a followup to grants question on the management timeline is i just want to make sure i understood the sequence are you  is the board trying to fill the ceo role and then let the new ceo kind of pick the cfo or is it being one kind of coterminous john ranelli i think i would change the words a little bit you know obviously our top priority is to find you know the best ceo to continue our plans that we believe are working well and then well fit into our operating philosophy into our culture and we would like to have him be able to participate in the selection of a cfo so i think that is more along the timelines that youre referring hale holden yes i was fairly not particulate in that so thank you for the followup or clarity and then the final question is a lot of discussion about whether  and i was wondering if you were seeing any change in order patterns for sort of spring orders or shell sets from your retail partners or is it sort of normal ordering and then well just see what the weather brings i didn’t know if the last couple months had changed kind of some of your customers perception where the spring might set niko lahanas no i think that in general our customers are still very bullish on the upcoming season and they are setting their stores for the upcoming lawn and garden season now all three of the big three depots also walmart had a fiscal year that ended at the end of january so you see a little bit slower but this is annually we see this a little bit slower ordering patterns in january and picks up significantly in february but we have a reason to believe that all three of the big three and our independent channel our national accounts everyone is looking forward to the season and will set their stores accordingly so they will be ready for business when the season breaks hale holden great thank you very much for the time i appreciate it operator the next question comes from the line of carla casella from jpmorgan please proceed with your question carla casella hi on the categories you exited should we see a cash flow in this current quarter from any inventory liquidation or is there any asset sales proceeds from it john ranelli i think most of the cash flow as we were reducing our inventory levels probably came in the first quarter of the year the actual transaction took place in the second quarter of the year but the majority of the cash flow came in the first quarter carla casella okay great all my other questions have been answered john ranelli thank you operator operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of kevin ziets from citigroup please proceed with your question kevin ziets hi thanks for taking my question just on the pet bedding business you mention it was the number one market share or leading business in the us im curious what the competitive sets looks like are there other large players in the us or is it you know how does the market share sit relative to maybe international companies and you know just curious niko lahanas sure this is niko yes there are two other fairly large players in the bedding business as well as us now internationally im not aware of any huge player out there but here domestically which is where all of our sales are taking place anyway its pretty much a threehorse race as far as the bedding business goes kevin ziets okay and does share shift very often or have you been growing share over time niko lahanas yes the business has been growing share very aggressively that was again as i mentioned earlier one of the reasons it was so attractive to us was the growth rate there the category overall is growing as well believe it or not its seen more as a consumer category because you have folks now that own multiple beds in a house you know a lot of people have a bed upstairs downstairs in multiple rooms and were seeing… john ranelli my dog has one bed niko lahanas were seeing kind of the purchases the frequency increase as well so its becoming very much a consumer business which again was what made it so attractive to us kevin ziets okay great and then i guess my second question was about the private label fertilizer business you walked away from i know youve talked about private label being important to you in terms of your sort of holistic relationship improving with the retailers and so im just trying to square that with kind of walking away from what might be a somewhat unprofitable program but how you square that against your sort of broader business with those retailers or maybe this is a less significant retailer that you walked away from niko lahanas its a great question the business that we decided it was a professional fertilizer program that’s not with – it wasnt with one of our core retailers so we still feel very much the same way as you outlined with regard to private label its still important to us on the garden side of the business we have a private label businesses in bird feed and controls and fertilizer and grass seed and for all the reasons that you articulated it gives us more critical mass a bigger share of the shelf it drives manufacturing efficiencies which benefits our branded as well so were still very bullish on private label in general its just that one piece of private label for a specific customer that was no longer profitable and we decided to exit kevin ziets okay that makes sense thanks again for taking my questions and good luck this spring niko lahanas thank you john ranelli thank you operator there are no further questions at this time mr would you like to make any close league marks john ranelli no thank you very much for attending our call today we look forward to our next
