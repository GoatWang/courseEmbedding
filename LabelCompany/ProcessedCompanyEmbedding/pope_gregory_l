convert a pagan people to christianity gregory is also well known for his writings which were more prolific than those of any of his predecessors as pope the epithet saint gregory the dialogist has been attached to him in eastern christianity because of his dialogues for this reason english translations of eastern texts will sometimes list him as gregory dialogos or the latinized equivalent dialogus a senators son and himself the prefect of rome at  gregory tried the monastery but soon returned to active public life ending his life and the century as pope although he was the first pope from a monastic background his prior political experiences may have helped him to be a talented administrator who successfully established papal supremacy during his papacy he greatly surpassed with his administration the emperors in improving the welfare of the people of rome and successfully challenged the theological views of patriarch eutychius of constantinople before the emperor tiberius ii gregory regained papal authority in spain and france and sent missionaries to england the realignment of barbarian allegiance to rome from their arian christian alliances shaped medieval europe gregory saw franks lombards and visigoths align with rome in religion throughout the middle ages he was known as the father of christian worship because of his exceptional efforts in revising the roman worship of his day his contributions to the development of the divine liturgy of the presanctified gifts still in use in the byzantine rite were so significant that he is generally recognized as its de facto author gregory is a doctor of the church and one of the latin fathers he is considered a saint in the catholic church eastern orthodox church anglican communion and some lutheran churches

around the year  in the city of rome his parents named him gregorius which according to ælfric of abingdon in an homily on the birthday of s gregory  is a greek name sic which signifies in the latin tongue vigilantius that is in english watchful the medieval writer who provided this etymology did not hesitate to apply it to the life of gregory aelfric states he was very diligent in gods commandments gregory was born into a wealthy patrician roman family with close connections to the church his father gordianus who served as a senator and for a time was the prefect of the city of rome also held the position of regionarius in the church though nothing further is known about that position gregorys mother silvia was wellborn and had a married sister pateria in sicily his mother and two paternal aunts are honored by catholic and orthodox churches as saints gregorys greatgreatgrandfather had been pope felix iii the nominee of the gothic king theodoric gregorys election to the throne of st peter made his family the most distinguished clerical dynasty of the period the family owned and resided in a villa suburbana on the caelian hill fronting the same street now the via di san gregorio as the former palaces of the roman emperors on the palatine hill opposite the north of the street runs into the colosseum the south the circus maximus in gregorys day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned villas covered the area gregorys family also owned working estates in sicily and around rome gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the caelian and these were described  years later by john the deacon gordianus was tall with a long face and light eyes he wore a beard silvia was tall had a round face blue eyes and a cheerful look they had another son whose name and fate are unknown gregory was born into a period of upheaval in italy from  the socalled plague of justinian swept through the provinces of the empire including italy the plague caused famine panic and sometimes rioting in some parts of the country over  of the population was wiped out or destroyed with heavy spiritual and emotional effects on the people of the empire politically although the western roman empire had long since vanished in favour of the gothic kings of italy during the s italy was gradually retaken from the goths by justinian i emperor of the eastern roman empire ruling from constantinople as the fighting was mainly in the north the young gregory probably saw little of it totila sacked and vacated rome in  destroying most of its ancient population but in  he invited those who were still alive to return to the empty and ruined streets it has been hypothesized that young gregory and his parents retired during that intermission to their sicilian estates to return in  the war was over in rome by  and a subsequent invasion of the franks was defeated in  after that there was peace in italy and the appearance of restoration except that the central government now resided in constantinople like most young men of his position in roman society saint gregory was well educated learning grammar rhetoric the sciences literature and law and excelling in all gregory of tours reported that in grammar dialectic and rhetoric  he was second to none he wrote correct latin but did not read or write greek he knew latin authors natural science history mathematics and music and had such a fluency with imperial law that he may have trained in it as a preparation for a career in public life indeed he became a government official advancing quickly in rank to become like his father prefect of rome the highest civil office in the city when only thirtythree years old the monks of the monastery of st andrew established by gregory at the ancestral home on the caelian had a portrait of him made after his death which john the deacon also saw in the th century he reports the picture of a man who was rather bald and had a tawny beard like his fathers and a face that was intermediate in shape between his mothers and fathers the hair that he had on the sides was long and carefully curled his nose was thin and straight and slightly aquiline his forehead was high he had thick subdivided lips and a chin of a comely prominence and beautiful hands in the modern era gregory is often depicted as a man at the border poised between the roman and germanic worlds between east and west and above all perhaps between the ancient and medieval epochs monastic yearsedit jerome and gregory on his fathers death gregory converted his family villa into a monastery dedicated to the apostle saint andrew after his death it was rededicated as san gregorio magno al celio in his life of contemplation gregory concluded that in that silence of the heart while we keep watch within through contemplation we are as if asleep to all things that are without it seems to some that gregory was not always forgiving or pleasant for that matter even in his monastic years for example a monk lying on his death bed confessed to stealing three gold pieces gregory forced the monk to die friendless and alone then threw his body and coins on a manure heap to rot with a curse take your money with you to perdition gregory believed that punishment of sins can begin even on ones deathbed however at the monks death gregory offered  masses in his remembrance to assist his soul before the final judgment eventually pope pelagius ii ordained gregory a deacon and solicited his help in trying to heal the schism of the three chapters in northern italy however this schism was not healed until well after gregory was gone gregory had a deep respect for the monastic life he viewed being a monk as the ardent quest for the vision of our creator his three paternal aunts were nuns renowned for their sanctity however after the two eldest died after seeing a vision of their ancestor pope felix the youngest soon abandoned the religious life and married the steward of her estate gregorys response to this family scandal was many are called but few are chosen gregorys mother silvia herself is a saint apocrisiariate –edit illumination in a thcentury manuscript of a letter of gregorys to saint leander bishop of seville bibl municipale ms  dijon in  pelagius ii chose gregory as his apocrisiarius ambassador to the imperial court in constantinople a post gregory would hold until  gregory was part of the roman delegation both lay and clerical that arrived in constantinople in  to ask the emperor for military aid against the lombards with the byzantine military focused on the east these entreaties proved unsuccessful in  pelagius ii wrote to gregory as apocrisiarius detailing the hardships that rome was experiencing under the lombards and asking him to ask emperor maurice to send a relief force maurice however had long ago determined to limit his efforts against the lombards to intrigue and diplomacy pitting the franks against them it soon became obvious to gregory that the byzantine emperors were unlikely to send such a force given their more immediate difficulties with the persians in the east and the avars and slavs to the north according to ekonomou if gregorys principal task was to plead romes cause before the emperor there seems to have been little left for him to do once imperial policy toward italy became evident papal representatives who pressed their claims with excessive vigor could quickly become a nuisance and find themselves excluded from the imperial presence altogether gregory had already drawn an imperial rebuke for his lengthy canonical writings on the subject of the legitimacy of john iii scholasticus who had occupied the patriarchate of constantinople for twelve years prior to the return of eutychius who had been driven out by justinian gregory turned himself to cultivating connections with the byzantine elite of the city where he became extremely popular with the citys upper class especially aristocratic women ekonomou surmises that while gregory may have become spiritual father to a large and important segment of constantinoples aristocracy this relationship did not significantly advance the interests of rome before the emperor although the writings of john the deacon claim that gregory labored diligently for the relief of italy there is no evidence that his tenure accomplished much towards any of the objectives of pelagius ii gregorys theological disputes with patriarch eutychius would leave a bitter taste for the theological speculation of the east with gregory that continued to influence him well into his own papacy according to western sources gregorys very public debate with eutychius culminated in an exchange before tiberius ii where gregory cited a biblical passage palpate et videte quia spiritus carnem et ossa non habet sicut me videtis habere in support of the view that christ was corporeal and palpable after his resurrection allegedly as a result of this exchange tiberius ii ordered eutychiuss writings burned ekonomou views this argument though exaggerated in western sources as gregorys one achievement of an otherwise fruitless apokrisiariat in reality gregory was forced to rely on scripture because he could not read the untranslated greek authoritative works gregory left constantinople for rome in  returning to his monastery on the caelian hill gregory was elected by acclamation to succeed pelagius ii in  when the latter died of the plague spreading through the city gregory was approved by an imperial iussio

of contemplation he was unwillingly forced back into a world that although he loved he no longer wanted to be a part of in texts of all genres especially those produced in his first year as pope gregory bemoaned the burden of office and mourned the loss of the undisturbed life of prayer he had once enjoyed as a monk when he became pope in  among his first acts was writing a series of letters disavowing any ambition to the throne of peter and praising the contemplative life of the monks at that time for various reasons the holy see had not exerted effective leadership in the west since the pontificate of gelasius i the episcopacy in gaul was drawn from the great territorial families and identified with them the parochial horizon of gregorys contemporary gregory of tours may be considered typical in visigothic spain the bishops had little contact with rome in italy the territories which had de facto fallen under the administration of the papacy were beset by the violent lombard dukes and the rivalry of the byzantines in the exarchate of ravenna and in the south pope gregory had strong convictions on missions almighty god places good men in authority that he may impart through them the gifts of his mercy to their subjects and this we find to be the case with the british over whom you have been appointed to rule that through the blessings bestowed on you the blessings of heaven might be bestowed on your people also he is credited with reenergizing the churchs missionary work among the nonchristian peoples of northern europe he is most famous for sending a mission often called the gregorian mission under augustine of canterbury prior of saint andrews where he had perhaps succeeded gregory to evangelize the pagan anglosaxons of england it seems that the pope had never forgotten the english slaves whom he had once seen in the roman forum the mission was successful and it was from england that missionaries later set out for the netherlands and germany the preaching of nonheretical christian faith and the elimination of all deviations from it was a key element in gregorys worldview and it constituted one of the major continuing policies of his pontificate according to the catholic encyclopedia he was declared a saint immediately after his death by popular acclamation in his official documents gregory was the first to make extensive use of the term servant of the servants of god servus servorum dei as a papal title thus initiating a practice that was to be followed by most subsequent popes worksedit part of a series on catholic

things changing a few adding some in letters gregory remarks that he moved the pater noster our father to immediately after the roman canon and immediately before the fraction this position is still maintained today in the roman liturgy the pregregorian position is evident in the ambrosian rite gregory added material to the hanc igitur of the roman canon and established the nine kyries a vestigial remnant of the litany which was originally at that place at the beginning of mass he also reduced the role of deacons in the roman liturgy sacramentaries directly influenced by gregorian reforms are referred to as sacrementaria gregoriana roman and other western liturgies since this era have a number of prayers that change to reflect the feast or liturgical season these variations are visible in the collects and prefaces as well as in the roman canon itself divine liturgy of the presanctified giftsedit in the eastern orthodox church and eastern catholic churches gregory is credited as the primary influence in constructing the more penitential divine liturgy of the presanctified gifts a fully separate form of the divine liturgy in the byzantine rite adapted to the needs of the season of great lent its roman rite equivalent is the mass of the presanctified used only on good friday the syriac liturgy of the presanctified gifts continues to be used in the malankara rite a variant of the west syrian rite historically practiced in the malankara church of india and now practiced by the several churches that descended from it and at some occasions in the assyrian church of the east gregorian chantedit main article gregorian chant the mainstream form of western plainchant standardized in the late th century was attributed to pope gregory i and so took the name of gregorian chant the earliest such attribution is in john the deacons  biography of gregory almost three centuries after the popes death and the chant that bears his name is the result of the fusion of roman and frankish elements which took place in the francogerman empire under pepin charlemagne and their successors writingsedit saint gregory the great by josé de ribera gregory is commonly credited with founding the medieval papacy and so many attribute the beginning of medieval spirituality to him gregory is the only pope between the fifth and the eleventh centuries whose correspondence and writings have survived enough to form a comprehensive corpus some of his writings are commentary on job frequently known in englishlanguage histories by its latin title magna moralia or as moralia on job this is one of the longest patristic works it was possibly finished as early as  it is based on talks gregory gave on the book of job to his brethren who accompanied him to constantinople the work as we have it is the result of gregorys revision and completion of it soon after his accession to the papal office liber regulae pastoralis book of pastoral rule  the rule for pastors in which he contrasted the role of bishops as pastors of their flock with their position as nobles of the church the definitive statement of the nature of the episcopal office this was probably begun before his election as pope and finished in  dialogues a collection of four books of miracles signs wonders and healings done by the holy men mostly monastic of sixthcentury italy with the second book entirely devoted to a popular life of saint benedict sermons including the sermons include the  homilae in hiezechielem homilies on ezekiel dealing with ezekiel  in book one and ezekiel  in book  these were preached during  the years that the lombards besieged rome and contain some of gregorys most profound mystical teachings they were revised eight years later the homilae xl in evangelia forty homilies on the gospels for the liturgical year delivered during  and  which were seemingly finished by  a papyrus fragment from this codex survives in the british museum london uk expositio in canticis canticorum only  of these sermons on the song of songs survive discussing the text up to song  in librum primum regum expositio commentary on  kings copies of some  letters have survived during gregorys time copies of papal letters were made by scribes into a registrum register which was then kept in the scrinium it is known that in the th century when john the deacon composed his life of gregory the registrum of gregorys letters was formed of  papyrus rolls though it is difficult to estimate how many letters this may have represented though these original rolls are now lost the  letters have survived in copies made at various later times the largest single batch of  letters being made by order of adrian i  the majority of the copies dating from the th to the th century are stored in the vatican library gregory wrote over  letters in the last  years of his life – that give us an accurate picture of his work a truly autobiographical presentation is nearly impossible for gregory the development of his mind and personality remains purely speculative in nature opinions of the writings of gregory vary his character strikes us as an ambiguous and enigmatic one the jewish canadianamerican popularist cantor observed on the one hand he was an able and determined administrator a skilled and clever diplomat a leader of the greatest sophistication and vision but on the other hand he appears in his writings as a superstitious and credulous monk hostile to learning crudely limited as a theologian and excessively devoted to saints miracles and relics controversy with eutychiusedit in constantinople gregory took issue with the aged patriarch eutychius of constantinople who had recently published a treatise now lost on the general resurrection eutychius maintained that the resurrected body will be more subtle than air and no longer palpable gregory opposed with the palpability of the risen christ in luke  as the dispute could not be settled the byzantine emperor tiberius ii constantine undertook to arbitrate he decided in favor of palpability and ordered eutychius book to be burned shortly after both gregory and eutychius became ill gregory recovered but eutychius died on  april  at age  on his deathbed eutychius recanted impalpability and gregory dropped the matter tiberius also died a few months after eutychius identification of three figures in the gospelsedit gregory was among those who identified mary magdalene with mary of bethany whom john  recounts as having anointed jesus with precious ointment an event that some interpret as being the same as the anointing of jesus performed by a woman that luke alone among the synoptic gospels recounts as sinful preaching on the passage in the gospel of luke gregory remarked this woman whom luke calls a sinner and john calls mary i think is the mary from whom mark reports that seven demons were cast out today biblical scholars distinguish the three figures but they are all still popularly identified iconographyedit gregory and his dove corpus christi college cambridge ms  in art gregory is usually shown in full pontifical robes with the tiara and double cross despite his actual habit of dress earlier depictions are more likely to show a monastic tonsure and plainer dress orthodox icons traditionally show st gregory vested as a bishop holding a gospel book and blessing with his right hand it is recorded that he permitted his depiction with a square halo then used for the living a dove is his attribute from the wellknown story attributed to his friend peter the deacon who tells that when the pope was dictating his homilies on ezechiel a curtain was drawn between his secretary and himself as however the pope remained silent for long periods at a time the servant made a hole in the curtain and looking through beheld a dove seated upon gregorys head with its beak between his lips when the dove withdrew its beak the pope spoke and the secretary took down his words but when he became silent the servant again applied his eye to the hole and saw the dove had replaced its beak between his lips this scene is shown as a version of the traditional evangelist portrait where the evangelists symbols are also sometimes shown dictating from the tenth century onwards an early example is the dedication miniature from an eleventhcentury manuscript of saint gregorys moralia in job the miniature shows the scribe bebo of seeon abbey presenting the manuscript to the holy roman emperor henry ii in the upper left the author is seen writing the text under divine inspiration usually the dove is shown whispering in gregorys ear for a clearer composition the anachronistic example at the top of this article is from the studio of carlo saraceni or by a close follower ca  from the giustiniani collection the painting is conserved in the galleria nazionale darte antica rome the face of gregory is a caricature of the features described by john the deacon mentioned under his early life above total baldness outthrust chin beaklike nose where john had described partial baldness a mildly protruding chin slightly aquiline nose and strikingly good looks in this picture also gregory has his monastic back on the world which the real gregory despite his reclusive intent was seldom allowed to have the mass of st gregory by robert campin th century the late medieval subject of the mass of st gregory shows a version of a thcentury story that was elaborated in later hagiography gregory is shown saying mass when christ as the man of sorrows appears on the altar the subject was most common in the th and th centuries and reflected growing emphasis on the real presence and after the protestant reformation was an assertion of the doctrine against protestant theology almsedit alms in christianity is defined by passages of the new testament such as matthew  which commands go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor  and come and follow me a donation on the other hand is a gift to some sort of enterprise profit or nonprofit on the one hand the alms of saint gregory are to be distinguished from his donations but on the other he probably saw no such distinction the church had no interest in secular profit and as pope gregory did his utmost to encourage that high standard among church personnel apart from maintaining its facilities and supporting its personnel the church gave most of the donations it received as alms gregory is known for his administrative system of charitable relief of the poor at rome they were predominantly refugees from the incursions of the lombards the philosophy under which he devised this system is that the wealth belonged to the poor and the church was only its steward he received lavish donations from the wealthy families of rome who following his own example were eager to expiate to god for their sins he gave alms equally as lavishly both individually and en masse he wrote in letters i have frequently charged you  to act as my representative  to relieve the poor in their distress   i hold the office of steward to the property of the poor  pope gregory the great the church received donations of many different kinds of property consumables such as food and clothing investment property real estate and works of art and capital goods or revenuegenerating property such as the sicilian latifundia or agricultural estates staffed and operated by slaves donated by gregory and his family the church already had a system for circulating the consumables to the poor associated with each parish was a diaconium or office of the deacon he was given a building from which the poor could at any time apply for assistance the state in which gregory became pope in  was a ruined one the lombards held the better part of italy their predations had brought the economy to a standstill they camped nearly at the gates of rome the city was packed with refugees from all walks of life who lived in the streets and had few of the necessities of life the seat of government was far from rome in constantinople which appeared unable to undertake the relief of italy the pope had sent emissaries including gregory asking for assistance to no avail in  gregory could wait for constantinople no longer he organized the resources of the church into an administration for general relief in doing so he evidenced a talent for and intuitive understanding of the principles of accounting which was not to be invented for centuries the church already had basic accounting documents every expense was recorded in journals called regesta lists of amounts recipients and circumstances revenue was recorded in polyptici books many of these polyptici were ledgers recording the operating expenses of the church and the assets the patrimonia a central papal administration the notarii under a chief the primicerius notariorum kept the ledgers and issued brevia patrimonii or lists of property for which each rector was responsible gregory began by aggressively requiring his churchmen to seek out and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not in a letter to a subordinate in sicily he wrote i asked you most of all to take care of the poor and if you knew of people in poverty you should have pointed them out  i desire that you give the woman pateria forty solidi for the childrens shoes and forty bushels of grain  soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a buildup to a great plan that he had in mind he understood that expenses must be matched by income to pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici the churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble money however was no substitute for food in a city that was on the brink of famine even the wealthy were going hungry in their villas the church now owned between  and  square miles  and  km of revenuegenerating farmland divided into large sections called patrimonia it produced goods of all kinds which were sold but gregory intervened and had the goods shipped to rome for distribution in the diaconia he gave orders to step up production set quotas and put an administrative structure in place to carry it out at the bottom was the rusticus who produced the goods some rustici were or owned slaves he turned over part of his produce to a conductor from whom he leased the land the latter reported to an actionarius the latter to a defensor and the latter to a rector grain wine cheese meat fish and oil began to arrive at rome in large quantities where it was given away for nothing as alms distributions to qualified persons were monthly however a certain proportion of the population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply to them gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons mainly monks every morning with prepared food it is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed when he did dine he shared the family table which he had saved and which still exists with  indigent guests to the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer these and other good deeds and charitable frame of mind completely won the hearts and minds of the roman people they now looked to the papacy for government ignoring the rump state at constantinople which had only disrespect for gregorycitation needed calling him a fool for his pacifist dealings with the lombards the office of urban prefect went without candidates from the time of gregory the great to the rise of italian nationalism the papacy was most influential in ruling italy famous quotes and anecdotesedit th century mosaic in westminster cathedral non angli sed angeli non angli sed angeli – they are not angles but angels aphorism summarizing words reported to have been spoken by gregory when he first encountered paleskinned english boys at a slave market sparking his dispatch of st augustine of canterbury to england to convert the english according to bede he said well named for they have angelic faces and ought to be coheirs with the angels in heaven discovering that their province was deira he went on to add that they would be rescued de ira from the wrath and that their king was named aella alleluia he said ecce locusta – look at the locust gregory himself wanted to go to england as a missionary and started out for there on the fourth day as they stopped for lunch a locust landed on the edge of the bible gregory was reading he exclaimed ecce locusta look at the locust but reflecting on it he saw it as a sign from heaven since the similarsounding loco sta means stay in place within the hour an emissary of the pope arrived to recall him i beg that you will not take the present amiss for anything however trifling which is offered from the prosperity of st peter should be regarded as a great blessing seeing that he will have power both to bestow on you greater things and to hold out to you eternal benefits with almighty god pro cuius amore in eius eloquio nec mihi parco – for the love of whom god i do not spare myself from his word the sense is that since the creator of the human race and redeemer of him unworthy gave him the power of the tongue so that he could witness what kind of a witness would he be if he did not use it but preferred to speak infirmly for the place of heretics is very pride itselffor the place of the wicked is pride just as conversely humility is the place of the good non enim pro locis res sed pro bonis rebus loca amanda sunt – things are not to be loved for the sake of a place but places are to be loved for the sake of their good things when augustine asked whether to use roman or gallican customs in the mass in england gregory said in paraphrase that it was not the place that imparted goodness but good things that graced the place and it was more important to be pleasing to the almighty they should pick out what was pia religiosa and recta from any church whatever and set that down before the english minds as practice for the rule of justice and reason suggests that one who desires his own orders to be observed by his successors should undoubtedly keep the will and ordinances of his predecessor in his letters gregory often emphasized the importance of giving proper deference to last wills and testaments and of respecting property rights compassion should be shown first to the faithful and afterwards to the enemies of the church at length being anxious to avoid all these inconveniences i sought the haven of the monastery… for as the vessel that is negligently moored is very often when the storm waxes violent tossed by the water out of its shelter on the safest shore so under the cloak of the ecclesiastical office i found myself plunged on a sudden in a sea of secular matters and because i had not held fast the tranquillity of the monastery when in possession i learnt by losing it

mission from rome to convert a pagan people to christianity gregory is also well known for his writings which were more prolific than those of any of his predecessors as pope the epithet saint gregory the dialogist has been attached to him in eastern christianity because of his dialogues for this reason english translations of eastern texts will sometimes list him as gregory dialogos or the latinized equivalent dialogus a senators son and himself the prefect of rome at  gregory tried the monastery but soon returned to active public life ending his life and the century as pope although he was the first pope from a monastic background his prior political experiences may have helped him to be a talented administrator who successfully established papal supremacy during his papacy he greatly surpassed with his administration the emperors in improving the welfare of the people of rome and successfully challenged the theological views of patriarch eutychius of constantinople before the emperor tiberius ii gregory regained papal authority in spain and france and sent missionaries to england the realignment of barbarian allegiance to rome from their arian christian alliances shaped medieval europe gregory saw franks lombards and visigoths align with rome in religion throughout the middle ages he was known as the father of christian worship because of his exceptional efforts in revising the roman worship of his day his contributions to the development of the divine liturgy of the presanctified gifts still in use in the byzantine rite were so significant that he is generally recognized as its de facto author gregory is a doctor of the church and one of the latin fathers he is considered a saint in the catholic church eastern orthodox church anglican communion

usually estimated to be around the year  in the city of rome his parents named him gregorius which according to ælfric of abingdon in an homily on the birthday of s gregory  is a greek name sic which signifies in the latin tongue vigilantius that is in english watchful the medieval writer who provided this etymology did not hesitate to apply it to the life of gregory aelfric states he was very diligent in gods commandments gregory was born into a wealthy patrician roman family with close connections to the church his father gordianus who served as a senator and for a time was the prefect of the city of rome also held the position of regionarius in the church though nothing further is known about that position gregorys mother silvia was wellborn and had a married sister pateria in sicily his mother and two paternal aunts are honored by catholic and orthodox churches as saints gregorys greatgreatgrandfather had been pope felix iii the nominee of the gothic king theodoric gregorys election to the throne of st peter made his family the most distinguished clerical dynasty of the period the family owned and resided in a villa suburbana on the caelian hill fronting the same street now the via di san gregorio as the former palaces of the roman emperors on the palatine hill opposite the north of the street runs into the colosseum the south the circus maximus in gregorys day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned villas covered the area gregorys family also owned working estates in sicily and around rome gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the caelian and these were described  years later by john the deacon gordianus was tall with a long face and light eyes he wore a beard silvia was tall had a round face blue eyes and a cheerful look they had another son whose name and fate are unknown gregory was born into a period of upheaval in italy from  the socalled plague of justinian swept through the provinces of the empire including italy the plague caused famine panic and sometimes rioting in some parts of the country over  of the population was wiped out or destroyed with heavy spiritual and emotional effects on the people of the empire politically although the western roman empire had long since vanished in favour of the gothic kings of italy during the s italy was gradually retaken from the goths by justinian i emperor of the eastern roman empire ruling from constantinople as the fighting was mainly in the north the young gregory probably saw little of it totila sacked and vacated rome in  destroying most of its ancient population but in  he invited those who were still alive to return to the empty and ruined streets it has been hypothesized that young gregory and his parents retired during that intermission to their sicilian estates to return in  the war was over in rome by  and a subsequent invasion of the franks was defeated in  after that there was peace in italy and the appearance of restoration except that the central government now resided in constantinople like most young men of his position in roman society saint gregory was well educated learning grammar rhetoric the sciences literature and law and excelling in all gregory of tours reported that in grammar dialectic and rhetoric  he was second to none he wrote correct latin but did not read or write greek he knew latin authors natural science history mathematics and music and had such a fluency with imperial law that he may have trained in it as a preparation for a career in public life indeed he became a government official advancing quickly in rank to become like his father prefect of rome the highest civil office in the city when only thirtythree years old the monks of the monastery of st andrew established by gregory at the ancestral home on the caelian had a portrait of him made after his death which john the deacon also saw in the th century he reports the picture of a man who was rather bald and had a tawny beard like his fathers and a face that was intermediate in shape between his mothers and fathers the hair that he had on the sides was long and carefully curled his nose was thin and straight and slightly aquiline his forehead was high he had thick subdivided lips and a chin of a comely prominence and beautiful hands in the modern era gregory is often depicted as a man at the border poised between the roman and germanic worlds between east and west and above all perhaps between the ancient and medieval epochs monastic yearsedit jerome and gregory on his fathers death gregory converted his family villa into a monastery dedicated to the apostle saint andrew after his death it was rededicated as san gregorio magno al celio in his life of contemplation gregory concluded that in that silence of the heart while we keep watch within through contemplation we are as if asleep to all things that are without it seems to some that gregory was not always forgiving or pleasant for that matter even in his monastic years for example a monk lying on his death bed confessed to stealing three gold pieces gregory forced the monk to die friendless and alone then threw his body and coins on a manure heap to rot with a curse take your money with you to perdition gregory believed that punishment of sins can begin even on ones deathbed however at the monks death gregory offered  masses in his remembrance to assist his soul before the final judgment eventually pope pelagius ii ordained gregory a deacon and solicited his help in trying to heal the schism of the three chapters in northern italy however this schism was not healed until well after gregory was gone gregory had a deep respect for the monastic life he viewed being a monk as the ardent quest for the vision of our creator his three paternal aunts were nuns renowned for their sanctity however after the two eldest died after seeing a vision of their ancestor pope felix the youngest soon abandoned the religious life and married the steward of her estate gregorys response to this family scandal was many are called but few are chosen gregorys mother silvia herself is a saint apocrisiariate –edit illumination in a thcentury manuscript of a letter of gregorys to saint leander bishop of seville bibl municipale ms  dijon in  pelagius ii chose gregory as his apocrisiarius ambassador to the imperial court in constantinople a post gregory would hold until  gregory was part of the roman delegation both lay and clerical that arrived in constantinople in  to ask the emperor for military aid against the lombards with the byzantine military focused on the east these entreaties proved unsuccessful in  pelagius ii wrote to gregory as apocrisiarius detailing the hardships that rome was experiencing under the lombards and asking him to ask emperor maurice to send a relief force maurice however had long ago determined to limit his efforts against the lombards to intrigue and diplomacy pitting the franks against them it soon became obvious to gregory that the byzantine emperors were unlikely to send such a force given their more immediate difficulties with the persians in the east and the avars and slavs to the north according to ekonomou if gregorys principal task was to plead romes cause before the emperor there seems to have been little left for him to do once imperial policy toward italy became evident papal representatives who pressed their claims with excessive vigor could quickly become a nuisance and find themselves excluded from the imperial presence altogether gregory had already drawn an imperial rebuke for his lengthy canonical writings on the subject of the legitimacy of john iii scholasticus who had occupied the patriarchate of constantinople for twelve years prior to the return of eutychius who had been driven out by justinian gregory turned himself to cultivating connections with the byzantine elite of the city where he became extremely popular with the citys upper class especially aristocratic women ekonomou surmises that while gregory may have become spiritual father to a large and important segment of constantinoples aristocracy this relationship did not significantly advance the interests of rome before the emperor although the writings of john the deacon claim that gregory labored diligently for the relief of italy there is no evidence that his tenure accomplished much towards any of the objectives of pelagius ii gregorys theological disputes with patriarch eutychius would leave a bitter taste for the theological speculation of the east with gregory that continued to influence him well into his own papacy according to western sources gregorys very public debate with eutychius culminated in an exchange before tiberius ii where gregory cited a biblical passage palpate et videte quia spiritus carnem et ossa non habet sicut me videtis habere in support of the view that christ was corporeal and palpable after his resurrection allegedly as a result of this exchange tiberius ii ordered eutychiuss writings burned ekonomou views this argument though exaggerated in western sources as gregorys one achievement of an otherwise fruitless apokrisiariat in reality gregory was forced to rely on scripture because he could not read the untranslated greek authoritative works gregory left constantinople for rome in  returning to his monastery on the caelian hill gregory was elected by acclamation to succeed pelagius ii in  when the latter died of the plague spreading through the city gregory was approved by an

gregory i papal styles of pope gregory i reference style his holiness spoken style your holiness religious style holy father posthumous style saint although gregory was resolved to retire into the monastic lifestyle of contemplation he was unwillingly forced back into a world that although he loved he no longer wanted to be a part of in texts of all genres especially those produced in his first year as pope gregory bemoaned the burden of office and mourned the loss of the undisturbed life of prayer he had once enjoyed as a monk when he became pope in  among his first acts was writing a series of letters disavowing any ambition to the throne of peter and praising the contemplative life of the monks at that time for various reasons the holy see had not exerted effective leadership in the west since the pontificate of gelasius i the episcopacy in gaul was drawn from the great territorial families and identified with them the parochial horizon of gregorys contemporary gregory of tours may be considered typical in visigothic spain the bishops had little contact with rome in italy the territories which had de facto fallen under the administration of the papacy were beset by the violent lombard dukes and the rivalry of the byzantines in the exarchate of ravenna and in the south pope gregory had strong convictions on missions almighty god places good men in authority that he may impart through them the gifts of his mercy to their subjects and this we find to be the case with the british over whom you have been appointed to rule that through the blessings bestowed on you the blessings of heaven might be bestowed on your people also he is credited with reenergizing the churchs missionary work among the nonchristian peoples of northern europe he is most famous for sending a mission often called the gregorian mission under augustine of canterbury prior of saint andrews where he had perhaps succeeded gregory to evangelize the pagan anglosaxons of england it seems that the pope had never forgotten the english slaves whom he had once seen in the roman forum the mission was successful and it was from england that missionaries later set out for the netherlands and germany the preaching of nonheretical christian faith and the elimination of all deviations from it was a key element in gregorys worldview and it constituted one of the major continuing policies of his pontificate according to the catholic encyclopedia he was declared a saint immediately after his death by popular acclamation in his official documents gregory was the first to make extensive use of the term servant of the servants of god servus servorum dei as a papal title thus initiating a practice that was to be followed by most subsequent popes worksedit part of a series on catholic

things changing a few adding some in letters gregory remarks that he moved the pater noster our father to immediately after the roman canon and immediately before the fraction this position is still maintained today in the roman liturgy the pregregorian position is evident in the ambrosian rite gregory added material to the hanc igitur of the roman canon and established the nine kyries a vestigial remnant of the litany which was originally at that place at the beginning of mass he also reduced the role of deacons in the roman liturgy sacramentaries directly influenced by gregorian reforms are referred to as sacrementaria gregoriana roman and other western liturgies since this era have a number of prayers that change to reflect the feast or liturgical season these variations are visible in the collects and prefaces as well as in the roman canon itself divine liturgy of the presanctified giftsedit in the eastern orthodox church and eastern catholic churches gregory is credited as the primary influence in constructing the more penitential divine liturgy of the presanctified gifts a fully separate form of the divine liturgy in the byzantine rite adapted to the needs of the season of great lent its roman rite equivalent is the mass of the presanctified used only on good friday the syriac liturgy of the presanctified gifts continues to be used in the malankara rite a variant of the west syrian rite historically practiced in the malankara church of india and now practiced by the several churches that descended from it and at some occasions in the assyrian church of the east gregorian chantedit main article gregorian chant the mainstream form of western plainchant standardized in the late th century was attributed to pope gregory i and so took the name of gregorian chant the earliest such attribution is in john the deacons  biography of gregory almost three centuries after the popes death and the chant that bears his name is the result of the fusion of roman and frankish elements which took place in the francogerman empire under pepin charlemagne and their successors writingsedit saint gregory the great by josé de ribera gregory is commonly credited with founding the medieval papacy and so many attribute the beginning of medieval spirituality to him gregory is the only pope between the fifth and the eleventh centuries whose correspondence and writings have survived enough to form a comprehensive corpus some of his writings are commentary on job frequently known in englishlanguage histories by its latin title magna moralia or as moralia on job this is one of the longest patristic works it was possibly finished as early as  it is based on talks gregory gave on the book of job to his brethren who accompanied him to constantinople the work as we have it is the result of gregorys revision and completion of it soon after his accession to the papal office liber regulae pastoralis book of pastoral rule  the rule for pastors in which he contrasted the role of bishops as pastors of their flock with their position as nobles of the church the definitive statement of the nature of the episcopal office this was probably begun before his election as pope and finished in  dialogues a collection of four books of miracles signs wonders and healings done by the holy men mostly monastic of sixthcentury italy with the second book entirely devoted to a popular life of saint benedict sermons including the sermons include the  homilae in hiezechielem homilies on ezekiel dealing with ezekiel  in book one and ezekiel  in book  these were preached during  the years that the lombards besieged rome and contain some of gregorys most profound mystical teachings they were revised eight years later the homilae xl in evangelia forty homilies on the gospels for the liturgical year delivered during  and  which were seemingly finished by  a papyrus fragment from this codex survives in the british museum london uk expositio in canticis canticorum only  of these sermons on the song of songs survive discussing the text up to song  in librum primum regum expositio commentary on  kings copies of some  letters have survived during gregorys time copies of papal letters were made by scribes into a registrum register which was then kept in the scrinium it is known that in the th century when john the deacon composed his life of gregory the registrum of gregorys letters was formed of  papyrus rolls though it is difficult to estimate how many letters this may have represented though these original rolls are now lost the  letters have survived in copies made at various later times the largest single batch of  letters being made by order of adrian i  the majority of the copies dating from the th to the th century are stored in the vatican library gregory wrote over  letters in the last  years of his life – that give us an accurate picture of his work a truly autobiographical presentation is nearly impossible for gregory the development of his mind and personality remains purely speculative in nature opinions of the writings of gregory vary his character strikes us as an ambiguous and enigmatic one the jewish canadianamerican popularist cantor observed on the one hand he was an able and determined administrator a skilled and clever diplomat a leader of the greatest sophistication and vision but on the other hand he appears in his writings as a superstitious and credulous monk hostile to learning crudely limited as a theologian and excessively devoted to saints miracles and relics controversy with eutychiusedit in constantinople gregory took issue with the aged patriarch eutychius of constantinople who had recently published a treatise now lost on the general resurrection eutychius maintained that the resurrected body will be more subtle than air and no longer palpable gregory opposed with the palpability of the risen christ in luke  as the dispute could not be settled the byzantine emperor tiberius ii constantine undertook to arbitrate he decided in favor of palpability and ordered eutychius book to be burned shortly after both gregory and eutychius became ill gregory recovered but eutychius died on  april  at age  on his deathbed eutychius recanted impalpability and gregory dropped the matter tiberius also died a few months after eutychius identification of three figures in the gospelsedit gregory was among those who identified mary magdalene with mary of bethany whom john  recounts as having anointed jesus with precious ointment an event that some interpret as being the same as the anointing of jesus performed by a woman that luke alone among the synoptic gospels recounts as sinful preaching on the passage in the gospel of luke gregory remarked this woman whom luke calls a sinner and john calls mary i think is the mary from whom mark reports that seven demons were cast out today biblical scholars distinguish the three figures but they are all still popularly identified iconographyedit gregory and his dove corpus christi college cambridge ms  in art gregory is usually shown in full pontifical robes with the tiara and double cross despite his actual habit of dress earlier depictions are more likely to show a monastic tonsure and plainer dress orthodox icons traditionally show st gregory vested as a bishop holding a gospel book and blessing with his right hand it is recorded that he permitted his depiction with a square halo then used for the living a dove is his attribute from the wellknown story attributed to his friend peter the deacon who tells that when the pope was dictating his homilies on ezechiel a curtain was drawn between his secretary and himself as however the pope remained silent for long periods at a time the servant made a hole in the curtain and looking through beheld a dove seated upon gregorys head with its beak between his lips when the dove withdrew its beak the pope spoke and the secretary took down his words but when he became silent the servant again applied his eye to the hole and saw the dove had replaced its beak between his lips this scene is shown as a version of the traditional evangelist portrait where the evangelists symbols are also sometimes shown dictating from the tenth century onwards an early example is the dedication miniature from an eleventhcentury manuscript of saint gregorys moralia in job the miniature shows the scribe bebo of seeon abbey presenting the manuscript to the holy roman emperor henry ii in the upper left the author is seen writing the text under divine inspiration usually the dove is shown whispering in gregorys ear for a clearer composition the anachronistic example at the top of this article is from the studio of carlo saraceni or by a close follower ca  from the giustiniani collection the painting is conserved in the galleria nazionale darte antica rome the face of gregory is a caricature of the features described by john the deacon mentioned under his early life above total baldness outthrust chin beaklike nose where john had described partial baldness a mildly protruding chin slightly aquiline nose and strikingly good looks in this picture also gregory has his monastic back on the world which the real gregory despite his reclusive intent was seldom allowed to have the mass of st gregory by robert campin th century the late medieval subject of the mass of st gregory shows a version of a thcentury story that was elaborated in later hagiography gregory is shown saying mass when christ as the man of sorrows appears on the altar the subject was most common in the th and th centuries and reflected growing emphasis on the real presence and after the protestant reformation was an assertion of the doctrine against protestant theology almsedit alms in christianity is defined by passages of the new testament such as matthew  which commands go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor  and come and follow me a donation on the other hand is a gift to some sort of enterprise profit or nonprofit on the one hand the alms of saint gregory are to be distinguished from his donations but on the other he probably saw no such distinction the church had no interest in secular profit and as pope gregory did his utmost to encourage that high standard among church personnel apart from maintaining its facilities and supporting its personnel the church gave most of the donations it received as alms gregory is known for his administrative system of charitable relief of the poor at rome they were predominantly refugees from the incursions of the lombards the philosophy under which he devised this system is that the wealth belonged to the poor and the church was only its steward he received lavish donations from the wealthy families of rome who following his own example were eager to expiate to god for their sins he gave alms equally as lavishly both individually and en masse he wrote in letters i have frequently charged you  to act as my representative  to relieve the poor in their distress   i hold the office of steward to the property of the poor  pope gregory the great the church received donations of many different kinds of property consumables such as food and clothing investment property real estate and works of art and capital goods or revenuegenerating property such as the sicilian latifundia or agricultural estates staffed and operated by slaves donated by gregory and his family the church already had a system for circulating the consumables to the poor associated with each parish was a diaconium or office of the deacon he was given a building from which the poor could at any time apply for assistance the state in which gregory became pope in  was a ruined one the lombards held the better part of italy their predations had brought the economy to a standstill they camped nearly at the gates of rome the city was packed with refugees from all walks of life who lived in the streets and had few of the necessities of life the seat of government was far from rome in constantinople which appeared unable to undertake the relief of italy the pope had sent emissaries including gregory asking for assistance to no avail in  gregory could wait for constantinople no longer he organized the resources of the church into an administration for general relief in doing so he evidenced a talent for and intuitive understanding of the principles of accounting which was not to be invented for centuries the church already had basic accounting documents every expense was recorded in journals called regesta lists of amounts recipients and circumstances revenue was recorded in polyptici books many of these polyptici were ledgers recording the operating expenses of the church and the assets the patrimonia a central papal administration the notarii under a chief the primicerius notariorum kept the ledgers and issued brevia patrimonii or lists of property for which each rector was responsible gregory began by aggressively requiring his churchmen to seek out and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not in a letter to a subordinate in sicily he wrote i asked you most of all to take care of the poor and if you knew of people in poverty you should have pointed them out  i desire that you give the woman pateria forty solidi for the childrens shoes and forty bushels of grain  soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a buildup to a great plan that he had in mind he understood that expenses must be matched by income to pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici the churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble money however was no substitute for food in a city that was on the brink of famine even the wealthy were going hungry in their villas the church now owned between  and  square miles  and  km of revenuegenerating farmland divided into large sections called patrimonia it produced goods of all kinds which were sold but gregory intervened and had the goods shipped to rome for distribution in the diaconia he gave orders to step up production set quotas and put an administrative structure in place to carry it out at the bottom was the rusticus who produced the goods some rustici were or owned slaves he turned over part of his produce to a conductor from whom he leased the land the latter reported to an actionarius the latter to a defensor and the latter to a rector grain wine cheese meat fish and oil began to arrive at rome in large quantities where it was given away for nothing as alms distributions to qualified persons were monthly however a certain proportion of the population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply to them gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons mainly monks every morning with prepared food it is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed when he did dine he shared the family table which he had saved and which still exists with  indigent guests to the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer these and other good deeds and charitable frame of mind completely won the hearts and minds of the roman people they now looked to the papacy for government ignoring the rump state at constantinople which had only disrespect for gregorycitation needed calling him a fool for his pacifist dealings with the lombards the office of urban prefect went without candidates from the time of gregory the great to the rise of italian nationalism the papacy was most influential in ruling italy famous quotes and anecdotesedit th century mosaic in westminster cathedral non angli sed angeli non angli sed angeli – they are not angles but angels aphorism summarizing words reported to have been spoken by gregory when he first encountered paleskinned english boys at a slave market sparking his dispatch of st augustine of canterbury to england to convert the english according to bede he said well named for they have angelic faces and ought to be coheirs with the angels in heaven discovering that their province was deira he went on to add that they would be rescued de ira from the wrath and that their king was named aella alleluia he said ecce locusta – look at the locust gregory himself wanted to go to england as a missionary and started out for there on the fourth day as they stopped for lunch a locust landed on the edge of the bible gregory was reading he exclaimed ecce locusta look at the locust but reflecting on it he saw it as a sign from heaven since the similarsounding loco sta means stay in place within the hour an emissary of the pope arrived to recall him i beg that you will not take the present amiss for anything however trifling which is offered from the prosperity of st peter should be regarded as a great blessing seeing that he will have power both to bestow on you greater things and to hold out to you eternal benefits with almighty god pro cuius amore in eius eloquio nec mihi parco – for the love of whom god i do not spare myself from his word the sense is that since the creator of the human race and redeemer of him unworthy gave him the power of the tongue so that he could witness what kind of a witness would he be if he did not use it but preferred to speak infirmly for the place of heretics is very pride itselffor the place of the wicked is pride just as conversely humility is the place of the good non enim pro locis res sed pro bonis rebus loca amanda sunt – things are not to be loved for the sake of a place but places are to be loved for the sake of their good things when augustine asked whether to use roman or gallican customs in the mass in england gregory said in paraphrase that it was not the place that imparted goodness but good things that graced the place and it was more important to be pleasing to the almighty they should pick out what was pia religiosa and recta from any church whatever and set that down before the english minds as practice for the rule of justice and reason suggests that one who desires his own orders to be observed by his successors should undoubtedly keep the will and ordinances of his predecessor in his letters gregory often emphasized the importance of giving proper deference to last wills and testaments and of respecting property rights compassion should be shown first to the faithful and afterwards to the enemies of the church at length being anxious to avoid all these inconveniences i sought the haven of the monastery… for as the vessel that is negligently moored is very often when the storm waxes violent tossed by the water out of its shelter on the safest shore so under the cloak of the ecclesiastical office i found myself plunged on a sudden in a sea of secular matters and because i had not held fast the tranquillity of the monastery when in possession i learnt by losing it how closely it should have been held in moralia sive expositio in job commentary on job also known as magna moralia gregory describes to the bishop leander the circumstances under which he became a

mission from rome to convert a pagan people to christianity gregory is also well known for his writings which were more prolific than those of any of his predecessors as pope the epithet saint gregory the dialogist has been attached to him in eastern christianity because of his dialogues for this reason english translations of eastern texts will sometimes list him as gregory dialogos or the latinized equivalent dialogus a senators son and himself the prefect of rome at  gregory tried the monastery but soon returned to active public life ending his life and the century as pope although he was the first pope from a monastic background his prior political experiences may have helped him to be a talented administrator who successfully established papal supremacy during his papacy he greatly surpassed with his administration the emperors in improving the welfare of the people of rome and successfully challenged the theological views of patriarch eutychius of constantinople before the emperor tiberius ii gregory regained papal authority in spain and france and sent missionaries to england the realignment of barbarian allegiance to rome from their arian christian alliances shaped medieval europe gregory saw franks lombards and visigoths align with rome in religion throughout the middle ages he was known as the father of christian worship because of his exceptional efforts in revising the roman worship of his day his contributions to the development of the divine liturgy of the presanctified gifts still in use in the byzantine rite were so significant that he is generally recognized as its de facto author gregory is a doctor of the church and one of the latin fathers he is considered a saint in the catholic church eastern orthodox church anglican communion

usually estimated to be around the year  in the city of rome his parents named him gregorius which according to ælfric of abingdon in an homily on the birthday of s gregory  is a greek name sic which signifies in the latin tongue vigilantius that is in english watchful the medieval writer who provided this etymology did not hesitate to apply it to the life of gregory aelfric states he was very diligent in gods commandments gregory was born into a wealthy patrician roman family with close connections to the church his father gordianus who served as a senator and for a time was the prefect of the city of rome also held the position of regionarius in the church though nothing further is known about that position gregorys mother silvia was wellborn and had a married sister pateria in sicily his mother and two paternal aunts are honored by catholic and orthodox churches as saints gregorys greatgreatgrandfather had been pope felix iii the nominee of the gothic king theodoric gregorys election to the throne of st peter made his family the most distinguished clerical dynasty of the period the family owned and resided in a villa suburbana on the caelian hill fronting the same street now the via di san gregorio as the former palaces of the roman emperors on the palatine hill opposite the north of the street runs into the colosseum the south the circus maximus in gregorys day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned villas covered the area gregorys family also owned working estates in sicily and around rome gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the caelian and these were described  years later by john the deacon gordianus was tall with a long face and light eyes he wore a beard silvia was tall had a round face blue eyes and a cheerful look they had another son whose name and fate are unknown gregory was born into a period of upheaval in italy from  the socalled plague of justinian swept through the provinces of the empire including italy the plague caused famine panic and sometimes rioting in some parts of the country over  of the population was wiped out or destroyed with heavy spiritual and emotional effects on the people of the empire politically although the western roman empire had long since vanished in favour of the gothic kings of italy during the s italy was gradually retaken from the goths by justinian i emperor of the eastern roman empire ruling from constantinople as the fighting was mainly in the north the young gregory probably saw little of it totila sacked and vacated rome in  destroying most of its ancient population but in  he invited those who were still alive to return to the empty and ruined streets it has been hypothesized that young gregory and his parents retired during that intermission to their sicilian estates to return in  the war was over in rome by  and a subsequent invasion of the franks was defeated in  after that there was peace in italy and the appearance of restoration except that the central government now resided in constantinople like most young men of his position in roman society saint gregory was well educated learning grammar rhetoric the sciences literature and law and excelling in all gregory of tours reported that in grammar dialectic and rhetoric  he was second to none he wrote correct latin but did not read or write greek he knew latin authors natural science history mathematics and music and had such a fluency with imperial law that he may have trained in it as a preparation for a career in public life indeed he became a government official advancing quickly in rank to become like his father prefect of rome the highest civil office in the city when only thirtythree years old the monks of the monastery of st andrew established by gregory at the ancestral home on the caelian had a portrait of him made after his death which john the deacon also saw in the th century he reports the picture of a man who was rather bald and had a tawny beard like his fathers and a face that was intermediate in shape between his mothers and fathers the hair that he had on the sides was long and carefully curled his nose was thin and straight and slightly aquiline his forehead was high he had thick subdivided lips and a chin of a comely prominence and beautiful hands in the modern era gregory is often depicted as a man at the border poised between the roman and germanic worlds between east and west and above all perhaps between the ancient and medieval epochs monastic yearsedit jerome and gregory on his fathers death gregory converted his family villa into a monastery dedicated to the apostle saint andrew after his death it was rededicated as san gregorio magno al celio in his life of contemplation gregory concluded that in that silence of the heart while we keep watch within through contemplation we are as if asleep to all things that are without it seems to some that gregory was not always forgiving or pleasant for that matter even in his monastic years for example a monk lying on his death bed confessed to stealing three gold pieces gregory forced the monk to die friendless and alone then threw his body and coins on a manure heap to rot with a curse take your money with you to perdition gregory believed that punishment of sins can begin even on ones deathbed however at the monks death gregory offered  masses in his remembrance to assist his soul before the final judgment eventually pope pelagius ii ordained gregory a deacon and solicited his help in trying to heal the schism of the three chapters in northern italy however this schism was not healed until well after gregory was gone gregory had a deep respect for the monastic life he viewed being a monk as the ardent quest for the vision of our creator his three paternal aunts were nuns renowned for their sanctity however after the two eldest died after seeing a vision of their ancestor pope felix the youngest soon abandoned the religious life and married the steward of her estate gregorys response to this family scandal was many are called but few are chosen gregorys mother silvia herself is a saint apocrisiariate –edit illumination in a thcentury manuscript of a letter of gregorys to saint leander bishop of seville bibl municipale ms  dijon in  pelagius ii chose gregory as his apocrisiarius ambassador to the imperial court in constantinople a post gregory would hold until  gregory was part of the roman delegation both lay and clerical that arrived in constantinople in  to ask the emperor for military aid against the lombards with the byzantine military focused on the east these entreaties proved unsuccessful in  pelagius ii wrote to gregory as apocrisiarius detailing the hardships that rome was experiencing under the lombards and asking him to ask emperor maurice to send a relief force maurice however had long ago determined to limit his efforts against the lombards to intrigue and diplomacy pitting the franks against them it soon became obvious to gregory that the byzantine emperors were unlikely to send such a force given their more immediate difficulties with the persians in the east and the avars and slavs to the north according to ekonomou if gregorys principal task was to plead romes cause before the emperor there seems to have been little left for him to do once imperial policy toward italy became evident papal representatives who pressed their claims with excessive vigor could quickly become a nuisance and find themselves excluded from the imperial presence altogether gregory had already drawn an imperial rebuke for his lengthy canonical writings on the subject of the legitimacy of john iii scholasticus who had occupied the patriarchate of constantinople for twelve years prior to the return of eutychius who had been driven out by justinian gregory turned himself to cultivating connections with the byzantine elite of the city where he became extremely popular with the citys upper class especially aristocratic women ekonomou surmises that while gregory may have become spiritual father to a large and important segment of constantinoples aristocracy this relationship did not significantly advance the interests of rome before the emperor although the writings of john the deacon claim that gregory labored diligently for the relief of italy there is no evidence that his tenure accomplished much towards any of the objectives of pelagius ii gregorys theological disputes with patriarch eutychius would leave a bitter taste for the theological speculation of the east with gregory that continued to influence him well into his own papacy according to western sources gregorys very public debate with eutychius culminated in an exchange before tiberius ii where gregory cited a biblical passage palpate et videte quia spiritus carnem et ossa non habet sicut me videtis habere in support of the view that christ was corporeal and palpable after his resurrection allegedly as a result of this exchange tiberius ii ordered eutychiuss writings burned ekonomou views this argument though exaggerated in western sources as gregorys one achievement of an otherwise fruitless apokrisiariat in reality gregory was forced to rely on scripture because he could not read the untranslated greek authoritative works gregory left constantinople for rome in  returning to his monastery on the caelian hill gregory was elected by acclamation to succeed pelagius ii in  when the latter died of the plague spreading through the city gregory was approved by an imperial iussio from constantinople the following september as was the norm during the byzantine papacy papacy –edit saint gregory the great pope dialogist church father monk and doctor of the church

gregory i papal styles of pope gregory i reference style his holiness spoken style your holiness religious style holy father posthumous style saint although gregory was resolved to retire into the monastic lifestyle of contemplation he was unwillingly forced back into a world that although he loved he no longer wanted to be a part of in texts of all genres especially those produced in his first year as pope gregory bemoaned the burden of office and mourned the loss of the undisturbed life of prayer he had once enjoyed as a monk when he became pope in  among his first acts was writing a series of letters disavowing any ambition to the throne of peter and praising the contemplative life of the monks at that time for various reasons the holy see had not exerted effective leadership in the west since the pontificate of gelasius i the episcopacy in gaul was drawn from the great territorial families and identified with them the parochial horizon of gregorys contemporary gregory of tours may be considered typical in visigothic spain the bishops had little contact with rome in italy the territories which had de facto fallen under the administration of the papacy were beset by the violent lombard dukes and the rivalry of the byzantines in the exarchate of ravenna and in the south pope gregory had strong convictions on missions almighty god places good men in authority that he may impart through them the gifts of his mercy to their subjects and this we find to be the case with the british over whom you have been appointed to rule that through the blessings bestowed on you the blessings of heaven might be bestowed on your people also he is credited with reenergizing the churchs missionary work among the nonchristian peoples of northern europe he is most famous for sending a mission often called the gregorian mission under augustine of canterbury prior of saint andrews where he had perhaps succeeded gregory to evangelize the pagan anglosaxons of england it seems that the pope had never forgotten the english slaves whom he had once seen in the roman forum the mission was successful and it was from england that missionaries later set out for the netherlands and germany the preaching of nonheretical christian faith and the elimination of all deviations from it was a key element in gregorys worldview and it constituted one of the major continuing policies of his pontificate according to the catholic encyclopedia he was declared a saint immediately after his death by popular acclamation in his official documents gregory was the first to make extensive use of the term servant of the servants of god servus servorum dei as a papal title thus initiating a practice that was to be followed by most subsequent popes worksedit part of a series on catholic

things changing a few adding some in letters gregory remarks that he moved the pater noster our father to immediately after the roman canon and immediately before the fraction this position is still maintained today in the roman liturgy the pregregorian position is evident in the ambrosian rite gregory added material to the hanc igitur of the roman canon and established the nine kyries a vestigial remnant of the litany which was originally at that place at the beginning of mass he also reduced the role of deacons in the roman liturgy sacramentaries directly influenced by gregorian reforms are referred to as sacrementaria gregoriana roman and other western liturgies since this era have a number of prayers that change to reflect the feast or liturgical season these variations are visible in the collects and prefaces as well as in the roman canon itself divine liturgy of the presanctified giftsedit in the eastern orthodox church and eastern catholic churches gregory is credited as the primary influence in constructing the more penitential divine liturgy of the presanctified gifts a fully separate form of the divine liturgy in the byzantine rite adapted to the needs of the season of great lent its roman rite equivalent is the mass of the presanctified used only on good friday the syriac liturgy of the presanctified gifts continues to be used in the malankara rite a variant of the west syrian rite historically practiced in the malankara church of india and now practiced by the several churches that descended from it and at some occasions in the assyrian church of the east gregorian chantedit main article gregorian chant the mainstream form of western plainchant standardized in the late th century was attributed to pope gregory i and so took the name of gregorian chant the earliest such attribution is in john the deacons  biography of gregory almost three centuries after the popes death and the chant that bears his name is the result of the fusion of roman and frankish elements which took place in the francogerman empire under pepin charlemagne and their successors writingsedit saint gregory the great by josé de ribera gregory is commonly credited with founding the medieval papacy and so many attribute the beginning of medieval spirituality to him gregory is the only pope between the fifth and the eleventh centuries whose correspondence and writings have survived enough to form a comprehensive corpus some of his writings are commentary on job frequently known in englishlanguage histories by its latin title magna moralia or as moralia on job this is one of the longest patristic works it was possibly finished as early as  it is based on talks gregory gave on the book of job to his brethren who accompanied him to constantinople the work as we have it is the result of gregorys revision and completion of it soon after his accession to the papal office liber regulae pastoralis book of pastoral rule  the rule for pastors in which he contrasted the role of bishops as pastors of their flock with their position as nobles of the church the definitive statement of the nature of the episcopal office this was probably begun before his election as pope and finished in  dialogues a collection of four books of miracles signs wonders and healings done by the holy men mostly monastic of sixthcentury italy with the second book entirely devoted to a popular life of saint benedict sermons including the sermons include the  homilae in hiezechielem homilies on ezekiel dealing with ezekiel  in book one and ezekiel  in book  these were preached during  the years that the lombards besieged rome and contain some of gregorys most profound mystical teachings they were revised eight years later the homilae xl in evangelia forty homilies on the gospels for the liturgical year delivered during  and  which were seemingly finished by  a papyrus fragment from this codex survives in the british museum london uk expositio in canticis canticorum only  of these sermons on the song of songs survive discussing the text up to song  in librum primum regum expositio commentary on  kings copies of some  letters have survived during gregorys time copies of papal letters were made by scribes into a registrum register which was then kept in the scrinium it is known that in the th century when john the deacon composed his life of gregory the registrum of gregorys letters was formed of  papyrus rolls though it is difficult to estimate how many letters this may have represented though these original rolls are now lost the  letters have survived in copies made at various later times the largest single batch of  letters being made by order of adrian i  the majority of the copies dating from the th to the th century are stored in the vatican library gregory wrote over  letters in the last  years of his life – that give us an accurate picture of his work a truly autobiographical presentation is nearly impossible for gregory the development of his mind and personality remains purely speculative in nature opinions of the writings of gregory vary his character strikes us as an ambiguous and enigmatic one the jewish canadianamerican popularist cantor observed on the one hand he was an able and determined administrator a skilled and clever diplomat a leader of the greatest sophistication and vision but on the other hand he appears in his writings as a superstitious and credulous monk hostile to learning crudely limited as a theologian and excessively devoted to saints miracles and relics controversy with eutychiusedit in constantinople gregory took issue with the aged patriarch eutychius of constantinople who had recently published a treatise now lost on the general resurrection eutychius maintained that the resurrected body will be more subtle than air and no longer palpable gregory opposed with the palpability of the risen christ in luke  as the dispute could not be settled the byzantine emperor tiberius ii constantine undertook to arbitrate he decided in favor of palpability and ordered eutychius book to be burned shortly after both gregory and eutychius became ill gregory recovered but eutychius died on  april  at age  on his deathbed eutychius recanted impalpability and gregory dropped the matter tiberius also died a few months after eutychius identification of three figures in the gospelsedit gregory was among those who identified mary magdalene with mary of bethany whom john  recounts as having anointed jesus with precious ointment an event that some interpret as being the same as the anointing of jesus performed by a woman that luke alone among the synoptic gospels recounts as sinful preaching on the passage in the gospel of luke gregory remarked this woman whom luke calls a sinner and john calls mary i think is the mary from whom mark reports that seven demons were cast out today biblical scholars distinguish the three figures but they are all still popularly identified iconographyedit gregory and his dove corpus christi college cambridge ms  in art gregory is usually shown in full pontifical robes with the tiara and double cross despite his actual habit of dress earlier depictions are more likely to show a monastic tonsure and plainer dress orthodox icons traditionally show st gregory vested as a bishop holding a gospel book and blessing with his right hand it is recorded that he permitted his depiction with a square halo then used for the living a dove is his attribute from the wellknown story attributed to his friend peter the deacon who tells that when the pope was dictating his homilies on ezechiel a curtain was drawn between his secretary and himself as however the pope remained silent for long periods at a time the servant made a hole in the curtain and looking through beheld a dove seated upon gregorys head with its beak between his lips when the dove withdrew its beak the pope spoke and the secretary took down his words but when he became silent the servant again applied his eye to the hole and saw the dove had replaced its beak between his lips this scene is shown as a version of the traditional evangelist portrait where the evangelists symbols are also sometimes shown dictating from the tenth century onwards an early example is the dedication miniature from an eleventhcentury manuscript of saint gregorys moralia in job the miniature shows the scribe bebo of seeon abbey presenting the manuscript to the holy roman emperor henry ii in the upper left the author is seen writing the text under divine inspiration usually the dove is shown whispering in gregorys ear for a clearer composition the anachronistic example at the top of this article is from the studio of carlo saraceni or by a close follower ca  from the giustiniani collection the painting is conserved in the galleria nazionale darte antica rome the face of gregory is a caricature of the features described by john the deacon mentioned under his early life above total baldness outthrust chin beaklike nose where john had described partial baldness a mildly protruding chin slightly aquiline nose and strikingly good looks in this picture also gregory has his monastic back on the world which the real gregory despite his reclusive intent was seldom allowed to have the mass of st gregory by robert campin th century the late medieval subject of the mass of st gregory shows a version of a thcentury story that was elaborated in later hagiography gregory is shown saying mass when christ as the man of sorrows appears on the altar the subject was most common in the th and th centuries and reflected growing emphasis on the real presence and after the protestant reformation was an assertion of the doctrine against protestant theology almsedit alms in christianity is defined by passages of the new testament such as matthew  which commands go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor  and come and follow me a donation on the other hand is a gift to some sort of enterprise profit or nonprofit on the one hand the alms of saint gregory are to be distinguished from his donations but on the other he probably saw no such distinction the church had no interest in secular profit and as pope gregory did his utmost to encourage that high standard among church personnel apart from maintaining its facilities and supporting its personnel the church gave most of the donations it received as alms gregory is known for his administrative system of charitable relief of the poor at rome they were predominantly refugees from the incursions of the lombards the philosophy under which he devised this system is that the wealth belonged to the poor and the church was only its steward he received lavish donations from the wealthy families of rome who following his own example were eager to expiate to god for their sins he gave alms equally as lavishly both individually and en masse he wrote in letters i have frequently charged you  to act as my representative  to relieve the poor in their distress   i hold the office of steward to the property of the poor  pope gregory the great the church received donations of many different kinds of property consumables such as food and clothing investment property real estate and works of art and capital goods or revenuegenerating property such as the sicilian latifundia or agricultural estates staffed and operated by slaves donated by gregory and his family the church already had a system for circulating the consumables to the poor associated with each parish was a diaconium or office of the deacon he was given a building from which the poor could at any time apply for assistance the state in which gregory became pope in  was a ruined one the lombards held the better part of italy their predations had brought the economy to a standstill they camped nearly at the gates of rome the city was packed with refugees from all walks of life who lived in the streets and had few of the necessities of life the seat of government was far from rome in constantinople which appeared unable to undertake the relief of italy the pope had sent emissaries including gregory asking for assistance to no avail in  gregory could wait for constantinople no longer he organized the resources of the church into an administration for general relief in doing so he evidenced a talent for and intuitive understanding of the principles of accounting which was not to be invented for centuries the church already had basic accounting documents every expense was recorded in journals called regesta lists of amounts recipients and circumstances revenue was recorded in polyptici books many of these polyptici were ledgers recording the operating expenses of the church and the assets the patrimonia a central papal administration the notarii under a chief the primicerius notariorum kept the ledgers and issued brevia patrimonii or lists of property for which each rector was responsible gregory began by aggressively requiring his churchmen to seek out and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not in a letter to a subordinate in sicily he wrote i asked you most of all to take care of the poor and if you knew of people in poverty you should have pointed them out  i desire that you give the woman pateria forty solidi for the childrens shoes and forty bushels of grain  soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a buildup to a great plan that he had in mind he understood that expenses must be matched by income to pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici the churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble money however was no substitute for food in a city that was on the brink of famine even the wealthy were going hungry in their villas the church now owned between  and  square miles  and  km of revenuegenerating farmland divided into large sections called patrimonia it produced goods of all kinds which were sold but gregory intervened and had the goods shipped to rome for distribution in the diaconia he gave orders to step up production set quotas and put an administrative structure in place to carry it out at the bottom was the rusticus who produced the goods some rustici were or owned slaves he turned over part of his produce to a conductor from whom he leased the land the latter reported to an actionarius the latter to a defensor and the latter to a rector grain wine cheese meat fish and oil began to arrive at rome in large quantities where it was given away for nothing as alms distributions to qualified persons were monthly however a certain proportion of the population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply to them gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons mainly monks every morning with prepared food it is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed when he did dine he shared the family table which he had saved and which still exists with  indigent guests to the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer these and other good deeds and charitable frame of mind completely won the hearts and minds of the roman people they now looked to the papacy for government ignoring the rump state at constantinople which had only disrespect for gregorycitation needed calling him a fool for his pacifist dealings with the lombards the office of urban prefect went without candidates from the time of gregory the great to the rise of italian nationalism the papacy was most influential in ruling italy famous quotes and anecdotesedit th century mosaic in westminster cathedral non angli sed angeli non angli sed angeli – they are not angles but angels aphorism summarizing words reported to have been spoken by gregory when he first encountered paleskinned english boys at a slave market sparking his dispatch of st augustine of canterbury to england to convert the english according to bede he said well named for they have angelic faces and ought to be coheirs with the angels in heaven discovering that their province was deira he went on to add that they would be rescued de ira from the wrath and that their king was named aella alleluia he said ecce locusta – look at the locust gregory himself wanted to go to england as a missionary and started out for there on the fourth day as they stopped for lunch a locust landed on the edge of the bible gregory was reading he exclaimed ecce locusta look at the locust but reflecting on it he saw it as a sign from heaven since the similarsounding loco sta means stay in place within the hour an emissary of the pope arrived to recall him i beg that you will not take the present amiss for anything however trifling which is offered from the prosperity of st peter should be regarded as a great blessing seeing that he will have power both to bestow on you greater things and to hold out to you eternal benefits with almighty god pro cuius amore in eius eloquio nec mihi parco – for the love of whom god i do not spare myself from his word the sense is that since the creator of the human race and redeemer of him unworthy gave him the power of the tongue so that he could witness what kind of a witness would he be if he did not use it but preferred to speak infirmly for the place of heretics is very pride itselffor the place of the wicked is pride just as conversely humility is the place of the good non enim pro locis res sed pro bonis rebus loca amanda sunt – things are not to be loved for the sake of a place but places are to be loved for the sake of their good things when augustine asked whether to use roman or gallican customs in the mass in england gregory said in paraphrase that it was not the place that imparted goodness but good things that graced the place and it was more important to be pleasing to the almighty they should pick out what was pia religiosa and recta from any church whatever and set that down before the english minds as practice for the rule of justice and reason suggests that one who desires his own orders to be observed by his successors should undoubtedly keep the will and ordinances of his predecessor in his letters gregory often emphasized the importance of giving proper deference to last wills and testaments and of respecting property rights compassion should be shown first to the faithful and afterwards to the enemies of the church at length being anxious to avoid all these inconveniences i sought the haven of the monastery… for as the vessel that is negligently moored is very often when the storm waxes violent tossed by the water out of its shelter on the safest shore so under the cloak of the ecclesiastical office i found myself plunged on a sudden in a sea of secular matters and because i had not held fast the tranquillity of the monastery when in possession i learnt by losing it how closely it should have been held in moralia sive expositio in job commentary on job also known as magna moralia gregory describes to the bishop leander the circumstances under which he became a

gregorius i c  –  march  commonly known as saint gregory the great was pope of the catholic church from  september  to his death in  gregory is famous for instigating the first recorded largescale mission from rome to convert a pagan people to christianity gregory is also well known for his writings which were more prolific than those of any of his predecessors as pope the epithet saint gregory the dialogist has been attached to him in eastern christianity because of his dialogues for this reason english translations of eastern texts will sometimes list him as gregory dialogos or the latinized equivalent dialogus a senators son and himself the prefect of rome at  gregory tried the monastery but soon returned to active public life ending his life and the century as pope although he was the first pope from a monastic background his prior political experiences may have helped him to be a talented administrator who successfully established papal supremacy during his papacy he greatly surpassed with his administration the emperors in improving the welfare of the people of rome and successfully challenged the theological views of patriarch eutychius of constantinople before the emperor tiberius ii gregory regained papal authority in spain and france and sent missionaries to england the realignment of barbarian allegiance to rome from their arian christian alliances shaped medieval europe gregory saw franks lombards and visigoths align with rome in religion throughout the middle ages he was known as the father of christian worship because of his exceptional efforts in revising the roman worship of his day his contributions to the development of the divine liturgy of the presanctified gifts still in use in the byzantine rite were so significant that he is generally recognized as its de facto author gregory is a doctor of the church and one of the latin fathers he is considered a saint in the catholic church eastern orthodox church anglican communion

usually estimated to be around the year  in the city of rome his parents named him gregorius which according to ælfric of abingdon in an homily on the birthday of s gregory  is a greek name sic which signifies in the latin tongue vigilantius that is in english watchful the medieval writer who provided this etymology did not hesitate to apply it to the life of gregory aelfric states he was very diligent in gods commandments gregory was born into a wealthy patrician roman family with close connections to the church his father gordianus who served as a senator and for a time was the prefect of the city of rome also held the position of regionarius in the church though nothing further is known about that position gregorys mother silvia was wellborn and had a married sister pateria in sicily his mother and two paternal aunts are honored by catholic and orthodox churches as saints gregorys greatgreatgrandfather had been pope felix iii the nominee of the gothic king theodoric gregorys election to the throne of st peter made his family the most distinguished clerical dynasty of the period the family owned and resided in a villa suburbana on the caelian hill fronting the same street now the via di san gregorio as the former palaces of the roman emperors on the palatine hill opposite the north of the street runs into the colosseum the south the circus maximus in gregorys day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned villas covered the area gregorys family also owned working estates in sicily and around rome gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the caelian and these were described  years later by john the deacon gordianus was tall with a long face and light eyes he wore a beard silvia was tall had a round face blue eyes and a cheerful look they had another son whose name and fate are unknown gregory was born into a period of upheaval in italy from  the socalled plague of justinian swept through the provinces of the empire including italy the plague caused famine panic and sometimes rioting in some parts of the country over  of the population was wiped out or destroyed with heavy spiritual and emotional effects on the people of the empire politically although the western roman empire had long since vanished in favour of the gothic kings of italy during the s italy was gradually retaken from the goths by justinian i emperor of the eastern roman empire ruling from constantinople as the fighting was mainly in the north the young gregory probably saw little of it totila sacked and vacated rome in  destroying most of its ancient population but in  he invited those who were still alive to return to the empty and ruined streets it has been hypothesized that young gregory and his parents retired during that intermission to their sicilian estates to return in  the war was over in rome by  and a subsequent invasion of the franks was defeated in  after that there was peace in italy and the appearance of restoration except that the central government now resided in constantinople like most young men of his position in roman society saint gregory was well educated learning grammar rhetoric the sciences literature and law and excelling in all gregory of tours reported that in grammar dialectic and rhetoric  he was second to none he wrote correct latin but did not read or write greek he knew latin authors natural science history mathematics and music and had such a fluency with imperial law that he may have trained in it as a preparation for a career in public life indeed he became a government official advancing quickly in rank to become like his father prefect of rome the highest civil office in the city when only thirtythree years old the monks of the monastery of st andrew established by gregory at the ancestral home on the caelian had a portrait of him made after his death which john the deacon also saw in the th century he reports the picture of a man who was rather bald and had a tawny beard like his fathers and a face that was intermediate in shape between his mothers and fathers the hair that he had on the sides was long and carefully curled his nose was thin and straight and slightly aquiline his forehead was high he had thick subdivided lips and a chin of a comely prominence and beautiful hands in the modern era gregory is often depicted as a man at the border poised between the roman and germanic worlds between east and west and above all perhaps between the ancient and medieval epochs monastic yearsedit jerome and gregory on his fathers death gregory converted his family villa into a monastery dedicated to the apostle saint andrew after his death it was rededicated as san gregorio magno al celio in his life of contemplation gregory concluded that in that silence of the heart while we keep watch within through contemplation we are as if asleep to all things that are without it seems to some that gregory was not always forgiving or pleasant for that matter even in his monastic years for example a monk lying on his death bed confessed to stealing three gold pieces gregory forced the monk to die friendless and alone then threw his body and coins on a manure heap to rot with a curse take your money with you to perdition gregory believed that punishment of sins can begin even on ones deathbed however at the monks death gregory offered  masses in his remembrance to assist his soul before the final judgment eventually pope pelagius ii ordained gregory a deacon and solicited his help in trying to heal the schism of the three chapters in northern italy however this schism was not healed until well after gregory was gone gregory had a deep respect for the monastic life he viewed being a monk as the ardent quest for the vision of our creator his three paternal aunts were nuns renowned for their sanctity however after the two eldest died after seeing a vision of their ancestor pope felix the youngest soon abandoned the religious life and married the steward of her estate gregorys response to this family scandal was many are called but few are chosen gregorys mother silvia herself is a saint apocrisiariate –edit illumination in a thcentury manuscript of a letter of gregorys to saint leander bishop of seville bibl municipale ms  dijon in  pelagius ii chose gregory as his apocrisiarius ambassador to the imperial court in constantinople a post gregory would hold until  gregory was part of the roman delegation both lay and clerical that arrived in constantinople in  to ask the emperor for military aid against the lombards with the byzantine military focused on the east these entreaties proved unsuccessful in  pelagius ii wrote to gregory as apocrisiarius detailing the hardships that rome was experiencing under the lombards and asking him to ask emperor maurice to send a relief force maurice however had long ago determined to limit his efforts against the lombards to intrigue and diplomacy pitting the franks against them it soon became obvious to gregory that the byzantine emperors were unlikely to send such a force given their more immediate difficulties with the persians in the east and the avars and slavs to the north according to ekonomou if gregorys principal task was to plead romes cause before the emperor there seems to have been little left for him to do once imperial policy toward italy became evident papal representatives who pressed their claims with excessive vigor could quickly become a nuisance and find themselves excluded from the imperial presence altogether gregory had already drawn an imperial rebuke for his lengthy canonical writings on the subject of the legitimacy of john iii scholasticus who had occupied the patriarchate of constantinople for twelve years prior to the return of eutychius who had been driven out by justinian gregory turned himself to cultivating connections with the byzantine elite of the city where he became extremely popular with the citys upper class especially aristocratic women ekonomou surmises that while gregory may have become spiritual father to a large and important segment of constantinoples aristocracy this relationship did not significantly advance the interests of rome before the emperor although the writings of john the deacon claim that gregory labored diligently for the relief of italy there is no evidence that his tenure accomplished much towards any of the objectives of pelagius ii gregorys theological disputes with patriarch eutychius would leave a bitter taste for the theological speculation of the east with gregory that continued to influence him well into his own papacy according to western sources gregorys very public debate with eutychius culminated in an exchange before tiberius ii where gregory cited a biblical passage palpate et videte quia spiritus carnem et ossa non habet sicut me videtis habere in support of the view that christ was corporeal and palpable after his resurrection allegedly as a result of this exchange tiberius ii ordered eutychiuss writings burned ekonomou views this argument though exaggerated in western sources as gregorys one achievement of an otherwise fruitless apokrisiariat in reality gregory was forced to rely on scripture because he could not read the untranslated greek authoritative works gregory left constantinople for rome in  returning to his monastery on the caelian hill gregory was elected by acclamation to succeed pelagius ii in  when the latter died of the plague spreading through the city gregory was approved by an imperial iussio from constantinople the following september as was the norm during the byzantine papacy papacy –edit saint gregory the great pope dialogist church father monk and doctor of the church

gregory i papal styles of pope gregory i reference style his holiness spoken style your holiness religious style holy father posthumous style saint although gregory was resolved to retire into the monastic lifestyle of contemplation he was unwillingly forced back into a world that although he loved he no longer wanted to be a part of in texts of all genres especially those produced in his first year as pope gregory bemoaned the burden of office and mourned the loss of the undisturbed life of prayer he had once enjoyed as a monk when he became pope in  among his first acts was writing a series of letters disavowing any ambition to the throne of peter and praising the contemplative life of the monks at that time for various reasons the holy see had not exerted effective leadership in the west since the pontificate of gelasius i the episcopacy in gaul was drawn from the great territorial families and identified with them the parochial horizon of gregorys contemporary gregory of tours may be considered typical in visigothic spain the bishops had little contact with rome in italy the territories which had de facto fallen under the administration of the papacy were beset by the violent lombard dukes and the rivalry of the byzantines in the exarchate of ravenna and in the south pope gregory had strong convictions on missions almighty god places good men in authority that he may impart through them the gifts of his mercy to their subjects and this we find to be the case with the british over whom you have been appointed to rule that through the blessings bestowed on you the blessings of heaven might be bestowed on your people also he is credited with reenergizing the churchs missionary work among the nonchristian peoples of northern europe he is most famous for sending a mission often called the gregorian mission under augustine of canterbury prior of saint andrews where he had perhaps succeeded gregory to evangelize the pagan anglosaxons of england it seems that the pope had never forgotten the english slaves whom he had once seen in the roman forum the mission was successful and it was from england that missionaries later set out for the netherlands and germany the preaching of nonheretical christian faith and the elimination of all deviations from it was a key element in gregorys worldview and it constituted one of the major continuing policies of his pontificate according to the catholic encyclopedia he was declared a saint immediately after his death by popular acclamation in his official documents gregory was the first to make extensive use of the term servant of the servants of god servus servorum dei as a papal title thus initiating a practice that was to be followed by most subsequent popes worksedit part of a series on catholic

things changing a few adding some in letters gregory remarks that he moved the pater noster our father to immediately after the roman canon and immediately before the fraction this position is still maintained today in the roman liturgy the pregregorian position is evident in the ambrosian rite gregory added material to the hanc igitur of the roman canon and established the nine kyries a vestigial remnant of the litany which was originally at that place at the beginning of mass he also reduced the role of deacons in the roman liturgy sacramentaries directly influenced by gregorian reforms are referred to as sacrementaria gregoriana roman and other western liturgies since this era have a number of prayers that change to reflect the feast or liturgical season these variations are visible in the collects and prefaces as well as in the roman canon itself divine liturgy of the presanctified giftsedit in the eastern orthodox church and eastern catholic churches gregory is credited as the primary influence in constructing the more penitential divine liturgy of the presanctified gifts a fully separate form of the divine liturgy in the byzantine rite adapted to the needs of the season of great lent its roman rite equivalent is the mass of the presanctified used only on good friday the syriac liturgy of the presanctified gifts continues to be used in the malankara rite a variant of the west syrian rite historically practiced in the malankara church of india and now practiced by the several churches that descended from it and at some occasions in the assyrian church of the east gregorian chantedit main article gregorian chant the mainstream form of western plainchant standardized in the late th century was attributed to pope gregory i and so took the name of gregorian chant the earliest such attribution is in john the deacons  biography of gregory almost three centuries after the popes death and the chant that bears his name is the result of the fusion of roman and frankish elements which took place in the francogerman empire under pepin charlemagne and their successors writingsedit saint gregory the great by josé de ribera gregory is commonly credited with founding the medieval papacy and so many attribute the beginning of medieval spirituality to him gregory is the only pope between the fifth and the eleventh centuries whose correspondence and writings have survived enough to form a comprehensive corpus some of his writings are commentary on job frequently known in englishlanguage histories by its latin title magna moralia or as moralia on job this is one of the longest patristic works it was possibly finished as early as  it is based on talks gregory gave on the book of job to his brethren who accompanied him to constantinople the work as we have it is the result of gregorys revision and completion of it soon after his accession to the papal office liber regulae pastoralis book of pastoral rule  the rule for pastors in which he contrasted the role of bishops as pastors of their flock with their position as nobles of the church the definitive statement of the nature of the episcopal office this was probably begun before his election as pope and finished in  dialogues a collection of four books of miracles signs wonders and healings done by the holy men mostly monastic of sixthcentury italy with the second book entirely devoted to a popular life of saint benedict sermons including the sermons include the  homilae in hiezechielem homilies on ezekiel dealing with ezekiel  in book one and ezekiel  in book  these were preached during  the years that the lombards besieged rome and contain some of gregorys most profound mystical teachings they were revised eight years later the homilae xl in evangelia forty homilies on the gospels for the liturgical year delivered during  and  which were seemingly finished by  a papyrus fragment from this codex survives in the british museum london uk expositio in canticis canticorum only  of these sermons on the song of songs survive discussing the text up to song  in librum primum regum expositio commentary on  kings copies of some  letters have survived during gregorys time copies of papal letters were made by scribes into a registrum register which was then kept in the scrinium it is known that in the th century when john the deacon composed his life of gregory the registrum of gregorys letters was formed of  papyrus rolls though it is difficult to estimate how many letters this may have represented though these original rolls are now lost the  letters have survived in copies made at various later times the largest single batch of  letters being made by order of adrian i  the majority of the copies dating from the th to the th century are stored in the vatican library gregory wrote over  letters in the last  years of his life – that give us an accurate picture of his work a truly autobiographical presentation is nearly impossible for gregory the development of his mind and personality remains purely speculative in nature opinions of the writings of gregory vary his character strikes us as an ambiguous and enigmatic one the jewish canadianamerican popularist cantor observed on the one hand he was an able and determined administrator a skilled and clever diplomat a leader of the greatest sophistication and vision but on the other hand he appears in his writings as a superstitious and credulous monk hostile to learning crudely limited as a theologian and excessively devoted to saints miracles and relics controversy with eutychiusedit in constantinople gregory took issue with the aged patriarch eutychius of constantinople who had recently published a treatise now lost on the general resurrection eutychius maintained that the resurrected body will be more subtle than air and no longer palpable gregory opposed with the palpability of the risen christ in luke  as the dispute could not be settled the byzantine emperor tiberius ii constantine undertook to arbitrate he decided in favor of palpability and ordered eutychius book to be burned shortly after both gregory and eutychius became ill gregory recovered but eutychius died on  april  at age  on his deathbed eutychius recanted impalpability and gregory dropped the matter tiberius also died a few months after eutychius identification of three figures in the gospelsedit gregory was among those who identified mary magdalene with mary of bethany whom john  recounts as having anointed jesus with precious ointment an event that some interpret as being the same as the anointing of jesus performed by a woman that luke alone among the synoptic gospels recounts as sinful preaching on the passage in the gospel of luke gregory remarked this woman whom luke calls a sinner and john calls mary i think is the mary from whom mark reports that seven demons were cast out today biblical scholars distinguish the three figures but they are all still popularly identified iconographyedit gregory and his dove corpus christi college cambridge ms  in art gregory is usually shown in full pontifical robes with the tiara and double cross despite his actual habit of dress earlier depictions are more likely to show a monastic tonsure and plainer dress orthodox icons traditionally show st gregory vested as a bishop holding a gospel book and blessing with his right hand it is recorded that he permitted his depiction with a square halo then used for the living a dove is his attribute from the wellknown story attributed to his friend peter the deacon who tells that when the pope was dictating his homilies on ezechiel a curtain was drawn between his secretary and himself as however the pope remained silent for long periods at a time the servant made a hole in the curtain and looking through beheld a dove seated upon gregorys head with its beak between his lips when the dove withdrew its beak the pope spoke and the secretary took down his words but when he became silent the servant again applied his eye to the hole and saw the dove had replaced its beak between his lips this scene is shown as a version of the traditional evangelist portrait where the evangelists symbols are also sometimes shown dictating from the tenth century onwards an early example is the dedication miniature from an eleventhcentury manuscript of saint gregorys moralia in job the miniature shows the scribe bebo of seeon abbey presenting the manuscript to the holy roman emperor henry ii in the upper left the author is seen writing the text under divine inspiration usually the dove is shown whispering in gregorys ear for a clearer composition the anachronistic example at the top of this article is from the studio of carlo saraceni or by a close follower ca  from the giustiniani collection the painting is conserved in the galleria nazionale darte antica rome the face of gregory is a caricature of the features described by john the deacon mentioned under his early life above total baldness outthrust chin beaklike nose where john had described partial baldness a mildly protruding chin slightly aquiline nose and strikingly good looks in this picture also gregory has his monastic back on the world which the real gregory despite his reclusive intent was seldom allowed to have the mass of st gregory by robert campin th century the late medieval subject of the mass of st gregory shows a version of a thcentury story that was elaborated in later hagiography gregory is shown saying mass when christ as the man of sorrows appears on the altar the subject was most common in the th and th centuries and reflected growing emphasis on the real presence and after the protestant reformation was an assertion of the doctrine against protestant theology almsedit alms in christianity is defined by passages of the new testament such as matthew  which commands go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor  and come and follow me a donation on the other hand is a gift to some sort of enterprise profit or nonprofit on the one hand the alms of saint gregory are to be distinguished from his donations but on the other he probably saw no such distinction the church had no interest in secular profit and as pope gregory did his utmost to encourage that high standard among church personnel apart from maintaining its facilities and supporting its personnel the church gave most of the donations it received as alms gregory is known for his administrative system of charitable relief of the poor at rome they were predominantly refugees from the incursions of the lombards the philosophy under which he devised this system is that the wealth belonged to the poor and the church was only its steward he received lavish donations from the wealthy families of rome who following his own example were eager to expiate to god for their sins he gave alms equally as lavishly both individually and en masse he wrote in letters i have frequently charged you  to act as my representative  to relieve the poor in their distress   i hold the office of steward to the property of the poor  pope gregory the great the church received donations of many different kinds of property consumables such as food and clothing investment property real estate and works of art and capital goods or revenuegenerating property such as the sicilian latifundia or agricultural estates staffed and operated by slaves donated by gregory and his family the church already had a system for circulating the consumables to the poor associated with each parish was a diaconium or office of the deacon he was given a building from which the poor could at any time apply for assistance the state in which gregory became pope in  was a ruined one the lombards held the better part of italy their predations had brought the economy to a standstill they camped nearly at the gates of rome the city was packed with refugees from all walks of life who lived in the streets and had few of the necessities of life the seat of government was far from rome in constantinople which appeared unable to undertake the relief of italy the pope had sent emissaries including gregory asking for assistance to no avail in  gregory could wait for constantinople no longer he organized the resources of the church into an administration for general relief in doing so he evidenced a talent for and intuitive understanding of the principles of accounting which was not to be invented for centuries the church already had basic accounting documents every expense was recorded in journals called regesta lists of amounts recipients and circumstances revenue was recorded in polyptici books many of these polyptici were ledgers recording the operating expenses of the church and the assets the patrimonia a central papal administration the notarii under a chief the primicerius notariorum kept the ledgers and issued brevia patrimonii or lists of property for which each rector was responsible gregory began by aggressively requiring his churchmen to seek out and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not in a letter to a subordinate in sicily he wrote i asked you most of all to take care of the poor and if you knew of people in poverty you should have pointed them out  i desire that you give the woman pateria forty solidi for the childrens shoes and forty bushels of grain  soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a buildup to a great plan that he had in mind he understood that expenses must be matched by income to pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici the churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble money however was no substitute for food in a city that was on the brink of famine even the wealthy were going hungry in their villas the church now owned between  and  square miles  and  km of revenuegenerating farmland divided into large sections called patrimonia it produced goods of all kinds which were sold but gregory intervened and had the goods shipped to rome for distribution in the diaconia he gave orders to step up production set quotas and put an administrative structure in place to carry it out at the bottom was the rusticus who produced the goods some rustici were or owned slaves he turned over part of his produce to a conductor from whom he leased the land the latter reported to an actionarius the latter to a defensor and the latter to a rector grain wine cheese meat fish and oil began to arrive at rome in large quantities where it was given away for nothing as alms distributions to qualified persons were monthly however a certain proportion of the population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply to them gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons mainly monks every morning with prepared food it is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed when he did dine he shared the family table which he had saved and which still exists with  indigent guests to the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer these and other good deeds and charitable frame of mind completely won the hearts and minds of the roman people they now looked to the papacy for government ignoring the rump state at constantinople which had only disrespect for gregorycitation needed calling him a fool for his pacifist dealings with the lombards the office of urban prefect went without candidates from the time of gregory the great to the rise of italian nationalism the papacy was most influential in ruling italy famous quotes and anecdotesedit th century mosaic in westminster cathedral non angli sed angeli non angli sed angeli – they are not angles but angels aphorism summarizing words reported to have been spoken by gregory when he first encountered paleskinned english boys at a slave market sparking his dispatch of st augustine of canterbury to england to convert the english according to bede he said well named for they have angelic faces and ought to be coheirs with the angels in heaven discovering that their province was deira he went on to add that they would be rescued de ira from the wrath and that their king was named aella alleluia he said ecce locusta – look at the locust gregory himself wanted to go to england as a missionary and started out for there on the fourth day as they stopped for lunch a locust landed on the edge of the bible gregory was reading he exclaimed ecce locusta look at the locust but reflecting on it he saw it as a sign from heaven since the similarsounding loco sta means stay in place within the hour an emissary of the pope arrived to recall him i beg that you will not take the present amiss for anything however trifling which is offered from the prosperity of st peter should be regarded as a great blessing seeing that he will have power both to bestow on you greater things and to hold out to you eternal benefits with almighty god pro cuius amore in eius eloquio nec mihi parco – for the love of whom god i do not spare myself from his word the sense is that since the creator of the human race and redeemer of him unworthy gave him the power of the tongue so that he could witness what kind of a witness would he be if he did not use it but preferred to speak infirmly for the place of heretics is very pride itselffor the place of the wicked is pride just as conversely humility is the place of the good non enim pro locis res sed pro bonis rebus loca amanda sunt – things are not to be loved for the sake of a place but places are to be loved for the sake of their good things when augustine asked whether to use roman or gallican customs in the mass in england gregory said in paraphrase that it was not the place that imparted goodness but good things that graced the place and it was more important to be pleasing to the almighty they should pick out what was pia religiosa and recta from any church whatever and set that down before the english minds as practice for the rule of justice and reason suggests that one who desires his own orders to be observed by his successors should undoubtedly keep the will and ordinances of his predecessor in his letters gregory often emphasized the importance of giving proper deference to last wills and testaments and of respecting property rights compassion should be shown first to the faithful and afterwards to the enemies of the church at length being anxious to avoid all these inconveniences i

gregorius i c  –  march  commonly known as saint gregory the great was pope of the catholic church from  september  to his death in  gregory is famous for instigating the first recorded largescale mission from rome to convert a pagan people to christianity gregory is also well known for his writings which were more prolific than those of any of his predecessors as pope the epithet saint gregory the dialogist has been attached to him in eastern christianity because of his dialogues for this reason english translations of eastern texts will sometimes list him as gregory dialogos or the latinized equivalent dialogus a senators son and himself the prefect of rome at  gregory tried the monastery but soon returned to active public life ending his life and the century as pope although he was the first pope from a monastic background his prior political experiences may have helped him to be a talented administrator who successfully established papal supremacy during his papacy he greatly surpassed with his administration the emperors in improving the welfare of the people of rome and successfully challenged the theological views of patriarch eutychius of constantinople before the emperor tiberius ii gregory regained papal authority in spain and france and sent missionaries to england the realignment of barbarian allegiance to rome from their arian christian alliances shaped medieval europe gregory saw franks lombards and visigoths align with rome in religion throughout the middle ages he was known as the father of christian worship because of his exceptional efforts in revising the roman worship of his day his contributions to the development of the divine liturgy of the presanctified gifts still in use in the byzantine rite were so significant that he is generally recognized as its de facto author gregory is a doctor of the church and one of the latin fathers he is considered a saint in the catholic church eastern orthodox church anglican communion

usually estimated to be around the year  in the city of rome his parents named him gregorius which according to ælfric of abingdon in an homily on the birthday of s gregory  is a greek name sic which signifies in the latin tongue vigilantius that is in english watchful the medieval writer who provided this etymology did not hesitate to apply it to the life of gregory aelfric states he was very diligent in gods commandments gregory was born into a wealthy patrician roman family with close connections to the church his father gordianus who served as a senator and for a time was the prefect of the city of rome also held the position of regionarius in the church though nothing further is known about that position gregorys mother silvia was wellborn and had a married sister pateria in sicily his mother and two paternal aunts are honored by catholic and orthodox churches as saints gregorys greatgreatgrandfather had been pope felix iii the nominee of the gothic king theodoric gregorys election to the throne of st peter made his family the most distinguished clerical dynasty of the period the family owned and resided in a villa suburbana on the caelian hill fronting the same street now the via di san gregorio as the former palaces of the roman emperors on the palatine hill opposite the north of the street runs into the colosseum the south the circus maximus in gregorys day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned villas covered the area gregorys family also owned working estates in sicily and around rome gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the caelian and these were described  years later by john the deacon gordianus was tall with a long face and light eyes he wore a beard silvia was tall had a round face blue eyes and a cheerful look they had another son whose name and fate are unknown gregory was born into a period of upheaval in italy from  the socalled plague of justinian swept through the provinces of the empire including italy the plague caused famine panic and sometimes rioting in some parts of the country over  of the population was wiped out or destroyed with heavy spiritual and emotional effects on the people of the empire politically although the western roman empire had long since vanished in favour of the gothic kings of italy during the s italy was gradually retaken from the goths by justinian i emperor of the eastern roman empire ruling from constantinople as the fighting was mainly in the north the young gregory probably saw little of it totila sacked and vacated rome in  destroying most of its ancient population but in  he invited those who were still alive to return to the empty and ruined streets it has been hypothesized that young gregory and his parents retired during that intermission to their sicilian estates to return in  the war was over in rome by  and a subsequent invasion of the franks was defeated in  after that there was peace in italy and the appearance of restoration except that the central government now resided in constantinople like most young men of his position in roman society saint gregory was well educated learning grammar rhetoric the sciences literature and law and excelling in all gregory of tours reported that in grammar dialectic and rhetoric  he was second to none he wrote correct latin but did not read or write greek he knew latin authors natural science history mathematics and music and had such a fluency with imperial law that he may have trained in it as a preparation for a career in public life indeed he became a government official advancing quickly in rank to become like his father prefect of rome the highest civil office in the city when only thirtythree years old the monks of the monastery of st andrew established by gregory at the ancestral home on the caelian had a portrait of him made after his death which john the deacon also saw in the th century he reports the picture of a man who was rather bald and had a tawny beard like his fathers and a face that was intermediate in shape between his mothers and fathers the hair that he had on the sides was long and carefully curled his nose was thin and straight and slightly aquiline his forehead was high he had thick subdivided lips and a chin of a comely prominence and beautiful hands in the modern era gregory is often depicted as a man at the border poised between the roman and germanic worlds between east and west and above all perhaps between the ancient and medieval epochs monastic yearsedit jerome and gregory on his fathers death gregory converted his family villa into a monastery dedicated to the apostle saint andrew after his death it was rededicated as san gregorio magno al celio in his life of contemplation gregory concluded that in that silence of the heart while we keep watch within through contemplation we are as if asleep to all things that are without it seems to some that gregory was not always forgiving or pleasant for that matter even in his monastic years for example a monk lying on his death bed confessed to stealing three gold pieces gregory forced the monk to die friendless and alone then threw his body and coins on a manure heap to rot with a curse take your money with you to perdition gregory believed that punishment of sins can begin even on ones deathbed however at the monks death gregory offered  masses in his remembrance to assist his soul before the final judgment eventually pope pelagius ii ordained gregory a deacon and solicited his help in trying to heal the schism of the three chapters in northern italy however this schism was not healed until well after gregory was gone gregory had a deep respect for the monastic life he viewed being a monk as the ardent quest for the vision of our creator his three paternal aunts were nuns renowned for their sanctity however after the two eldest died after seeing a vision of their ancestor pope felix the youngest soon abandoned the religious life and married the steward of her estate gregorys response to this family scandal was many are called but few are chosen gregorys mother silvia herself is a saint apocrisiariate –edit illumination in a thcentury manuscript of a letter of gregorys to saint leander bishop of seville bibl municipale ms  dijon in  pelagius ii chose gregory as his apocrisiarius ambassador to the imperial court in constantinople a post gregory would hold until  gregory was part of the roman delegation both lay and clerical that arrived in constantinople in  to ask the emperor for military aid against the lombards with the byzantine military focused on the east these entreaties proved unsuccessful in  pelagius ii wrote to gregory as apocrisiarius detailing the hardships that rome was experiencing under the lombards and asking him to ask emperor maurice to send a relief force maurice however had long ago determined to limit his efforts against the lombards to intrigue and diplomacy pitting the franks against them it soon became obvious to gregory that the byzantine emperors were unlikely to send such a force given their more immediate difficulties with the persians in the east and the avars and slavs to the north according to ekonomou if gregorys principal task was to plead romes cause before the emperor there seems to have been little left for him to do once imperial policy toward italy became evident papal representatives who pressed their claims with excessive vigor could quickly become a nuisance and find themselves excluded from the imperial presence altogether gregory had already drawn an imperial rebuke for his lengthy canonical writings on the subject of the legitimacy of john iii scholasticus who had occupied the patriarchate of constantinople for twelve years prior to the return of eutychius who had been driven out by justinian gregory turned himself to cultivating connections with the byzantine elite of the city where he became extremely popular with the citys upper class especially aristocratic women ekonomou surmises that while gregory may have become spiritual father to a large and important segment of constantinoples aristocracy this relationship did not significantly advance the interests of rome before the emperor although the writings of john the deacon claim that gregory labored diligently for the relief of italy there is no evidence that his tenure accomplished much towards any of the objectives of pelagius ii gregorys theological disputes with patriarch eutychius would leave a bitter taste for the theological speculation of the east with gregory that continued to influence him well into his own papacy according to western sources gregorys very public debate with eutychius culminated in an exchange before tiberius ii where gregory cited a biblical passage palpate et videte quia spiritus carnem et ossa non habet sicut me videtis habere in support of the view that christ was corporeal and palpable after his resurrection allegedly as a result of this exchange tiberius ii ordered eutychiuss writings burned ekonomou views this argument though exaggerated in western sources as gregorys one achievement of an otherwise fruitless apokrisiariat in reality gregory was forced to rely on scripture because he could not read the untranslated greek authoritative works gregory left constantinople for rome in  returning to his monastery on the caelian hill gregory was elected by acclamation to succeed pelagius ii in  when the latter died of the plague spreading through the city gregory was approved by an imperial iussio from constantinople the following september as was the norm during the byzantine papacy papacy –edit saint gregory the great pope dialogist church father monk and doctor of the church

gregory i papal styles of pope gregory i reference style his holiness spoken style your holiness religious style holy father posthumous style saint although gregory was resolved to retire into the monastic lifestyle of contemplation he was unwillingly forced back into a world that although he loved he no longer wanted to be a part of in texts of all genres especially those produced in his first year as pope gregory bemoaned the burden of office and mourned the loss of the undisturbed life of prayer he had once enjoyed as a monk when he became pope in  among his first acts was writing a series of letters disavowing any ambition to the throne of peter and praising the contemplative life of the monks at that time for various reasons the holy see had not exerted effective leadership in the west since the pontificate of gelasius i the episcopacy in gaul was drawn from the great territorial families and identified with them the parochial horizon of gregorys contemporary gregory of tours may be considered typical in visigothic spain the bishops had little contact with rome in italy the territories which had de facto fallen under the administration of the papacy were beset by the violent lombard dukes and the rivalry of the byzantines in the exarchate of ravenna and in the south pope gregory had strong convictions on missions almighty god places good men in authority that he may impart through them the gifts of his mercy to their subjects and this we find to be the case with the british over whom you have been appointed to rule that through the blessings bestowed on you the blessings of heaven might be bestowed on your people also he is credited with reenergizing the churchs missionary work among the nonchristian peoples of northern europe he is most famous for sending a mission often called the gregorian mission under augustine of canterbury prior of saint andrews where he had perhaps succeeded gregory to evangelize the pagan anglosaxons of england it seems that the pope had never forgotten the english slaves whom he had once seen in the roman forum the mission was successful and it was from england that missionaries later set out for the netherlands and germany the preaching of nonheretical christian faith and the elimination of all deviations from it was a key element in gregorys worldview and it constituted one of the major continuing policies of his pontificate according to the catholic encyclopedia he was declared a saint immediately after his death by popular acclamation in his official documents gregory was the first to make extensive use of the term servant of the servants of god servus servorum dei as a papal title thus initiating a practice that was to be followed by most subsequent popes worksedit part of a series on catholic

things changing a few adding some in letters gregory remarks that he moved the pater noster our father to immediately after the roman canon and immediately before the fraction this position is still maintained today in the roman liturgy the pregregorian position is evident in the ambrosian rite gregory added material to the hanc igitur of the roman canon and established the nine kyries a vestigial remnant of the litany which was originally at that place at the beginning of mass he also reduced the role of deacons in the roman liturgy sacramentaries directly influenced by gregorian reforms are referred to as sacrementaria gregoriana roman and other western liturgies since this era have a number of prayers that change to reflect the feast or liturgical season these variations are visible in the collects and prefaces as well as in the roman canon itself divine liturgy of the presanctified giftsedit in the eastern orthodox church and eastern catholic churches gregory is credited as the primary influence in constructing the more penitential divine liturgy of the presanctified gifts a fully separate form of the divine liturgy in the byzantine rite adapted to the needs of the season of great lent its roman rite equivalent is the mass of the presanctified used only on good friday the syriac liturgy of the presanctified gifts continues to be used in the malankara rite a

the east gregorian chantedit main article gregorian chant the mainstream form of western plainchant standardized in the late th century was attributed to pope gregory i and so took the name of gregorian chant the earliest such attribution is in john the deacons  biography of gregory almost three centuries after the popes death and the chant that bears his name is the result of the fusion of roman and frankish elements which took place in the francogerman empire under pepin charlemagne and their successors writingsedit saint gregory the great by josé de ribera gregory is commonly credited with founding the medieval papacy and so many attribute the beginning of medieval spirituality to him gregory is the only pope between the fifth and the eleventh centuries whose correspondence and writings have survived enough to form a comprehensive corpus some of his writings are commentary on job frequently known in englishlanguage histories by its latin title magna moralia or as moralia on job this is one of the longest patristic works it was possibly finished as early as  it is based on talks gregory gave on the book of job to his brethren who accompanied him to constantinople the work as we have it is the result of gregorys revision and completion of it soon after his accession to the papal office liber regulae pastoralis book of pastoral rule  the rule for pastors in which he contrasted the role of bishops as pastors of their flock with their position as nobles of the church the definitive statement of the nature of the episcopal office this was probably begun before his election as pope and finished in  dialogues a collection of four books of miracles signs wonders and healings done by the holy men mostly monastic of sixthcentury italy with the second book entirely devoted to a popular life of saint benedict sermons including the sermons include the  homilae in hiezechielem homilies on ezekiel dealing with ezekiel  in book one and ezekiel  in book  these were preached during  the years that the lombards besieged rome and contain some of gregorys most profound mystical teachings they were revised eight years later the homilae xl in evangelia forty homilies on the gospels for the liturgical year delivered during  and  which were seemingly finished by  a papyrus fragment from this codex survives in the british museum london uk expositio in canticis canticorum only  of these sermons on the song of songs survive discussing the text up to song  in librum primum regum expositio commentary on  kings copies of some  letters have survived during gregorys time copies of papal letters were made by scribes into a registrum register which was then kept in the scrinium it is known that in the th century when john the deacon composed his life of gregory the registrum of gregorys letters was formed of  papyrus rolls though it is difficult to estimate how many letters this may have represented though these original rolls are now lost the  letters have survived in copies made at various later times the largest single batch of  letters being made by order of adrian i  the majority of the copies dating from the th to the th century are stored in the vatican library gregory wrote over  letters in the last  years of his life – that give us an accurate picture of his work a truly autobiographical presentation is nearly impossible for gregory the development of his mind and personality remains purely speculative in nature opinions of the writings of gregory vary his character strikes us as an ambiguous and enigmatic one the jewish canadianamerican popularist cantor observed on the one hand he was an able and determined administrator a skilled and clever diplomat a leader of the greatest sophistication and vision but on the other hand he appears in his writings as a superstitious and credulous monk hostile to learning crudely limited as a theologian and excessively devoted to saints miracles and relics controversy with eutychiusedit in constantinople gregory took issue with the aged patriarch eutychius of constantinople who had recently published a treatise now lost on the general resurrection eutychius maintained that the resurrected body will be more subtle than air and no longer palpable gregory opposed with the palpability of the risen christ in luke  as the dispute could not be settled the byzantine emperor tiberius ii constantine undertook to arbitrate he decided in favor of palpability and ordered eutychius book to be burned shortly after both gregory and eutychius became ill gregory recovered but eutychius died on  april  at age  on his deathbed eutychius recanted impalpability and gregory dropped the matter tiberius also died a few months after eutychius identification of three figures in the gospelsedit gregory was among those who identified mary magdalene with mary of bethany whom john  recounts as having anointed jesus with precious ointment an event that some interpret as being the same as the anointing of jesus performed by a woman that luke alone among the synoptic gospels recounts as sinful preaching on the passage in the gospel of luke gregory remarked this woman whom luke calls a sinner and john calls mary i think is the mary from whom mark reports that seven demons were cast out today biblical scholars distinguish the three figures but they are all still popularly identified iconographyedit gregory and his dove corpus christi college cambridge ms  in art gregory is usually shown in full pontifical robes with the tiara and double cross despite his actual habit of dress earlier depictions are more likely to show a monastic tonsure and plainer dress orthodox icons traditionally show st gregory vested as a bishop holding a gospel book and blessing with his right hand it is recorded that he permitted his depiction with a square halo then used for the living a dove is his attribute from the wellknown story attributed to his friend peter the deacon who tells that when the pope was dictating his homilies on ezechiel a curtain was drawn between his secretary and himself as however the pope remained silent for long periods at a time the servant made a hole in the curtain and looking through beheld a dove seated upon gregorys head with its beak between his lips when the dove withdrew its beak the pope spoke and the secretary took down his words but when he became silent the servant again applied his eye to the hole and saw the dove had replaced its beak between his lips this scene is shown as a version of the traditional evangelist portrait where the evangelists symbols are also sometimes shown dictating from the tenth century onwards an early example is the dedication miniature from an eleventhcentury manuscript of saint gregorys moralia in job the miniature shows the scribe bebo of seeon abbey presenting the manuscript to the holy roman emperor henry ii in the upper left the author is seen writing the text under divine inspiration usually the dove is shown whispering in gregorys ear for a clearer composition the anachronistic example at the top of this article is from the studio of carlo saraceni or by a close follower ca  from the giustiniani collection the painting is conserved in the galleria nazionale darte antica rome the face of gregory is a caricature of the features described by john the deacon mentioned under his early life above total baldness outthrust chin beaklike nose where john had described partial baldness a mildly protruding chin slightly aquiline nose and strikingly good looks in this picture also gregory has his monastic back on the world which the real gregory despite his reclusive intent was seldom allowed to have the mass of st gregory by robert campin th century the late medieval subject of the mass of st gregory shows a version of a thcentury story that was elaborated in later hagiography gregory is shown saying mass when christ as the man of sorrows appears on the altar the subject was most common in the th and th centuries and reflected growing emphasis on the real presence and after the protestant reformation was an assertion of the doctrine against protestant theology almsedit alms in christianity is defined by passages of the new testament such as matthew  which commands go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor  and come and follow me a donation on the other hand is a gift to some sort of enterprise profit or nonprofit on the one hand the alms of saint gregory are to be distinguished from his donations but on the other he probably saw no such distinction the church had no interest in secular profit and as pope gregory did his utmost to encourage that high standard among church personnel apart from maintaining its facilities and supporting its personnel the church gave most of the donations it received as alms gregory is known for his administrative system of charitable relief of the poor at rome they were predominantly refugees from the incursions of the lombards the philosophy under which he devised this system is that the wealth belonged to the poor and the church was only its steward he received lavish donations from the wealthy families of rome who following his own example were eager to expiate to god for their sins he gave alms equally as lavishly both individually and en masse he wrote in letters i have frequently charged you  to act as my representative  to relieve the poor in their distress   i hold the office of steward to the property of the poor  pope gregory the great the church received donations of many different kinds of property consumables such as food and clothing investment property real estate and works of art and capital goods or revenuegenerating property such as the sicilian latifundia or agricultural estates staffed and operated by slaves donated by gregory and his family the church already had a system for circulating the consumables to the poor associated with each parish was a diaconium or office of the deacon he was given a building from which the poor could at any time apply for assistance the state in which gregory became pope in  was a ruined one the lombards held the better part of italy their predations had brought the economy to a standstill they camped nearly at the gates of rome the city was packed with refugees from all walks of life who lived in the streets and had few of the necessities of life the seat of government was far from rome in constantinople which appeared unable to undertake the relief of italy the pope had sent emissaries including gregory asking for assistance to no avail in  gregory could wait for constantinople no longer he organized the resources of the church into an administration for general relief in doing so he evidenced a talent for and intuitive understanding of the principles of accounting which was not to be invented for centuries the church already had basic accounting documents every expense was recorded in journals called regesta lists of amounts recipients and circumstances revenue was recorded in polyptici books many of these polyptici were ledgers recording the operating expenses of the church and the assets the patrimonia a central papal administration the notarii under a chief the primicerius notariorum kept the ledgers and issued brevia patrimonii or lists of property for which each rector was responsible gregory began by aggressively requiring his churchmen to seek out and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not in a letter to a subordinate in sicily he wrote i asked you most of all to take care of the poor and if you knew of people in poverty you should have pointed them out  i desire that you give the woman pateria forty solidi for the childrens shoes and forty bushels of grain  soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a buildup to a great plan that he had in mind he understood that expenses must be matched by income to pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici the churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble money however was no substitute for food in a city that was on the brink of famine even the wealthy were going hungry in their villas the church now owned between  and  square miles  and  km of revenuegenerating farmland divided into large sections called patrimonia it produced goods of all kinds which were sold but gregory intervened and had the goods shipped to rome for distribution in the diaconia he gave orders to step up production set quotas and put an administrative structure in place to carry it out at the bottom was the rusticus who produced the goods some rustici were or owned slaves he turned over part of his produce to a conductor from whom he leased the land the latter reported to an actionarius the latter to a defensor and the latter to a rector grain wine cheese meat fish and oil began to arrive at rome in large quantities where it was given away for nothing as alms distributions to qualified persons were monthly however a certain proportion of the population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply to them gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons mainly monks every morning with prepared food it is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed when he did dine he shared the family table which he had saved and which still exists with  indigent guests to the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer these and other good deeds and charitable frame of mind completely won the hearts and minds of the roman people they now looked to the papacy for government ignoring the rump state at constantinople which had only disrespect for gregorycitation needed calling him a fool for his pacifist dealings with the lombards the office of urban prefect went without candidates from the time of gregory the great to the rise of italian nationalism the papacy was most influential in ruling italy famous quotes and anecdotesedit th century mosaic in westminster cathedral non angli sed angeli non angli sed angeli – they are not angles but angels aphorism summarizing words reported to have been spoken by gregory when he first encountered paleskinned english boys at a slave market sparking his dispatch of st augustine of canterbury to england to convert the english according to bede he said well named for they have angelic faces and ought to be coheirs with the angels in heaven discovering that their province was deira he went on to add that they would be rescued de ira from the wrath and that their king was named aella alleluia he said ecce locusta – look at the locust gregory himself wanted to go to england as a missionary and started out for there on the fourth day as they stopped for lunch a locust landed on the edge of the bible gregory was reading he exclaimed ecce locusta look at the locust but reflecting on it he saw it as a sign from heaven since the similarsounding loco sta means stay in place within the hour an emissary of the pope arrived to recall him i beg that you will not take the present amiss for anything however trifling which is offered from the prosperity of st peter should be regarded as a great blessing seeing that he will have power both to bestow on you greater things and to hold out to you eternal benefits with almighty god pro cuius amore in eius eloquio nec mihi parco – for the love of whom god i do not spare myself from his word the sense is that since the creator of the human race and redeemer of him unworthy gave him the power of the tongue so that he could witness what kind of a witness would he be if he did not use it but preferred to speak infirmly for the place of heretics is very pride itselffor the place of the wicked is pride just as conversely humility is the place of the good non enim pro locis res sed pro bonis rebus loca amanda sunt – things are not to be loved for the sake of a place but places are to be loved for the sake of their good things when augustine asked whether to use roman or gallican customs in the mass in england gregory said in paraphrase that it was not the place that imparted goodness but good things that graced the place and it was more important to be pleasing to the almighty they should pick out what was pia religiosa and recta from any church whatever and set that down before the english minds as practice for the rule of justice and reason suggests that one who desires his own orders to be observed by his successors should undoubtedly keep the will and ordinances of his predecessor in his letters gregory often emphasized the importance of giving proper deference to last wills and testaments and of respecting property rights compassion should be shown first to the faithful and afterwards to the enemies of the church at length being anxious to avoid all these inconveniences i

september  until his death gregory is well known for his writings which were more prolific than those of any of his predecessors as pope he is the patron saint of musicians singers students and teachers throughout the middle ages he was known as the father of christian worship because of his exceptional efforts in revising the roman worship of his day he is also known as st gregory the dialogist in eastern orthodoxy because of his dialogues for this reason english translations of orthodox texts will sometimes list him as gregory dialogus he was the first of the popes to come from a monastic background gregory is a doctor of the church and one of the latin fathers he is considered a saint in the roman catholic church eastern orthodox church anglican communion and some lutheran churches immediately after his death gregory was canonized by popular acclaim the protestant reformer john calvin admired gregory and declared in his institutes that gregory was the last good pope early life the exact date of gregorys birth is uncertain but is usually estimated to be around the year  in the city of rome his parents named him gregorius which according to aelfric in an homily on the birthday of s gregory  is a greek name which signifies in the latin tongue vigilantius that is in english watchful the medieval writers who give this etymology do not hesitate to apply it to the life of gregory aelfric for example goes on he was very diligent in gods commandments when gregory was a child italy was retaken from the goths by justinian i emperor of the eastern roman empire ruling from constantinople the war was over by  an invasion of the franks was defeated in  the western roman empire had long since vanished in favor of the gothic kings of italy after  there was peace in italy and the appearance of restoration except that the government now resided in constantinople italy was still united into one country rome and still shared a common official language the very last of classical latin from  the socalled plague of justinian swept through the provinces of the empire including italy the plague caused famine panic and sometimes rioting in some parts of the country over  of the population was wiped out or destroyed this had heavy spiritual and emotional effects on the people of the empire as the fighting had been mainly in the north the young gregorius probably saw little of it totila sacked and vacated rome in  destroying most of its ancient population but in  he invited those who were still alive to return to the empty and ruinous streets it has been hypothesized that young gregory and his parents gordianus and silvia retired during that intermission to gordianus sicilian estates to return in  gregory had been born into a wealthy noble roman family with close connections to the church the lives in latin use nobilis but they do not specify from what historical layer the term derives or identify the family no connection to patrician families of the roman republic has been demonstrated gregorys greatgreatgrandfather had been pope felix iii but that pope was the nominee of the gothic king theodoric gregorys election to the throne of st peter made his family the most distinguished clerical dynasty of the period the family owned and resided in a villa suburbana on the caelian hill fronting the same street now the via di san gregorio with the former palaces of the roman emperors on the palatine hill opposite the north of the street runs into the colosseum the south the circus maximus in gregorys day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned villas covered the area gregorys family also owned working estates in sicily and around rome gregorys father gordianus held the position of regionarius in the roman church nothing further is known about the position gregorys mother silvia was wellborn and had a married sister pateria in sicily gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the caelian and these were described  years later by john the deacon gordianus was tall with a long face and light eyes he wore a beard silvia was tall had a round face blue eyes and a cheerful look they had another son whose name and fate are unknown the monks of st andrews the ancestral home on the caelian had a portrait of gregory made after his death which john the deacon also saw in the th century he reports the picture of a man who was rather bald and had a tawny beard like his fathers and a face that was intermediate in shape between his mothers and fathers the hair that he had on the sides was long and carefully curled his nose was thin and straight and slightly aquiline his forehead was high he had thick subdivided lips and a chin of a comely prominence and beautiful hands gregory was well educated with gregory of tours reporting that in grammar dialectic and rhetoric  he was second to none he wrote correct latin but did not read or write greek he knew latin authors natural science history mathematics and music and had such a fluency with imperial law that he may have trained in law it has been suggested as a preparation for a career in public life while his father lived gregory took part in roman political life and at one point was prefect of the city in the modern era gregory is often depicted as a man at the border poised between the roman and germanic worlds between east and west and above all perhaps between the ancient and medieval epochs monastic years gregory had a deep respect for the monastic life he viewed being a monk as the ardent quest for the vision of our creator his three paternal aunts were nuns renowned for their sanctity however after the two eldest passed away after seeing a vision of their ancestor pope felix the youngest soon abandoned the religious life and married the steward of her estate gregorys response to this family scandal was many are called but few are chosen gregorys mother silvia herself is a saint on his fathers death he converted his family villa suburbana located on the caelian hill just opposite the circus maximus into a monastery dedicated to the apostle saint andrew after his death it was rededicated as san gregorio magno al celio in his life of contemplation gregory concluded that in that silence of the heart while we keep watch within through contemplation we are as if asleep to all things that are without it seems to some that gregory was not always forgiving or pleasant for that matter even in his monastic years for example a monk lying on his death bed confessed to stealing three gold pieces gregory forced the monk to die friendless and alone then threw his body and coins on a manure heap to rot with a curse take your money with you to perdition gregory believed that punishment of sins can begin even on ones deathbed however this was done to help the monk to repent of his sin and not out of a misplaced anger the penance from st gregory did in fact help him to repent and afterwards st gregory offered  masses to free the monk from purgatory he later appeared to his brother and said that he has been released and is in heaven eventually pope pelagius ii ordained him a deacon and solicited his help in trying to heal the schism of the three chapters in northern italy however italy was not healed until well after gregory was gone apocrisiariate – in  pelagius ii chose gregory as his apocrisiarius ambassador to the imperial court in constantinople gregory was part of the roman delegation both lay and clerical that arrived in constantinople in  to ask the emperor for military aid against the lombards with the byzantine military focused on the east these entreaties proved unsuccessful in  pelagius ii wrote to gregory as apocrisiarius detailing the hardships that rome was experiencing under the lombards and asking him to ask emperor maurice to send a relief force maurice however had long ago determined to limit his efforts against the lombards to intrigue and diplomacy pitting the franks against them it soon became obvious to gregory that the byzantine emperors were unlikely to send such a force given their more immediate difficulties with the persians in the east and the avars and slavs to the north according to ekonomou if gregorys principle task was to plead romes cause before the emperor there seems to have been little left for him to do once imperial policy toward italy became evident papal representatives who pressed their claims with excessive vigor could quickly become a nuisance and find themselves excluded from the imperial presence altogether gregory had already drawn an imperial rebuke for his lengthy canonical writings on the subject of the legitimacy of john iii scholasticus who had occupied the patriarchate of constantinople for twelve years prior to the return of eutychius who had been driven out by justinian gregory turned himself to cultivating connections with the byzantine elite of the city where he became extremely popular with the citys upper class especially aristocratic women ekonomou surmises that while gregory may have become spiritual father to a large and important segment of constantinoples aristocracy this relationship did not significantly advance the interests of rome before the emperor although the writings of john the deacon claim that gregory labored diligently for the relief of italy there is no evidence that his tenure accomplished much towards any of the objectives of pelagius ii gregorys theological disputes with patriarch eutychius would leave a bitter taste for the theological speculation of the east with gregory that continued to influence him well into his papacy according to western sources gregorys very public debate with eutychius culminated in an exchange before tiberius ii where gregory cited a biblical passage palpate et videte quia spiritus carnem et ossa non habet sicut me videtis habere in support of the view that christ was corporeal and palpable after his resurrection allegedly as a result of this exchange tiberius ii ordered eutychiuss writings burned ekonomou views this argument though exaggerated in western sources as gregorys one achievement of an otherwise fruitless apokrisiariat in reality gregory was forced to rely on scripture because he could not read the untranslated greek authoritative works gregory left constantinople for rome in  returning to his monastery on the caelian hill gregory was elected by acclamation to succeed pelagius ii in  when the latter died of the plague spreading through the city gregory was approved by an imperial iussio from constantinople the following september as was the norm during the byzantine papacy missions amid all his burdens and anxieties it seems that the pope had never forgotten the english slaves whom he had once seen in the roman forum pope gregory had strong convictions on missions almighty god places good men in authority that he may impart through them the gifts of his mercy to their subjects and this we find to be the case with the british over whom you have been appointed to rule that through the blessings bestowed on you the blessings of heaven might be bestowed on your people also papacy – although gregory was resolved to retire into the monastic lifestyle of contemplation he was unwillingly forced back into a world that although he loved he no longer wanted to be a part of in texts of all genres especially those produced in his first year as pope gregory bemoaned the burden of office and mourned the loss of the undisturbed life of prayer he had once enjoyed as a monk when he became pope in  among his first acts was writing a series of letters disavowing any ambition to the throne of peter and praising the contemplative life of the monks at that time for various reasons the holy see had not exerted effective leadership in the west since the pontificate of gelasius i the episcopacy in gaul was drawn from the great territorial families and identified with them the parochial horizon of gregorys contemporary gregory of tours may be considered typical in visigothic spain the bishops had little contact with rome in italy the territories which had de facto fallen under the administration of the papacy were beset by the violent lombard dukes and the rivalry of the jews in the exarchate of ravenna and in the south gregory is credited with reenergizing the churchs missionary work among the nonchristian peoples of northern europe he is most famous for sending a mission often called the gregorian mission under augustine of canterbury prior of saint andrews where he had perhaps succeeded gregory to evangelize the pagan anglosaxons of england the mission was successful and it was from england that missionaries later set out for the netherlands and germany the preaching of the catholic faith and the elimination of all deviations from it was a key element in gregorys worldview and it constituted one of the major continuing policies of his pontificate according to the catholic encyclopedia he was declared a saint immediately after his death by popular acclamation in his official documents gregory was the first to make extensive use of the term servant of the servants of god servus servorum dei as a papal title thus initiating a practice that was to be followed by most subsequent popes works liturgical reforms john the deacon wrote that pope gregory i made a general revision of the liturgy of the pretridentine mass removing many things changing a few adding some in letters gregory remarks that he moved the pater noster our father to immediately after the roman canon and immediately before the fraction this position is still maintained today in the roman liturgy the pregregorian position is evident in the ambrosian rite gregory added material to the hanc igitur of the roman canon and established the nine kyries a vestigial remnant of the litany which was originally at that place at the beginning of mass he also reduced the role of deacons in the roman liturgy sacramentaries directly influenced by gregorian reforms are referred to as sacrementaria gregoriana with the appearance of these sacramentaries the western liturgy begins to show a characteristic that distinguishes it from eastern liturgical traditions in contrast to the mostly invariable eastern liturgical texts roman and other western liturgies since this era have a number of prayers that change to reflect the feast or liturgical season these variations are visible in the collects and prefaces as well as in the roman canon itself in the eastern orthodox church gregory is credited with compiling the liturgy of the presanctified gifts this liturgy is celebrated on wednesdays fridays and certain other weekdays during great lent in the eastern orthodox church and those eastern catholic churches which follow the byzantine rite gregory wrote over  letters in the last  years of his life – that give us an accurate picture of his work a truly autobiographical presentation is nearly impossible for gregory the development of his mind and personality remains purely speculative in nature gregorian chant the mainstream form of western plainchant standardized in the late th century was attributed to pope gregory i and so took the name of gregorian chant the earliest such attribution is in john the deacons  biography of gregory almost three centuries after the popes death and the chant that bears his name is the result of the fusion of roman and frankish elements which took place in the francogerman empire under pepin charlemagne and their successors writings gregory is commonly accredited with founding the medieval papacy and so many attribute the beginning of medieval spirituality to him gregory is the only pope between the fifth and the eleventh centuries whose correspondence and writings have survived enough to form a comprehensive corpus some of his writings are sermons forty on the gospels are recognized as authentic twentytwo on ezekiel two on the song of songs dialogues a collection of miracles signs wonders and healings including the popular life of saint benedict commentary on job frequently known even in englishlanguage histories by its latin title magna moralia the rule for pastors in which he contrasted the role of bishops as pastors of their flock with their position as nobles of the church the definitive statement of the nature of the episcopal office copies of some  letters have survived out of an unknown original number recorded in gregorys time in a register it is known to have existed in rome its last known location in the th century it consisted of  papyrus rolls now missing copies of letters had begun to be made the largest batch of  by order of adrian i the majority of the copies dating from the th to the th century are stored in the vatican library opinions of the writings of gregory vary his character strikes us as an ambiguous and enigmatic one cantor observed on the one hand he was an able and determined administrator a skilled and clever diplomat a leader of the greatest sophistication and vision but on the other hand he appears in his writings as a superstitious and credulous monk hostile to learning crudely limited as a theologian and excessively devoted to saints miracles and relics controversy with eutychius in constantinople gregory took issue with the aged patriarch eutychius of constantinople who had recently published a treatise now lost on the general resurrection eutychius maintained that the resurrected body will be more subtle than air and no longer palpable gregory opposed with the palpability of the risen christ in luke  as the dispute could not be settled the byzantine emperor tiberius ii constantine undertook to arbitrate he decided in favor of palpability and ordered eutychius book to be burned shortly after both gregory and eutychius became ill gregory recovered but eutychius died on  april  at age  on his deathbed eutychius recanted impalpability and gregory dropped the matter tiberius also died a few months after eutychius identification of three figures in the gospels gregory was among those who identified mary magdalene with mary of bethany whom john  recounts as having anointed jesus with precious ointment an event that some interpret as being the same as the anointing of jesus that the synoptic gospels recount as performed by a sinful woman in line with this interpretation the gospel reading for the feastday of mary magdalene in the roman missal from the tridentine edition of pope pius v to the  revision by pope paul vi was the account of this event in the gospel of luke preaching on the lucan passage gregory remarked this woman whom luke calls a sinner and john calls mary i think is the mary from whom mark reports that seven demons were cast out today biblical scholars distinguish the three figures but they are still popularly identified iconography in art gregory is usually shown in full pontifical robes with the tiara and double cross despite his actual habit of dress earlier depictions are more likely to show a monastic tonsure and plainer dress orthodox icons traditionally show st gregory vested as a bishop holding a gospel book and blessing with his right hand it is recorded that he permitted his depiction with a square halo then used for the living a dove is his attribute from the wellknown story recorded by his friend peter the deacon who tells that when the pope was dictating his homilies on ezechiel a curtain was drawn between his secretary and himself as however the pope remained silent for long periods at a time the servant made a hole in the curtain and looking through beheld a dove seated upon gregorys head with its beak between his lips when the dove withdrew its beak the pope spoke and the secretary took down his words but when he became silent the servant again applied his eye to the hole and saw the dove had replaced its beak between his lips this scene is shown as a version of the traditional evangelist portrait where the evangelists symbols are also sometimes shown dictating from the tenth century onwards an early example is the dedication miniature from the an eleventh century manuscript of st gregorys moralia in job the miniature shows the scribe bebo of seeon abbey presenting the manuscript to the holy roman emperor henry ii in the upper left the author is seen writing the text under divine inspiration usually the dove is shown whispering in gregorys ear for a clearer composition the imaginative and anachronistic example at the top of this article is from the studio of carlo saraceni or by a close follower ca  from the giustiniani collection the painting is conserved in the galleria nazionale darte antica rome the face of gregory is a caricature of the features described by john the deacon mentioned under his early life above total baldness outthrust chin beaklike nose where john had described partial baldness a mildly protruding chin slightly aquiline nose and strikingly good looks in this picture also gregory has his monastic back on the world which the real gregory despite his reclusive intent was seldom allowed to have the late medieval subject of the mass of st gregory shows a version of a th century story that was elaborated in later hagiography gregory is shown saying mass when christ as the man of sorrows appears on the altar the subject was most common in the th and th centuries and reflected growing emphasis on the real presence and after the protestant reformation was an assertion of the doctrine against protestant theology alms alms in christianity is defined by passages of the new testament such as matthew  which commands go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor  and come and follow me a donation on the other hand is a gift to some sort of enterprise profit or nonprofit on the one hand the alms of st gregory are to be distinguished from his donations but on the other he probably saw no such distinction the church had no interest in secular profit and as pope gregory did his utmost to encourage that high standard among church personnel apart from maintaining its facilities and supporting its personnel the church gave most of the donations it received as alms gregory is known for his administrative system of charitable relief of the poor at rome they were predominantly refugees from the incursions of the lombards the philosophy under which he devised this system is that the wealth belonged to the poor and the church was only its steward he received lavish donations from the wealthy families of rome who following his own example were eager to expiate to god for their sins he gave alms equally as lavishly both individually and en masse he wrote in letters i have frequently charged you  to act as my representative  to relieve the poor in their distress   i hold the office of steward to the property of the poor  the church received donations of many different kinds of property consumables such as food and clothing investment property real estate and works of art and capital goods or revenuegenerating property such as the sicilian latifundia or agricultural estates staffed and operated by slaves donated by gregory and his family the church already had a system for circulating the consumables to the poor associated with each parish was a diaconium or office of the deacon he was given a building from which the poor could at any time apply for assistance the state in which gregory became pope in  was a ruined one the lombards held the better part of italy their predations had brought the economy to a standstill they camped nearly at the gates of rome the city was packed with refugees from all walks of life who lived in the streets and had few of the necessities of life the seat of government was far from rome in constantinople which appeared unable to undertake the relief of italy the pope had sent emissaries including gregory asking for assistance to no avail in  gregory could wait for constantinople no longer he organized the resources of the church into an administration for general relief in doing so he evidenced a talent for and intuitive understanding of the principles of accounting which was not to be invented for centuries the church already had basic accounting documents every expense was recorded in journals called regesta lists of amounts recipients and circumstances revenue was recorded in polyptici books many of these polyptici were ledgers recording the operating expenses of the church and the assets the patrimonia a central papal administration the notarii under a chief the primicerius notariorum kept the ledgers and issued brevia patrimonii or lists of property for which each rector was responsible gregory began by aggressively requiring his churchmen to seek out and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not in a letter to a subordinate in sicily he wrote i asked you most of all to take care of the poor and if you knew of people in poverty you should have pointed them out  i desire that you give the woman pateria forty solidi for the childrens shoes and forty bushels of grain  soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a buildup to a great plan that he had in mind he understood that expenses must be matched by income to pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici the churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble money however was no substitute for food in a city that was on the brink of famine even the wealthy were going hungry in their villas the church now owned between  and  square miles  and  km of revenuegenerating farmland divided into large sections called patrimonia it produced goods of all kinds which were sold but gregory intervened and had the goods shipped to rome for distribution in the diaconia he gave orders to step up production set quotas and put an administrative structure in place to carry it out at the bottom was the rusticus who produced the goods some rustici were or owned slaves he turned over part of his produce to a conductor from whom he leased the land the latter reported to an actionarius the latter to a defensor and the latter to a rector grain wine cheese meat fish and oil began to arrive at rome in large quantities where it was given away for nothing as alms distributions to qualified persons were monthly however a certain proportion of the population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply to them gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons mainly monks every morning with prepared food it is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed when he did dine he shared the family table which he had saved and which still exists with  indigent guests to the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer these and other good deeds and charitable frame of mind completely won the hearts and minds of the roman people they now looked to the papacy for government ignoring the rump state at constantinople which had only disrespect for gregory calling him a fool for his pacifist dealings with the lombards the office of urban prefect went without candidates from the time of gregory the great to the rise of italian nationalism the papacy was most influential in ruling italy famous quotes and anecdotes non angli sed angeli – they are not angles but angels aphorism summarizing words reported to have been spoken by gregory when he first encountered paleskinned english boys at a slave market sparking his dispatch of st augustine of canterbury to england to convert the english according to bede he said well named for they have angelic faces and ought to be coheirs with the angels in heaven discovering that their province was deira he went on to add that they would be rescued de ira from the wrath and that their king was named aella alleluia he said ecce locusta – look at the locust gregory himself wanted to go to england as a missionary and started out for there on the fourth day as they stopped for lunch a locust landed on the edge of the bible gregory was reading he exclaimed ecce locusta look at the locust but reflecting on it he saw it as a sign from heaven since the similar sounding loco sta means stay in place within the hour an emissary of the pope arrived to recall him i beg that you will not take the present amiss for anything however trifling which is offered from the prosperity of st peter should be regarded as a great blessing seeing that he will have power both to bestow on you greater things and to hold out to you eternal benefits with almighty god pro cuius amore in eius eloquio nec mihi parco – for the love of whom god i do not spare myself from his word the sense is that since the creator of the human race and redeemer of him unworthy gave him the power of the tongue so that he could witness what kind of a witness would he be if he did not use it but preferred to speak infirmly for the place of heretics is very pride itselffor the place of the wicked is pride just as conversely humility is the place of the good non enim pro locis res sed pro bonis rebus loca amanda sunt – things are not to be loved for the sake of a place but places are to be loved for the sake of their good things when augustine asked whether to use roman or gallican customs in the mass in england gregory said in paraphrase that it was not the place that imparted goodness but good things that graced the place and it was more important to be pleasing to the almighty they should pick out what was pia religiosa and recta from any church whatever and set that down before the english minds as practice for the rule of justice and reason suggests that one who desires his own orders to be observed by his successors should undoubtedly keep the will and ordinances of his predecessor in his letters gregory often emphasized the importance of giving proper deference to last wills and testaments and of respecting property rights compassion should be shown first to the faithful and afterwards to the enemies of the church at length being anxious to avoid all these inconveniences i sought the haven of the monastery… for as the vessel that is negligently moored is very often when the storm waxes violent tossed by the water out of its shelter on the safest shore so under the cloak of the ecclesiastical office i found myself plunged on a sudden in a sea of secular matters and because i had not held fast the tranquillity of the monastery when in possession i learnt by losing it how closely it should have been held in moralia sive expositio in job commentary on job also known as magna moralia gregory describes to the bishop leander the circumstances under which he became a monk illiterate men can contemplate in the lines of a picture what they cannot learn by means of the written word � � � memorials lives in britain appreciation for gregory remained strong even after his death with him being called gregorius noster our gregory by the british it was in britain at a monastery in whitby that the first full length life of gregory was written in c  appreciation of gregory in rome and italy itself however did not come until later the first vita of gregory written in italy was not produced until john the deacon in the th century monuments the namesake church of san gregorio al celio largely rebuilt from the original edifices during the th and th centuries remembers his work one of the three oratories annexed the oratory of st silvia is said to lie over the tomb of gregorys mother in england gregory is revered as the apostle of the land they regarded him as the source of their conversion music italian composer ottorino respighi composed a piece named st gregory the great san gregorio magno that features as the fourth and final part of his church windows vetrate di chiesa works written in  feast day the current roman catholic calendar of saints revised in  as instructed by the second vatican council celebrates st gregory the great on  september before that the general roman calendar assigned his feast day to  march the day of his death in  this day always falls within lent during which there are no obligatory memorials for this reason his feast day was moved to  september the day of his episcopal consecration in  the eastern orthodox church and the associated eastern catholic churches continue to commemorate st gregory on  march the occurrence of this date during great lent is considered appropriate in the byzantine rite which traditionally associates saint gregory with the divine liturgy of the presanctified gifts celebrated only during that liturgical season other churches also honour saint gregory the church of england on  september the evangelical lutheran church in america and the episcopal church in the united states on  march a traditional procession is held in żejtun malta in honour of saint gregory san girgor on easter wednesday which most often falls in april the range of possible dates being  march to  april the feast day of st gregory also serves as a commemorative day for the former pupils of downside school the socalled old gregorians traditionally the og ties are worn by all of the societys members on this day the text in this box was generated from a wikipedia article which is released under the ccbysaread

there not doing anything special as a syrian priest he must have felt a little out of place among the roman people mourning that day for the dead pope as a good preacher he must have wanted to speak to the funeral procession about christs promise of resurrection as a learned man he must have wondered who would follow the holy saint gregory ii as pope and where he would take the church as a holy man he must have been praying for gregory ii and for all the people around him to find their place after death in gods arms but he was just one of the crowd not to god and not to the people who recognized the wellknown holy man in their midst right in the middle of the funeral procession they singled him out they swept him away and clamored for him to be named the next bishop of rome then suddenly unexpectedly without his even lifting a finger his whole life changed and he could no longer just stand there and do nothing after he was proclaimed pope gregory iii emperor leo iii attacked the veneration of holy images because leo iii thought the honor paid to jesus mary and the saints by keeping statues and icons was idolatry he condemned them and wanted them destroyed gregory iii didnt just stand there but immediately sent a letter to leo iii he couldnt get the letter through because the priestmessenger was afraid to deliver it so instead gregory called a synod that approved strong measures against anyone who would try to destroy images of jesus mary or the saints gregory took his stand and leo iii apparently thought the only way to move him was through physical force so leo sent ships to kidnap gregory and bring him to constantinople many people in rome must have tried to get gregory to move  but he just stood there and once again god intervened a storm destroyed leos ships the only thing leo could do was capture some of the papal lands so leo got a few acres of land and we kept our wonderful reminders of the love of god the protection of jesus the prayers of mary and the examples of the saints all because gregory knew when to take a stand  and when to stand there and let god work gregory iii was pope from  in his footsteps where in your life do you need to take a stand take a stand the next time you here someone say something that indicates religious racial gender or any other kind of prejudice take a stand and make it clear that such prejudice is not tolerated by god or gods people prayer saint gregory iii its hard to stand still and wait for god to do his work sometimes i doubt gods providence im afraid that gods plan wont work out unless i
