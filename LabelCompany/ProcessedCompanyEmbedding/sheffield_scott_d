carmichael  views  comments monroe energy oil  gas industry pbf energy permian basin permian basin petroleum association philadelphia energy solution pioneer natural resources scott sheffield shale texas oil and gas association scott sheffield for many the word “pioneer” evokes iconic imagery of the first american settlers — romantically rugged and sunsoaked — who braved new unforgiving terrain and adverse conditions in the name of posterity and prosperity these early pioneers are responsible for igniting the evolution of the united states from a fledgling uncharted territory into the world power that it is today and they embody the first notions of pursuing the american dream but what comes to mind when thinking of modernday pioneers and do any even still exist to answer this question look no further than an impressive granitecovered office complex in irving texas scott sheffield — an unassuming downtoearth yet phenomenally successful businessman in his early s — is truly a modernday pioneer a title he appropriately shares with the large independent oil and gas company that he leads as chief executive officer and chairman of the board sheffield’s forwardthinking leadership and intuition finetuned by nearly a lifetime of experience in the industry have positioned the company as a leader in the oil and gas sector pioneer natural resources was officially formed in  when the parker  parsley petroleum company formerly headed by sheffield merged with mesa inc since that time pioneer has grown to become one of the most prominent independent producers in the country with approximately  employees and annual revenue exceeding  billion even in the midst of a cyclical industry downturn the company is poised to continue its growth and revenue trajectories pioneer’s success is largely attributed to sheffield although his humility would never allow him to take all of the credit sheffield’s forwardthinking leadership and intuition finetuned by nearly a lifetime of experience in the industry have positioned the company as a leader in the oil and gas sector next frontier oil exports repealing restrictions one new horizon sheffield is pursuing is crude oil exports not only is the ceo at the forefront of the debate rallying the troops in an effort to repeal the yearold federal ban he also chartered the discovery of a new conduit for us companies to move petroleum products abroad on december   president gerald ford signed into law the energy policy and conservation act which in part banned the export of american crude oil ostensibly in response to the arab oil embargo of the s in the decades since the global landscape has changed dramatically geopolitical powers have shifted and reshifted regimes have risen and fallen and the discovery of domestic unconventional resources has led to a tremendous increase in the amount of oil and natural gas the us is producing in fact the us energy information administration reports that the surge in oil production growth in  was the largest volume increase since record keeping began more than  years ago a staggering  million barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd increase to equal a total of  million boepd for the year with this huge boost in production the us has surpassed historically top oil producers such as russia and saudi arabia a report from columbia university’s center on global energy policy lays out the argument “increased us crude production can weaken the economic power fiscal strength and geopolitical influence of other large oil producing countries” the report also notes that allowing crude oil exports will provide for “greater us diplomatic leverage in future application of sanctions or pursuits of other objectives” lifting the ban would mean huge economic benefits for the us as well according to ihs energy allowing exports could spur investments of nearly  billion as well as increase the gdp by  billion as a result of the uptick in production additionally the balance of trade would be significantly impacted narrowing the trade deficit by  billion in  according to icf international the repeal has the potential to create thousands of new jobs and put money directly back into consumers’ pockets it’s projected that us consumers could save on average up to  billion per year over the next two decades as a result of lower gas or fuel prices predictions on job growth range from about  to  newly created jobs with the highest estimate peaking around  million in  and investmentled economic expansion and lower unemployment rates would lead to a significant boost in american households’ disposable income by far the most significant benefit is to domestic oil producers who are undeniably on an uneven playing field with the rest of the world west texas intermediate wti the light sweet crude oil produced in the state has seen a price differential of as much as  less than brent the typical benchmark for pricing on the international market “it’s our domestic price versus the world price” sheffield explains “just a  swing will make a difference of whether we’re increasing production  million barrels a day longterm or decreasing production  million barrels a day” sheffield points out that it is not just the oil producers who are getting a lesser deal per barrel but also individual royalty owners — who collect payments on a percentage of oil sales — and the federal and state governments that hold production on publicly owned lands “lifting the crude oil export ban gets what should be a fair price for all constituents of the oil and gas industry” sheffield says he has long been an outspoken advocate for exports and has made multiple trips to washington dc with his team and other energy ceos in march sheffield testified before the us house subcommittee on energy and power in support of lifting the outdated restrictions “i think the comments were very well received” sheffield says adding that the critical impacts on national security and job creation and the importance of getting a competitive price were key points in the discussions in conjunction with legislative efforts in dc sheffield is a founding member of the producers for american crude oil exports pace an industry group aimed at sharing factual information with elected officials and the public about the benefits of allowing us producers to sell crude oil in global markets “ryan lance the chairman and ceo of conocophillips and i got together about a year ago” sheffield recalls of the group’s organic origins “we had a discussion about this point and we began soliciting members to join the group” pace membership also includes anadarko petroleum apache chesapeake energy concho resources devon energy encana eog resources ep energy hess laredo petroleum marathon oil noble energy occidental petroleum and wpx energy “we hope that we can get a bipartisan bill through both the senate and the house sometime this fall” sheffield says although he knows there are still significant obstacles to overcome in the meantime first not everyone agrees that exporting crude oil is the best move for the us specifically some inland refiners consumers and refiners united for domestic energy crude was recently formed by four refiners — philadelphia energy solutions alon usa energy pbf energy and monroe energy — with the purpose of maintaining the current restriction on crude oil exports the group says reversing the ban will actually cause gasoline prices to go up — not down — and cites potential unintended consequences to the economy energy independence and national security but sheffield sees it differently “their point is that if us crude gets the same price as world crude they’ll go under” the oil executive says yet prohibiting crude exports puts the oil industry in a precarious position which is further compounded by the current pricing slump as well as oversupply and lack of storage “if current trends continue and the export ban is not lifted us shale oil production will flatten or decline by disproportionate volumes versus our overseas competitors diminishing the profound benefits of the shale revolution” sheffield said in a testimony before congress he is also concerned with the timing of when such a bill would go before congress “the biggest concern sad to say is that most politicians are worried about the price of gasoline” sheffield says referring to elected officials’ hesitancy to cause discontent among voters who often have kneejerk reactions to any increase at the pump in reality us gasoline is priced off global gasoline prices not domestic crude prices and sheffield points to various independent studies that show that repealing the crude oil export ban will benefit us consumers by putting downward pressure on gasoline prices due to increased global oil supplies nevertheless sheffield admits that the vote could easily be delayed if the price of gasoline is going up at the time ideally he says congress would approve the repeal within the next few months but he realistically gives it a  chance of passing this year pioneering condensate exports while pioneer’s chairman homed in on the larger issue of crude oil exports that didn’t distract him from finding a clever way around it in  while other oil producers were riding high on solid prices and a newfound abundance of shale resources sheffield was beginning to see the writing on the wall the excess oil produced domestically must go somewhere typically to the gulf coast or cushing oklahoma — the delivery point for wti futures contracts “i was worried about the storage issues like they’re having today and moving oil down to the gulf coast” he says about his early calculations and he was right to be concerned this march crude oil storage at cushing reached  million barrels the highest volume on record the  million barrels of storage capacity represents more than  percent of crude oil working storage space in the midwest in addition to the glut at cushing west texas has been grappling with production that is outpacing takeaway capacity in may the region also experienced significant pipeline disruptions this created record levels of stockpiles and forced oil to be diverted to cushing instead of the gulf coast further compounding storage issues but back before this congestion was making headlines sheffield had the keen insight to anticipate such events “we researched the  law in regard to the ban on oil exports and realized there was a mechanism that if you had condensate that was processed like we have in the eagle ford play there’s a chance that the commerce department would agree with us and consider it processed condensate” sheffield recalls to everyone’s surprise the us commerce department issued a private ruling approving pioneer’s request to export condensate in less than a month sheffield and his team were the first to uncover an overlooked loophole buried deep in various sections of archaic laws and government codes section a of the export administration regulations states “lease condensate that has been processed through a crude oil distillation tower is not crude oil but a petroleum product” as long as the crude oil has undergone stabilization and distillation it can be considered a refined petroleum product and therefore may be exported with far fewer restrictions in july  pioneer exported its first shipment of condensate making it the first us company to export the petroleum product under current restrictions sheffield admits that credit must be given to the obama administration as well “instead of lifting the ban outright which is what they should do they’re giving a little bit to the industry to allow this oversupply problem to at least get pushed back” sheffield explains in july  pioneer exported its first shipment of condensate making it the first us company to export the petroleum product under current restrictions the company exported  barrels per day bpd of eagle ford condensate to asia and europe last year in  pioneer is exporting approximately  bpd with significantly improved pricing compared to domestic sales new york ny – august  chairman and ceo scott sheffield of pioneer natural resources rings the opening bell at the new york stock exchange on august   in new york city photo ben hidernyse euronext  after news of the commerce department’s ruling broke several companies followed suit enterprise products partners royal dutch shell bhp billiton bp trafigura cima energy a texasbased mitsubishi corporation affiliate nustar and cheniere energy are currently exporting or in the process of exporting condensate a pioneer in the making sheffield’s rise to the upper echelons of the oil industry was not by chance or luck and it certainly did not happen overnight his journey to the top has been nearly a lifetime in the making his father hugh d sheffield was a petroleum engineer and executive at atlantic richfield company also known as arco sheffield was born in dallas and in  the family moved to tehran iran where sheffield attended high school from his time in iran the future ceo learned several lessons about life and the world that have undoubtedly shaped his perspective today “you learn to appreciate foreign cultures when you live there” the texas native says “you have to learn to live in and appreciate their environment” this heightened sense of respect is a trait that sheffield has maintained throughout his life and one of the attributes that makes him so beloved by his employees at pioneer time abroad also provided an enhanced understanding and unique perspective on the geopolitical intricacies that have an impact on foreign relations and the oil industry as well as an ingrained sense of gratitude for life back home “you get a greater appreciation for the us … all the things that we have in this country that we don’t think about versus living in a foreign culture” sheffield says upon graduating from high school in  sheffield returned to the us to attend college at the university of texas at austin although he loved math and science the college freshman initially felt the urge to carve his own path “i rebelled against my father and signed up for prelaw” sheffield says somewhat jokingly it didn’t take long for sheffield and the university to realize that prelaw was not the right fit “i flunked out of college” sheffield admits with a grin quickly clarifying “they called it a forced withdrawal” although sheffield came close to joining the ranks of modernday millionaires who never graduated from college his father stepped in and gave his son a harsh dose of reality in what sheffield calls “a gamechanging event” he was sent to roughneck on an offshore rig for about four months “you need to focus and get an education is what it taught me and not party and have fun” sheffield reflects he returned to school after his semester off with new zest switched majors and surpassed minimum requirements for continued enrollment achieving an almost perfect grade point average that semester sheffield graduated from the university of texas in  with a bachelor of science in petroleum engineering and went to work as a production and reservoir engineer for amoco in odessa texas he stayed with the company for about four and a half years primarily working on enhanced oil recovery projects in west texas in  fate came knocking sheffield accepted a position at the parker  parsley petroleum company a small independent oil company making him the fifth employee and the only engineer on staff at that time the intimate environment was exactly what the young engineer needed to flourish “i basically was taught by the founders at parker  parsley everything you can know about the oil and gas industry” sheffield says “i learned more just in a year with them than i did in five years with a major oil company” two years after joining the company sheffield was named vice president of engineering in  the founders of parker  parsley sold their interest in the business and sheffield stepped up as president and a director on the board in  sheffield and his management team made the prudent decision to purchase the company from the owner at the time a financial real estate company that was teetering on bankruptcy shortly after gaining control of the company sheffield was named chairman of the board of directors and ceo in  the new leader took the company public in  sheffield skillfully navigated the merger between parker  parsley petroleum company and mesa inc forming pioneer natural resources today he is the ceo and chairman of the board of directors of one of the topperforming oil and gas producers in the country secret to success as a seasoned veteran of the industry the current oil pricing slump is not exactly sheffield’s first rodeo “going through five downturns you gain experience” he says through that experience the oil executive has perfected the recipe for success in the industry simply put good rocks good books and most importantly good people good rocks “we have some of the best shale rocks in the country in both the permian basin in west texas and the eagle ford” sheffield says but that wasn’t always the case if not for sheffield’s sensibility and intuitive decisionmaking pioneer very well could have missed some of its greatest opportunities in the mids major oil companies began divesting large portions of their us acreage convinced that domestic production had matured and diverted attention and resources overseas sheffield chose a slightly different path “that time period is when we made most of our acquisitions from the major oil companies in the spraberry and wolfcamp field” sheffield says located in the permian basin the spraberry and wolfcamp shale play is one of the nation’s oldest producing oil fields and was often overlooked at the time the company also dabbled in the international arena achieving success in the deepwater gulf of mexico africa and argentina but by the early s the newly discovered barnett shale in north texas was turning attention back home as it was the first shale formation heavily produced by the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing shale plays quickly became the new hot topic “in  we made the decision to exit over time all of those international businesses and refocus our staff” sheffield says noting that pioneer was somewhat late to the party in the barnett shale “we said there has to be shale under our south texas and permian basin properties” a handful of years later in  the first horizontal well was drilled in the eagle ford shale in south texas unleashing a frenzy of drilling activity in the oncequiet region while the ceo was right in thinking there may be shale under pioneer’s south texas properties the real breakthrough was yet to come “i saw a presentation in  by our geosciences staff that was sort of the game changer for the company” sheffield remembers “the game changer was really the permian basin the spraberry and wolfcamp field” that presentation revealed that pioneer was already sitting on billions of barrels of recoverable oil literally right under their feet “this was a billionbarrel discovery on our own lands most of it held by production right outside of midland texas” sheffield remarks of the tremendous find today pioneer is the largest acreage holder in the permian basin boasting a yearplus inventory and more than  drilling locations from its first well drilled in  to  spraberrywolfcamp production has more than doubled increasing from  to  boepd it could be said that sheffield initiated the resurgence of the mighty permian basin last year pioneer added proved reserves from horizontal drilling activities in the permian basin and eagle ford totaling  million boe and oil production was up  percent year over year even with the decline in oil prices and activity pioneer still projects production growth of  percent for  with estimated production in the second quarter of this year averaging  to  boepd good books possibly the most essential lesson sheffield has learned throughout his decades in the industry is the importance of being financially secure his cardinal rule “always have a great balance sheet because you don’t know when the price of oil is going to change” to protect against inevitable volatility in oil prices sheffield says one of the most important steps is securing good hedges pioneer is currently  percent hedged at  per barrel which has resulted in roughly an extra  per barrel on the majority of sales so far this year sheffield estimates it could provide somewhere in the ballpark of  million to  million overall for  the company is also heavily hedged next year according to the ceo well over  percent at  or higher potentially adding another  million in  sheffield took additional steps to strengthen the balance sheet in direct anticipation of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec meeting last fall at which the group decided to maintain current production levels further depressing prices brought on by oversupply and weakening demand globally “we raised a billion in equity back before the opec meeting” sheffield says since the meeting several companies again followed pioneer’s lead sheffield predicts in the six to eight weeks prior to our discussion in april approximately  billion to  billion of equity had been raised by the industry in  pioneer also divested of three nonessential business components in an effort to boost cash flow the sale of its alaska barnett shale and hugoton assets resulted in net proceeds of  million additionally the company is currently in the final stages of negotiating the sale of the eagle ford midstream business in response to the decline in oil prices pioneer like many companies has significantly reduced the number of rigs operating across the state currently it has  horizontal rigs online —  in the permian basin region and six in the eagle ford however because of sheffield’s ability to keep the company financially lean and wellpositioned in regard to acreage it is poised to rebound much faster than most once prices stabilize sheffield predicts the company could start adding rigs sometime in the second half of this year although that’s contingent upon several factors first the ceo expects the sale of the eagle ford midstream business will close during the second quarter providing another cash infusion to the balance sheet additionally sheffield wants to be sure the worst is not yet to come in terms of oil prices “i’m optimistic that we saw the bottom when it hit  to  twice” sheffield says the third factor is achieving ambitious reductions in key budgetary items namely drilling and completion costs the company announced drilling and completion costs had already reached the targeted  percent reduction in the first quarter with the most significant of these reductions in materials such as drilling mud chemicals guar and water fuel charges labor and transportation rental equipment such as blowout preventers and coil tubing and well services such as wireline direction and cementing services to achieve such goals the company is cutting down to twostring casing from threestring in several areas utilizing dissolvable bridge plugs for increased efficiency in each stage of stimulation drilling near existing tank batteries and drilling multiple wells from a single pad to reduce costs by the end of the year pioneer expects to achieve an overall  percent reduction in these costs with the key contributors being casing and tubing well stimulation and drilling rig costs additionally pioneer projects the cost to construct new facilities particularly horizontal tank batteries and lease operating expenses in  to be  percent and  percent lower respectively than the prior year as of the first quarter the company had already realized a  percent reduction in lease operating expenses the company is also implementing additional costcutting methods to maintain profitability and productivity for example pioneer made the decision in midfebruary to exclusively utilize pioneer pumping services eliminating the need for a thirdparty service company pioneer also recently announced the closing of its denver office and streamlined operations in the raton basin in february pioneer shut down the vertical drilling program in the permian basin as it was no longer necessary to hold acreage and provides lesser returns compared to horizontal wells pioneer’s ceo sees a strong continued presence for years to come in the permian basin and the eagle ford shale good people acreage wasn’t the only valuable asset pioneer was scooping up from major oil companies as they were moving internationally in the ’s “we went to the majors and hired a lot of employees from them” sheffield says explaining one reason for the company’s relocation to irving “it was easier to attract them in the dallasfort worth area than it was in midland” with the ramp up in industry activity over the past decade hiring the best in the business has become an increasingly competitive sport for oil and gas companies who are offering even more enticing compensation packages pioneer offers a twoforone match on employee retirement plans up to  percent of an employee’s salary as well as stock purchase plans an annual incentive bonus program and an employee referral awards program it also provides a tuition reimbursement plan employeeassistance plan and affordable insurance coverage for employees including medical life and disability programs pioneer goes a step further than most by making it as convenient as possible for its employees to achieve a healthy worklife balance the company’s recently constructed office complex in midland boasts a free day care center two workout rooms and a cafeteria where employees enjoy complimentary lunch together employees also have the chance to bond and be active in the corporate challenge an eightweek olympicsstyle tournament held each fall in which companies and organizations in the dallas area compete in a number of sports and events such as badminton golf tennis volleyball flag football and more the proceeds go to support the special olympics sheffield says everyone involved has a great time and really gets into the competitive spirit — it seems himself included “we’re threetime champions” but the real draw boils down to the leadership and sheffield’s belief in open communication trust and humility the chief executive says his office is always open to all employees and he constantly stresses to treat everyone with the same level of respect “don’t sit there and do something differently for me that you wouldn’t do for somebody working out in the field or a file clerk” sheffield says “treat everyone the same — everybody is important in this company” throughout our conversation sheffield often seemed to downplay his role in pioneer’s accomplishments rarely using the word “i” — instead saying “we” “i feel like i’m just another employee” the ceo admits “i always say it started with my parents” sheffield says “that’s what i was taught and so it’s natural to be that way” the proof is in the pudding pioneer has consistently been recognized as a top employer for several years running it’s one of only  companies to land on the dallas morning news’ “top  places to work” since the program was started in  receiving the coveted no  spot in  pioneer has also been named one of the “best companies to work for in texas” every year since  which holds special significance as it is based on employees’ feedback good to the core one of the underlying reasons pioneer is consistently recognized as a great place to work is the strong corporate culture sheffield established and maintains within the company for pioneer core values aren’t just a colorful poster on the wall community involvement charitable giving safety and sustainability are a way of life community involvement and charitable giving giving back to the communities in which they live and operate is an important focal point for pioneer’s ceo and employees in addition to the considerable tax revenue and employment the company provides pioneer is actively involved in local charities and places significant importance on providing educational opportunities for the betterment of communities and to prepare a future texas workforce in the permian basin region where pioneer has long been active sheffield is regarded as a highly respected member of the community in part because of his philanthropic endeavors pioneer donated  million to the permian basin petroleum museum in  for renovations expansion and muchneeded improvement of the nation’s largest museum dedicated to the petroleum industry the company has made financial contributions toward the construction of the bush tennis center which opened in  in midland employees also team up annually with christmas for our troops to pack almost  gift boxes for service members stationed in iraq and afghanistan during the holiday season as well as sending small care packages and letters to members of the military throughout the year but perhaps the largest and most meaningful contributions have gone to midland area schools in  pioneer made a fouryear commitment of  million to the early college high school at midland college a program in which high school students can concurrently take collegelevel courses and receive a high school diploma and an associate degree upon graduation the same year sheffield publicly endorsed the  million elementary school bond initiative which passed largely thanks to support by the industry and community leaders like sheffield last year pioneer and a small coalition of local companies collectively dedicated  million to the midland isd education foundation  million went to new teacher signing bonuses and the remainder was used for resigning bonuses this donation was intended to help the district attract and retain quality teachers which has been difficult given the cost of living and fluctuations in enrollment youth and education are also a charitable focus in pioneer’s south texas operating area the company partners with local colleges such as coastal bend college in beeville and victoria college to ensure courses are meeting the industry’s needs and sufficiently preparing students to work in their chosen fields pioneer also partners with local junior highs and high schools to help meet needs in math and science from delivering graphing calculators to helping acquire new microscopes and lab equipment each june pioneer and the victoria business and education coalition host the youth leadership conference a fiveday program at which middle school students are taught essential leadership skills to help them succeed in school and their future careers and as pioneer is a founding member of the south texas energy  education roundtable steer steer and its employees support youth livestock shows by sending letters of encouragement to students and contributing funds in the company’s new home of north texas pioneer has collaborated with habitat for humanity building  new homes in the area as well as participating in a brush with kindness a habitat subprogram that assists the elderly and disabled with minor home repairs and helps revitalize local neighborhoods each spring pioneer sponsors a fundraising campaign to assist the north texas food bank as well as cohosting the annual dallas casa classic golf tournament the highest grossing oneday charity tournament in the dallasfort worth area in  the event raised more than  million for the court appointed special advocates nonprofit organization in both north and west texas the company is also deeply involved with the united way employees donate on an individual basis through payroll deductions and through other means and every dollar donated is matched by pioneer employees enjoy organizing creative fundraising events even turning two floors of the midland office into a ninehole miniature golf course to help raise money for the midland united way in irving the company hosts an inoffice event in which employees race their homemade foodconstructed model cars against one another to raise money for meals on wheels one of united way’s agencies the company was recognized for its efforts and unique fundraising approach receiving the  trendsetter award from the united way of metropolitan dallas pioneer provides economic benefits to communities by providing stable employment and substantial tax revenue it is the no  taxpayer in midland county and employs roughly  west texans in its permian basin operations in south texas the company employs about  workers and it paid almost  million in production taxes and  million in ad valorem taxes in  pioneer also employs more than  people in the irving headquarters contributing over  million in production taxes and close to  million in ad valorem taxes to north texas communities in  safety safety is a critical component of every operation and pioneer devotes significant time and resources to ensuring all employees are wellversed in safety practices and procedures in  pioneer’s health safety and environment team spent more than  personhours training more than  employees the following year the pioneer pumping services training department initiated a comprehensive twoweek onsite new hire training program in which participants attend osha courses and equipment training as well as receiving handson experience with ppsspecific equipment and field and yard inspections over the past year pioneer has featured a series of three targeted training programs the most recent is the webelieve program which was created by company staff and features participant polling group discussions case studies and interactive videos sheffield believes corporate culture starts at the top and as such pioneer’s top supervisors and managers regularly attend the awardwinning dupont sustainable solutions managing safety courses in  more than  managers attended the twoday training session pioneer’s board of directors has also established the health safety and environment committee to provide oversight of these practices within the company and monitor management’s efforts in maintaining a culture based on safety and environmental protection vehicle safety is another area of focus especially considering the substantial amount of time employees spend on the road in  employees drove a total of  million miles and completed more than  personhours of driver safety training courses approximately  of pioneer’s fleet vehicles are equipped with gps tracking technology which monitors safe driving practices and helps optimize routes and reduce mileage in  for every million miles driven by pioneer employees there were on average  preventable vehicle accidents last year pioneer’s osha recordable injury rate and losttime accident rate dropped to an eightyear low sustainability and environmental stewardship in terms of sustainability pioneer utilizes a multidisciplinary approach to balancing economic growth social progress and environmental stewardship pioneer’s sustainable development department works to reduce its environmental footprint and provide costeffective solutions through scientific analyses of information and knowledge the company is also expanding the role of its corporate environmental team overall the company’s sustainability efforts coalesce around three key issues water air and surface in regard to water pioneer has made tremendous strides in sustainability through several initiatives for one the company is increasingly using brackish nondrinkable groundwater for its drilling operations because of the consistent occurrence of droughts in texas sheffield assembled a team of geologists about three or four years ago to examine alternative sources of water specifically brackish water “we found a lot of brackish water in the santa rosa formation” sheffield says “we’ve been very successful there as the first area to replenish and supplement fresh water” to further avoid the use of fresh water in its west texas operations pioneer has created a unique partnership with the city of odessa to purchase effluent water from the municipality while this type of agreement is not commonly seen in texas sheffield notes it is a mutually beneficial one this relationship provides pioneer with a steady supply of water to produce wells and significant cost benefits sheffield estimates that moving away from fresh water could save the company about  to  per well in drilling and trucking costs for the city the financial commitment secures funding for the construction and maintenance of such infrastructure odessa is able to build a sophisticated new treatment plant capable of processing water to the standards pioneer needs but the plant will also serve the needs and residents of the greater area for years to come pioneer is also in talks with the city of midland regarding a similar agreement further increasing the amount of effluent water being utilized “we hope by  to essentially be using a combination of effluent water and brackish water and not use fresh water at all” sheffield says and the company is exploring several waterrecycling projects for the fresh water it does still use although the economics have slowed the widespread implementation of such initiatives “so far the recycling projects are very expensive” the chairman admits “but over time we think it’s better to recycle so we’re still working on a couple of projects trying to get their costs down” to protect existing groundwater the company is installing covers on selected water storage ponds at well sites to combat evaporation pioneer is also adding pressure gauges to monitor and test the annular space of all new wells to ensure well integrity and further protect water resources to better understand the company’s impact on air quality and emissions pioneer implemented a new program that includes advanced emissions measurements improved practices and data collection helped the company achieve a  percent decrease in reported gross emissions in  the company has also made improvements to the completion process specifically in the eagle ford shale which has resulted in a  percent reduction in flaring in this production stage between  and  as well pioneer has converted more than  percent of lightduty trucks to natural gas fuel as of mid — representing roughly  vehicles going a step further the company is expanding its use of this domestic fuel by converting three drilling rigs in south texas to natural gas reducing particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions pioneer’s efforts are not going unnoticed as it claims the first oil and gas project to ever receive the texas commission on environmental quality’s texas environmental award in the pollution prevention category deeply committed to surface protection and conservation one of the company’s key initiatives is reducing well pad footprints by drilling multiple wellbores from a single pad in south texas pioneer has reduced its average footprint per wellbore from  acres in  to fewer than  acres in  in  pioneer was awarded the prestigious bruno hansonmidland college environmental excellence award for achievements in the spill management program and pollution prevention initiatives extensive training in proactive safety measures and overall demonstration of corporate and environmental stewardship measuring success although his net worth is well into the millions sheffield measures success not in dollars and cents rather he prefers the sense of pride he feels when reflecting on the company he’s built and the jobs he’s provided to thousands of pioneer employees sheffield’s greatest personal accomplishment “creating a great company where  employees really think it’s a fun place to work” the ceo says on a larger scale sheffield says his impact on the country’s oil supply namely finding and participating in one of the world’s largest oil fields the permian basin gives him personal fulfillment “career wise my greatest accomplishment is that we’ve been the best sp  energy company stock performer over the last five years” sheffield says pioneer’s stock is also ranked as the th top performing stock overall on the sp  sheffield and wife kimberley reside in irving they have five children — roseanne bryan kit bonnie and cassandra bryan has followed in the family business founding parsley energy in
