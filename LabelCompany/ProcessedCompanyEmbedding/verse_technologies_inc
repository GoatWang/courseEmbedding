of appeal second district division  california versa technologies inc petitioner v superior court of the state of california county of los angeles respondent perry dean motsinger real party in interest civ      decided march   dolan  davis by robert e kelly jr los angeles for petitioner no appearance for respondent court james h davis and john m inferrera los angeles for real party in interest petition for writ of mandate to require respondent court to vacate its order denying petitioners motion for summary judgment and to enter a new and different order granting said motion we granted an alternative writfactsreal party in interest perry dean motsinger was injured by the alleged malfunction of a certain blowmolding machine and alleged that the malfunction was caused by among other things the defective operation of a certain camoperated air valve the valve bore the legend “versa” and was alleged to have been manufactured by petitioner versa technologies incversa technologies inc filed a motion for summary judgment supported by the affidavit of its president to the effect that the valve in question had not been manufactured by versa technologies inc of racine county wisconsin the declaration of robert e kelly jr esq counsel for versa technologies inc alleged that the valve was easily identifiable as having been manufactured by versa products company of new jerseythe declaration of john m inferrera esq one of the lawyers representing real party and plaintiff motsinger shows that he twice offered to enter a voluntary dismissal as to mr kellys client once before the motion for summary judgment was heard and again after mr kellys motion for summary judgment had been deniedmr inferrera filed no counteraffidavits in opposition to mr kellys motion it is alleged that the motion was denied upon the ground that there was no showing that the photographs of the valve upon which the president of versa technologies inc based his affidavit represented the actual product which allegedly caused the injury mr inferrera takes the position that he did not know whether the valve was identical to the one that allegedly caused the injury while mr kelly takes the position that it was represented to him to be similar to the valve that caused the injury and that he photographed the valve so represented at mr inferreras officediscussionthe purpose of a motion for summary judgment is to discover proof to expedite litigation and to provide for prompt disposition of actions where there is in fact no triable issue martin v general finance co  calappd   calrptr  bank of america etc v oil well s co  calappd   pd  newport v city of los angeles  calappd   calrptr where as in the present case it is conceded by counsel for real party and plaintiff that he has named the wrong party it is his duty to file a voluntary dismissal whether such dismissal is requested agreed to or not presumably as soon as the motion for summary judgment was filed counsel for real party was put upon notice that he should determine whether versa technologies inc was indeed the manufacturer of the valve in question since counsel for real party informs us under penalty of perjury that he offered to file a voluntary dismissal even after petitioners motion had been denied we must assume that he had made the determination that petitioner was not in fact the manufacturer of the valve instead of filing a dismissal however he filed opposition to this petitionit is true that by means of interrogatories and requests for admissions counsel for petitioner might have constructed an airtight motion for summary judgment it is also true that his motion is something less than artful we believe however that where a question of identity of one of the parties is raised in the form of a motion for summary judgment then the opposing party should be required at the very least to file a counteraffidavit under penalty of perjury setting forth the facts upon which he bases his goodfaith belief that the party is the actual manufacturer of the product involvedsome of the facts which are before us may not have been before the superior court possibly because the superior court took the position that no opposition was necessary surely if the superior court had known that counsel for real party was willing to file a voluntary dismissal it would have granted the motion for summary judgment it would seem that counsel have put the courts to a good deal of trouble merely to satisfy a clash of personalitieslet a peremptory writ of mandate issue requiring respondent court to vacate

they will not provide anymore updates windows updates for security flaws system enhancements or the like for windows and any microsoft products being run under windows xp migrating from windows xp if you are going to migrate from windows xp to a newer operating system try looking for a computer with windows  on it better yet look for windows  professional more options and tools try to steer clear of windows  as this new operating can be a culture shock for someone who is comfortable with working in windows xp   still using windows xp note read the highlighted areas below on the status of windows   and the next os  just because microsoft has stopped providing support and updates to windows xp see sidebar doesnt mean you have to stop using your computer however it does mean that it will be more vulnerable to threats from the internet there are measures you can take to mitigate these threats but at some point you will have to either upgrade your existing computer not recommended or replace your computer with one with a new operating system on it upgrading an existing windows xp computer this method is not recommended because a newer operating system windows  or  may not run on your existing computer due to hardware incompatibility to test your computer for windows  compatibility go to microsofts compatibility centers website opens a new window the reason a newer operating system may not work with your old computer is because of old technology with both your software programs you use or the hardware and devices you use replacing your xp machine this is by far the best choice but it can be costly costly not only for the computer itself but for the newer software programs youll have to buy for it not all of your existing programs will work under windows  or  if youre going to move to windows  youll find theres a learning curve a steep learning curve microsoft has changed the familiar start button interface with a panel layout more favorable to touch panel devices there is a way to get to the somewhatsimilar old interface but it can be confusing for most people and that interface isnt entirely like what were all used to if you move to windows  youll find it very similar to windows xp windows  will be around for awhile to come but it will eventually be archived much like xp also to get windows  youre going to have to hunt for it from the manufacturers dell hp etc its still available on new computers its just harder to find microsoft is really pushing windows  december  update there will be no windows  in microsofts words  will be too closely associated with  which carry with it too many negative feelings windows  technical preview is being tested at this time no release date has been specified but microsoft promises that it will be out in the latter part of  december  previews search youtube for windows  or click here for some walkthroughs on the new os skip the searching and watch this one its provides a pretty good overview fall  update windows  has become much easier to find thanks to windows  on new computers as microsoft has made a commitment to abandon windows  entirely they will continue to support it but its going much the way windows millennium edition went see this page for end of supportlife details on microsoft systems scroll to the windows section for oss may  update a reputable insider to all things microsoft says that the company is working on windows  to debut as early as the third quarter of  there may be truth to this as windows  has been so poorly received by the business community continue to use windows xp if youre going to continue to use windows xp there are certain things that you should ensure you have on it for protection if the windows xp computer is not attached nor will it ever be in the future to the internet then you can use it for as long as the hardware will hold out in reality however most computers are attached to the internet in this case you need to ensure you have at least all of the following software programs on your computer an antimalware program an antivirus program and a firewall antimalware software there are some free antimalware programs available just search for antimalware software or click here for google results the one i like and recommend is from malwarebytes opens a new window theres a free version available but buy a registered copy of it there are more options for you you can buy it for home or business they have a bulk licensing program pricing starts at around  do not use microsofts antimalware products as they will not be updated due to end of support antivirus software whatever brand or version you currently use check with the producers of it to ensure you will still be getting updates for it like antimalware software there are many antivirus software programs available for free again just search for antivirus software click here for google results i like avg free or purchased for the free version see their website opens a new window you can also purchase a version of it as you go through the installation process the purchased version gives you more protection tools review their options to see what best fits your needs again do not use a microsoft antivirus product firewall you should at least have windows firewall on  better yet to stay away from microsoft products that are no longer supported download a firewall software product there are many free ones still available search for firewall software click here for google results for a solid free firewall check out zone alarms firewall opens new window they have a version you can buy as well web surfing microsofts internet explorer is probably the mostsusceptible web browser for attacks of all kinds its a buggy browser and its slower than other browsers as well and now that microsoft has stopped support for xp their ie browser is going to be targeted more often in the future by hackers if you continue to use your windows xp computer it is imperative that you do not use internet explorer at all firefox new window is a much more secure faster and everevolving browser that you can continue to use and it will receive updates when they are available googles chrome new window is another choice though for the technically inclined it doesnt offer a lot of configuration choices there are many more browsers besides these two alternatives see wikipedias entry new window for a complete listing summary once you have the three products on your computer make absolutely certain that they are working properly and are receiving updates new antivirus and antimalware definition files make certain your firewall is on and do not use mss internet explorer you can extend the life of your xp computer by following the steps above it doesnt guarantee your computer wont be compromised from an outside threat but it will lessen the likelihood if you or your company wants help in any of the above areas configuring your xp computers or in migrating to new computers id be happy to assist you please send me an email or call me at  and we can discuss your objectives stephen       verse technologies • portland maine  copyright    versa
