funds private equity funds and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments before you invest in alternative investments you should consider your overall financial situation how much money you have to invest your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk  nonfinancial assets such as closelyheld businesses real estate oil gas and mineral properties and timber farm and ranch land

don’t have an investment allocation to real estate investment trusts “reits” because they believe they already have “enough” exposure to “real estate” through ownership of their home reits and your home are very different asset classes with very different characteristics reits invest primarily in commercial real estate which is any nonresidential property used for commercial profitmaking purposes your home is an investment in residential real estate which is a type of property containing either a singlefamily or multifamily structure which is available for occupation and nonbusiness purposes performance over the past  years publiclytraded reits have returned an annualized  total return and homes have returned  or just a little more than inflation over these  years reits returned more than x  while homes didn’t quite double  publiclytraded reits have been one of the top performing asset classes and homes have been one of the worst over the past  years there are many differences between reits and your home that contribute to this notable difference in performance the largest contributor is that commercial real estate can generate positive cash flows but the residential home you live in cannot by living in your home you are effectively consuming the market rate rent that your home might have procured if you forgo rent as you do by living in your home the return profile changes to be basically little more than an inflation hedge performance of real estate follows the following formula total return  price change  rent collected diversification with your home  of the asset is in one property type and in one geographic market – this is concentration in its purist form the opposite of diversification on the other hand with publiclytraded reits investors can choose from dozens of property types including but not limited to specialized real estate sectors such as data centers cell phone towers casinos medical research labs infrastructure prisons ski areas etc across any market in the us and most major markets in the world the opportunity for diversification in publiclytraded reits vastly exceeds that of a single home liquidity homes are relatively illiquid compared to public reits that can be traded every day the stock market is open and settle to cash virtually immediately this is in stark contrast to the home market which may be illiquid for months seasons or even years and can take months to settle to cash transaction costs transacting a home is much more costly than transacting in publiclytraded reits when you sell a home the typical transaction cost is more than  of the home’s sale price for perspective based on data from the last  years as shown in the total return chart above this is equal to about five years’ worth of your home’s price appreciation after inflation in contrast it costs little more than pocket change to trade shares of a public reit  per trade at fidelity and  per trade at scottrade flexibility home ownership is not flexible the entry price for a home is typically sixfigures and you can’t really buy or sell a percentage of a home – it is binary either you are in all the way or you are completely out with publiclytraded reits you can buy almost any amount you wish in single share increments typically share on the stock market with public reits you can trim add or change a position in almost any amount on almost any day supply  demand perhaps the single most impactful factor that undermines home price appreciation is the ability of developers to add new product to the market in our opinion homes are the type of real estate most likely to be oversupplied because we believe they are the cheapest smallest quickest and least complicated real estate product type to build aaca also believes that whenever the cost to build new homes is below the current market value of existing homes builders will build new homes which could create a price ceiling on the appreciation of your home additionally in recessions construction costs materials and labor costs decrease which makes building new homes less expensive and creates additional new supply this combination of factors could dampen your home’s price rebound out of a recession relative to public reits as shown in the historical graph below volatility let’s look at volatility of publiclytraded reits and homes below is a graph of the past  years which includes the financial crisis since public reits trade on the stock market the share price of these reits are subject to fluctuation in the stock market and as such experience volatility however we would argue the underlying physical real estate owned by the reits can’t be much different in volatility than your physical home the difference is that your home isn’t bought and sold every day and marked to that market price that being said in the graph below we see that homes sold off  and public reits sold off  in the financial crisis however looking at a longer period of time homes captured  of the downside and  of the upside of public reits over the past  years – homes have been asymmetrical to the downside and public reits have since gone on to return  over the past  years while homes have returned  in that same time period final thoughts we believe you should think of your home first and foremost as the place you and your family live and second as an inflation hedge for your invested principal – nothing more than that you should not think of your home as an investment in real estate as history shows there has been almost no meaningful return after inflation publiclytraded reits and your home are very different asset classes with very different characteristics but what if i rent my home out but what if i buy a home and rent it out that would be good right sure you will grab the warranted rent assuming you can find a good renter but you may also be the one grabbing a plunger to fix the toilet on christmas eve when your renter calls also you still need a place to live so you will presumably either be buying or renting a home to live in additionally it is probably unlikely that you can rent one house as efficiently as a public reit that has professional leasing revenue optimization software economies of scale expert experience market knowledge and realtime industry data lastly if you want to buy a home and rent it out there are several publiclytraded reits that do that   this is a summary and does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities or to participate in any
