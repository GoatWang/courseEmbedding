salmon and trout it’s the substance that gives these marine animals their distinct color animals have adapted to exploit the health benefits of astaxanthin astaxanthin is believed to protect microalgae from environmental stress salmon accumulate astaxanthin from their diet and store it in their muscle tissue astaxanthin is believed to protect salmon from oxidative stress when they swim upstream to spawn – a taxing and traumatic event identification and study richard kuhn in  richard kuhn identified and isolated astaxanthin from lobster kuhn had setup a laboratory on the banks of the neckar river in germany and quickly established his reputation as a leading experimentalist in organic chemistry astaxanthin was one of the earliest carotenoids to be examined by the broader research community noting that astaxanthin was found to improve animal health and vitality further scientific study ensued to date over  peerreviewed papers exploring astaxanthin have been published in scientific journals more than  peerreviewed papers have been published by cardax team members ten of which appeared in the american journal of cardiology supplementation humans have been consuming a

the health in humans and animals astaxanthin is proven to reduce inflammation at its source without the harmful side effects of common antiinflammatories and pain relievers cardax’s pharmaceutical development program for astaxanthin will target conditions where inflammation is strongly implicated including osteoarthritis astaxanthin is well positioned to meet the needs of patients suffering from osteoarthritis astaxanthin reduces inflammation equivalent a steroid in nonhuman tests but is far safer than steroids nsaids or tnfα inhibitors learn more  metabolic syndrome astaxanthin could decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in humans astaxanthin has been shown to significantly lower bad cholesterol ldlc and triglycerides while simultaneously raising good cholesterol hdlc similarly in animal models of disease astaxanthin significantly decreased blood pressure and fasting glucose levels learn more  other conditions astaxanthin has the potential to treat a variety of conditions driven by inflammation learn more  proof of concept astaxanthin has demonstrated efficacy in models of inflammatorymediated disease including reduction of tnfα levels equivalent to a steroid reduction of liver enzymes and liver histological damage reduction of cholesterol levels reduction of elevated triglycerides decrease of atheroma formation reduction of oxidizedldl levels reduction in blood clot formation with no increase in bleeding and decrease in myocardial tissue damage following experimentallyinduced myocardial infarction  peer reviewed papers featuring astaxanthin have been published in leading scientific journals learn more  mechanism of action following oral administration of astaxanthin and intestinal uptake astaxanthin is delivered initially to the liver via chylomicrons and subsequently distributed to tissues throughout the body via plasma lipoprotein particles including very lowdensity lipoprotein “vldl” hdl and ldl once in the cell astaxanthin accumulates within various organelles including nuclear endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membranes localization within mitochondria is highly controlled by the cell and allows astaxanthin to uniquely regulate oxidative and nitrosative stress in a privileged location critical to normal metabolic function and often at the heart of metabolic dysfunction and aging due to its chemical structure astaxanthin completely spans the lipid component of cell membranes facilitating its biphasic aqueous and lipid antioxidant functions in support of the unique property of astaxanthin one study examined xray diffraction profiles of five structurally related antioxidants embedded in a lipid matrix and demonstrated that each oriented differently with only astaxanthin traversing the lipid potentially explaining in part why other wellknown antioxidants including betacarotene vitamin c and vitamin e have not achieved greater clinical success in addition to mitochondrial influence astaxanthin’s remarkable aqueous and lipid antioxidant functions have the capacity to influence intracellular inflammatory and metabolic pathway signaling because many important intracellular pathways are directly modulated by inflammatory and oxidative stress mediators in support of strong antioxidant function within the body astaxanthin administration has demonstrated statistically significant antioxidant capacity in humans as measured by decreased isoprostanes decreased malondialdehyde “mda” levels increased total antioxidant capacity “tac” and increased superoxide dismutase “sod” as well as decreased lipid peroxidation likewise numerous animal studies have supported the extensive and powerful antioxidant capacity of astaxanthin in vivo many studies support the strong influence of astaxanthin on mitochondrial functionality as well as inflammatory and metabolic intracellular signaling in animals and in cellbased models astaxanthin vs steroids and nsaids most antiinflammatory drugs target highly specific biological enzymes or receptors such as cyclooxygenase  “cox” tnfα and cc chemokine receptor type  “ccr” while these natural targets play a significant role in inflammation they are also critical components of other important biological pathways with chronic use of most antiinflammatories these pathways may not function normally resulting in adverse side effects including immune system suppression liver damage cardiovascular disease risk and gastrointestinal bleeding in contrast astaxanthin safely reduces inflammation at its source in that it localizes in the plasma mitochondrial and nuclear membranes scavenges or quenches the unwanted initiators and effectors of inflammation—reactive oxygen “ros” and nitrogen species “rns” and demonstrates no evidence of the immunosuppressive effects of steroids or tnfα inhibitors or offtarget effects eg receptor or pathway astaxanthinhistory and background
