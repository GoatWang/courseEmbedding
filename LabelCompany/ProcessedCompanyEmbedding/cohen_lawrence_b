have seen so many doctors  for so many illnesses  for so many years that i was resigning myself to a lifetime of drugs disease and decline i felt like i would never be truly well again that the best i would ever be able to do is control symptoms and cope the best i could the doctors i had seen and i’d seen my share of them could never really offer me answers all they could do is order a test or prescribe something and whatever they prescribed just masked the symptoms – it never got to what was the real problem i knew i was on the wrong path but didn’t know how to explain it and didn’t know how to find another path until i found dr kellmandr kellman is an entirely different kind of physician it’s not just that he is a good listener and truly cares – though he is and he does it’s that he sees the underlying patterns to disease in ways other doctors seem to miss his insights run deeper and his medicalscientific knowledge is broader than any doctor i have ever encountered simply put dr kellman is in a class of his own not only is he more capable and knowledgeable than anyone i’d ever come across he is also philosophically unique in that he approaches the patient with a goal of wellness not just of treating disease combine this mindset with cutting edge medicine and you have someone that transforms lives it’s been  months and the results have been dramatic dr kellman has gotten to the bottom of my health issues where so many other physicians failed i am stronger healthier and more alive than i have been in many years it’s hard to put into words just how unique dr kellman is or how much he has changed my life the term “miracleworker” seems cliché but it’s no exaggeration he also has a ton of really good information on his website if you don’t want to treat the disease but instead want to be truly well you really should see this amazing man have always been an optimist i believe life can be better now thanks to dr kellman mine isphilip j miller md facsindi p ratedby the time i found myself in dr millers office i had wanted a nose job for over a decade i was miserable and depressed i hated my nose for so long and it was the only thing i saw when i looked in the mirror for years i fantasized about getting it done but i was too scared i would look fake i was scared i wouldnt recognize myself when i looked in the mirror or that my friends and family would say what did you do to your face or worsethey wouldnt even recognize me at all despite all these fears i researched for weeks looking for the top cosmetic surgeons and the best facial surgeons etc until i narrowed it down to a handful of prestigious renowned doctorsdr philip miller being one of them of course i set up consultations with all of them but dr miller was the first and only one i went to within just  minutes of the initial consult i felt at ease dr miller and his staff assured me that  it didnt matter what anyone else thought what mattered was that i was happy with my nose and  and more importantlydr miller is an artist who specializes in bringing harmony to the face and giving his patients a natural looking nose in that appointment he also recommended i get a chin implant to create harmony in my facial proportions and i am so glad i did after the healing process i felt finally alive finally myself and finally beautiful i felt like the face in the mirror was the one that had been there all along just dying to come out i did not feel fake or unnatural it felt like he found the nose i was meant to have and created a harmonious face i could feel proud of and grateful for since my procedure i am a new woman my life and world have opened up with so many possibilities i have confidence and i feel feminine and powerful i couldnt possibly recommend dr miller more he will change your lifephilip j miller md facshazelharbin rateddr miller did my rhinoplasty and fat injections under the eyes a month ago it was a pretty nice experience i mean i met with dr miller a few times and he addressed my concerns the staff was pretty helpful i kept going back and forth as far as what i wanted to get done and they were very accommodating i cancelled twice and kept rescheduling and it was such a very nice experience i like the fact that he was and ear nose and throat specialist i researched where he’s initially studied and then after looking at some of the photos online it just looks very natural and i wanted a natural look and i didnt want people to be able to tell that i had it done after reviewing his portfolio online and meeting him i went to a couple of different doctors and this was a better experience he seems to know what he was talking about he assured me that it would look more natural its going to just enhance the other features on my face and thats exactly what i was looking to hear its only been a month so already i can see some sort of improvement theres still some swelling and stuff but it takes a year for this thing to heal i mean the profile of my face looks a lot better and my face just looks a lot i dont know what the right word is it just looks a lot softer you know i dont have my nose overbearing on my face anymore

miller md facsjacobj ratedi had a rhinoplasty in may by dr miller i researched online and read reviews from magazines and things like that this was actually my revision rhinoplasty it was done in march for the first time the result initially was great and i was very happy with it but as my nose healed it just healed in a really weird way where the bump was starting to come back a little bit so about a year later i went back to visit he saw it and then immediately we came up with a date for him to just revise it and fix it i got it done because my nose was really bad its just visibly horrible i had a huge bump it went a lot smoother than i thought it was going to go especially the second time around it was definitely better my down time was maybe a couple of days so people shouldnt be that reluctant to get it done if they think they should do it you know get it done once the cast is off i could see right away that the bump was completely removed i had a pretty big bump right on the bridge of my nose so as soon as it was taken off you know it was a little bit swollen but i could see that it was gone im really happy with the result hes very professional he let me know everything that was going to happen as far as healing and everything went very smooth philip j miller md facsshaymes ratedi heard from a friend and wordi heard from a friend and wordofmouth in the city that dr miller was a highly recommended plastic surgeon and having received a surgery performed by him i’d do the same when i went to meet with him at his office his staff was great from the minute i walked in everyone was very nice and welcoming and they went through some questions with me before i met with the doctor he went over the eyes minilift and the co laser peel procedure with me and made sure i understood which was great he gave me all the information i needed to make the decision and pretty much covered all my questions in early april i went in to receive both procedures dr miller was amazing and always there whenever i needed him i spoke with him late one night and on the weekend because i was nervous and something wasn’t right he made sure that his assistant came right in and saw me and everything was fine the way i healed was amazing my scars are minimal and i was back to my regular activities in about three weeks i like everything about my resultsstifelman michael

appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give
