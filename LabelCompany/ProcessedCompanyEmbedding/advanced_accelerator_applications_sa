molecular nuclear medicine mnm molecular nuclear medicine is a medical specialty using trace amounts of active substances called radiopharmaceuticals to create images of organs and lesions and to treat various diseases like cancer the technique works by injecting targeted radiopharmaceuticals into the patients body that accumulate in the organs or lesions and reveal specific biochemical processes mnm can be divided in two branches molecular nuclear diagnostics and molecular nuclear therapy molecular nuclear diagnostics employs a variety of imaging devices and radiopharmaceuticals pet positron emission tomography and spect single photon emission computed tomography are highly sensitive imaging technologies that enable physicians to diagnose different types of cancer cardiovascular diseases neurological disorders and other diseases in their early stages molecular nuclear therapy uses radioactive sources radionuclides to treat a range of tumor types using shortrange particles

revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too

nasdaqaaap aaa or the company an international specialist in molecular nuclear medicine mnm today announced a year exclusive supply agreement for lutetium  with the university of missouri research reactor murr® through this agreement murr® will supply aaa with gmpquality lutetium  chloride the precursor for production of investigational product lutetium lu  dotatate lutathera® and other lu based therapeutics in development lutetium  is a radionuclide that emits both highenergy beta and lowenergy gamma radiation beta particles electrons are commonly used as an external radiation source to treat solid tumors known as radiotherapy however in nuclear medicine tumor killing beta particles are delivered to tumors intravenously by labeling a targeting molecule such as dotatate with a radionuclide such as lutetium  as in lutetium lu  dotatate lutathera® the targeting molecule has an affinity for certain tumor receptors creating a rapid uptake of these molecules by the tumor cells the beta emitting radiation of the radionuclide is treating the tumor while the gamma emitting radiation may be visualized using specialized imaging techniques enabling quantification of treatment delivery to tumor cells ralph butler executive director of murr® commented “murr® has a proud history of providing research isotopes to industry since the early days of targeted lu  research at murr® our vision has been to reliably supply lu  chloride for research and ultimately produce directly for drug manufacturers this agreement completes our vision as we believe aaa’s breakthrough investigational product lutathera® is on the verge of approval in the usa and europe and will be widely administered to patients the agreement also allows murr® to continue its worldwide research collaborations using this uniquely capable isotope” stefano buono chief executive officer of aaa stated “this agreement complements our existing supply of lutetium  from our idb subsidiary in the netherlands and supports our plans to produce lutetium lu  dotatate lutathera® for the north american market at our millburn nj site lutetium ’s utility in oncology therapy has been long documented

diagnostics and operates throughout the world with over  locations in the united states europe and asia aaap also faces competition from larger healthcare companies such as ge healthcare which have varying degrees of investment in pet but whose products and sales comprise a significant proportion of the mnm market in addition aaap faces competition from local companies and university hospitals that operate within specific geographic areas while these competitors may have more limited manufacturing infrastructure than aaap does they may have greater experience or a more established reputation in these areas than aaap does spect aaap faces competition in the field of spect from a greater number of spect manufacturers than aaap does in pet given the more established and widespread

“aaa” or “the company” an international specialist in molecular nuclear medicine mnm announced today that it has acquired the remaining  of atreus pharmaceuticals corporation a developmentstage biopharmaceutical company headquartered in ottawa canada and focused on the development of proprietary molecular imaging products aimed at imaging apoptosis and necrosis based on annexin v atreus pharmaceuticals corporation is now a fully owned aaa subsidiary and has been renamed aaa canada aaa also announces the enrollment of the first patient in the phase iiia clinical trial to evaluate the safety pharmacokinetics and dosing of key diagnostic product candidate mtcrhannexin v in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis the study will also assess the ability of mtcrhannexin v to identify the disease and to monitor the effectiveness of current drug treatment mtcrhannexin v is a single photon emission computed tomography spect radiopharmaceutical agent being developed to detect early cell stress and apoptosis programmed cell death in a number of pathological conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in this phase iiia clinical trial  patients will be enrolled to receive two doses of mtcrhannexin v one at baseline and one after drug treatment the principal investigator of the study is prof john prior university hospital of lausanne switzerland a phase i trial has been completed at the university of ottawa heart institute in canada to assess the safety pharmacokinetics and dosing of mtcrhannexin v in  healthy volunteers the results are currently being analysed the principal investigator of this study is dr terrence ruddy stefano buono chief executive officer of aaa commented these two announcements are key milestones in aaa’s progress the acquisition of the remaining  of atreus has been triggered by a number of successful milestones achieved during the development of annexin v i am delighted that atreus’ founder bill dickie will now be president and ceo of aaa canada and will continue working with us in what we expect will be the development of products based on annexin v we are also very excited to be initiating the first of a series of new phase iii clinical trials aimed at understanding the potential of mtcrhannexin v in different indications” bill dickie president and chief executive officer of aaa canada added “mtcrhannexin v potentially has multiple applications in cardiology oncology and autoimmune disorders as it detects the fundamental process of apoptosis many diseases are increasingly treated with powerful and expensive biologic drugs an imaging biomarker of apoptosis has the potential to be an important personalized disease management tool prof john prior said “early diagnosis and effective treatment management is crucial for the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and can lead to a significantly improved quality of life for patients suffering from these progressive debilitating diseases” dr terrence ruddy added “mtcrhannexin v imaging has many exciting potential applications the single vial mtcrhannexin v kit being developed by aaa is convenient to use and has the potential to become a cost effective tool in the diagnosis and management of a wide range of diseases” aaa has an exclusive worldwide license to develop proprietary molecular imaging products based on annexin v about mtcrhannexin v and spect mtcrhannexin v is a single photon emission computed tomography spect radiopharmaceutical agent in development that aims to detect early cell stress and apoptosis in vivo to assess programmed cell death in a number of pathological conditions including rheumatoid arthritis ankylosing spondylitis and
