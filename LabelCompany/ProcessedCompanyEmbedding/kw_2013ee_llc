complacent in managing the server for example it is important that you run the sbs  best practices analyzer on your server on a regular basis whether that is monthly or quarterly run it on a recent

install exchange  sp on sbs  by kw · comments  may   carl gray “oxford sbs guy” has a very good step by step blog on installing exchange  sp on sbs including screen shots so there’s no need for me to replicate what he has already posted however there are two critical steps he did not include before you start the sp upgrade please go into services and stop the windows sbs manager service please make sure that you do not have windows management framework wmf  installed on the server look for kb you will need to uninstall this patch and then reboot the server before you install the sp upgrade susan bradley has previously posted on both of these issues see stop sbs manager and uninstall wmf  i also offer some additional advice to add to his process which you may find helpful when downloading the exchangespxexe file put it into an empty temp folder say downloadsesptemp then when you double click on the exe to extract all the files it will extract the files to this same temp folder once the sp upgrade is completed all you need to do for cleanup is to delete this one temp folder i highly recommend that you make sure that you have a full recent backup of your server before you start i also recommend that you reboot the server before starting the upgrade process if you are installing sp remotely using rwa be aware that you will lose your remote connection during this process do not panic the sp upgrade will stop the rdpgateway service just be patient give the upgrade about  minutes to complete eventually you will be able to connect back in via rwa and when you do you should find that the upgrade has completed if sp has been installed successfully i would suggest rebooting the server again it doesn’t hurt and in some cases it may help finally carl says to check that the version of exchange is correct here is how i perform that step open up exchange management shell type the following getexchangeserver  fl nameeditionadmindisplayversion the build number for

servers tools tags  sbs extend keyboard and mouse with synergy by kw · comments  may   last august i wrote about a utility called mouse without borders developed in microsoft’s “the garage” that allows you to use one keyboard and mouse to control multiple computers and the utility works very great that is unless you also have linux or mac os x computers which you also want to control with a single keyboard and mouse so here comes synergy which offers to extend your mouse and keyboard to all three environments and did i say that it is free i decided to take it for a spin today and i was quite surprised at how easy it was to install and run it for this first effort i only installed it on two windows computers at a later date i will post my efforts to include a linux or mac workstation my scenario i have a windows  x workstation with three monitors and a windows r x server running hyperv installsetup first workstation my mouse and keyboard that i wish to use is on my win workstation so i first downloaded the windows bit version of synergy and installed it i designate this as my synergy “server” it then asks what type on encryption i wish to use that’s a really nice feature as it does provide some protection from anyone trying to intercept your keystrokes you have a choice of four  different encryption modes or you can disable encryption for purposes of testing i chose to not enable encryption    the only other step to do is to click on the configure server… button you will have a screen where you can describe your setup indicating in which direction the monitor for each of the other workstations is located         installsetup on next workstation in this case my second workstation which synergy refers to as a client is running windows server  r x i am also running hyperv manager on this server so i decided to install the synergy client to the hyperv parent so i can control all of my hyperv guests so i download and install the  bit version of synergy and install it this time when it asks server or client i’ll select “client” then you need to tell the synergy client the name of the computer that is the “synergy “server”    i thought i was all done but my mouse would not move over to the monitor attached to my server at first i thought it was a firewall issue but turning off the firewall on the wkr server did not fix it in fact if you check the firewall settings you will find that synergy had automatically added the proper inbound tcp and udp rules i then checked services and discovered that the synergy service had not yet been started after doing so i immediately saw that synergy was communicating between the two computers and my single mouse and keyboard was now controlling both computers comments  categories  news servers tools windows tags
