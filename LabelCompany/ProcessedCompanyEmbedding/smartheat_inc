technology co beijing smartheat jinhui energy ltd technology co ltd indicates a subsidiary of a subsidiary all other entities are directly owned by smartheat inc table of contents principal factors affecting our financial performance our revenues are subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the industry changes in prc government fiscal policies inflation in china and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns our revenues may fluctuate due to the seasonal nature of central heating services in the prc because the equipment used in residential buildings must be delivered prior to the beginning of the heating season in late fall which occurs during the third and fourth calendar quarters in china we also anticipate decreased sales volume in the first calendar quarter compared to other quarters as our customers generally install and test our products during this period and are in the process of budgeting their new projects additionally any significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay of commercial acceptance of new products unfavorable sales trends in existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our revenue growth or cause a decline in quarterly revenue in response to inflationary concerns the prc government tightened fiscal policies beginning in  that contributed to a slowdown in many sectors of chinas economy and restricted bank lending practices chinas economy grew at its slowest pace in three years during  according to the national bureau of statistics of china this slow growth continued into the first quarter of  historically approximately  of our customers representing the majority of our total sales consist of stateowned enterprises in china many of these customers the majority of which are real estate developers encountered difficulties in  and  in obtaining grants from the prc government and faced an extended bank loan application process both of which typically are used to finance the purchase of our products these conditions continued into  accordingly the continued deflationary policy of the prc government affected the number of new sales of our phes and phe units as certain stateowned enterprises deferred bidding for new projects because of their working capital difficulties or abandoned existing projects the decline in new projects among stateowned enterprises and increased peer competition contributed to a decline in sales of our phes and phe units in   and the first quarter of  we also canceled contracts in  with certain of these stateowned customers that were unable to make payments or that had requested adjustments to their payment terms in response to their financial difficulties although these events caused a decrease in our sales in   and into  a portion of the canceled phe and phe unit orders were reinstated in  and we expect that additional orders and contracts that were canceled or partially delayed will be performed in  reducing the impact of the drop in our sales over the long term furthermore the prc government remains committed to the construction of affordable housing projects and emissionreduction and energysaving policies which we believe will continue to drive demand for our clean technology heat transfer products our revenues also may fluctuate significantly due to material costs which normally account for approximately  of our cost of sales we experienced and anticipate continued fluctuation in raw material costs as a result of world economic conditions such as the price of stainless steel used to produce plates our phes and phe units we monitor the commodities markets for pricing trends and changes but do not engage in hedging to protect against raw material fluctuations instead we attempt to mitigate the shortterm risks of price swings by purchasing raw materials in advance based on production needs and projected sales we typically experience stronger sales during the second half of the year which is the start of fall and winter in china during which we historically generate the majority of our revenue accordingly we increased our inventory and advances to suppliers during the first three quarters of  and  in anticipation of our historical high season for production management believes our current levels of increased inventory resulting from the unexpected abandonment of projects and cancelation of orders by certain customers in  and  will be consumed throughout  as we fulfill new orders and delayed and reinstated contracts although we currently are able to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials it is impossible to predict future availability or cost unfavorable fluctuations in the price quality or availability of required raw materials could negatively affect our cash flows and ability to meet the demands of our customers which could result in the loss of future sales table of contents our profitability depends upon the margin between the cost to us of goods used in the manufacturing process such as plates pumps water tanks sensors control systems and other raw materials as well as our fabrication costs associated with converting such goods and raw materials compared to the selling price of our products and the overall supply of raw materials we intend to base the selling prices of our products upon the associated raw materials costs to us which typically make up approximately  of total cost we may not be able to pass all increases in raw material costs and ancillary acquisition costs associated with taking possession of raw materials through to our customers however and there may be a time lag as we bid on new projects and renegotiate pricing with our existing customers furthermore to ease inflationary pressure on our costs we implemented new controls over our purchasing process and raw material pricing by adopting a new budgetary control system to monitor our fixed costs and continued improvements to our manufacturing process to decrease labor cost and improve manufacturing efficiency the economic conditions our subsidiaries faced in   and in the first quarter of  made it impossible for our subsidiaries to pay dividends to our us parent company which is dependent upon such dividends to meet its financial obligations relevant prc statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by the companys prc subsidiaries only out of the subsidiarys retained earnings if any as determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations further the companys prc subsidiaries are required to take certain reserves as detailed in note  to our financial statements as a result we sought alternative sources of capital for our us parent company on july   we entered into a secured revolving credit facility with northtech holdings inc a british virgin islands business corporation owned by certain members of our former management james wang rhett wang and wen sha jane ai our corporate secretary is also a part owner of northtech as amended on december   the credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to  with any amounts borrowed maturing on april   borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by  of the equity interest in each of our wholly directlyowned subsidiaries and are repayable at our option in shares of our common stock on december   we repaid  of the  outstanding under the credit agreement with  restricted shares of our common stock approximately  of our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock as authorized by the credit agreement and approved by our shareholders as of march   the balance owing to northtech under the credit agreement was  significant accounting policies while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis basis of presentation our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us or us gaap principle of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of smartheats us parent and its subsidiaries taiyu sandeke smartheat siping jinhui smartheat investment smartheat energy smartheat trading ruicheng smartheat germany and smartheat pump all significant intercompany accounts and transactions were eliminated in consolidation in preparing the financial statements in conformity with us gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates required by management include the recoverability of longlived assets allowance for doubtful accounts and the reserve for obsolete and slowmoving inventories actual results could differ from those estimates table of contents accounts receivable we maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts customer concentrations customer credit worthiness current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves accounts receivable are net of unearned interest unearned interest represents imputed interest on accounts receivable with due dates over one year from the invoice date discounted at our borrowing rate for the year based on historical collection activity we had bad debt allowances of  million and  million at march   and december   respectively impairment of longlived assets we assess the impairment of longlived assets which include tangible assets such as property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the longlived assets or the appropriate grouping of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists if an asset is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on fair value fv generally determined using the assets expected future discounted cash flows or market value if readily determinable the following are indicators management considers in determining whether it is necessary to test assets for impairment in accordance with asc   significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually using a twostep approach based on this valuation approach we concluded the goodwill balance of  million for smartheat germany was impaired as of december   based on our review we believe that as of march   and december   there were no significant impairments of our other longlived assets revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab  codified in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  sales revenue is recognized when phes heat meters and hps are delivered and for phe units when customer acceptance occurs the price is fixed or determinable no other significant obligations of ours exist and collectability is reasonably assured payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue under advance from customers our agreements with our customers generally provide that  of the purchase price is due upon placement of an order  upon delivery and  upon installation and acceptance of the equipment after customer testing as a common practice in the heating manufacturing business in china payment of the final  of the purchase price is due no later than the termination date of the standard warranty period which ranges from  to  months from the acceptance date due to the slowdown of the chinese economy and tightened monetary policy and in order to attract and retain customers the companys subsidiaries have adjusted their contract and payment terms on a casebycase basis to permit for more flexible and longer payment terms table of contents our standard warranty is provided to all customers and is not considered an additional service rather it is an integral part of the product sale we believe the existence of the standard product warranty in a sales contract does not constitute a deliverable in the arrangement and thus there is no need to apply the eitf  codified in fasb asc topic  separation and allocation model for a multiple deliverable arrangement sfas  codified in fasb asc topic  specifically addresses the accounting for standard warranties and neither sab  nor eitf  supersedes sfas  we believe accounting for our standard warranty pursuant to sfas  does not impact revenue recognition because the cost of honoring the warranty can be reliably estimated we charge for aftersales services provided after the expiration of the warranty period with aftersales services mainly consisting of cleaning phes and repairing and exchanging parts we recognize such revenue when service is provided the revenue earned from these services was not material during the three months ended march   and  foreign currency translation and comprehensive income loss the functional currency of our subsidiaries in china is rmb the functional currency of smartheat germany our german subsidiary is eur for financial reporting purposes rmb and eur were translated into usd as the reporting currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income there was no significant fluctuation in exchange rate for the conversion of rmb to usd after the balance sheet date we use statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  reporting comprehensive income codified in fasb asc topic  comprehensive income is comprised of net income and all changes to the statements of stockholders equity except those due to investments by shareholders changes in paidin capital and distributions to shareholders recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income asc topic  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income the new asu requires entities to disclose in a single location either on the face of the financial statement that reports net income or in the notes the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci for items reclassified out of aoci and into net income in their entirety entities must disclose the effect of the reclassification on each affected net income item for aoci reclassification items that are not reclassified in their entirety into net income entities must provide a crossreference to other required us gaap disclosures there is no change in the requirement to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements the asu does not change the items currently reported in other comprehensive income for public entities the new disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those years ie the first quarter of  for entities with calendar yearends the asu applies prospectively and early adoption is permitted the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements table of contents results of operations three months ended march   compared to the three months ended march   the following table sets forth the results of our operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales certain columns may not add due to rounding     of sales   of sales sales     cost of sales       gross profit loss      operating expenses       loss from operations     nonoperating income expenses net      income tax benefit       noncontrolling interest     net loss to smartheat inc       sales net sales in the three months ended march   were  million consisting of  million for phes  million for phe units  million for heat meters and  million for hps while net sales in the three months ended march   were  million consisting of  million for phes  million for phe units  million for heat meters and  million for hps an overall decrease of  million or  the  decrease in total revenue was due primarily to the decrease in sales volume in the three months ended march   compared to  sales volume of phes phe units heat meters and hps decreased    and  respectively in the first quarter of  compared to  the decrease in sales volume in the three months ended march   compared to  resulted from the continued effects of a tightened fiscal policy in china which has contributed to a slowdown in    aug   c  cybernet data systems inc all
