hanwinmgml availability out of stock churchill winston hangsen eliquid hangsen eliquid is used for ecigarettes and is a premium liquid produced through a tobacco extraction technique as opposed to synthetically created nicotine which originates in a lab hangsen eliquid is rigorously tested for safety and quality because hangsen eliquid uses a tobacco extraction technique hangsen eliquid is able to provide a consistent highquality and robustly flavored eliquid that meets the demands of even the most discriminating vaping customers the hangsen eliquid we offer is available in multiple sizes and strengths valerie minnick   golden tobacco ry hangsen is my all time favorite but because i love it so much i never ventured out to try others i decided to put my favorite to the test and ordered ml each of hangsen deluxe churchillwinston and ryvanillacaramel deluxe was a little too heavy for me but churchill winston was a definite challenger to ry the flavor is just smooth and easy tobacco i really like this one and even tried it with a little menthol and couldnt put it down i tried it in my aspire k and also a joyetech evod mega and the taste was very consistent i will definitely keep this on my list steve oldenburger   received this on  it had a shelf date of  sent them a message  days ago no response with this having that date code makes the product at least a year old or longer so i will not even bother opening it  sad i was hoping for a good vendor to do business with  rl   oh so very good rl   very smooth with great flavor chris   fastest mail order co anywhere best service and advice best selection quality and price customer since  anonymous valued customer   its a repeater for me  enjoy the tobacco flavor farhad sadeghi   i think the best way to quite cigarettes is using electronic cigarette anonymous valued customer   this is my favorite ive been vaping for  years now and this is my favorite tobacco liquid my go to all day vape cant beat the price or the service elaine hubbell   i will never buy from anyone else this is the best vape juice anonymous valued customer   this has a nice light cigarette taste cant beat the price or service will definitely reorder librarob   i never smoked winston but i would put it in the same category as marlboro  camel but its not as rough or bitter as marlboro or camel i like the flavor and has good amount of vapor on the exhale jeanine r   this is one of my favorites and it never disappoints me great flavor and throat hit with plenty of vapor give it a try dennis   this stuff is real good medium tobacco flavor and smokes real smooth easy on the throat and could be in your top three try it you wont be sorry elaine   the best vape juice i have found elaine   very good taste richard c   this ejuice is awesome butythis and you wont regret your purchase chris   great vaping when you use churchill no after taste like some other tobacco liquids with a clean clearomizer and good battery its the best i have bought a lot of things online and you cant beat these guys its the best service christine stoute   at first i almost sent it back as i detected the odor of corn chips which is gross to me i used it because i didnt have anything on hand i now catch a wiff occasionally but it is a good product for volume etc unless you are totally into the sweet stuff this is the best consistent smoke you can have without a real cig harry   a nice clean unwaivering tobacco taste not to strong not to weak just the all day smoke that i have come to enjoy in the winstonchurchill tobacco liquid i would like if the mix was available in other pgvg options would purchase again definitely anonymous valued customer   i did not like this liquid it did not taste like outher winston liquid that i have used to me it has a pipecigar like after taste i only purchased ml mg so will vape this as a last resort if i run out of my regular highway tfor me this is the best clint gates   i have looked everywhere for a winston flavor and this one hits all the right notes nothing sweet and fruity about this one if you are looking for just a tobacco flavor this one is for you sam tummo   i tried the usa blend a little to sweet then ordered churchill perfect would like to see a sampler pack to make the choice easier and more efficient great customer service keep up the good work thanks sam anonymous valued customer   caterpillar vapor is the best site for ecigs and ejuice j howard   i found a little aftertaste using this flavor it does resemble the real winston cigs but is not quite as good as the turkish or usa liquids in my opinion shipping prices and service are superb at this store anonymous valued customer   i am having trouble getting used to the vapor thing i really dont like the sound of the vapor pipe i have not been able to use the vapor as much as i intended to when i bought it i think its a good idea but always find an excuse to smoke a regular cigarette but i am going to continue to try to use it brian   i didnt smoke winston but this is my favorite of the tobacco flavor juices if youre looking for a tobacco flavor to help get off regular cigarettes id recommend giving churchill a try anonymous valued customer   a lil strong monte   tastes like a winstonive been vaping for about a year nowand ive tryed many of cos but this tastes closest to the real thingkeep up the good work anonymous valued customer   would rate inbetween the us mix and camelwould like to see in a light and larger sized bottles ariel a   im new to ego and you product was recommended by a friend i was looking for something similar to my brand of cigarette and i have to say that this product has impress me and you cant ask for better pricing thanks for the good work j robson   ive tried
