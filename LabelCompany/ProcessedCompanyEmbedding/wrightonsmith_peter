first quarter of  i’ll then hand it over to rick who’ll walk you through our financial results in detail once ricks completed that and will hand back to wrap up the call and provide our financial guidance well then open up the lines to take your questions turning to  first quarter results we posted revenues of  million which was just above the top end of our guidance of  million to  million representing yearoveryear growth of  on a constant currency basis revenues grew  in the quarter tb revenue was  million in line with our expectations we saw continued growth in the us as well as strong growth in europe and rest of world as expected asia declined yearoveryear due to order timing in china tickborne disease and other revenue during the quarter was  million which is a little stronger than expected looking at revenue by geography us revenues grew  in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter the growth was driven by continued positive impacts of a larger and maturing sales force and the addition of our new tickborne disease revenue lines europe and rest of world revenues grew by  on a reported basis relative to the prior year quarter or  on a constant currency basis the growth was driven by strong tb performance in the uk and continental european markets and the small additional contribution from the sale of lyme kits in europe as anticipated asia revenues declined to  on a reported basis over the prior year quarter or  on a constant currency basis as we discussed in our prior call there were some temporary factors driving the flatness in asia for the fullyear including fx headwinds the discount we gave to our chinese distributor and the decision to stop selling certain accessories in japan however the decline seen specifically in this quarter was due to order timings in china nevertheless the underlying volume growth in test utilization remains strong in both china and japan we continue to focus on growth in our core tb business which is trending in line with the expectations stated in our fourth quarter call as a reminder our sales force size will remain relatively constant for the year as we look to drive adoption in the large underpenetrated tb market with a maturing sales force in addition we will look to leverage the sales force to accelerate growth of our new tickborne disease portfolio during the first quarter we saw good early sales activity with our tickborne products however as we previously stated we expect to take another quarter or so for our sales force to become fully trained and then productive consequently we’re expecting to see a positive impact in account acquisition only towards the end of the year and that do not expect to see the fruits of that labor in terms of revenue growth until  overall the integration of both imugen and immunetics is going very well we have fully integrated both companies into our organizational structure and completed the integration of our hr systems we’ve also successfully transferred substantially all of imugen’s emergence private payor contracts to us and as a result we are now routinely collecting payment from thirdparty payors the progress continues on schedule towards setting up tspottb in our norwood laboratory and as i’ll detail later we’ve made good progress with the bla submissions for our blood screening assays for babesia shifting to discuss our pipeline on new addition to our tickborne disease pipeline is an assay for rickettsia which includes rocky mountain spotted fever we expect to add this to our imugen test menu in time for the peak tick season this year the rickettsia test helps us to further expand our menu of tests in the tickborne space this rd assay is part of our stated aim to continue to innovate our offering consistent with our longer term goal of building a market leadership position in tickborne diseases shifting  of blood screening pipeline we made good progress on our three blas having expanded a significant amount of effort on continued remediation of the applications we believe we remain on track for bla approval in late  for the portfolio for babesia related products as a reminder both imugen and immunetics have products seeking to address the babesiosis within the blood transfusion screening market imugen with both a serology and a pcr testing service and immunetics with an elisa based serology test we’re also delighted to report another scientific paper ph on the imugen test system has just been published the paper in the general ph transfusion report from the findings from the use of the imugen tests in over  blood donations and it confirms the importance of combining pcr testing serology in endemic areas moving onto our transplant pipeline we released encouraging interim data from the reacts trial for the tspot cmv test during the first quarter the data was released in multiple posters and presentations at the american society for blood and marrow transplantation conference in february the european society for blood and marrow transplantation conference in march and additionally last week at the european congress of clinical microbiology and infectious disease we’ve been pleased with the positive physician feedback on this early data as mentioned previously indiscernible more data to emerge we are planning a measured commercialization of the product to gain some market experience our initial commercial efforts is to be focused in europe and we’ll progress from there we continue to expect to receive interim data for tspotprt from the protects trial in quarter three similar to cmv once the interim data is available we’ll determine the most appropriate commercialization strategy as we wait for clinical data to grow we continue the process of reprioritizing our rd pipeline in an effort to maximize the roi and reduce costs overall were pleased with the progress we made so far in  and remain positive about the growth opportunities in our business on that note ill now hand you over to rick to walk you through our financial results in greater detail richard altieri thank you peter total revenues in the quarter were  million a  increase over revenues of  million in the first quarter of  breaking down our reported revenue on a regional basis us revenue was  million representing  of our revenue europe and rest of world revenue was  million representing  of our revenue and asia revenue was  million representing  of our revenue turning to some comments on pricing and volume in our tb business we sold  tests in the us via both our kit sales and tests processed in our odl service business asps in our us business for the quarter increased slightly due to the increasing contribution from reimbursed tests we sold just under  tests in our ous region both via kit sales and tests processed in our uk odl service business in country pricing remained stable while asps  reported asps were impacted by mix and foreign currency movements gross profit of  million increased by  million yearoveryear an increase of  from the prior years quarter overall gross margin for the quarter was  a decrease of  point basis points from the prioryear period we continue to make great progress in expanding margins in our tb business which grew strongly yearoveryear but these were offset by the addition of the tickborne disease business which currently carries lower gross margins breaking down our margins on a product and service split product gross margin was  and service gross margin was  product gross margin increased to  basis points from the prior year the increase was primarily due to improved tb kit costs product mix and the impact of fx partially offset by the lower margin on tickborne disease kits sales to give a bit more detail on product mix we are now seeing the positive impacts on margins of having stop selling lowmargin accessories in japan service margin decreased to  basis points from the prioryear period we continue to make positive progress on tb service gross margin at our memphis facility this was obeyed  outweighed by the addition of tickborne disease service revenues which currently carry lower margins on a sequential basis overall gross margin decreased from  in the fourth quarter of  to  in the first quarter of  a decrease of  basis points product gross margin decreased  basis points driven primarily by the impact of seasonally lower revenues or sequentially lower revenues and service gross margin fell  basis points primarily due to the usual impact of seasonally lower tickborne disease volumes in q turning to operating expenses sales and marketing expenses were  million in the first quarter of  up  million from the first quarter of  the increase in sales and marketing cost was primarily due to the hiring we did last year to increase headcount research and development expenses were  million in the first quarter an increase of  compared to the first quarter  the increase in rd expense was primarily due to increased headcount consumable costs and amortization related to the acquisitions general and administrative expenses was  million in the first quarter of  up  million from the prior year period the increase in ga expense was primarily driven by legal costs related to the patent litigation as well as increased headcount operating expenses for the first quarter included  million of sharebased compensation we expect this number to increase as we make additional equity awards in  and future years during the quarter we recorded a credit to the pl to reflect the change in value of the contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of immunetics this is because we now believe that fda approval for the immunetics bla will fall beyond the time cutoff where a milestone payment would have been due net loss for the first quarter of  was  million compared to a net loss of  million in the first quarter of  ebitda for the first quarter was a loss of  million compared to a loss of  million in the first quarter of  adjusted ebitda which excludes sharebased compensation unrealized foreign currency gains and losses and change in value of contingent consideration was a loss of  million compared to a loss of  million in the prior year period adjusted ebitda loss was somewhat higher than anticipated primarily due to the higher spending to remediate the blas and higher than anticipated spending on litigation both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are nongaap measures turning to the balance sheet we finished the first quarter with  million in cash and cash equivalents and weve yet withdraw anything on our outstanding  million revolving line of credit we used approximately  million of cash in the quarter as a reminder cash utilization is highest during the first quarter due to payment of yearend bonuses and royalties along with accounting and legal fees related to our year end filings nonetheless cash utilization in the first quarter was somewhat above our expectations primarily due to the bla and litigation spending that i previously mentioned ill now hand it back to peter who will discuss our business outlook peter wrightonsmith thank you rick turning to guidance for the fullyear  we continue to expect revenues of between  million to  million representing  to  yearoveryear growth or  to  on a constant currency basis turning to the outlook for the second quarter of  we expect revenues of between  and  million representing  to  yearoveryear growth we’re expecting tb revenues to grow sequentially due to continued strong us performance and a pickup in china following the relatively light q we are expecting tickborne disease and other revenues to also grow sequentially based on the usual seasonal pattern of testing as well as growing revenues our second major focus this year is on transitioning the company towards profitability one component to that strategy is driving operating leverage with a reduction of operating expenses as a percent of sales on the bottom line we are focused on making progress initially on adjusted ebitda which we use internally as our best measure as the core profitability of the business given our earlier comments over the cost of bla remediation and litigation expenses we now expect ebitda loss to be in the range of  million to  million for the same reasons we now anticipate using approximately  million to  million of cash in  we expect this number will decline in subsequent years and believe that we currently have cash on hand to fund our current operating plans for future profitability that concludes our formal prepared remarks we’ll now open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from bill quirk with piper jaffray your line is open william quirk great thank you and good morning everyone first question is just on the gross margin performance certainly understand that theres some nuances to mix and whatnot but your tickborne diseases was off a little bit sequentially and yeah we saw a sequential decline in gross margin so maybe you can just dive into that a little deeper and maybe talk about some  or maybe give some additional color on the initiative to try to drive that higher here in future quarters thank you richard altieri sure so thanks bill for the question so we actually saw our tb margins come in ahead of expectations we made good progress in underlying tb margins both in the product side as well as on the service side and these were offset by the impact of the tickborne disease gross margins both on the on the kit – tb tickborne disease kits sales as well as tickborne disease service margins as a reminder tickborne disease margins are lower than our corporate average currently and that was exacerbated by the seasonally low tickborne disease revenues in the first quarter so therefore the margins are lower in the first quarter and we expect them to be sequentially higher as we come into the seasonally higher tickborne disease you know quarters in the second and third quarter william quirk so it’s essentially that those have negative absorption is that basically would happen rick because you had lowest richard altieri yeah there is a high fixed costs in the tickborne disease margin so you know they are significantly impacted by the volumes that go through the lab william quirk okay got it and then question peter peter you made the comment about keeping the sales force stable or constant i think was word you used in  is that to imply that you consider investing in some additional sales people and in  or is that or am i reading too much into that peter wrightonsmith i think you’re reading too much into that i mean certainly it’s something that we will consider whether to further expand the sales force and ultimately comes down to a tradeoff between profitability and growth and we have made the decision over that for  but either indiscernible that will certainly be something we’ll look at but we haven’t made a final decision on it william quirk okay got it and then just last one for me just rd spend it did sequentially come down kind of as expected given commentary around some of the bla filings and such how should we think about that trending over the balance of the year should that continue to come down as you reprioritizing part of the rd pipeline just i guess kind of help us directionally to think about where that should go and maybe to the extent you can talk about a stable run rate thank you peter wrightonsmith yes we do expect rd to come down both because obviously protects and reacts trials will gradually wind down but also the bla remediation costs which as we said are running higher than we had thought obviously on to permanent either because once that work is done and the resubmissions in you know once the fda is considering that submission obviously we don’t have the cost of doing that so we do directionally feel the rd costs will come down william quirk got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from tycho peterson with jpmorgan your line is open tycho peterson hey good morning maybe just starting with china peter you cited some order timing issues there can you maybe just elaborate on what that was and then i guess should we think about the impact of the discount to the distributors being more of a q dynamics since you didn’t necessarily call that out peter wrightonsmith thanks tycho for the question so really the way to think about asia for this year is it  is basically flat for the year as a whole but as usual there is going to be some bouncing around that  growth rate which is because of order timings that’s traditionally been the feature of our chinese business and so q the reason it was below flat was purely due to order timings and then we’re expecting it to be above flat in quarter two as those order timings rebound but netnet of it as we take the whole year as a whole we do expect asia to be consistent what we said previously which is roughly flat for the year tycho peterson okay and if we think about you know the performance in the us market good number there can you just may be help us segment that a little bit how much is being driven by physician office versus the segments right now peter wrightonsmith yes it’s a great question we are seeing good growth in both segments but clearly physician office is going well its becoming a more  it’s still a minority but a more material minority of our revenues and one of the positive impacts of that on our business is clearly that about the asp overall is going up in the us as we get more reimbursed revenues as a share of our revenue mix so thats being good to see tycho peterson okay and then last one i guess just thinking little bit about competitive dynamics you know qiagen did a announce a big tender with the korean armed forcesare there other tenders of that size and scale out there that you’re potentially looking at and any thoughts on how things could change when they launch their fourth gen test later this year peter wrightonsmith so the central message is that we don’t see any fundamental changes in the competitive landscape the g products being out in europe for some time now and again we don’t see it fundamentally change in the landscape so as far as we are concerned that’s a relatively stable dynamic in our business tycho peterson and terms of your government tenders big figure you know projects that maybe out there peter wrightonsmith yes so i mean clearly in south korea what actually happened there was a lab that was running quantiferon who won a tender with the military and there were clearly – there is clearly other aspects of that south korean increase in screening that are also up for grabs and we will certainly intend to compete for that and we’re also looking in many other countries around the world as well where we think there is growth opportunities i am not sure how big an impact tender specifically will play in that but to the extent that they feature in particular market we’ll clearly be looking at those tycho peterson okay thank you peter wrightonsmith thank you operator thank you our next question comes from doug schenkel with cowen  company your line is open unidentified analyst hi good morning this is christine on for doug today thanks for taking my questions peter wrightonsmith morning chris unidentified analyst good morning so i guess how are you thinking about the ous opportunity for tick and i guess the question is really coming from immunetics previously had sales in europe or was that really a function of crossselling after closing the acquisition peter wrightonsmith so why some of you will think of lyme disease and tickborne diseases is primarily us phenomena lyme is actually a global phenomenon it’s been reported in over  counties around the world and one of the principle ous markets actually is europe for lyme disease testing of which there is a meaningful market and one that’s growing immunetics had a small amount of revenue in europe when we made the acquisition and clearly we are looking to grow that in europe through having it this product in our sales force in europe in the same way that we’re looking to grow it in the us through leveraging our sales forces there as well unidentified analyst got it and then in terms of the europe total europe growth can you just tease out what was europe growth related to tb and what the contribution from tick was peter wrightonsmith i don’t have those numbers to hand rick do you happen to have them to hand it’s not chris we’ll follow up with you afterwards i would estimate that the majority of it is tb tick testing indiscernible new unidentified analyst got it then just given the strength in europe can you talk about the potential of vesting incrementally in that market for both tb and tickborne and then just how sustainable is the recent growth trends in europe just because i know i think there were some tenders in the uk peter wrightonsmith yes we actually see the outlook in europe most of all being stronger that it has been in recent times because of those factors because of the uk tender because of some strength we’re seeing in some other countries and because of the addition of tickborne disease testing so we are all viewing europe and rest of world as being stronger this year in terms of growth the one thing i should say its caution for that is fx  like to see a material headwind and so reported growth may look more muted but on a constant currency base certainly we are seeing europe and rest of world growth pick up unidentified analyst got it thanks so much for taking my questions peter wrightonsmith thank you operator thank you our next question comes from catherine schulte with robert w baird your line is open catherine schulte hey guys thanks for the questions i was wondering if you could talk about other products that you acquired with imugen and immunetics and any planned rollouts for the rest of the year i know the fda has announced plans to publish a final guidance on bacterial detection in platelets this year so is that something that would encourage commercialization of the bactx test peter wrightonsmith morning catherine that’s a great question so yes imugen came with some – they were doing some rd work on additional emerging species within tickborne diseases and we certainly feel that thats worth continuing because it’s consistent with our strategy of wanting to become a market leader in tickborne diseases immunetics came with a very large pipeline of other infectious disease tests and you’re quite right i think the bactx product is the most near term opportunity within that and certainly that’s the one that we are spending significant and effort examining clearly the market is going to change with this fda guidance it’s going to come out the question we need to identify is the bactx product likely to be successful in that market given the competitor that exist and what is the cost of return on investment to get to that point and thats one of things that we’re deep in evaluation over the moment catherine schulte okay great and then for the cmv launch how should we think about the investments for a measured european rollout and what are your assumptions and guidance for second quarter and the year for cmv contribution peter wrightonsmith so i’ll answer the second question first so as we said on the fourth quarter call we have minimal expectations for revenue of cmv this year in terms of what it means in terms of incremental investment it’s relatively modest you know the whole intent behind tickborne diseases and behind transplant is the ability to leverage the global commercial channel we’ve already built for tb and so there is only modest incremental spend to start those early commercialization activities because we are largely using the same sales people and technical support people that we already have catherine schulte great thank you peter wrightonsmith thank you operator thank you i am showing no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to mr peter wrightonsmith for closing remarks peter wrightonsmith thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter  results we’re pleased with the progress we continue to make against our growth strategy and it’s an exciting time of transition at oxford immunotec we look

progress we made in  before reviewing our fourth quarter performance i will then hand it over to rick to walk you through our financial results in detail once rick has completed that he’ll hand back to me to discuss our outlook for  and provide our financial guidance we will then open up the lines to take your questions  was a transformational year for oxford immunotec we made significant progress to moving from a single product late in tb diagnostics company to a multiproduct immuneregulated disease diagnostics company the ondriving continued adoption and strong growth in our core tb business we acquired imugen and immunetics which established a new franchise in tickborne disease testing we now have a portfolio of tickborne disease tests but in kit and service form and are enthusiastic about the opportunity in this clinical market in addition to our clinical product offerings in fact physicians also allow us to enter into the blood screening market between imugen and immunetics we believe that we’re the only products currently seeking fda clearance for screening babesia in donated blood its potentially significant opportunity to add another dimension to our product pipeline we also made headway in progressing our transplant pipeline having completed enrollment for both our tspotcmv and our tspotprt clinical trials during the year and upon readout of the dates from these trials we will shift off focus towards commercialization of these products our financial results for  demonstrated our progress as we achieved revenues of  million which was above our initial annual guidance of  million to  million as a result of strong performance in our core tb business and the contribution from the imugen and immunetics acquisitions our core tb franchise performed well in  as revenues grew from  million to  million this represented  growth on a reported basis and  on a constant currency basis this was above our initial expectations for the year in  us tb sales grew  which represents record yearoveryear dollar growth the growth in our us tb business was driven primarily by volume increases in the institutional and physician office points as we continue to see the positive impact from our growing and maturing sales force we ended the year with approximately  sales reps calling on both institutions and physician office up approximately  reps in the beginning of the year europe and rest of world revenue declined by  on a reported basis relative to the prior year on a constant currency basis however europe and rest of the world revenues increased by  positive volatility and fx rate and commodities prices affected some of our more fast loan markets we were pleased to see performance strengthen in our core european markets in particular in the uk volumes in the nhs tender are growing nicely but remain small in relation to the total opportunity asia revenues grew  on a reported basis over the prior year the increase was primarily due to significant growth in both japan and china asia grew  on a constant currency basis with the variance in reported growth due to strengthening of the yen our sales force in japan continues to be successful in driving demand that is for tb and in china our strategy to expand it to other segments of the market appears to be bearing fruit underlying volume growth remains strong in both of these markets turning to indiscernible these products we are excited about the acquisitions of both imugen and immunetics we view these acquisitions not only as highly complementary to each other but also to our tb business due to the high degree of core point overlap we therefore believe we will able to leverage our current commercial resources to sell these products we’ve launched the tickborne to these franchises to our sales force and continue to anticipate that our us sales force will be fully trained by the middle of  neither imugen nor immunetics had a well developed commercial infrastructure until once our sales team reaches full productivity with these products we expect to be able to drive accelerated growth in these businesses as previously mentioned both these acquisitions included some additional pipeline products the most immediate near term opportunity is the leverage technologies developed by both imugen and immunetics to enter into the blood screening market of babesia by way of background babesia is caused primarily by parasite transmitted by the bite of an infected tick however this parasite infects red blood cells in addition to infection by tick bite patients can also contract the disease to blood transfusions from babesia infected donors babesia is a growing cause of transfusion transmitted infections and in fact it is now the highest ranking pathogen thats transmitted by blood transfusion for which no donor screening is available and despite this risk there are currently no babesia tests which fda clears the blood screening both imugen and immunetics have products seek to address this problem imugen has both serology and a pcr testing service and immunetics has laser based serology cascade clinical trials from these products have been completed and bla applications have been submitted to the fda in early december the new england journal of medicine published clinical trial result from imugen tests from their large clinical trials conducted in partnership with the american red cross this clinical trial which forms core of the fda submission determined that imugen testing regime is effective in detecting babesia in blood samples we are working with the fda to provide additional information on both companies bla applications and currently anticipate the approval of these three tests occurring in late  to our knowledge no other company have started an ind for the vga screening so with these assets we expect to be the first mover in this market for a number of years we believe that the addressable market for vga blood screening could be significant in may of  the fdas blood product advisory committee or bpac met and proposed the following recommendations for the vga testing in donor blood in the us approximately  million serological test for indiscernible and approximately  million pcr test for indiscernible if these recommendations were to become a formal mandate these  million test could present upwards of a  million revenue opportunity moving onto our transplant pipeline as we noted in our quarter three call enrollment on protect and react chart is complete and we are now following up these patients for post transplant event we remain on track for interim data to be available from the react trial for cmv this quarter and from the protect chart prt in quarter three assuming that interim data is positive we expect to move to start filling these tests we will continue to take a measured approach of commercialization once we wait for the clinical data to grow turning now to review our  fourth quarter results we posted revenues of  million which was above our guidance of  to  million and represents yearonyear growth of  on a constant currency basis given the recent acquisition we provided revenue breakout by indication in the fourth quarter tb revenue grew  as compared to the prior year period increase was primarily driven by strong growth in the us tickborne disease and other revenue which during the quarter included both imugen and immunetics was  million to ahead of our expectations looking at fourth quarter revenue by geography us revenues grew  in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period us tb sales grew  the growth in tb was driven primarily by volume increases in both institutions and physician offices but we continue to see the positive impacts from our growing and maturing sales force europe and rest of world revenue fell by  on a reported basis relative to the prior year quarter on a constant currency basis however europe and rest of world revenue increased by  as we continue to see a strengthening in core markets asia revenues grew  on a reported basis over the prior year quarter the increase was primarily due to growth in both japan and china asia grew  on a constant currency basis with the variance in reported growth due to the yen subsequent to our last earnings call we’ve given a couple of regulatory guidelines announcements that i would like to briefly discuss in december updated guidelines of the diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children were published jointly by the american thoracic society infectious diseases society of america and the cdc these guidelines go much further in recommending indiscernible over the skin test in prior guidelines we believe these new guidelines along with the us preventive services task force recommendation which came out early in  continue to generate further momentum for the adoption of tests also in december congress passed st century cures act as part of the act a formal working group is to be established to focus specifically on laying another tickborne disease the purpose of the working group is to develop and implement a plan for improving outcomes of lyme disease and other tickborne diseases as well as the implementation of a plan for improving diagnosis treatment and prevention of tickborne diseases specific actions have been taken and it may not well be taken for a number of years we view the creation of a group focused solely on tickborne diseases in the us as validation of our assessment of the unmet need and shows the governmental support for solutions to the problem overall we are very pleased with our strong performance during the fourth quarter and throughout the year in both our core tb business and on newly core tickborne business as well as with our pipeline products on that note i will now hand over to rick who will walk you through our financial results in greater details richard altieri thank you peter total revenues in the quarter were  million a  increase over revenues of  million in the fourth quarter of  breaking down our reported revenues on a regional basis us revenue was  million representing  of our revenue europe and rest of world revenue was  million representing  of revenue and asia revenue was  million representing  of our revenue turning to some comments on pricing and volume in our tb business we sold over  tests in the us via both our kit sales and test processed in our odl service business asps in the us business for the quarter increased slightly versus the prioryear period as a result of increased contribution from the physician office market we sold over  tests in our ous region both via kit sales and tests processed in our uk’s odl service business in country pricing remain generally stable for the fourth quarter although asps for the ous region as a whole vary from quartertoquarter due to geographic revenue mix and foreign currency movements gross profit of  million increased by  million or  from the prior year’s quarter overall gross margin for the quarter was  an increase of  basis points from the prior year period product gross margin was  and service gross margin was  product gross margin increased  basis points from the prior year the increase was primarily due to product mix lower kit cost due to improved efficiency and increased volume and the favorable impact of currency movements service margin increased by  basis points from the prior year period driven by improved efficiency in our odl labs and increased volume offset by imugen’s tickborne disease service revenue which carries lower margins than our core tb revenue on a sequential basis overall gross margin decreased from  in the third quarter to  in the fourth quarter of  a decrease of  basis points product gross margin decreased  basis points driven primarily by the impact of immunetics’ tickborne disease revenue and service gross margins fell  basis points due to usual impact of decreased seasonal volume in the fourth quarter as well as the impact of imugen’s tickborne disease revenues which carry low margins and our core tb revenue turning to upgrading expenses sales and marketing expenses were  million in the fourth quarter of  up  from the fourth quarter of  the increase in sales and marketing cost was primarily due to increased headcount research and development expenses were  million in the fourth quarter an increase of  million compared to the fourth quarter of  the increase in rd expense was primarily due to acquisition but the acquisitions of imugen and immunetics and clinical expenses related to the protect and react studies general administrative expenses were  million in the fourth quarter of  up  million from the prior year period the increase in ga expense was driven by increased headcount legal cost related to acquisitions is low as patent litigation and sharebased compensation costs operating expenses for the fourth quarter included  million of sharebased compensation we expect this number to increase as we make additional equity awards in  in the future years we had two accounting changes related to the carrying value associated with the boulder diagnostics acquisition that we made in  as many of you know we reconsider the carrying value of our acquired assets on a periodic basis as we have revaluated the rd programs that we acquired from older diagnostics we have concluded that the progress weve made on the spirofind program since the acquisition is that the current products that we are developing we line more on ip that we have generated since the acquisition rather than the ip as it stood at the time of the acquisition as a consequence you can search spirofind continues to be a project we have written down the value of this specific ip that we acquired from boulder with the corresponding credit of the associated contingent consideration payments of this ip in addition in conjunction with our ongoing rd reprioritization that peter will talk about later we had chosen to deprioritize a low defined project and this also formed a modest part of the down charge to our both ip rd and a corresponding credit from the associated contingent consideration impairment the net effect of these movements was an expense of approximately  included in operating expenses net loss to the fourth quarter of  was  million compared to a net loss of  million in the fourth quarter of  net loss includes an income tax benefit of  million we write it to the reduction and the valuation reserve of our uk net operating loss and the tax benefit reported as part of the acquisition of immunetics ebitda for the fourth quarter was a loss of  million compared to a loss of  million in the fourth quarter of  adjusted ebitda which excludes sharebased compensation unrealized foreign currency gains and losses and the two charges that i just discussed related to ip rd and contingent consideration was a loss of  million for the fourth quarter of  compared to a loss of  million in the prior year period both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are nongaap measures turning briefly to a review of results for the fullyear of  revenues for the year was  million or  increase over fullyear  revenues of  million revenue grew  over the prior year on a constant currency basis gross profit was  million an increase of  million over the prior year gross margin for the fullyear of  was  an increase of a  basis points compared to  in  operating expenses for the fullyear of  was  million an increase of  million compared to  net loss of the fullyear of  was  million compared to a net loss of  million in  ebitda for the fullyear was the loss of  million compared to a loss of  million in  and adjusted ebitda was a loss of  million for the full year compared to a loss of  million in the prior year turning to the balance sheet we finished the quarter with  million in cash and cash equivalence we used approximately  million of cash in the quarter  million of which was directly related to the acquisition of immunetics both for the purchased price and the acquisition related costs for the fullyear excluding the acquisitions and related field cost and excluding financing cost we used  million of cash which was better than our guidance at the beginning of the year of  million in cash usage during the quarter we entered into a debt financing agreement on october th which provided the company with up to  million in capital comprised of a  million term loan and a  million working capital revolver based on our current cash position we believe we have sufficiently capitalized to allow us to achieve profitability ill now hand it back to peter who will discuss our business outlook peter wrightonsmith thank you richard were in a exciting transition for the company as we move from being a one product company to a four product company with tb tickborne diseases blood screening and transplant as the management team were focused on two priorities to continue to grow revenue strongly and to start to make progress toward profitability on the revenue side we expect to maintain a longstanding record of strong revenue growth a continuing to drive penetration of tspot tb into the very large underpenetrated market of tb screening we will work accelerate the growth of our new tickborne disease portfolio by initializing our commercial infrastructure thirdly we have to add new sources of revenue growth by adding new products into our sales force lab infrastructure including blood screening tests transplant tests and in the longer term future other tests added by rd or ma taking each of these in turn we will continue our current strategies to penetrating the us and all us market for tb theyre working well theyre driving growth and the market remains very underpenetrated we expect to keep our commercial infrastructure relatively flat this year that we think to reduce our pricing expenses in the percent of revenue looking regionally we expect the us to continue to grow strongly as our sales force continues its strong current productivity we expect our europe and rest of world regions continue as recent record of higher growth were expecting mid to high single digit constant currency growth but remindful of the fx is likely to make reported growth based on our models lastly in asia despite expected strong underlying tactical in growth in  the physically were expecting reported revenues to be relatively flat due to three temporary impacts firstly fx rates have moved significantly against us on the yen and so this is a meaningful headwind to reported revenues in asia secondly given the deterioration of the chinese yuan against the dollar we have made the decision to reduce our dollar pricing to our chinese distributor to offset some of this fx change lastly we made a decision to stop selling certain accessories in japan this will have a oneoff impact on revenue so we done it as we were not making much money on these accessories and this reflects our commitments to also make progress towards profitability on tickborne diseases we expected it will take a couple of quarters for our sales force to come fully trained and then productive consequently were expecting to see a pointed impact in accounts acquisition towards the end of the year as the wind had a seasonally its kind of less testing it will take until  before such account wins are likely to meaningfully impact the top line growth rate therefore while  is a critical execution year for us in tickborne diseases we do not expect to see the fruits of those labors in revenues into the s and starts in earnest in  as it relates to blood screening we put significant rd resources into remediating these three bla since acquiring the imugen and immunetics our principle objective in  is to obtain a approval for the end of the year for each of our three blood screening test for babesia whilst we do currently obtain what is revenues from these products under cost recovery under our current plan b we do not expect a meaningful increase contribution from blood screening until we obtain fda clearance and until a week followed by an fda mandate for testing if we can achieve fda clearance in late  and then if it is followed swiftly by an fda mandate we should see revenues to come more meaningful in  for our transplant pipeline we look forward to seeing data from the respective clinical trials assuming the results are positive well be taking a measure to project commercialization whats the data builds and consequently you have minimal expectations for revenue this year taking all this commentary into account for the fullyear  we expect revenues of between  million and  million representing  to  yearoveryear reported growth or  to  on a constant currency basis turning to the outlook for the first quarter of  we expect revenues of between  million and  million representing   to  yearoveryear reported growth on a constant currency basis this reflects  to  yearovergrowth in the us we expect to see tb revenues rise sequentially from quarter four in line of our usual seasonal pattern clinical tickborne disease revenues will likely decline slightly again inline of the usual seasonal pattern and through the fox your tick bites in winter months sequentially we expect decline in asia revenues due to order timings for china and the impact of the china price decrease as well as growing revenues our second major focus this year is on transition in the company towards profitability we therefore aim to demonstrate progress on both gross and operating margin this year although recent fx changes and the imugen and immunetics acquisitions will provide a meaningful headwinds to gross margins this year we are nonetheless aiming to modestly expand our gross margins for the fullyear to a continued focus in operational improvements were also looking to drive operating leverage by having our operating expenses come down as percent of revenue i described how the addition of tickborne disease revenues through the overlap of copoints leverages ourselves in marketing expenses however we are also working to see rd on rd specifically weve begun this process of reprioritizing our pipeline this is for two reasons firstly we have a lot more opportunity in our pipeline given the new blood screening tests as well as the other pipeline products that came with imugen and immunetics secondly we want to ensure that rd spending comes down a percent of revenue both of these reasons drive us to reprioritize our pipeline so that we focused on our activities in only in the most promising products so to maximize our roi from the spend on ga even despite increased litigation expenses associated with bringing the ip infringement case towards trail we expect to see ga come down this percent of revenue on the bottomline were focused on making progress initially on adjusted ebitda which we use internally of our best measure of the copossibility of the business we are hoping to see adjusted ebitda loss which is by almost half to approximately a  million loss we anticipate using approximately  million of cash in  off that  million approximately  million will let the increase of the working capital influence capital expenditures we expect this number would decline in subsequent years and believe that we currently have cash on hand from the operating plants reach profitability similar to last year we anticipate the first quarter will highest in terms of cash usage due to accounting and legal fees related to our event filings along with the payment of yearend bonuses and royalties that concludes our formal prepared remarks well now open up the line for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from doug schenkel with cowen  company your line is open doug schenkel good afternoon and thank you for taking our questions first question is on us momentum when you look back at yearoveryear revenue growth in the us quarterbyquarter in  growth improved every quarter i know thats a little bit of noisy metric but clearly things are moving continuing to move in the right direction it seems like a big part of this is attributable to a larger sales force and relatively your increased penetration into the physician office channel heading into  how should we think about this trend would it be fair to think that if anything you can continue we’ve not gained momentum given your sales force is now more tenured richard altieri i think there are number of comments to make on that that question doug and thank you for it i think the first thing to say is we expect in around to see similar dollar yearoveryear revenue growth in  as we’ve seen in  and thats largely because we have got a relatively stable number of sales reps because we are not planning to materially increase our sales headcount this year and we are expecting rest of the cost and productivity the puts and takes around that are to your point the puts might be that with recent guidelines and as our sales force get more tenured and as we continue to learn how to do this better but that might improve productivity on the take side of things is obviously the risk of distraction from also having our rep sales tickborne diseases and we believe those puts and takes are likely to even themselves out and so our assumption is relatively confident productivity growth so again to summarize our expectation is similar dollar yearoveryear revenue growth doug schenkel okay thank you for that that is helpful change in geographies and moving over to asia trying to i guess parse out if you will your assessment of the outlook for underlying demand and competitive dynamics in china and japan is at least at first blush a bit challenging given a lot of moving parts foreign exchange your pricing commentary and what you are doing in china the product discontinuation in japan just to name a few if you kind of adjust for all those things and i am sure you have internally i am sure you have some thoughts on how you feel the demand patterns are evolving and how competitive dynamics are evolving would you be willing to comment a little bit when you normalize for all the moving parts on what you think about the growth rates in these markets and how competition is evolving richard altieri yes so i think the first thing to say is that we are long term believers in the growth outlook for these markets and although  will appear to be flat for these temporary reasons that i have outlined that doesnt change our underlying belief in the growth in the market and certainly we expect to maintain decent volume growth this year notwithstanding these headwinds to reported revenues links to that we dont fundamentally see any change in the capacity scenario in these markets the one area where obviously we have chosen to reflect those is in our decision to reduce our dollar price for distributor in china we have the dominant plan china right now we are long term believers in that market we think it could be a very significant market and we are mindful that continuing to expand our price premium over that locally produce cheaper cloned product mainly that we see more market share to them than we would otherwise like and so we think that this decision to make a oneoff price reduction is in our long term interest because it help us to preserve our dominant share in the market as this market continues to grow and overtime becomes we hope very significantly for the company doug schenkel okay and i guess one last related followup and then i will get back in the queue some of what you just commented on peter really spoke to your long term view on the market your main competitor really your only competitor and late in tb highgrowth testing has talked about growth outlook of at least to  per year on average for the next five years in your view does that seem like a reasonable target growth rate for the overall market thank you peter wrightonsmith i think that you can separate two factors whats the overall growth of this tb screening market and then what is the penetration rate of highgrowth within that and so i think the first thing to say is i am very encouraged absolutely about the underlying growth of the screening market the nhs tender the uspga recommendation the recent guidelines in south korea i think the world is starting to ruffle with the tb better given the horrendous tb statistics this year and realizes that tb screening is a more important part of the solution in the path before so i think the market is going to grow very nicely and then within that again i see fundamentally impediments to highgrowth not being able to continue very strong penetration versus the skin test the guidelines continues to strengthen highgrowths’ favor and generally more and more the market is going to be comfortable with this technology and if not and so to wrap it up really i remain a strong believer in the long term outlook for this business and this market doug schenkel okay thanks again peter wrightonsmith thank you operator and our next question comes from catherine indiscernible with robert w baird your line is open unidentified analyst hey guys thanks for the questions quickly on the nhs migrant screening program i think they posted an updated last month and it sounds like many of the ccgs have started testing and some are behind the schedule so just curious how you see this unfolding from a volume perspective in  and then as a followup in the regions where you arent that exclusive provider of testing what kind of share are you getting so far peter wrightonsmith great questions so we work very cautious at the beginning when we first announced it to say that it would take some time just to get going because we are well aware of the run time structure in nhs and how long it takes them to get things going and this update that you refer to a month ago was totally consistent with our expectations of how slow it would be to get these job up and moving in terms of outlook for volumes i think we do expect  our volumes to grow meaningfully from this in the uk from  but even then its going to be still very underpenetrated but it would be full penetration that we can expect when this tender finally gets up to full speed in terms of how we are doing in the areas where we are not exclusive i have to say i am very satisfied with our success rate in winning business here we have a lot of thought into how are we going to actually rollout our service so this area you may recall this time last year i talked about making some investments in our uk and our services business generally but thats part of our uk service and those investments in logistics and figuring out how to make this easy for primary care physicians to access this service are certainly bearing fruit in terms of our capacity versus other players who would take some of this market so i am very happy about that unidentified analyst okay and then quickly on china did you make any other changes to your distributor model or strategy aside from just price reduction any change in like expanding the market discounts with the distributor peter wrightonsmith no unidentified analyst okay thank you peter wrightonsmith thank you operator and our next question comes from william quirk with piper jaffray your line is open william quirk thanks good afternoon can you hear me peter wrightonsmith we can hear you fine bob william quirk okay excellent so i guess a couple of questions on the bgm and so if i heard you correctly peter and if i remember reading to the filings correctly you already showing some babesia into the blood centers so i think i am curious what sort of conversations have you held with arc and abc and i guess how could we gauge the potential uptick or uptake of fda approved babesia assays i am just trying to think through things like logistics and how much volume you are seeing in a serological kit and typically what we have seen historically is that blood banks when they adopt they adopt pretty rapidly and typically its comes with or nothing sort of phenomena not just within arc but within the competitors at abc as well peter wrightonsmith yes so i think our working assumption is this which is the people who are super motivated to do testing without an fda mandate already doing that testing via imugen and immunetics under the open inds and so our view is that fda approval doesnt really change volumes it obviously we hope will change price but it wont change volumes what will change volumes is fda guidance on source and we are obviously hopeful the fda will release guidance at some point once fda clear tests are available but understanding the timing of that exactly what guidelines will say is clearly not predictable at this point in time we have to be pack minutes that we can refer to we can see that the debate has been held in the public domain so far but i cant predict what the fda will do so to repeat our assumption is fda approval doesnt materially change volumes that might change price favorably but the real inflation in volumes comes if as and when an fda mandate occurs william quirk understood and then just to be clear in terms of the price change to fosun when did that occur exactly peter wrightonsmith from the beginning of year and its a rebate and it will only be given by some headings and minimum volumes but obviously will be accruing for it throughout the course of the year on the assumption that they will do those volumes so it won’t impact on numbers starting in quarter one william quirk okay understood and then did you also stop selling accessories in the first quarter as well i guess i am just trying to get at some of the weaker performance in the fourth quarter in asia and just trying to figure out if it was tied in at all to some of the go forward metrics peter wrightonsmith yes i think the quarter four in asia is really separable from the commentary around  it clearly has to do with timing variance and nothing more or less than that so i dont read too much into quarter four its just the usual volatility obviously i have made specific comments around the outlook  william quirk got it and appreciate the color thanks peter peter wrightonsmith thank you bill operator and our next question comes from tycho peterson with jpmorgan your line is open tycho peterson thanks and maybe peter on the rd reprioritization just wondering to the extent that there are projects that are kind of being pushed up i am trying to understand i understand the thought process but trying to understand is there things that are kind of being pushed off that you would kind of highlight and then anything you are willing to say on time line to profitability given you’re placing more of an emphasis on it now peter wrightonsmith yes so what we have communicated obviously is that our gout program has been put on hold at least for the foreseeable future i dont want to comment on any other pipeline products until we have completed the reprioritization that’s going to take a number of months there is a lot of work to do to do that in a disciplined way and i will expect to give more commentary then about things that we’ve definitely decided not to proceed with for example at that stage so just too early to say on that in terms of timing to profitability again i dont want to what i can tell you clearly is that we dont want to get to profitability this year what i dont want to do is get balanced into providing guidance for next year or beyond well i would say is that we are mindful that we want to show material progress towards profitability but we want to preserve some flexibility as to the exact timing depend so that we can make appropriate investments not business but long term value creation tycho peterson okay and then i know its early days on the tickborne front but it sounds like you’re not anticipating real revenues this year can you give us a sense of what you have kind of embedded in guidance for imugen and immunetics i know they did about  million in  can you give us a sense of what you are assuming this year peter wrightonsmith yes i mean so again we have been the guidance we are giving now is very similar to  identical to what we said when we actually acquired the businesses so imugen was  million in  and growing kind of  a year and we said it wouldn’t make a material impact on that growth rate until  immunetics was  million to  million of clinical revenues basically flat and again we wouldnt make any impact on that till  so that gives you some i think some fairly granular guidance as to what we are expecting for those businesses in  tycho peterson okay and then last one on the bci i know its again early days there fairly concentrated customer base it sounds like when the time comes wont need to place real resources into building out commercial channels is that a fair assumption peter wrightonsmith yes its a very good question tycho i mean certainly our assumptions i think one of the attractions of this market is that essentially there is very little sales and marketing cost required because its a mandate so obviously you do need to have some support from a logistics and technical perspective but sales and marketing charge is related to such business are likely to be very very small and the consequence of this business can be very profitable in terms of operating margin there is no doubt it is seen from the recent sale of logics blood screening business tycho peterson got it okay thanks peter wrightonsmith thank you operator and i am showing no further questions i would now like to turn the call back to peter wrightonsmith for any further remarks peter wrightonsmith yes thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year  results we are pleased with progress and we continue to make against our growth strategy and this
