david guilty of innovation based on information in unitarian universalism a narrative history by david e bumbaugh chicago meadville lombard theological school press  note david is pronounced daveed for a short time religious toleration was the rule of the land in thcentury transylvania when his mother died the newly crowned king john sigismund found himself ruling a country divided religiously among roman catholics calvinists and lutherans among the kings advisors were george biandrata a polish physician and skilled politician and court preacher david ferencz known in the west as francis david in the heady times of the th century christian doctrine was the subject of great debate king john sigismund realizing there was no possibility of compromise among the various interpreters of proper doctrine issued an edict that each person was free to support their chosen understanding of christian doctrine the edict allowed advisor biandrata and court preacher david both members of the reformed calvinist tradition to begin to explore questions concerning the doctrine of the trinity and the deity of jesus their exploration and unorthodox interpretations of christian doctrine caused considerable concern among other members of the reformed clergy in those days doctrinal matters in transylvania were fully aired by convening a formal debate king john sigismund scheduled such an event for march   he invited believers in the unity of god position to debate the trinitarians the debate lasted ten days beginning at  am each day francis david represented the unitarian position and relied on scripture to buttress his arguments at the conclusion of the debate davids arguments were seen as stronger and many in transylvania embraced unitarianism a second debate the following year led the king to declare that he himself was unitarian and there should be religious toleration in the land by  unitarianism was given legal recognition in what would turn out to be king john sigismunds last public act he died two months later as a result of an accident and left no heir to the throne john sigismund was succeeded by a catholic named stephen bathori who dismissed most of the unitarians at court while retaining biandrata as one of his advisors stephen bathori reaffirmed a policy of toleration for those christian religions named in the  decree but declared that he would not allow any further religious innovation unitarianism gained more converts in transylvania during that period despite the prohibition against doctrinal changes and an ecclesiastical organization was developed by  restrictions were placed on unitarians but the organization continued to thrive francis david by now the unitarian bishop was still driven toward reform of doctrine rather than development of church organization he explored questions having to do with the doctrine of the lords supper infant baptism predestination and the worship of jesus questioning doctrine in all four areas biandrata more concerned with the health of the church than with matters of doctrine urged david to keep silent but this was not francis davids way francis david began to preach his heretical ideas from the pulpit biandrata concerned for the survival of the unitarian church  reported davids activities to the ruler david continued to preach after the prince ordered him to stop and francis david was arrested and tried for the crime of innovation questioning and challenging religious doctrine the prosecutor at trial was giorgio biandrata who dissembled when asked about his own earlier involvement in questioning religious doctrine francis david was found guilty of innovation and condemned to prison for the remainder of his life he died in the royal dungeon in the castle at deva on november   biandrata went on to push the unitarian church toward more conservative theological positions by the time he died in  very little remained of his former influence in the transylvanian unitarian movement the unitarian church itself was forced into a position of doctrinal stagnation that lasted more than  years print all of harvest the power contents ‹ taking it home up practicing
