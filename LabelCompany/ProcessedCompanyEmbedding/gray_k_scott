nonlinear chemical kinetics peter gray and stephen k scott a clarendon press publication international series of monographs on chemistry chemical oscillations and instabilities nonlinear chemical kinetics peter gray and stephen k scott a clarendon press publication international series of monographs on chemistry description today scientists in many fields are expressing considerable interest in nonlinearity and the ideas of oscillations and chaos chemical reactions provide perfect examples of these phenomena this book is an excellent introduction to the area of nonlinear phenomena in chemical kinetics that involve chemical feedback such as chain branching autocatalysis and selfheating the emphasis is on physical and pictorial representation and on identifying those gross features which are essential the experimental conditions under which such behavior will occur can be predicted using simple mathematical recipes and these are also included readers will find full discussions of longlived oscillations for autocatalytic or exothermic reactions in closed vessels and stationary states bistability and oscillations in continuous flow reactors and diffusion cells other topics considered include chemical wave propagation pattern selection and formation heterogeneous reactions complex oscillations quasiperiodicity and chemical chaos both forced and spontaneous the second part of the book describes actual experimental systems such as the belousovzhabotinskii reaction and include discussion of the behavior of important gasphase reactions this volume is an ideal sourcebook of applied problems for graduate courses in dynamical systems advanced chemical kinetics and chemical reactor engineering as well as for research workers in physical chemistry and
