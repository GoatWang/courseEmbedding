was founded in  after having worked for a publicly traded brokerage firm for over ten years our founder richard mcelreath felt wall street had one purpose to serve themselves and the big institutional clients that drive their business in richards opinion the investor is far down the list of priorities of many of todays brokerage firms now do not misinterpret those thoughts we are big believers of capitalism and the free market we just need to know where we stand in the market the market has a lot to offer we just do not have to subscribe to all of it liquid and efficient markets are something we use to our advantage we leave the initial public offerings new investment ideas and other hot topics at the time to others following the crowd or the latest trend is not our objective in addition spring capital contributes more value through multiple product offerings in one location for both individuals as well as institutions the bottom line is this no matter your investment goal spring
