kentucky utilities company  case study gas and electric company makes paperless power management easy with citrix netscaler louisville gas and electric company lge kentucky utilities company ku and citrix louisville gas and electric company lge and kentucky utilities company ku regularly receive bestinclass customersatisfaction ratings that is significant for utilities that together serve nearly  million customers including providing power in all  counties in kentucky and five counties in virginia in addition to providing natural gas for customers in louisville kentucky and  surrounding counties lge and ku are part of the ppl corporation family of companies and they are headquartered in louisville the challenge perpetuate a paperless workplace and maximize application availability  in order to empower field employees to access the information they need at any time lge and ku have steadily moved toward mobilepowered workforces and paperless operations in a power plant mobile connections can be challenging wireless network connections aren’t always available in power plants and when they are they often suffer from interference to combat the unreliable nature of wireless connections the lge and ku development group turned to cellular connectivity and developed several internalfacing mobile applications that employees use on apple ipad devices in the early stages of the move to a cellularbased approach employees were sometimes unable to connect to the mobile applications due to lge and ku’s previous loadbalancing solution ineffectively handling traffic the solution couldn’t consistently deliver the needed capacity and reliability—which meant that employees couldn’t consistently access critical apps and data to support more secure reliable mobileapplication access in the field and on employees’ personal devices in  lge and ku deployed citrix xenmobile citrix netscaler was already deployed to provide remote access to a small internal virtualdesktopinfrastructure vdi environment the companies also used a different loadbalancing solution to support other critical application workloads such as their existing sap solution–based customer portal microsoft exchange and oracle financials the addition of xenmobile and the pending endoflife of the existing loadbalancing appliance provided the opportunity for lge and ku to consolidate all their loadbalancing requirements onto a single vendor platform—a move that could meet application delivery needs and lower overall operational costs the solution choose netscaler for oneplatform onevendor efficiency lge and ku chose netscaler appliances run on intel xeon processors as their solution the utilities upgraded their existing netscaler solutions to the multitenant netscaler sdx platform which has allowed them to service additional applications and isolate virtual instances from a single appliance with the netscaler sdx solution lge and ku use a single platform for all of their loadbalancing needs and help secure access to critical enterprise application workloads and their entire citrix infrastructure which includes citrix xenapp xendesktop xenmobile and sharefile field employees securely access applications from their mobile devices using the xenmobile and netscaler sdx solutions the netscaler sdx appliance ensures the availability of xenmobile mobiledevicemanagement mdm servers serve  million customers employ nearly  people provide power to  counties during hightraffic surges delivering percent uptime for apps and data lge and ku reduce costs by maintaining a digital “paper” trail that increases accuracy response times and productivity by removing the need to manage pieces of paper and the risk of losing those papers lge and ku can now host qualityassurance qa and production environments from the same netscaler appliance separating them as virtual instances on the multitenant netscaler platform netscaler sdx and because netscaler appliances are run on intel xeon processors lge and ku’s netscaler solution takes advantage of the processor family’s improved encryption performance and data availability netscaler appliances also benefit from intel virtualization technology for directed io intel vtd which improves performance for inputoutput io devices in virtualized environments key benefits a paperless model won’t work if digital connections aren’t always available and secure with its netscaler solution the lge and ku operations team can fully support the lge and ku corporate commitment to digital transformation netscaler appliances can also help the team drive even more paperless processes that help reduce errors deliver greater time savings and help maintain and improve compliance employees are empowered and customers are more satisfied by having consistent service and a faster return to service when outages occur “we believe doing it electronically instead of on paper is better and netscaler helps us do it electronically” says bill brumleve system administrator at lge and ku cost savings and datacenter consolidation with the netscaler sdx solution cost savings come from more than just being paperless using the netscaler sdx solution has allowed lge and ku to consolidate their data centers with fewer netscaler appliances which delivers significant cost savings consolidating to a single loadbalancing vendor has also contributed to lower operational costs as a result of decreased datacenter complexity and technical debt the entire operation with its  million customers is now run using four netscaler sdx  appliances housed in two different datacenter locations and those netscaler appliances are run on intel xeon processors which contribute to outstanding performance in virtualized environments and high consolidation ratios improved user experience and it productivity consolidated load balancing with the netscaler solution lets lge and ku deliver a better experience for field employees it also has allowed lge and ku to improve field employee and it productivity users can easily and reliably connect and connections no longer fail as they occasionally had with the previous vpn solution users aren’t kept from getting their jobs done and they don’t have to find timeconsuming workarounds either “now users get everything they need in a much easier way the end user has a much smoother experience than before” brumleve says with the netscaler solution the lge and ku it team can focus on more strategic initiatives instead of managing applicationaccess issues “better integration has helped make management of app delivery easier” brumleve says with the intel xeon processor e family powering its netscaler solution lge and ku optimizes performance based on workload demands at the server level netscaler appliances are optimized to squeeze the maximum capacity and support from intel architecture and up to  mb of l cache on the intel xeon processor e v family this lowers latency and accelerates performance because it’s much faster for data to move through the l cache than through main system memory by playing off of one another’s strengths the intel xeon processor e v family and the netscaler solution let brumleve and his team move more data more quickly through the data center high availability and disaster recovery the netscaler solution’s reliability and highavailability ha capabilities keeps users connected and productive in ways they don’t even realize because of the platform’s seamless failover capabilities and running on the intel xeon processor e v family helps further ensure the netscaler solution’s overall availability because of the processor family’s improved encryption performance and data availability lge and ku once experienced a failure while upgrading a virtualmachine host the upgrade caused their netscaler appliance to fail however the appliance automatically failed over to standby and users didn’t experience a single millisecond of disruption “we were able to do all of that without the end user knowing a thing it failed over to its standby and never skipped a beat we’ve done that several times and it allows us to do a lot of things without having to cause outages for the user i’ve been very happy with that the ha and dr functionality is very near and dear to our hearts” brumleve says brumleve and his team use the global server load balancing gslb capability in the netscaler appliance wherever possible to ensure traffic is intelligently distributed between data centers the team deploys netscaler appliances in each data center to distribute xenmobile traffic virtual ip addresses vips that support gslb run in each data center and all lge and ku appliances in each data center run as ha pairs “gslb makes disaster recovery that much easier” brumleve says looking ahead in the next few years lge and ku want to consolidate even more onto netscaler sdx appliances by adding ssl vpn functionality with citrix netscaler unified gateway to eliminate the need for their current vpn solution to deliver all their applications lge and ku are also looking to upgrade their remaining netscaler mpx platforms to netscaler sdx appliances download case study as pdf with netscaler giving users access is simply checking a box and picking a certificate from a dropdown and we are done and it all works because of the integration it isn’t different processes working on different platforms it works much better the integration really helps us bill brumleve system administrator lge and ku about citrix citrix nasdaqctxs is leading the transition to softwaredefining the workplace uniting virtualization mobility management networking and saas solutions to
