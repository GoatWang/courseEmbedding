the drug is currently in phase b for oncology and phase  for proteus syndrome a rare overgrowth disease in a trial being conducted by the national institutes of health nih both trials are biomarkerdriven and are focused on enrolling patients with the akt mutation we plan to initiate a company sponsored phase  trial in overgrowth diseases including pros pikca rare overgrowth syndromes and proteus syndrome in q of  arq  has demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth and downstream akt signaling in vivo in tumors whose growth is driven by these targets single agent activity with arq  was observed in phase a and phase b studies as well as reductions in expression levels of relevant biomarkers publications support akt as a viable target in oncology and proteus syndrome mechanism of action arq  suppresses the akt pathway via two modes of action first by binding to the inactive form of akt arq  prevents membrane localization and full akt activation second arq  also directly inhibits the membrane associated active form of akt precision medicine the akt mutation is believed to play a role in a number of cancers and overgrowth diseases such as proteus syndrome and overgrowth syndromes similar to pros the akt pathway when abnormally activated is implicated in multiple oncogenic processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis  this pathway has emerged as a target of potential therapeutic relevance for compounds that inhibit its activity which has been linked to a variety of cancers as well as to select nononcology indications preclinical research has demonstrated that arq  potently and selectively inhibits both the active and inactive forms of akt a landmark discovery by researchers from the national human genome research institute demonstrated that a somatic mutation in the akt oncogene which carries the set of instructions to produce the akt kinase causes proteus syndrome a point mutation – a singleletter “misspelling” in the dna of the genetic code — in the akt gene activates the tissue growth characteristic of proteus syndrome diseases we are exploring in clinical trials rare diseases proteus syndrome patients with proteus syndrome experience changes in the shapes of certain body structures over time including abnormal often asymmetric massive growth overgrowth of the skeleton skin adipose tissue and central nervous system out of proportion to the rest of the body which may appear normal although patients may have minimal or no manifestations at birth the disease develops and becomes apparent in early childhood  months and rapidly progresses with intense growth in the first  years of life the worldwide incidence is believed to be less than one in a million overgrowth diseases overgrowth disease is a term used to refer to a spectrum of rare diseases identified by somatic mutations often of the pik or akt pathway that result in excess growth in certain areas of the body while the individual diseases that fall within the overgrowth spectrum have similar symptoms each disease is defined by unique characteristics diseases that are part of the overgrowth spectrum include pros diseases pikcarelated overgrowth spectrum and proteus syndrome each disease on its own is rare sometimes ultrarare often only impacting an estimated one in a million people worldwideas an example cloves congenital lipomatous overgrowth vascular malformations epidermal nevi spinalskeletal anomalies andor scoliosis is a disease that is part of the pros family of diseases according to the cloves foundation wwwclovesfoundationorg cloves is an extremely rare progressive overgrowth disorder affecting approximately  people worldwide the symptoms vary from mild soft tissue tumors to vascular malformations encompassing the spine or internal organs cloves syndrome is closely linked to other overgrowth disorders like mcm macrocephalycapillary malformation syndrome klippeltrénaunayweber syndrome and proteus syndrome oncology akt driven cancers  prevalence of akt mutations in cancer varies from  depending on tumor types the tumor types with the highest prevalence of akt mutations are breast bladder endometrial ovarian and cervical cancers current clinical trials phase  in overgrowth diseases with genetic alterations of the pikakt pathway this phase  trial is scheduled to begin dosing in q’ more
