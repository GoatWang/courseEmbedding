images  mins prep  mins cook  mins yield about  servings ratings  by colleen graham updated  share pin email print a tom  jerry is a classic winter cocktail and a beverage that every explorer of the drink world should try at some point its a sweet frothy warm drink that is flavored with dark rum and cognac and it has been a holiday favorite since the s theres no sugarcoating it the tom  jerry is not the easiest drink to make but it is worth itwhile this drink is often compared to eggnog it is not an eggnog the main difference is that the tom  jerry is served warm and the drink is built in the serving mug eggnog on the other hand is cold and already mixed and ready to drink the tom  jerry is however a fantastic alternative to eggnog and many drinkers prefer it because it is more of a warm milk punch and has less of an eggy flavoryou will find that the tom  jerry is much like making a hot buttered rum it all begins with mixing the spiced batter which can be refrigerated or frozen until its time for a drink at that point its as simple as pouring warm milk over your liquor and batter its a fabulous way to have a tasty hot cocktail at the ready for holiday visitors and parties what youll need for the tom  jerry batter  eggs separated  teaspoon cream of tartar  cup butter  stick softened  cup sugar  teaspoon ground cinnamon  teaspoon ground nutmeg  teaspoon ground cloves  teaspoon vanilla extract  ounces dark rum for the drink  ounce dark rum  ounce cognac or brandy  tablespoon tom  jerry batter hot milk or hot water or both about  ounces total grated nutmeg for garnish how to make it to make the batteryou can prepare the batter a few hours ahead of time and either freeze or refrigerate it this recipe includes both cream of tartar and rum in the batter because the tartar keeps the sugars from separating and the rum acts as a preservative this will allow you to skip the freezer if you like however because it does include raw eggs you do need to take the precautions to keep it cold and avoid salmonella separate the egg white from the egg yolk and place each into individual bowlsadd the cream of tartar to the egg whites and whip with a mixer until you have a meringuelike texture with stiff peaksadd the softened butter and sugar to the bowl of egg yolks and whip until it is fully incorporated and a liquidgently fold the egg yolk mix into the egg

almost ready to relax with a steaming mug of this delicious cocktail if you can pour and stir a drink you will have no problems making this oneyou do need to pay attention to your milk when heating milk you need to do so slowly over a mediumhigh heat do not allow the milk to boil or it will curdle the same is true if you heat it too quickly go nice and slow and your milk will come out fine

hot water you can also do a  mix of milk and water if you prefer if you enjoy nondairy milk alternatives like soy or almond milk those can be used as wellthere are many recipes for the tom  jerry and each puts their own spin on the mixsome recipes skip the spices and vanilla in the batter in this case consider garnishing with a mix of ground cloves cinnamon and nutmeg to spice up the drinka few of the older recipes use a considerable amount of sugar sometimes up to  pounds as in professor jerry thomas recipe and skip the butter this is used most often when mixing the drink with hot water to give it more froth and creamothers are written without the premade batter however whipping egg whites is not an easy task so its best to do this in bulk rather than with just an egg or twofeel free to adapt this recipe to your own tastein the midwest it is very common to find premixed tom  jerry batter however just as it is with eggnog a madefromscratch drink is often much betterserving with the tom  jerry punch setit is very common for the tom  jerry to be served in a tom  jerry punch set these include a small punch bowl for holding the batter and matching mugs the pieces are most often in white ceramic with tom  jerry written on them sometimes you can find a bowl with a lid as wellthis is a great way to serve the drink for a party and they often have a fantastic vintage style you can
