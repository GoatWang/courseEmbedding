morningstar ownership zone™ provides detail about a portfolios equity investment style by showing the range of stock sizes and styles a portfolios ownership zone™ is derived by plotting each stock in the funds portfolio within the proprietary morningstar style box™ the shaded area represents the center  of the funds assets and it provides an intuitive visual representation of the area of the market in which the fund invests a centroid plot in the middle of the ownership zone represents the weighted average of all the funds holdings a fund that is concentrated will have a small ownership zone relative to the area of the style box and broadly diversified fund will have an ownership zone that stretches across many sizes and style over a period of time the shape and location of a funds ownership zone may vary the model for the fixedincome style box is based on the two pillars of fixedincome performance interestrate sensitivity and credit quality the three interest sensitivity groups are limited moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high medium and low these groupings display a portfolios effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the funds risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio the sec yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning

more sensitive to interest rate changes bond statistic average life in years expressed in years average life is time weighting the expected principal payments taking into consideration the impact of

growth nicholas equity income fund inc nseix was designed to invest in dividendpaying stocks across the market capitalization spectrum the fund launched in  and is managed by lead portfolio manager michael l shelton cfa cpa and coportfolio manager david o nicholas cfa the fund has tended to own more small and midcap stocks we believe the focus on smaller companies allows the fund to enhance its potential return by combining the longterm principal appreciation of smaller stocks along with the power of dividend income as is true with the other nicholas funds a critical component to the fund’s style is seeking to buy stocks with dividend yields greater than the market valuations offering the best opportunity for capital appreciation over the longrun and a margin of safety to offset the risk of price declines the nicholas philosophy has strongly maintained the benefits of buying stocks at valuations that are afforadble relative to their longterm potential the fund’s history suggests this approach can produce more consistent riskadjusted returns over time  snapshot objective performance portfolio manager distribution history documents  forms investment approach nicholas equity income fund seeks to provide investors with a reasonable stream of income along with longterm capital growth through a diversified portfolio of stocks with attractive dividend yields the fund will invest in

information about morningstar style box methodology the morningstar ownership zone™ provides detail about a portfolios equity investment style by showing the range of stock sizes and styles a portfolios ownership zone™ is derived by plotting each stock in the funds portfolio within the proprietary morningstar style box™ the shaded area represents the center  of the funds assets and it provides an intuitive visual representation of the area of the market in which the fund invests a centroid plot in the middle of the ownership zone represents the weighted average of all the funds holdings a fund that is concentrated will have a small ownership zone relative to the area of the style box and broadly diversified fund will have an ownership zone that stretches across many sizes and style over a period of time the shape and location of a funds ownership zone may vary the model for the fixedincome style box is based on the two pillars of fixedincome performance interestrate sensitivity and credit quality the three interest sensitivity groups are limited moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high medium and low these groupings display a portfolios effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the funds risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio
