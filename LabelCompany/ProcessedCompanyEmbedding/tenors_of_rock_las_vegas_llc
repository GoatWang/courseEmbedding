did not know what to expect this is a new show in las vegas only about two weeks old i think that they have done a great job of working out the kinks the performers are five men from the uk each in there own right are very talented soloists combined they are great they have great voices and blend together nicely my wife and i are products of the sixties and are not classic rock fans the concert had enough variety for everyone we thought that it was a nice touch that the singers and dancers came out into the audience and performed from there the music is loud and sometimes somewhat overbearing i think that there is something for everyone visited january  helpful  thank mikeshy report ask mikeshy about tenors of rock this review is the subjective opinion of a tripadvisor member

residency at harahs las vegas i was told when i booked that they were loud and very energentic and the sound was great well i was not disappointed these guys could sing opera to rock and they were sooooo good i was rocking and loving the entire show their talents of each one was out of this world the show was on the big stage and on side stages they were in the audience and interacting i may be in my s but believe me i knew every song and i cant say really explain how much i enjoyed this show keep it up guys i will be back visited january  helpful  thank marilyn w report ask marilyn w about

helpful votes “loved it these guys rock” reviewed january   was looking for an inexpensive music show to see during our first night at harrahs and wow did we make the right choice my partner and i love rock music and we had a great time at the show these guys are very talented and entertaining the band was great too loved the performance of bohemian rhapsody which apparently was a new addition to the showthe dancing ladies were good but a little goes a long way i think some of the bits with the dancers could be removed from the act im sure theyll figure out what works as time goes on harrahs showroom is a small venue and its cool that the guys and dancers wander out into the audience but closer to the stage is definitely better however if youre in the first couple of rows you might feel like the big boxes speakers on the stage block your view a bit the side seats were good the lighting and stage sets were great if you love rock go see these guys visited january  helpful
