corp  otcqb  ptrc  petro river or the company is pleased to provide an update on its proposed drilling program on its core asset the pearsonia west concession pearsonia in osage county oklahoma as well as other recent corporate activitiespearsonia comprises one of the largest contiguous oil and gas acreage positions in oklahoma at approximately  acres petro river acquired a controlling interest in the asset in may  through an investment in bandolier energy llc pearsonia had been previously exploited by horizontal drilling in mississippian reservoirs and the future exploration and development strategy was to target similar reservoirs through horizontal drilling in order to best develop pearsonia petro river is actively pursuing a vertical development program built upon the  miles of high quality proprietary d seismic our technical team has identified a number of structural closures ranging in size from  acres to  acres these structures are suitable for and support a vertical development program that can be implemented in the near future and that we believe has economic merit in the current low crude oil price environmentshane matson president of bandolier energy commented osage county has long been known for having along with  producing paleozoic horizons the best mississippian reservoirs in the midcontinent our team has deep experience integrating advanced seismic interpretation techniques with existing well control to identify high grade vertical opportunities this advantage coupled with the immense knowledge base gained through the successful horizontal exploitation of conventional and unconventional mississippian reservoirs in the county gives confidence in our ability to successfully exploit the reserves we know are trapped in the subsurfacepearsonia vertical drilling program the relatively shallow nature of the reservoirs in the pearsonia region along with few drilling hazards allow for low drilling and completion costs for vertical wells estimated costs are in the    range which is about  of the cost of a horizontal well operating costs for vertical wells are also much lower substantial investment has been made in infrastructure which complements and accelerates the time from well completion to oil production additionally each well has the opportunity to encounter multiple reservoirs of mississippian and pennsylvanian age creating stacked potential for each wellbore recent conservative economic projections developed by the company calculated using lowcase economic ultimate recoveries and current pricing parameters indicate potential doubledigit internal rates of return these potential returns are enhanced if higher oil prices and larger reserves are achieved petro river is currently seeking development partners with the intention of commencing a pilot vertical well drilling program subject to regulatory approvalexperience in mississippi lime vertical drilling  analogous results pearsonia is strategically located in a fairway of the most significant mississippian fields in the county the greater dog creekpearsoniablacklandforaker trend historically surrounding fields have produced millions of barrels of oil from vertical mississippian completions the burbank oil field which has produced over  million barrels of oil to date is located just adjacent to and downdip of pearsonia further there are five major fields adjacent to or within the boundaries of pearsonia these five fields have an average of  vertical wells with cumulative oil production of  million barrels of oil cumulative natural gas production of approximately  billion cubic feet and average production of  barrels of oil per well in addition the companys management and advisory board have substantial experience executing development programs in the region collectively the management of petro river bandolier and the advisory team have drilled over  wells in the midcontinent region and have  years experience successfully drilling wells in the mississippian and related structuresan increased focus on technology solutions business petro spring in an effort to take advantage of opportunities in
