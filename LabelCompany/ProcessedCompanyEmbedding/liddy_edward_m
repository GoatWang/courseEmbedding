continue reading the main story photo credit peter ahlberg the following is a letter sent on tuesday by jake desantis an executive vice president of the american international group’s financial products unit to edward m liddy the chief executive of aigdear mr liddyit is with deep regret that i submit my notice of resignation from aig financial products i hope you take the time to read this entire letter before describing the details of my decision i want to offer some contexti am proud of everything i have done for the commodity and equity divisions of aigfp i was in no way involved in — or responsible for — the credit default swap transactions that have hamstrung aig nor were more than a handful of the  current employees of aigfp most of those responsible have left the company and have conspicuously escaped the public outrageafter  months of hard work dismantling the company — during which aig reassured us many times we would be rewarded in march  — we in the financial products unit have been betrayed by aig and are being unfairly persecuted by elected officials in response to this i will now leave the company and donate my entire posttax retention payment to those suffering from the global economic downturn my intent is to keep none of the money myselfi take this action after  years of dedicated honorable service to aig i can no longer effectively perform my duties in this dysfunctional environment nor am i being paid to do so like you i was asked to work for an annual salary of  and i agreed out of a sense of duty to the company and to the public officials who have come to its aid having now been let down by both i can no longer justify spending    hours a day away from my family for the benefit of those who have let me down advertisement continue reading the main story you and i have never met or spoken to each other so i’d like to tell you about myself i was raised by schoolteachers working multiple jobs in a world of closing steel mills my hard work earned me acceptance to mit and the institute’s generous financial aid enabled me to attend i had fulfilled my american dream continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story i started at this company in  as an equity trader became the head of equity and commodity trading and a couple of years before aig’s meltdown last september was named the head of business development for commodities over this period the equity and commodity units were consistently profitable — in most years generating net profits of well over  million most recently during the dismantling of aigfp i was an integral player in the pending sale of its wellregarded commodity index business to ubs as you know business unit sales like this are crucial to aig’s effort to repay the american taxpayerthe profitability of the businesses with which i was associated clearly supported my compensation i never received any pay resulting from the credit default swaps that are now losing so much money i did however like many others here lose a significant portion of my life savings in the form of deferred compensation invested in the capital of aigfp because of those losses in this way i have personally suffered from this controversial activity — directly as well as indirectly with the rest of the taxpayersi have the utmost respect for the civic duty that you are now performing at aig you are as blameless for these credit default swap losses as i am you answered your country’s call and you are taking a tremendous beating for itbut you also are aware that most of the employees of your financial products unit had nothing to do with the large losses and i am disappointed and frustrated over your lack of support for us i and many others in the unit feel betrayed that you failed to stand up for us in the face of untrue and unfair accusations from certain members of congress last wednesday and from the press over our retention payments and that you didn’t defend us against the baseless and reckless comments made by the attorneys general of new york and connecticutmy guess is that in october when you learned of these retention contracts you realized that the employees of the financial products unit needed some incentive to stay and that the contracts being both ethical and useful should be left to stand that’s probably why aig management assured us on three occasions during that month that the company would “live up to its commitment” to honor the contract guaranteesthat may be why you decided to accelerate by three months more than a quarter of the amounts due under the contracts that action signified to us your support and was hardly something that one would do if he truly found the contracts “distasteful”that may also be why you authorized the balance of the payments on march at no time during the past six months that you have been leading aig did you ask us to revise renegotiate or break these contracts — until several hours before

decision to honor the contracts was both ethical and financially astute but it seems to have been politically unwise it’s now apparent that you either misunderstood the agreements that you had made — tacit or otherwise — with the federal reserve the treasury various members of congress and attorney general andrew cuomo of new york or were not strong enough to withstand the shifting political winds advertisement continue reading the main story you’ve now asked the current employees of aigfp to repay these earnings as you can imagine there has been a tremendous amount of serious thought and heated discussion about how we should respond to this breach of trustas most of us have done nothing wrong guilt is not a motivation to surrender our earnings we have worked  long months under these contracts and now deserve to be paid as promised none of us should be cheated of our payments any more than a plumber should be cheated after he has fixed the pipes but a careless electrician causes a fire that burns down the housemany of the employees have in the past six months turned down job offers from more stable employers based on aig’s assurances that the contracts would be honored they are now angry about having been misled by aig’s promises and are not inclined to return the money as a favor to youthe only real motivation that anyone at aigfp now has is fear mr cuomo has threatened to “name and shame” and his counterpart in connecticut richard blumenthal has made similar threats — even though attorneys general are supposed to stand for due process to conduct trials in courts and not the pressso what am i to do there’s no easy answer i know that because of hard work i have benefited more than most during the economic boom and have saved enough that my family is unlikely to suffer devastating losses during the current bust some might argue that members of my profession have been overpaid and i wouldn’t disagreethat is why i have decided to donate  percent of the effective aftertax proceeds of my retention payment directly to organizations that are helping people who are suffering from the global downturn this is not a taxdeduction gimmick i simply believe that i at least deserve to dictate how my earnings are spent and do not want to see them disappear back into the obscurity of aig’s or the federal government’s budget our earnings have caused such a distraction for so many from the more pressing issues our country faces and i would like to see my share of it benefit those truly in needon march  i received a payment from aig amounting to  after taxes in light of the uncertainty over the ultimate taxation and legal status of this payment the actual amount i donate may be less — in fact it may end up being far less if the recent house bill raising the tax on the retention payments to  percent stands once all the money is donated you will immediately receive a list of all recipientsthis choice is right for me i wish others at aigfp luck finding peace with their difficult decision and only hope their judgment is not clouded by fear mr liddy i wish you success in your commitment to return the money extended by the american government and luck with the continued unwinding of the company’s diverse businesses — especially those remaining credit default swaps i’ll continue over the short term to help make sure no balls are dropped but after what’s happened this past week i can’t remain much longer — there is too much bad blood i’m not sure how you will greet my resignation but at least attorney general blumenthal should be relieved that i’ll leave under my own power and will not need to be “shoved out the door” advertisement continue reading the main story sincerelyjake desantis continue reading the main story we’re interested
