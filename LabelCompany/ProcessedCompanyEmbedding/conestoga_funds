conestoga capital advisors is group of smallcap investor cut straight from the hidden gems cloth theyre hg members too the group invests in companies with robust earnings growth strong cash positions solid market share and smart ethical successful management teams last week i chatted with duane dorazio who ive known for years and a fellow managing partner bob mitchell what follows are a few key takeaways from our discussion via a lightly edited transcript with my own thoughts sprinkled in my comments are in italics conestoga capitals approach the investment philosophy the process has stayed very consistent through all the years  one of our strengths is that we stick to what we do and we dont deviate based on the flavor of the day or what the markets are doing we look for really goodquality smallcap companies and look to invest with them for a number of years it takes us a long time to get comfortable and then once we make that decision we hope to be in the name for a period of time we like to have a turnover ratio of less than  and i would say historically in the last three or four years its probably been below  ac for context most mutual funds hold stocks for less than a year meaning they have annual turnover north of  our separate account composite goes back to  we started the conestoga small cap fund ccasx in october of  and its managed the exact same way as our separate account historical product was managed ac since inception capital advisors has returned  annualized versus  for the russell  the smallcap fund is up  vs  for the russell  conestoga invests in long positions only no shorting smallcap conservative growth investing and reducing volatility one of the things that we try to emphasize in our process or our philosophy is that we try to reduce the volatility our companies are strong fundamental companies that have nice cash positions when times get tough they dont get hit as hard as the market so were not capturing the downside on the upside we just try to keep pace with the market versus the typical momentum of smallcap managers that we see in our space we view ourselves as a smallcap conservative growth investor often the volatility associated with smallcap growth stocks can be very difficult for institutional as well individual investors to stomach thats why we focus on higherquality companies that have very highlevel sustained revenue and earnings growth rates they can dampen the volatility thats often associated with small cap growth yet still see the benefits of having exposure to the small cap growth asset class through having a manager that focuses on conservative growth companies ac conestogas top  firmwide holdings as of june  are carbo ceramics advent software advisory board costar group blackboard bottomline technologies nve quality systems hittite microwave and sun hydraulics certainly since we started the firm in  it was much more volatile than i think any of us could have imagined so living through  the aftermath of the  attacks and the difficult  and then fast forward to the credit crisis and the great recession of  what i think is critical and gave our firm and investment style the ability to prosper is really the confidence in knowing the companies that you own we focus on companies that have strong management teams and having the confidence in those individuals understanding their philosophies and their approach about how they want to build their business how they would react in very difficult and challenging economic times having companies that had significantly very low leverage and very strong balance sheets really gave us the fortitude to continue to stay true to our discipline market myopia versus longterm investing so much of the market has been shortterm oriented in terms of what have you done for me lately that provides one of our competitive advantages in that we can look beyond the next quarter or two and use that to your advantage in order to build positions in companies or increase positions in what otherwise might be viewed as a shortterm disappointment from an earnings perspective perhaps the company spent more money than anticipated because of an opportunity that is the right decision from a business perspective but so many people who run investment management firms and mutual funds are looking for a shortterm return that makes it very difficult for people to look beyond the next  days i dont think that is good for american business in general hunting for the next multibagger stock were very much fundamentally based the investment team here spends a significant amount of time out on the road talking to companies and getting to know them the management teams competitors suppliers we do a lot of phone work as well to try to ascertain whether or not what is presented to us in a conference room is in fact whats going on in the real world we place a great deal of emphasis on going to industry trade shows and conferences putting some mileage on our cars were enrolled in several frequent flyer programs and we benefit from that we have four criteria that we use that  we think define highquality smallcap names and that whittles thousands of companies down to a universe of about  to  names about a third of the portfolios historically come from that universe from the screening process and the remaining twothirds come from more qualitative factors ac the four criteria are  the ability to generate annualized earnings growth of at least  for next three years  a strong market position and high returns on equity  or more  a strong balance sheet and conservative accounting policies debt to equity ratio should be less than   good management team typically with ownership of more than  weve gotten to know a lot of the management teams that we invest in and during our due diligence process we often come across a better name than what we started with thats how i found neogen see smallcap idea no  below i was out visiting meridian bioscience and asked the ceo what other companies he thought were wellrun in his space or what they owned in their personal accounts and he told me about this little company called neogen which i had never heard of wrote it down went back to the office and did work and then went out to east lansing and visited them so its a combination of factors we try to be rigid yet flexible if that makes sense we dont want to just put blinders on and say hey if you dont have management ownership of  youre automatically disqualified if its less than that because of some historical factors were willing to look at that but we want to make sure that generally speaking those companies meet our criteria healthy balance between business analysis and valuation we first and foremost look for a great business but we also are valuationsensitive we want to make sure that were paying what we think is a reasonable price for a business we look at each company on a casebycase basis there are some companies that deserve to trade at a  to  multiple because of their business model and their cyclicality were willing to pay  times that for others because of their business model the recurring revenue and their strong competitive position so we dont have a cookiecutter valuation that says if its x multiple its too expensive or too cheap we think its really important to look at each company on a casebycase basis the stock has got to be able to have the ability to double over a three to fiveyear period of time in order to be included in our portfolio ac thats annualized returns of  to  over that three to fiveyear period smallcap idea no  paying up for a franchise  carbo ceramics one of our longestterm investments and frankly one of our most successful investments is a company called carbo ceramics  nyse crr  which is based in houston texas it makes ceramic proppants that get dropped into oil and gas wells the competitive product to that is a sander or sand resin with a ceramic proppant because of the uniform nature of that proppant you can get more oil and gas out of a well as a result this company has demonstrated a longterm track record of being able to grow nicely in up markets but also have the ability to take share in down markets as a result if you look at that stock on a valuation basis relative to almost any other oil service company when we bought it  and the statement is true today  its relatively much more expensive than anybody else but what you typically dont see particularly in oilservice companies is a proprietary advantage so if you talk to a lot of industryspecific people about carbo ceramics they would say oh that stock is way too expensive were structured here as generalists so were looking for good businesses regardless of what industry or economic sector they serve i think that benefits us because we dont have these very industryfocused valuation metrics as a result carbo ceramics has demonstrated over the past five to  years the ability to significantly grow their business in good times and in bad times it shows up in their superior operating margins and their very strong return on equity theyre actually one of the few firms in the united states if not the world thats physically out of manufacturing capacity theyre in the midst of an expansion that they cant get up fast enough that expansion will give them an additional  million pounds of ceramic proppant kicking the tires and checking underneath the hood with any name including carbo ceramics it usually takes us three to six to nine months to do our due diligence this involves talking to competitors suppliers distributors depending upon the particular business model and how they reach the market we place a great deal of emphasis on getting to know those different data points and looking at industry conditions in an oilservice company where energy oil and commodity prices are critical its important to make sure that your company has a significant proprietary advantage because their end customers are so influenced by commodity prices energy has historically been a tough space for us because of that boombust mentality we saw carbo ceramics patent portfolio and how that has been a very strong note  which a lot of people like to talk about these days  in terms of being able to have an intellectual property surrounding that proppant they also have locked up a raw material called kaolin that is a critical ingredient of ceramic proppants theyve been able to buy up a lot of that land in the united states particularly in georgia the cost of moving that can be prohibitively expensive so by locking up some of the resources and putting their plants right next to them theyre effectively widening their moat those are the types of things we look for in order to be willing to pay what perhaps other people might consider a high multiple yet what we think is a reasonable multiple given their competitive edge and their significant growth prospects portfolio approach diversify and manage by conviction were very much managers of conviction you can see that we have typically  names in the portfolio our top  names account for typically between  and  of the portfolio with that said we certainly want to make sure we are protecting the downside and one of the ways to mitigate risk is by having diversification and so we have  names that are spread across multiple economic sectors we tend to not have certain industries or sectors represented because they dont have growth characteristics like utilities or consumer staples we have significant exposure into technology and health care and to the producer durable area very developed technology names like blackboard and blackbaud and tyler which are software related and are the respective pound gorillas in their spaces their contracts are usually three to five years they have renewal rates in excess of  or so and have very strong competitive positions so its critical that youre able to protect the downside and be able to have diversification across a number of sectors but still be willing i think to have conviction on the names that you own we target no sector to be more than  of the overall portfolio were actually currently a little bit above that threshold now because some of our tech names have performed relatively well we want to make sure that no sector weighting is two times more than the benchmark russell  smallcap idea no  neogen one of the themes we like where we tend to find a lot of companies is in the diagnostic states and neogen  nasdaq neog  is a company that really fits that bill extremely well it is a food and animal safety diagnostic company based in east lansing michigan michigan is obviously more known for its automobile exposure than its healthcare companies but within east lansing there is this company called neogen and interestingly neogen is the second largest owner of schools in east lansing given the demographic shifts that have occurred the east lansing school district has looked to raise some funds neogen has found that it is a fantastic and very capitalefficient way to expand their facilities in fact theres a house next to their headquarters and the guy wont move because neogen pays his taxes cuts his lawn and doesnt have latenight parties these guys run a great business food and animal safety its obviously been in the news a lot with the recent salmonella outbreak within the egg business and neogen  not that this will drive their revenue  but it gets a lot of headlines because of its exposure to what has been a very hot topic in the news over the last several years with the recent food outbreaks like weve seen recently here with the egg and the poultry industries neogen has the broadest line of diagnostic products as they say from inside the farm gate to the table they have a continuum of products that will serve the farmers the food processors and then the retailers as well its a company thats run by jim herbert and lon bonhannon jim herbert was one of the founders and lon i think has been there about  or  years theyre a great management team thats flown under the radar screen here for a couple of years i think its starting to get some notoriety in terms of being extremely wellpositioned tractor supply is a big customer of theirs and they have a very longterm and very strong relationship with that entity thinking about acquisitions and returns on equity we look at returns on equity and returns on invested capital very critically and if you looked at our return on equity its about  or  our return on invested capital is about  or  so together they tell the same story and i think our roe number is fairly clean because of the types of companies that we invest in now neogen is a bit of a different story half of its growth comes from internal organic growth and new product development and the other half comes from these acquisitions weve been a shareholder for about three or four years we tend to shy away from companies where acquisitions are part of the core strategy but as we watched the company for a period of time we got more comfortable that these acquisitions that theyre doing are not transformational acquisitions they tend to be very much extensions of their product line usually buying that product is kind of an orphan product line from the large multinational where  million doesnt mean anything and then they acquire that product line they have the capacity back in east lansing to bring that manufacturing back to them and get scale on it and then get it through their distribution channel actually every one of their acquisitions that theyve made has been accretive to its shareholders and its one of the more interesting conference calls jim herbert who is a tennessean has quite a number of good sayings during the call i dont know if you know simpson manufacturing  nyse ssd  but barclay simpson and jim herbert i think are one of a kind that you typically dont see anymore ac simpson manufacturing is a former hg company that we sold near the top in late  because the valuation outstripped our expectations and yes we loved listening into their conference calls to hear what barclay had to say next smallcap idea no  from the hg watch list  abaxis abaxis  nasdaq abax  is a diagnostic company based in union city cali clint severson is i think a fantastic manager he has done a great job in terms of building a business and more recently surrounding himself with other very strong managers like don wood who i think is the chief operating officer and really effectively the head of the manufacturing operations up until don came in i would say people criticized abaxis for their lack of manufacturing expertise don has come in and really put a very strong discipline in that has been able to lower the cost of the discs and we expect further cost reductions going forward abaxis has built up its own sales force within the veterinary area i think a lot of investors focus on the medical side of the equation and the success or lack thereof that they have in that area as really a growth driver i think theyre going to be successful in both of those areas in the veterinary area and in the medical area with their piccolo basically its a battle of a better product versus a distribution force and whos going to win that i think that given the countrys and the worlds focus on higher quality outcomes in an efficient fashion abaxiss product is extremely wellpositioned they dont have the huge distribution force that some of their competitors have but they do have superior products in terms of their functionality their features and they make the physician office and the vet office much more efficient if you look at things from a total cost perspective abaxis is a name that hasnt really done much over the last several years but because of some of the changes theyve undergone in terms of their distribution i think its extremely wellpositioned looking out the next three to five years to see continued traction in the medical space and to drive their revenue and earnings in excess of  for the next several years ac for more on abaxis check out stans watch list writeup  smallcap idea no  advisory board advisory board  nasdaq abco  is a name that weve owned also for a considerable period of time a company that i would say is a very dominant player in its space it is well managed by bob musselwhite and michael kirshbaum i think theyre strong managers they provide i think a very costeffective solution to primarily hospitals within the united states they ran into some difficulty relatively speaking in  and  as their customers were feeling the impact of the credit crunch but they really showed the value of their products to their customer base during those difficult times and emerged a very strong player theyve had some difficulty implementing these webbased analytical tools to their customers but i think theyre on the back side of that implementation and those difficulties thats shown up in terms of the growth in their contract value and in the renewal rate so we think its extremely wellpositioned its got a great deal of cash in the balance sheet the one fly in the ointment there is that the options that the management team pays themselves has a little more stock option overhang than what we typically like to see but thats somewhat the nature of the beast in terms of how a generically speaking consulting firm still has to compete in terms of what they provide their employees which are truly the assets of the business they have to pay them well and thats reflected i think in that option issue that surrounds the company disclosure
