directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not

highlyvisible because of his popular blog a vc he recently raised concerns about too many venture investors chasing returns wanting to invest in venture startups without really understanding their business but in that same post he also wrote the venture capital business is showing good returns for the first time in a decade the sectors that are performing best are web services and early stageseed investing these are sectors we have been investing in for over fifteen years we’ve seen these sectors boom and bust before and we’ll probably see it again we are committed to these sectors and have no plans to leave them union square’s new opportunity fund will presumably focus on the same sorts of early stage internet startups union square is so good at sniffing out although the name is different its previous funds which are differentiated by date so it is possible that the opportunity fund will focus on a different set of opportunities i have an email out to union square about this and will update when i hear back update fred wilson says “we cannot comment at this time because we’re still in the process of raising the fund we look forward to giving you a full report when

fund would focus on laterstage investments as far as union square ventures goes principal fred wilson has commented on the filing without actually commenting on fund “there are ways to keep a financing quiet and avoid these filings and we have been involved in financings where that was done successfully but unless you specifically request that your lawyers keep the financing quiet you are most likely going to have your fundraising effort in the public record “and this can catch you off guard if you want to control the message and announce the financing to your employees first so they don’t read about it in the tech blogs you need to be aware that the clock is ticking and you need to get the word out fairly promptly” wilson said on his blog that “due to legal issues” he “can’t comment on it until next month sometime” new yorkbased union square raised its debut fund of  million in  and is known for its early bets on internet companies such as twitter and zynga its second

some investments that take years to make they are often our best investments quizlet took something like five years to go from a company we got interested in to a usv investment in march  we hosted an event we called hacking education that was the official start of our focus on education from that event came a thesis on how we would approach investing in education we would invest in lightweight services and networks that allowed anyone to learn anything we would not invest in services sold top down to the existing k and higher education system we wanted to obliterate not automate we started hunting around for services and networks that fit our thesis one that caught our attention was quizlet the leading web and mobile studying tool we got an intro through christina eventually andy got a meeting we found out that quizlet had been bootstrapped was profitable and was not interested in raising outside capital but andy did not take no for an answer he kept calling on them he brought me to meet the two quizlet leaders andrew and dave in september  we got the same story in that meeting but we did make an impression we started inviting them to our events in sf and they usually would come so we kept doing that and kept stoping by to say hi when we were in sf earlier this year dave called me to say that they were going to raise outside capital he and andrew had concluded that the opportunity to build and develop peer to peer learning and studying tools for web and mobile was so large that they could not continue to bootstrap so we jumped onto the opportunity and threw ourselves at it that process had a number of fits and starts but we hung in there and eventually the financing came together the way andrew and dave wanted it to and we joined our friends at costanoa altos and owl in a mm series a round for a ten year old company just writing those last few words makes me happy you dont see many series a rounds for ten year old companies but when you do they are generally good ones to do so what is quizlet well if you have kids in middle high school or college they probably use it quizlet is a studyinglearning tool written by andrew sutherland for his own use ten years ago when he was studying for a french test he put it out on the web a bit later he was joined by dave margulius who helped him turn quizlet into a business by implementing an elegant freemium business model quizlet is free for anyone to use but if you want to do certain higher value things you can pay a small amount every month for access to them quizlet lets anyone create a study set and practice it online and on mobile and it also allows anyone to use someone elses study set quizlet is peer to peer learning over mm study sets have been created by users and over bn study sessions have been done on quizlet quizlet has been a top ten education app in the mobile app stores for years a fact i was constantly reminded of every time i went to look at the education category in the years we were chasing this investment here are some examples i just found by searching around a sinecosine study set  essential french verbs aerobic and anaerobic respiration forklift test prep just imagine a massively open database of mm study sets like that which is growing by the day and you get why we have been and continue to be so interested in quizlet there are over bn learners on planet earth within a decade the vast majority of them will have a mobile device connected to this massively open database of study set which is available for free these bn learners will be able to contribute and consume these study sets and in the process the world will become more educated and more literate that is hacking education and that is why usv is so excited to finally be an investor

work dld munich  fireside chat with usvs andy weissman with figure toronto  new fund  same focus  union square ventures home threads blog portfolio about jobs new fund  same focus mar   “ we closed on union square ventures  lp last week our new fund at mm in capital ments is large enough for us to be able to act on our conviction and to support our portfolio but small enough to enable us to flexibly build positions in attractive capital efficient web servicesthe investment focus of union square ventures  lp remains the same we are convinced that the information technology enabled transformation of the global economy has only begun the environment however is quite different today than it was when we closed our first fund four years ago then the economy was just emerging from the collapse of the dot com bubble and the opportunity for web services like delicious and feedburner was not yet broadly understood today the global economy seems to be headed into a recession and the market for lightweight web services is arguably over populated and over invested so even though we have not changed where we invest we continue to evolve how we invest to adapt to the changing market today new web services are popping up every day unfortunately users only have so much time services targeted at web savvy early adopters will increasingly need to displace time spent with existing services to gain meaningful traction on the other hand more people all over the world are web literate creating opportunity for new services designed to appeal to new untapped groups of users at work and at home the potential value of the available audience is also poised to explode as the generation that grew up not knowing a world without the web is moving out of the back bedroom and off the dole into the workforce all of this means that you will see subtle changes in the way we invest our new fund we will be even more selective about the early stage web services we back looking for compelling differentiation a discrete market focus and clear evidence of sustainable user growth you will also see us invest selectively in later stage opportunities that we believe are poised to grow as more users become more dependent on the web to manage their daily lives perhaps the biggest change is that there will be new faces around the office albert wenger who has been working closely with us for several years will be joining us as a partner andrew parker has made himself so essential to the operation of our business that we broke the rules on our two year analyst program and asked him to stay on as an associate we are recruiting a new analyst to take over andrew’s duties in that area we are fortunate that we have been able to add to our team without changing the feel of our firm albert and andrew share our passion for startups and our conviction that the web will continue to be a disruptive force in the global economy they also fit well into our collegial culture where we do our own work support the entire portfolio and share the credit and the blame for the outcomewe are pleased that the closing of union square ventures  lp will enable us to continue doing the work we love we have a tremendous group of supportive institutional limited partners in our first fund and are thrilled that every one of them is participating in union square ventures  lp we look forward to continuing the dialogue with all of you in the coming years ” brad burnham please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus comments powered by disqus
