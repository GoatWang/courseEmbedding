missouri memorandum and order audrey g fleissig district judge this matter is before the court on defendants motion doc no  to exclude the reports and testimony of plaintiffs expert witnesses david prescott and brian abbott from the bench trial in this case for the reasons set forth below the motion shall be granted in part and denied in part background plaintiffs in this class action are civilly committed residents of the missouri department of mental healths dmhs sex offender rehabilitation and treatment services sorts facilities who have been declared sexually violent predators svps under missouris svp statute mo rev stat §  et seq plaintiffs assert claims under  usc §  and the americans with disabilities act ada  usc §§  et seq challenging the care and treatment provided to sorts residents and the reimbursement sought by the state for that treatment one of plaintiffs experts david prescott is a licensed clinical social worker he serves as the director of professional development and quality improvement for becket family of services which operates a range of inpatient and outpatient programs including treatment of individuals who have been sexually abused he previously served as the clinical director of the minnesota sex offender program in moose lake minnesota and as the treatment assessment director for wisconsins sand ridge secure treatment center both of which are svp civil commitment programs like sorts prescott has also served as a consultant and trainer for other state svp civil commitment programs he conducted a training of clinicians at the sorts facility in farmington missouri in  in his expert report prescott provides the following opinions opinion  sorts as presently constituted is not structured in such a manner to provide effective and comprehensive mental health treatment necessary to result in conditional or full releases for any covered residents opinion  the standards for release of sorts residents are vague unrealistic and unachievable and further not supported by mental health professional standards opinion  sorts does not make use of or employ the least restrictive alternative for its residents doc no  plaintiffs other expert brian abbott is a licensed clinical psychologist and clinical social worker he has worked as a clinician forensic evaluator author and trainer in the area of child sexual abuse he has treated or supervised the treatment of hundreds of sex offenders and he has testified in svp civil commitment proceedings around the country including in missouri in his expert report abbott provides the following opinions  svp civil commitment programs represent flawed public policy in general  the standards for release at sorts are unrealistic andor unachievable  sorts does not have an effective treatment program because it appears that sorts does not allow releases to less restrictive alternatives sorts appears to be underfunded residents appear to be receiving less than the amount of treatment time provided at other sex offender treatment programs and the lack of releases at sorts likely instills a sense of hopelessness in sorts residents which is countertherapeutic  the sorts conditional release program is unrealistic unworkable and disingenuous because for example conditionally released residents do not appear to be permitted to spend meaningful time outside of the sorts facilities and it appears that residents the dmh identified as being eligible for conditional release were not informed of this fact and were not afforded an opportunity for conditional release  sorts lacks a least restrictive alternative and  missouris svp civil commitment procedures in general appear to be biased toward promoting commitment doc no  neither prescott nor abbott interviewed any of the residents or staff at sorts instead they based their opinions on a review of discovery in this case and their training education and experience with other svp civil commitment programs around the country the discovery reviewed by both experts includes emails and correspondence among dmh employees expressing concerns regarding overcrowding understaffing underfunding and low or nonexistent graduation rates at sorts treatment materials from a onetime treatment director at sorts dr mark carich other documents and interrogatory responses produced by defendants and transcripts of depositions conducted in this case defendants do not challenge the qualifications of prescott or abbott rather they argue that the expert reports and accompanying testimony are not based on sufficient facts or data are unhelpful and do not reliably apply the principles and methods to the facts of the case defendants argue that the experts opinions are inadmissible because they are based on outdated emails and documents defendants note that the experts did not interview any residents or staff at sorts did not discuss standards of release with anyone at sorts do not know whether the treatment materials they reviewed were ever implemented at sorts and do not know what treatment methods are currently being used at sorts defendants also argue that abbotts opinions regarding the svp civil commitment process generally including that it represents flawed public policy and appears biased toward commitment are irrelevant to the issues in this case which are limited to the constitutionality of the care and treatment provided to sorts residents and the reimbursement sought for that treatment plaintiffs respond that defendants challenges regarding the factual bases of the expert testimony go to the weight of the testimony not its admissibility plaintiffs argue that the experts extensive experience with svp civil commitment programs around the country and their review of the extensive discovery in this case provide a sufficient basis for their opinions and will help the court resolve the issues in this case plaintiffs note that defendants will be free at trial to challenge the data upon which the experts relied and to present their own experts opinions plaintiffs also argue that abbotts opinions regarding missouris svp civil commitment process generally are relevant to plaintiffs claims that the care and treatment at sorts is unconstitutional and alternatively a violation of the ada plaintiffs note that abbotts opinions discuss the psychological evaluations performed by certified forensic experts during the civil commitment process and the fact that some sorts residents were committed despite an evaluation that they did not suffer from a mental abnormality andor did not meet the risk threshold set forth in the svp statute plaintiffs argue that these evaluations are relevant to their care and treatment claims because the evaluations should have but have not been considered in formulating the treatment provided to and standards for release of the respective sorts residents in other words plaintiffs argue that abbotts opinions regarding the continued commitment of sorts residents who were at one time found to not suffer from a mental abnormality that makes them sexually dangerous help demonstrate that sorts program as applied in these instances is unlawful discussion the admission of expert testimony in federal court is governed by federal rule of evidence  wagner v hesston corp  fd   th cir  rule  provides a witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge skill experience training or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if a the experts scientific technical or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue b the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data c the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and d the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case fed r evid  the rule was amended in  in response to daubert v merrell dow pharms inc  us   which charged trial judges with a gatekeeping role to exclude unhelpful and unreliable expert testimony as a general rule the factual basis of an expert opinion goes to the credibility of the testimony not the admissibility and it is up to the opposing party to examine the factual basis for the opinion in crossexamination first union nat bank v benham  fd   th cir  only if the experts opinion is so fundamentally unsupported that it can offer no assistance to the jury must such testimony be excluded id and any doubts regarding whether an experts testimony will be useful should generally be resolved in favor of admissibility clark by  through clark v heidrick  fd   th cir  citations omitted moreover because the main purpose of daubert exclusion is to protect juries from being swayed by dubious scientific testimony daubert standards are relaxed in bench trials where there is no jury and the trial court is the fact finder in re zurn pex plumbing prods liab litig  fd   th cir  tussey v abb inc  fd   th cir  in a bench trial we not only give the trial court wide latitude in determining whether an experts testimony is reliable we also relax dauberts application internal citations omitted david e watson pc v united states  fd   th cir  holding that dauberts application is relaxed for bench trials because there is less need for the gatekeeper to keep the gate when the gatekeeper is keeping the gate only for himself citation omitted in this bench trial the court finds that the expert reports and testimony of prescott and abbott are admissible except in one narrow respect discussed below the court agrees with plaintiffs that the factual bases of the expert opinions are matters of credibility not admissibility any weaknesses perceived by defendants in the factual bases of the expert opinions may be explored on cross examination see garrett v albright no cv  wl  at  wd mo mar   rejecting the defendants attack on factual basis of experts conclusion including what records he may or may not have reviewed whether he should have made calls to    other hospitals or whether one interview was sufficient and holding that these matters went to credibility not admissibility kay v lamar adver of s dakota inc no civ kes  wl  at  dsd aug   defendants argue that dr lierman could have obtained additional facts by interviewing some of the officers of arxx the fact that dr lierman may have obtained additional data does not demonstrate that dr lierman relied on insufficient facts the court will however exclude abbotts opinions that svp civil commitment programs represent flawed public policy in general and that missouris svp civil commitment procedures appear to be biased toward promoting commitment as defendants correctly note plaintiffs do not challenge missouris ability to civilly commit svps therefore abbotts opinions regarding whether the civil commitment of svps is bad policy or missouris procedures are biased are unhelpful and irrelevant the court will grant defendants motion to exclude these two opinions however this ruling should not be read to prohibit plaintiffs from introducing the factual information upon which abbott may have relied such as the nature of the psychological evaluations conducted during the civil commitment process to the extent abbott contends these evaluations should impact treatment and standards of release at sorts conclusion for the reasons set forth above it is hereby ordered that defendants motion to exclude the testimony and reports of david prescott and brian abbott is granted in part and denied in part doc no  the motion is granted with respect to abbotts opinions that the svp civil commitment process is flawed public policy and biased in favor of commitment the motion is denied

monument challenged was feet high and feet wide was placed in  it was donated to the state of texas by the fraternal order of eagles a civic organization with the support of cecil b demille who had directed the film the ten commandments the state accepted the monument and selected a site for it based on the recommendation of the state agency responsible for maintaining the capitol grounds the donating organization paid for its erection two state legislators presided over the dedication of the monument the monument was erected on the capitol grounds behind the capitol building between the texas capitol and supreme court buildings the surrounding  acres  m² contained  monuments and  historical markers commemorating the people ideals and events that compose texan identity plurality opinionedit the plurality opinion stated that the monument was constitutional as it represented historical value and not purely religious value the primary content is the text of the ten commandments an eagle grasping the american flag an eye inside of a pyramid and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the ten commandments below the text are two stars of david and the superimposed greek letters chi and rho which represent christ the bottom of the monument bears the inscription presented to the people and youth of texas by the fraternal order of eagles of texas  below the above matter and the title the ten commandments the monuments text reads in full i am the lord thy god thou shalt have no other gods before me thou shalt not make to thyself any graven images thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain remember the sabbath day to keep it holy honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou shalt not kill thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor thou shalt not covet thy neighbors house thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his cattle nor anything that is thy neighbors thomas van orden challenged the constitutionality of the monument a native texan van orden passed by the monument frequently when he would go to the texas supreme court building to use its law library breyers concurrenceedit monument with state capitol in background breyers concurrence in this case is made all the more interesting because on the surface it appears that he voted quite differently in the mccreary county v aclu of kentucky a case which was heard and decided at the same time and seems to the casual observer virtually identical however in van orden v perry breyer submitted an opinion separate from that of the court while in mccreary he did not as a result the van orden case was decided by a plurality not a majority as the other in opening his discussion of reasoning breyer states the case before us is a borderline case it concerns a large granite monument bearing the text of the ten commandments located on the grounds of the texas state capitol on the one hand the commandments text undeniably has a religious message invoking indeed emphasizing the deity on the other hand focusing on the text of the commandments alone cannot conclusively resolve this case rather to determine the message that the text here conveys we must examine how the text is used and that inquiry requires us to consider the context of the display he then goes on to list points which are stated to be insufficient individually but together seem to provide a reasonable basis for secular purpose the monuments year history on the texas state grounds indicates that nonreligious aspects of the tablets message predominate the group that donated the monument the fraternal order of eagles is a private civic and primarily secular organization who while interested in the religious aspect of the ten commandments sought to highlight the commandments role in shaping civic morality as part of that organizations efforts to combat juvenile delinquency the eagles consulted with a committee composed of members of several faiths in order to find a nonsectarian text — an act which underscores the groups ethicsbased motives the tablets as displayed on the monument prominently acknowledge that the eagles donated the display the physical setting of the monument suggests little or nothing of the sacred the monument sits in a large park containing  monuments and  historical markers all designed to illustrate the ideals of those who settled in texas and of those who have lived there since that time the setting does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other religious activity the setting does provide a context of history and moral ideals the larger display together with the displays inscription about its origin communicates to visitors that the state sought to reflect moral principles illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the states citizens historically speaking have endorsed that is to say the context suggests that the state intended the displays moral message — an illustrative message reflecting the historical ideals of texans — to predominate breyer then goes on to state if these factors provide a strong but not conclusive indication that the commandments text on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message a further factor is determinative here as far as i can tell  years passed in which the presence of this monument legally speaking went unchallenged until the single legal objection raised by petitioner and i am not aware of any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation hence those  years suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals whatever their system of beliefs are likely to have understood the monument as amounting in any significantly detrimental way to a government effort to favor a particular religious sect primarily to promote religion over nonreligion to engage in any religious practice to compel any religious practice or to work deterrence of any religious belief schempp  u s at  goldberg j concurring those  years suggest that the public visiting the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage breyer continues to explain a position which seeks to balance between not leading the law to exhibit a hostility toward religion that has no place in our establishment clause of the first amendment traditions and recognizing the danger of the slippery slope and ultimately rests upon a matter of degree which is i believe critical in a borderline case such as this one breyer concludes by stating he cannot agree with the plurality nor with justice scalias dissent in mccreary county v aclu of kentucky but while he does agree with justice oconnors statement of principles in mccreary he disagrees with her evaluation of the evidence as it bears on the applying those principles to van orden v perry stevens dissentedit stevens dissenting opinion essentially stated that in formulating a ruling for this case the court had to consider whether the display had any significant relation to the specific and secular history of the state of texas or the united states as a whole ultimately stevens asserted that the display has no purported connection to gods role in the formation of texas or the founding of our nation     and therefore could not be protected on the basis that it was a display dealing with secular ideals in fact stevens says that the display transmits the message that texas specifically endorses the judeochristian values of the display and thus the display

the state agency responsible for maintaining the capitol grounds the donating organization paid for its erection two state legislators presided over the dedication of the monument the monument was

religious value the primary content is the text of the ten commandments an eagle grasping the american flag an eye inside of a pyramid and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script

law library breyers concurrenceedit monument with state capitol in background breyers concurrence in this case is made all the more interesting because on the surface it appears that he voted quite differently in the mccreary county v aclu of kentucky a case which was heard and decided at the same time and seems to the casual observer virtually identical however in van orden v perry breyer submitted an opinion separate from that of the court while in mccreary he did not as a result the van orden case was decided by a plurality not a majority as the other in opening his discussion of reasoning breyer states the case before us is a borderline case it concerns a large granite monument bearing the text of the ten commandments located on the grounds of the texas state capitol on the one hand the commandments text undeniably has a religious message invoking indeed emphasizing the deity on the other hand focusing on the text of the commandments alone cannot conclusively resolve this case rather to determine the message that the text here conveys we must examine how the text is used and that inquiry requires us to consider the context of the display he then goes on to list points which are stated to be insufficient individually but together seem to provide a reasonable basis for secular purpose the monuments year history on the texas state grounds indicates that nonreligious aspects of the tablets message predominate the group that donated the monument the fraternal order of eagles is a private civic and primarily secular organization who while interested in the religious aspect of the ten commandments sought to highlight the commandments role in shaping civic morality as part of that organizations efforts to combat juvenile delinquency the eagles consulted with a committee composed of members of several faiths in order to find a nonsectarian text — an act which underscores the groups ethicsbased motives the tablets as displayed on the monument prominently acknowledge that the eagles donated the display the physical setting of the monument suggests little or nothing of the sacred the monument sits in a large park containing  monuments and  historical markers all designed to illustrate the ideals of those who settled in texas and of those who have lived there since that time the setting does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other religious activity the setting does provide a context of history and moral ideals the larger display together with the displays inscription about its origin communicates to visitors that the state sought to reflect moral principles illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the states citizens historically speaking have endorsed that is to say the context suggests that the state intended the displays moral message — an illustrative message reflecting the historical ideals of texans — to predominate breyer then goes on to state if these factors provide a strong but not conclusive indication that the commandments text on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message a further factor is determinative here as far as i can tell  years passed in which the presence of this monument legally speaking went unchallenged until the single legal objection raised by petitioner and i am not aware of any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation hence those  years suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals whatever their system of beliefs are likely to have understood the monument as amounting in any significantly detrimental way to a government effort to favor a particular religious sect primarily to promote religion over nonreligion to engage in any religious practice to compel any religious practice or to work deterrence of any religious belief schempp  u s at  goldberg j concurring those  years suggest that the public visiting the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage breyer continues to explain a position which seeks to balance between not leading the law to exhibit a hostility toward religion that has no place in our establishment clause of the first amendment traditions and recognizing the danger of the slippery slope and ultimately rests upon a matter of degree which is i believe critical in a borderline case such as this one breyer concludes by stating he cannot agree with the plurality nor with justice scalias dissent in mccreary county v aclu of kentucky but while he does agree with justice oconnors statement of principles in mccreary he disagrees with her evaluation of the evidence as it bears on the applying those principles to van orden v perry stevens dissentedit stevens dissenting opinion essentially stated that in formulating a ruling for this case the court had to consider whether the display had any significant relation to the specific and secular history of the state of texas or the united states as a whole ultimately stevens asserted that the display has no purported connection to gods role in the formation of texas or the founding of our nation     and therefore could not be protected on the basis that it was a display dealing with secular ideals in fact stevens says that the display transmits the message that texas specifically endorses the judeochristian values of the display and thus the display violates the establishment clause see alsoedit list of united states supreme court

prominently acknowledge that the eagles donated the display the physical setting of the monument suggests little or nothing of the sacred the monument sits in a large park containing  monuments and  historical markers all designed to illustrate the ideals of those who settled in texas and of those who have lived there since that time the setting does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other religious activity the setting does provide a context of history and moral ideals the larger display together with the displays inscription about its origin communicates to visitors that the state sought to reflect moral principles illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the states citizens historically speaking have endorsed that is to say the context suggests that the state intended the displays moral message — an illustrative message reflecting the historical ideals of texans — to predominate breyer then goes on to state if these factors provide a strong but not conclusive indication that the commandments text on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message a further factor is determinative here as far as i can tell  years passed in which the presence of this monument legally speaking went unchallenged until the single legal objection raised by petitioner and i am not aware of any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation hence those  years suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals whatever their system of beliefs are likely to have understood the monument as amounting in any significantly detrimental way to a government effort to favor a particular religious sect primarily to promote religion over nonreligion to engage in any religious practice to compel any religious practice or to work deterrence of any religious belief schempp  u s at  goldberg j concurring those  years suggest that the public visiting the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage breyer continues to explain a position which seeks to balance between not leading the law to exhibit a hostility toward religion that has no place in our establishment clause of the first amendment traditions and recognizing the danger of the slippery slope and ultimately rests upon a matter of degree which is i believe critical in a borderline case such as this one breyer concludes by stating he cannot agree with the plurality nor with justice scalias dissent in mccreary county v aclu of kentucky but while he does agree with justice oconnors statement of principles in mccreary he disagrees with her evaluation of the evidence as it bears on the applying those principles to van orden v perry stevens dissentedit stevens dissenting opinion essentially stated that in formulating a ruling for this case the court had to consider whether the display had any significant relation to the specific and secular history of the state of texas or the united states as a whole ultimately stevens asserted that the display has no purported connection to gods role in the formation of texas or the founding of our nation     and therefore could not be protected on the basis that it was a display dealing with secular ideals in fact stevens says that the display transmits the message that texas specifically endorses the judeochristian values of the display and thus the display violates the establishment clause see alsoedit list of united states supreme court

ginsburg dissent oconnor dissent souter joined by stevens ginsburg laws applied us const amend i van orden v perry  us   was a united states supreme court case involving whether a display of the ten commandments on a monument given to the government at the texas state capitol in austin violated the establishment clause of the first amendment in a suit brought by thomas van orden of austin the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit ruled in november  that the displays were constitutional on the grounds that the monument conveyed both a religious and secular message van orden appealed and in october  the high court agreed to hear the case at the same time as it heard mccreary county v aclu of kentucky a similar case challenging a display of the ten commandments at two county courthouses in kentucky the appeal of the th circuits decision was argued by erwin chemerinsky a constitutional law scholar and the alston  bird professor of law at duke university school of law who represented van orden on a pro bono basis texas case was argued by texas attorney general greg abbott an amicus curiae was presented on behalf of the respondents the state of texas by thensolicitor general paul clement the supreme court ruled on june   by a vote of  to  that the display was constitutional the court chose not to employ the popular lemon test in its analysis reasoning that the display at issue was a passive monument instead the court looked to the nature of the monument and    our nation’s history chief justice william rehnquist delivered the plurality opinion of the court justice stephen breyer concurred in the judgment but wrote separately the similar case of mccreary county v aclu of kentucky was handed down the same day with the opposite result

backgroundedit ten commandments monument at the texas state capitol the monument challenged was feet high and feet wide was placed in  it was donated to the state of texas by the fraternal order of eagles a civic organization with the support of cecil b demille who had directed the film the ten commandments the state accepted the monument and selected a site for it based on the recommendation of the state agency responsible for maintaining the capitol grounds the donating organization paid for its erection two state legislators presided over the dedication of the monument the monument was erected on the capitol grounds behind the capitol building between the texas capitol and supreme court buildings the surrounding  acres  m² contained  monuments and  historical markers commemorating the people ideals and events that compose texan identity plurality opinionedit the plurality opinion stated that the monument was constitutional as it represented historical value and not purely religious value the primary content is the text of the ten commandments an eagle grasping the american flag an eye inside of a pyramid and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the ten commandments below the text are two stars of david and the superimposed greek letters chi and rho which represent christ the bottom of the monument bears the inscription presented to the people and youth of texas by the fraternal order of eagles of texas  below the above matter and the title the ten commandments the monuments text reads in full i am the lord thy god thou shalt have no other gods before me thou shalt not make to thyself any graven images thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain remember the sabbath day to keep it holy honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou shalt not kill thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor thou shalt not covet thy neighbors house thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his cattle nor anything that is thy neighbors thomas van orden challenged the constitutionality of the monument a native texan van orden passed by the monument frequently when he would go to the texas supreme court building to use its law library breyers concurrenceedit monument with state capitol in background breyers concurrence in this case is made all the more interesting because on the surface it appears that he voted quite differently in the mccreary county v aclu of kentucky a case which was heard and decided at the same time and seems to the casual observer virtually identical however in van orden v perry breyer submitted an opinion separate from that of the court while in mccreary he did not as a result the van orden case was decided by a plurality not a majority as the other in opening his discussion of reasoning breyer states the case before us is a borderline case it concerns a large granite monument bearing the text of the ten commandments located on the grounds of the texas state capitol on the one hand the commandments text undeniably has a religious message invoking indeed emphasizing the deity on the other hand focusing on the text of the commandments alone cannot conclusively resolve this case rather to determine the message that the text here conveys we must examine how the text is used and that inquiry requires us to consider the context of the display he then goes on to list points which are stated to be insufficient individually but together seem to provide a reasonable basis for secular purpose the monuments year history on the texas state grounds indicates that nonreligious aspects of the tablets message predominate the group that donated the monument the fraternal order of eagles is a private civic and primarily secular organization who while interested in the religious aspect of the ten commandments sought to highlight the commandments role in shaping civic morality as part of that organizations efforts to combat juvenile delinquency the eagles consulted with a committee composed of members of several faiths in order to find a nonsectarian text — an act which underscores the groups ethicsbased motives the tablets as displayed on the monument prominently acknowledge that the eagles donated the display the physical setting of the monument suggests little or nothing of the sacred the monument sits in a large park containing  monuments and  historical markers all designed to illustrate the ideals of those who settled in texas and of those who have lived there since that time the setting does not readily lend itself to meditation or any

state sought to reflect moral principles illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the states citizens historically speaking have endorsed that is to say the context suggests that the state
