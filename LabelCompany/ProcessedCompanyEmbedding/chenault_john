world search leadership american express ceo kenneth chenault valuing eq over iq nov   executive education north america twitter facebook linkedin google email print comment quote twitter facebook linkedin google email print comment quote supports kws leadership content when kenneth chenault first came to american express more than  years ago as a young executive just off a twoandahalf year consulting stint at bain  company he looked around and saw an opportunity in the corporation’s struggling merchandising group the person overseeing that group and the rest of travel related services at the time was louis v gerstner jr who later went on to become ceo of rjr nabisco and then ibm gerstner advised chenault against getting involved with the offshoot business selling jewelry stereo equipment and other odds and ends by direct mail to american express customers in fact said gerstner he was ready to shut the whole enterprise down “‘do not take this job’ lou told me over and over” chenault now the chairman and ceo of american express said during a recent wharton leadership lecture “but i said ‘lou i want to take on a challenge’ i never shied away from taking a risk and i felt this was the way i should go” “my view is often to take on the assignments that no one else wants particularly early on in a career” –kenneth chenault as chenault started work he looked around for what he called “the best and the brightest” available to him at american express he realized that because the division was a neglected part of the corporation he would get experience in all aspects of that business “something they would never have let some yearold just out of the consulting business do otherwise my view is often to take on the assignments that no one else wants particularly early on in a career everyone wants to be in the glamorous part of a business i wanted to learn” in the two years that chenault ran merchant services it went from an albatross to a profit center its revenues more than tripling from  million to  million gerstner finally insisted chenault join the credit card side of the corporation and a leadership star was born “leadership takes many forms but one thing that is most important is to realize that change is inevitable especially in the age we live in now and that you always have to be adaptable to change” noted chenault he emphasized that american express itself was hardly a glamorous company when it started in  it was the original company henry wells william g fargo and john butterfield founded to move freight “moving freight was not a business with a lot of glamour” he said “but they instituted core values that we still hold  years later in our daytoday operations — integrity and customer commitment… it is pretty extraordinary that a freight company founded in  established a brand that remains relevant in  in the digital age” chenault took over as ceo in  after a series of jobs that he held for  years at the company it was unusual for an african american to reach the top of an american corporation but chenault has never felt his race either qualified him for a position or prevented him from getting it he said he just had confidence in himself as a leader and went about his work methodically never backbiting and always seeking advice even from executives who might have been competitors knowledgewharton high school “i really did not focus on becoming a ceo until around  years before it happened but i worked with people who could be viewed as competition and worked well with them” he stated “i had straightforward conversations with them and said ‘let us focus on what is best for the company’ i thought by doing that everything would work out for the best” when he became ceo the top  executives in the employee company all stayed on although over time some left for other positions identifying good leaders chenault described his leadership style as both simple and complex the simple part he said is that he feels he has kept his integrity that he has never tried to fool anyone and that he has been consistent in his goals to serve that traditional triumvirate of customers employees and shareholders he is constantly looking for good leaders in his company he does not evaluate whether someone is a leader until he sees who that person’s followers are “who is listening to them how many people respect him” said chenault referring to the questions he asks of young leaders in particular mostly he added that is demonstrated when someone is both decisive and compassionate chenault oversaw a restructuring of american express’s business in  as vice chairman when it became clear he would have to eliminate nearly  jobs he said decided to tell people up to  months before their actual departure date so that they would have time to adjust to the layoffs “you do what you can to be compassionate even when the news is bad” chenault said which leads to another of his leadership principles — that the leader himself has to be a team player “the point is not to just be a nice person but be effective too sometimes being a team player is using what i call constructive confrontation be courteous but push forward on what needs to be done” although chenault said he does not devalue intellect — after all he went to bowdoin college one of the nation’s best liberal arts schools and harvard law school — what he values more than iq is eq — executional quotient “a good leader wants to get it done” he said “eq is the most important thing — to have the focus to get whatever the job at hand is completed” he believes leadership can indeed be taught and while american express does not have formal leadership training chenault hopes to teach by his own example for instance he likes to not only get consultations from his higher executives but values feedback from every part of the company “i reach down to all levels any employee who sends me a question i respond it may not be  lines but something and if people know you can be approached they will come to you that creates a positive attitude about the company” several times a year he will go to different parts of the country and world and hold brown bag lunches with about  employees none of them senior executives “the physical presence of a leader is important it shows the organization no matter how large cares about its employees “i ask them only one thing that when they leave the meeting tell  people about it” he said “i don’t care if they say ‘ken is a jerk’ because at least it brings a connection it is impossible to maintain a relationship with  people but i don’t believe in the imperial ceo the best organizations create thousands of leaders” two role models chenault admires a number of leaders but pointed to two favorites nelson mandela and warren buffett the most important thing he has learned from mandela is that even when you are in a crisis you have to think about the future “here was someone in prison who came out a stronger person” noted chenault “it was not just about survival he thought about the vision of what he wanted the country to become it is hard to see anyone in modern history who came out from prison” such a hero “sometimes being a team player is using what i call constructive confrontation” –kenneth chenault he said he doesn’t admire buffett just because he owns  of american express through berkshire hathaway “he is someone who has an intellectual curiosity and is also incredibly genuine as a person” said chenault “he admits that he loves business but he also engages with people he can walk down the street in omaha or new york and will talk to people tell a joke sign a dollar bill for them he has humanity and a steel trap mind he has a nice swift way to say ‘no’ — not in a harsh way but in a way that does not waste people’s time” chenault’s favorite quote about leadership is one he attributes to napoleon “the role of a leader is to define reality and give hope” it is really difficult he said to find out the facts of a situation and to understand the ultimate implications “you have to be open and honest to find reality to get the right answers to your questions but then you have to tell the people you lead what the reasons are to be hopeful to tell them why you should inspire them “this is all easy in good times but it is a dealbreaker during challenging times and that is when you find out who the leader is” he noted “the reputations of individual leaders are truly made or lost in times of crisis you must gain loyalty by being decisive and compassionate otherwise your reputation will vanish” supports kws leadership content citing knowledgewharton close for personal use please use the following citations to quote for personal use mla

alec if sothis belies much of what mr chenault claims ae is doing ryan hunter intriguing retrospective on a remarkable career warren has always spoken fondly of kenneth during shareholder meetings he refers to him as an “excellent manager” noting his execution and longterm total returns – in a similar manner as warren refers to tony nicely of geico i’m particularly fond of kenneth’s approach to spreading employeetoemployee connections across an organization “i ask them only one thing that when they leave the meeting tell  people about it” i’d personally like to hear kenneth describe a time in his career when he was at conflict with his own eq desire for execution a time when his hands were tied either due to circumstances inside or outside of his control how did he break the cycle and move forward inevitably this will occur for many of us in the course of our careers the inspiration would be invaluable warm regards phillip cesaretti sir i am a very disgruntled customer but not for very long  as i get older the words sorry and apologize are a part of just about every conversation especially on the telephone or while chatting on the web i call it the cowards plan book no matter what happens those two words can solve anything i called “american” express customer service first i was in mexico city then after requesting an american then i was in india   minutes on the telephone i was informed by ashima badge   that an investigation was being done pertaining to my request today technology is at warp speed but the employees are still working on the wheel  thank you sir and good day william smith as a footnote to mr chennault’s leadership skills with american express i would like to add a comment about the remarkable margin that unauthorized purchases made on cardholder’s behalf for  appointment calendars  cookbooks – available elsewhere for  et al shows rare business acumen and unscrupulous daring required in st century business leadership if i were bold enough to choose my clients’ purchases make those purchases without their permission and charge usurious rates on the purchase price i personally chose perhaps i too could breathe the rarefied air of those with a fleet of gulfstream’s at my disposal knowledgewharton partners view all partners partner collaborations become a content partner microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of
