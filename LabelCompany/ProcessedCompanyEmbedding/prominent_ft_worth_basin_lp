and slate strata along the eastern flank of the ouachitas the fort worth basin and bend arch lie entirely within north central texas covering an area of  square miles  km the southern and eastern boundaries are defined by county lines that generally follow the ouachita structural front although a substantial portion of this structural feature is included near dallas the north boundary follows the texasoklahoma state line in the east where the province includes parts of the sherman basin and muenster arch in the west the north boundary follows the northeast county lines of oklahomas three southwestern counties harmon jackson and tillman counties which include the south flank of the wichita mountains and the hollis basin the western boundary trends northsouth along county lines defining

to the north and the bend and lampasas arches along the central part of province  along the east portion is an area that includes the eastern shelf and concho arch collectively known as the concho platform the mineral wells fault runs northeastsouthwest through palo pinto parker wise denton counties and joins with the newark east fault system the fault system bisects the newark east field nef creating a zone of poor production in barnett shale gas reservoirs several faults that cut basement and lower paleozoic rocks in the southern part of the province are identified at the ordovician ellenburger group stratigraphic level these faults and associated structures formed during development of the llano uplift and fort worth basin with faulting ending by the early missourian tectonic historyedit fort worth basinedit evolution of the fort worth basin and bend arch structures are critical to understanding burial histories and hydrocarbon generation the asymmetrical wedgeshaped fort worth basin is a peripheral paleozoic foreland basin with about  feet  m of strata preserved in its deepest northeast portion and adjacent to the muenster arch and ouachita structural belt the basin resembles other basins of the ouachita structural belt such as the black warrior arkoma val verde and marfa basins that formed in front of the advancing ouachita structural belt as it was thrust onto the margin of north america thrusting occurred during a late paleozoic episode of plate convergence bend archedit the bend arch extends north from the llano uplift it is a broad subsurface northplunging positive structure the arch formed as a hingeline by downwarping of its eastern flank due to subsidence of the fort worth basin during early stages of development of the ouachita structural belt in the late mississippian and west tilting in the late paleozoic which formed the midland basin there is disagreement on the structural history of the bend arch flippen  suggested it acted as a fulcrum and is a flexure and structural high and that only minor uplift occurred in the area to form an erosional surface on the chesterage limestones that were deposited directly on top of the barnett in contrast cloud and barnes  suggested periodic upwarp of the bend flexure from midordovician through early pennsylvanian time resulted in several unconformities the red river arch and the muenster arch also became dominant structural features during the late mississippian and early pennsylvanian general stratigraphyedit hydrocarbon production from ordovician mississippian and early pennsylvanian rocks is mostly from carbonate rock reservoirs whereas production in the midpennsylvanian through lowpermian is mostly from clastic rock reservoirs the sedimentary section in the fort worth basin is underlain by precambrian granite and diorite cambrian rocks include granite conglomerate sandstones and shale that are overlain by marine carbonate rocks and shale no production has been reported from cambrian rocks the silurian devonian jurassic and triassic are absent in the fort worth basin from cambrian to mississippian time the fort worth basin area was part of a stable cratonic shelf with deposition dominated by carbonates ellenburger group carbonate rocks represent a broad epeiric carbonate platform covering most of texas during the early ordovician a pronounced drop in sea level sometime between late ordovician and mississippian time resulted in prolonged platform exposure this erosional event removed any silurian and devonian rocks post viola limestone unconformity that may have been present barnett shale was deposited over the resulting unconformity provenance of the terrigenous material that constitutes the barnett shale was from ouachita thrust sheets and the reactivation of older structures such as the muenster arch postbarnett deposition continued without interruption as a sequenced of extremely hard and dense limestones were laid down these limestones have often been confused with the lower part of the overlying marble falls formation and they have never been formally named in the literature since the underlying barnett is generally assumed to be late mississippian chester in age the superposed carbonates are often referred to informally as the chester limestones clastic rocks of provenance similar to the barnett dominate the pennsylvanian part of the stratigraphic section in the bend arch–fort worth basin with progressive subsidence of the basin during the pennsylvanian the western basin hinge line and carbonate shelf continued migrating west deposition of thick basinal clastic rocks of the atoka strawn and canyon formations occurred at this time these mid and late pennsylvanian rocks consist mostly of sandstones and conglomerates with fewer and thinner limestone beds petroleum production historyedit hydrocarbon shows were first encountered in province  during the midnineteenth century while drilling water wells sporadic exploration began following the civil war and the first commercial oil discoveries occurred in the early s in  discovery of ranger field stimulated one of the largest exploration and development booms in texas ranger field produces from the atokabend formation a sandstoneconglomerate reservoir that directly overlies the barnett formation operators drilled more than  wildcats in and around the fort worth basin attempting to duplicate the success of ranger these wildcat efforts resulted in the discovery of more fields and production from numerous other reservoirs including strawn fluvialdeltaic sandstone atokabend fluvialdeltaic sandstone and conglomerate marble falls carbonate bank limestone barnett siliceous shale and ellenburger dolomitic limestone by  the province reached a mature stage of exploration and development as demonstrated by the high density and distribution of well penetrations and production wells oil and lesser amounts of gas are found throughout the paleozoic section but most hydrocarbons consist of oil in pennsylvanian reservoirs province  is among the more active drilling areas during the resurgence of us drilling which began after the opec oil embargo it has consistently appeared on the list of the  most active provinces in terms of wells completed and footage drilled  oil wells and  gas wells were drilled and completed in this area from  to  cumulative production in province  from conventional reservoirs prior to the  usgs assessment was  billion barrels × m of oil  trillion cubic feet × m of gas and  million

pennsylvanian and include dark finegrained carbonate rock and shale units within the marble falls limestone and the black shale facies of the smithwickatoka shale the barnett shale was deposited over much of northcentral texas however because of postdepositional erosion the present distribution of barnett is limited to province  the barnett shale is over  feet  m thick along the southwest flank of the muenster arch it is eroded in areas along the red riverelectra and muenster arches to the north the llano uplift to the south where it outcrops and the easternmost portion of the province where the barnett laps onto the eastern shelfconcho platform average total organic carbon toc content in the barnett shale is about  and toc is as high as  in samples from outcrops along the llano uplift on the south flank of the fort worth basin it has geochemical characteristics similar to other devonianmississippian black shales found elsewhere in the us eg woodford bakken new albany and chattanooga formations these black shales all contain oilprone organic matter type ii kerogen based on hydrogen indices above  milligrams of hydrocarbons per gram of toc and generate a similar type of high quality oil low sulfur  api gravity although kerogen cracking decomposition is a source of oil and gas from the barnett shale the principal source of gas in the newark east field is from cracking of oil and bitumen thermal maturityedit low maturation levels in the barnett shale at vitrinite reflectance ro estimated at  yield oils of ° api gravity in brown county oils found in shackelford throckmorton and callahan counties as well as in montague county are derived from barnett shale at the middle of the zone of oil generation oil window thermal maturities levels ≈ ro although condensate is associated with gas production in wise county barnett source rock maturity is generally  ro or greater the zone of wet gas generation is in the  ro range whereas the primary zone of dry gas generation main gas window begins at a ro of  thermal maturity of barnett shale can also be derived from toc and rockeval tmax measurements although tmax is not very reliable for high maturity kerogens due to poor pyrolysis peak yields and peak shape the extent of kerogen transformation can be utilized for example barnett shale having a  toc and a hydrogen index of less than  is in the wet or dry gas windows with equivalent ro values greater than  toc in contrast low maturity barnett shale from lampasas county outcrops have initial toc values averaging about  with hydrocarbon potentials averaging  by volume a good average value for barnett shale is derived from the mitcham  well in brown county where toc is  and hydrocarbon potential is  by volume using these data we can determine toc values will decrease  during maturation from the immature stage to the gasgeneration window samples from the t p simms well in the newark east gasproducing area have average toc values of  but greater than  of the organic matter is converted to hydrocarbons thus its original toc was about  with an initial estimated potential of  by volume any oil generated would be expelled into shallow or deeper horizons as in the west and north or cracked to gas where measured vitrinite reflectance is above  ro hydrocarbon generationedit the barnett shale is thermally mature for hydrocarbon generation over most of its area barnett source rock is presently in the oilgeneration window along the north and west parts of the province and in the gas window on the east half of the barnettpaleozoic tps expulsion of highquality oil from the barnett was episodic and began at low ro   thermal maturity thirtytwo oils from wise and jack counties were analyzed to determine the characteristics of the generating source rock api gravity and sulfur content were integrated with highresolution gas chromatography gc and gas chromatographymass spectrometry gcms analyses the api gravity of the oils ranges from ° to ° and sulfur contents are low  which is characteristic of high thermal maturity oils biomarkers from gcms analyses show oils were sourced from marine shale based on sterane distribution and the presence of diasteranes carbon isotopic analyses of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions support hydrocarbon generation from a singlesource unit in the main gasproducing area of fractured barnett shale the gas generation window is along a trend subparallel to the ouachita thrust front jarvie  reported the british thermal unit btu content of barnett gas is directly proportional to ro levels reservoir rocksedit reservoir rocks include clastic and carbonate rocks ranging in age from ordovician to early permian most production from conventional reservoirs is from pennsylvanian rocks whereas the only recognized production from unconventional accumulations is from mississippian fractured barnett shale and early pennsylvanian atokan fractured marble falls limestone conglomerate of the pennsylvanian bend group is the main producing reservoir in the boonsville bend field with cumulative production through  exceeding  trillion cubic feet × m of gas oil sourced from barnett shale is produced from numerous reservoir rocks in the bend arch–fort worth basin including barnett shale caddo formation canyon group chappel limestone bend group and ellenburger group seal rocksedit seal rocks in the barnettpaleozoic tps are mostly shale units and dense low permeability carbonate rock that are distributed on both regional and local scales barnett shale is a major regional seal for older reservoirs mostly porous carbonate rock reservoirs of the ellenburger group production from barnett shale is largely dependent on the presence or absence of marble falls and viola limestones although these formations are not considered seal rocks in areas where they are tight and not water wet they serve as barriers confining hydraulicinduced fracturing frac barriers and help retain formation pressures during well stimulation trapsedit traps for conventional hydrcocarbon accumulations are mostly stratigraphic for carbonate rock reservoirs and both structural and stratigraphic in clasticrock reservoirs combination structural and stratigraphic traps are also common in pennsylvanian sandstone reservoirs stratigraphic traps in carbonate rocks result from a combination of facies and depositional topography erosion updip pinchout of facies and diagenetically controlled enhancedpermeability and porosity zones a good example of a carbonate stratigraphic trap is the pinnacle reef traps of the chappel limestone where local porous grainstone and packstone are restricted to isolated buildups or reef clusters on lowrelief paleotopography of the eroded ellenburger group chappel pinnacle reefs are draped and sealed by the overlying barnett shale stratigraphic traps in pennsylvanian atoka sandstones and conglomerates are mainly pinch outs related to facies changes or erosional truncation fractured barnett shaleedit highquality ° api gravity low sulfur oil is produced from barnett shale in the provinces north and western portions where it exhibits low thermal maturity ro ≈  similar quality oils ° api gravity and condensates associated with gas are produced in wise county where the barnett is of higher thermal maturity gas production is from hydraulically fractured black siliceous shale calorific values of gases from nef commonly range between  btu the barnetts main producing facies is a black organicrich siliceous shale with a mean composition of about  quartz  clay mostly illitesmectite and illite  carbonate calcite dolomite and siderite  feldspar  pyrite and  toc average porosity in the productive portions is about  and matrix permeability is measured in nanodarcies three assessment units have been proposed for the barnett shale continuous accumulations each with different geologic and production characteristics a nef gas sweet spot where the barnett is siliceous thick within the gas generation window slightly overpressured and enclosed by dense tight overlying marble falls limestone and underlying viola limestone and simpson group as frac barriers an outlying area where the barnett is within the gasgeneration window but the subcrop is the porous ellenburger and the overlying marble falls limestone barrier may be absent and an area of lesser potential where overlying and underlying barriers may be absent and production includes oil and gas from fractured barnett shale the siliceous nature of the barnett shale and its relation to fracture enhancement in nef was noted by lancaster also the second assessment unit where the barnett shale subcrop is ellenburger group carbonate rocks is being tested by several operators the units resource potential unit will be guided by the results of current testing with directional wells and various completion methods to determine optimum completion techniques for gas recovery historically

in eur in barnett wells is the result of improved geologic and engineering concepts that guide development of the barnett continuous gas play moreover recompletion of wells after about five years of

pennsylvanian and include dark finegrained carbonate rock and shale units within the marble falls limestone and the black shale facies of the smithwickatoka shale the barnett shale was deposited over much of northcentral texas however because of postdepositional erosion the present distribution of barnett is limited to province  the barnett shale is over  feet  m thick along the southwest flank of

rocks in the barnettpaleozoic tps are mostly shale units and dense low permeability carbonate rock that are distributed on both regional and local scales barnett shale is a major regional seal for

barriers an outlying area where the barnett is within the gasgeneration window but the subcrop is the porous ellenburger and the overlying marble falls limestone barrier may be absent and an area of lesser potential where overlying and underlying barriers may be absent and production includes oil and gas from fractured barnett shale the siliceous nature of the barnett shale and its relation to fracture enhancement in nef was noted by lancaster also the second assessment unit where the barnett shale subcrop is ellenburger group carbonate rocks is being tested by several operators the units

worth basin  landman leases mineral domain chain of title operators producers information guidelines drilling tceq epa requirements  wwwthebarnettshalecom     the fort worth basin    the fort worth basin is the footprint of an ancient ocean   the barnett shale is the organic structure this ancient ocean leaves behind proving that this areas was flooded and in fact an ocean that existed at three different times flooding out this area now known as the fort worth basin  the barnett shale is a natural gas source bed rock that stretches over  to  north texas counties and is still actively being discovered  its   squaremile reservoir is already the second largest producing onshore domestic natural gas field in the united states after the san juan basin in new mexico and colorado at three different times spread out by  million years texas was actually a shallow ocean that stretched up the central plains and even carried up into and through canada  the first  feet of ocean is considered the photo eukaric zone since light can penetrate the first  feet  with light and heat being a factor in this shallow body of water we can assume these oceans had a huge phytoplankton and zooplankton population and with that massive coral reef beds were created by filtering the massive plankton population  this was the environment in most of texas some  to  million years ago as the ocean came in and out at least three different times in the fort worth basin  the barnett shale gas field was discovered by wildcatters in the early s who were pioneering the conglomerate marble falls pregnant shale and strawn zones the technology to produce from the barnett shale did not evolve until  this is the first area in the entire world where we are pioneering the art of producing natural gas from a source bed rock and it is alive and anaerobic  chris sanders has revolutionized the art of turning co into oxygen and natural gas while simultaneously reducing co in the atmosphere the result is the first circle of life between our ecosystem and the petroleum anaerobic bacterial world the vast majority of the industry is unconcerned with the oxygen output co reduction or the circle of life instead an industry wide success rate of  and  of the nations natural gas supply make this field the most active onshore drilling play in the united states contact chris at chrissandersyahoocom texas environmental energy group inc  teeg  in fact in every other area of the world every drop of oil and natural gas has already escaped from the source and has been actively working its way on up to the surface only to be trapped by structure and horizons of geological time zones  in these upper production zones a degree of permeability and porosity must exist so that we can produce from the formation  the barnett shale has almost no porosity and no permeability which was the reason why until now source bed rocks have not been produced from  therefore it is safe to say that these explorers will spread their knowledge of source bed rock stimulation and production throughout the world so what is going on here in texas is extremely different because every operator and producer here is a pioneer in the most advanced cutting edge and active play in the world shale consists of very fine grained particles of quartz and clay minerals  it is consolidated mud that has been deposited in lakes seas inland oceans and other similar environments  about  forty five  percent of all exposed sedimentary rocks are shales  organic sedimentary rocks are formed from organic debris  it is the deposit of onceliving organisms all collected and sealed into a medley of what once was shells corals calcareous algae wood plants bones etc  although they are a form of clastic rock organic rocks tend to contain a larger amount of immaculately preserved fossils which laid down near the place where the animal coral plant or plankton once lived   as the rocky mountains formed several separate ocean beds were created in the state of texas and are identified as the delaware basin the permian basin and the fort worth basin the barnett shale is in the fort worth basin and because of its maturity and age we are able to frackture and produce from this blanket formation the permian basin sets an example from its exploration history and research being from coral reef beds itself  the word frack is used as a term out on the oil patch that describes our ability to frackture and stimulate zones horizontally by creating new channels and areas while increasing the porosity and permeability of an area out side of the production pipe we have just perforated  perforating is shooting through the production casing and into our zone  in this case the barnett shale zone is the organic settlement of life itself proving the theories of oceans ice ages volcanoes and meteorite impacts  however this field is completely different in many aspects  this ancient shallow ocean in which the barnett shale is believed to be divided in two zones the upper and lower barnett shale by producing and reviewing logs in the primary core of the barnett shale i have noticed three zones this proves three flooding events  under the primary core and three layers you will find a thick layer of obsidian obsidian is a blackish translucent glass this is probably the result of a meteorite impact in conjunction with several triggered volcanic eruptions which then caused the ice ages and eventually the oceans  the first two ocean occurrences were closer together in time and defined as the lower zone the third one spanned at least  million years later which is now called the upper zone   time zones are geologically missing from this shale area which perplexes others as to what happened to this time frame in the barnett shale  my only assumption is that the oceans continually existed in this time and either eroded or absorbed the span of these missing formations  we have three faults and three times that the ocean came in and out of the fort worth basin spread out over  million years we also have three vertical faults in the shale  unlike most formations these barnett shale faults are areas to avoid because they are incapable of producing any gas or form of production such as the muenster arch basin fault zone   add plate tectonic action and  million more years for maturity and we have our current situation today at the core area of the barnett shale we find the third zone in this shale which is the existence of the first ocean sediment itself also in this lower level there is more maturity and higher levels of gas and condensate with a higher btu british thermal unit rating obsidian is found underneath this third layer proving some meteorite and volcanic activity before the creation of these oceans  the northern and older part of the barnett shale between denton and decatur produces a higher btu rating as we follow the shale south to fort worth the btu drops to btu  i have noticed that some operators are only successful in certain areas and most of this has to do with their frack techniques in conjunction with either the low btu or high btu areas co stimulation is what i would scientifically recommend to induce breathing in an anaerobic organic environment major oil companies have decided to concentrate in different areas of this shale and even other new shale discoveries because of their different frackturing techniques beliefs discoveries and abilities by inducing the anaerobic environment with co we stimulate oxygen and natural gas  we can then separate the natural gas into hydrogen and co we then use the hydrogen and return the co to the anaerobic bacteria environment to produce more oxygen and more natural gas the result is the first major circle of life between our ecosystem and sustainable natural gas production in the barnett shale the reason for failure in the barnett shale play is simple  spacing and depth are the essentials in producing from this zone  a fine layer of obsidian covers the ellenberger zone which must be watched and avoided  acre spacing seems to be a common norm for safety in vertical wells  if a well hits the ellenberger it will produce water and we consider the well killed  horizontal wells require at least  times the normal spacing  problems if one of the fracktures goes into the ellenberger zone which is below the barnett shale then all of the gas will follow the path of least resistance and flow into the ellenberger zone which is mainly water here in this area  certain new companies have learned how to find this gas now trapped in the ellenberger and are working on a purification process which extracts all of the gases and precious metals from the water some of the water will be used to maintain the water level of lake bridgeport what is creating all of this gas and why is it considered a source bed rock  the shale is basically compacted organic composition and living at a high temperature  inside this compacted shale we find that it has life and that there is anaerobic bacteria feeding on a decomposed coral reef shale producing gas  the bacteria i believe lives in an anaerobic environment and can be stimulated with co the bacteria in turn is stimulated and literally excretes methane  however the rock is so dense that a lot of the gas stays trapped uniformly perfect and even in the rock  what happens with this other gas that leaves through the surface of the shale  it rises and is trapped in other structures and feeds other zones such as the conglomerate  most of these zones were discovered before we discovered the shale because we did not go deeper  the barnet shale is about at  to  feet deep along highway  in between denton and decatur texas  we know that the ocean   ellenberger is at around    here the inorganic theory suggests that petroleum can come from an inorganic or nonliving source this theory has failed to produce a single drop of oil or natural gas  the barnett shale is  percent organic and produced from an organic source  an old dead ocean it is like having a huge anaerobic digester trapped miles deep and if maintained correctly could last indefinitely  i use the earth itself as an anaerobic digester much like the one below  but instead of building a container at the surface  i use the shale very much in the same fashion except    deep  truthfully many cities could take advantage of this same principle using large carsts or caverns in connection with the cities sewage systems  the results would immediately produce usable gas just like we are doing in the shale  look at the anaerobic digester below using cotton hulls it can power over  homes in texas talk about a use for waste the united states geological survey estimates that the entire barnett shale field contains  trillion cubic feet of gas  estimates of the size of barnett shales reserves are rapidly increasing the field is starting to make a big impact on the nations gas business at a time of declining domestic production and projections of rising demand gas executives predict that the current production of  billion cubic feet a day   percent of the national output  has the potential to climb to  billion to  billion cubic feet a day in a few years  new discoveries in the outer fringes of the shale define as what mr jim leatherwood calls the paleo landscape this term correctly defines the reason for success and failure due to the result of the ancient oceans floor and channel contour the paleo landscape is now the wildcatters frontier in the barnett shale  questions and concerns  extremely high gas pressures leak into shallow to deep fresh ground water fields  the problem  the annulus in between the production casing and the earth  dirt or ground itself creates a passageway for gas to escape into different horizons  gas can work its way up a small channel that can develop in between the production casing and the dirt we call this channel the annulus this channel can grow because of extreme lower gas zone pressures and poison large shallow fresh water reserves  is there a solution  yes  in artesia new mexico they noticed a great natural resource early on with their artesian fresh water springs  they did not want to contaminate their naturally carbonated water  so they cement around the pipe the whole way down destroying the annulus  yes its more expensive but water is really more of a precious resource than gas the interstate i e was the edge of this ocean and as a result it is the edge of the barnett shale zone  a history of the drilling activity teaches us that the primary zone of this barnett shale is in between denton and decatur texas stretching down to fort worth texas  we know that the zone is thicker and richer in natural gas the further north in the barnett shale and has a higher btu rating  and the further south towards fort worth we find a btu rating    unlike other source beds we have learned to avoid the fault lines that exist because they do not produce gas and are accurately mapped by geo map on active production in the area   frank dux the legendary world champion martial arts bloodsport  kumite master is using money from the barnett shale to save the rainforests and children throughout the world  the three men run dux inc and are asian ambassadors for the clean world wide water plan  the plan combines solar panels and wind generators which feed water dehumidifiers for constant clean water and constant hydrogen energy these three men not only hold the key to world wide freedom but they educate everyone about the answer to save everyone by providing clean water to every child animal crop and city throughout the world by using the sun the wind and commercial dehumidifiers together as the sustainable solution  the water extracted in the atmosphere is the cleanest water ever tested according to the environmental protection agency epa  the cost of water extraction is free because of sustainable integration solar  wind the results are the keys to world wide freedom and peace  the technology is the exact reverse of what is done in the barnett shale to stimulate anaerobic life the most interesting thing about this barnett shale is how solid it is  typically when we measure for permeability or porosity we calculate in darceys as a form of measurement  however in the barnett shale we calculate our porosity and permeability in anchstroms or shall i say atomic measure  this means that the shale is so tight that gas has a hard time escaping it  drilling through the shale is like drilling through a brunswick pool table or bowling ball  yet we find several interesting factors in the shale itself such as micro fractures that travel from the north east to the southwest  we use these micro fractures when we horizontally drill to utilize the structure in combination with the multi stage frac job  halliburton has several multi frac techniques that will literally amaze you  using micro radio transmission devices and special fluids the company is literally able to follow each fracture in amazing detail you get what you pay for and horizontal frac jobs can go easily between  and  million  devon itself claims that the work itself is very costly and still an educational process  james hall of devon is leading the industry in horizontal production discoveries and results many smaller operators are experiencing the same dramatic results using standard old vertical techniques and open hole completions open hole completions  yes you heard me right  the shale is so very solid that it is more stable than what we could put down there and it allows us to cover more area  the trick in developing this field is spacing   acres seems to be a safe space for wells in the barnett shale  many of the majors have killed off some of their nearby wells by drilling to close or having a huge horizontal with a bad frack job cross flood the area  the trick in this field is not finding the zone  its not getting greedy  if you pass the barnett shale you have entered the ocean you hit the ocean you ruined your project  engineers be ready to spot obsidian which covers the ellenberger zone the zone you must avoid  if a nearby well hits the ocean and has fractured into your zone that well has just ruined your production region that gas will shoot out into the ocean instead of up your hole george mitchell pioneered the lower barnett shale and devon has seen its capital gain merely by perforating the upper zones in their existing wells  however i believe a majority of their wells were slim hole completed making a rework not an option  nevertheless this company holds about  of the barnett shale and its oil and gas leases by production  the story of this barnett shale and its production evolution actually began with the early texas wildcatters that discovered the area and defined the conglomerate   the most successful wildcatter in texas history is my father cw sanders ° with a wildcat success rate of  in the days before advanced  d seismic technology  he used two very conventional methods for drilling success one he coined lineology whereas you would draw a straight line between two good wells and create a location  the other involved taking off into the air which was common for us back in the seventies and eighties and then spotting a location from a birds eye perspective which then led to us chasing the cattle off of some dirt road in the middle of nowhere before  making a location  he is an amazing pilot and would fly high in the sky to get a birds eye view which allowed him to examine the remains of the prehistoric oceans that once covered the lands and since all natural gas and oil comes from the remains of these dead prehistoric oceans this gave us a perfect view because from up above you can see the fault lines and where the ocean edges existed at different times he discovered the outer most fringes of these ocean channels later defined as the conglomerate zone which he revealed were fed by an organic source today it is called the barnett shale this picture was taken in  in the back stands texas legendary golden wildcatter cw sanders as he discovered evidence of this barnett shale in his logs  the kid in the picture is me  years ago and even at this age i had witnessed my father drill countless successful wildcat wells even in areas now considered to be the core of the barnett shale  even then my father was questioning ways to produce from this zone  however because of production technology at the time and  returns we stimulated zones which were higher in porosity and permeability  something that the barnett shale does not have so we produced the gas that had already escaped the barnett shale  trapped under structure and ready to burst  this conglomerate zone was an exciting early discovery that was ready to be produced and defined  chris this barnett shale is the source bed rock for natural gas  my father has been saying this since  cw sanders with his son chris sanders back in the seventies chris sanders with his son eden sanders in  my son eden sanders will be learning the ropes from me making us three generations in oil and gas production currently  we are exploring four other shale discoveries in two other areas of texas and in colorado and oklahoma   if you are using internet explorer and happen to hear the music on this page it is my piano music  i hope you enjoy it if you have a new lease or acreage available and would like to have it reviewed for our projects or modified for any reason such as surface sentimental reasons please email chrissandersyahoocom or landmanlonestarnaturalgascom  please include the county acreage abstract numbers and previous leases if any   if you have minerals or are able to execute an oil  gas lease in the barnett shale please contact us as there are many oil and gas companies ready to drill in this highly active and successful area currently i am working on expanding the barnett shale to the north in wise and montague and to the west in jack and palo pinto    i am interested in anything in denton west of  archer clay cooke denton jack johnson montague palo pinto parker tarrant wichita and wise county texas  in arkansas we will pursue a  acre study of the shale where we will duplicate some of our fracturing techniques on this new discovery that i call the circle of life because we create oxygen from our friends the anaerobic bacteria that breath in co and breathe out o while producing ng  the barnett shale is a living anaerobic digester   the paleo landscape and the birth of the barnett shale began with the defining of the fort worth basin and also the conglomerate zone discovered by early wildcatters such as coke gage p ellenberger tb pickens george mitchell norman stovall cw chuck sanders frank pitts fm doc wigington and william zuhone but george mitchell discovered how to stimulate this zone and with that and the established conglomerate zone above it a blanket coverage was quickly defined to be the barnett shale  it was soon later known through science that this layer was in fact responsible for feeding the above zones with natural gas and that this was in fact the source bed rock mitchell energy  george mitchell was acquired by devon in january  and began developing the barnett shale in the fort worth basin in the northeast sector of central texas in  his down hole man fm wigington aka doc has now teamed up with the natural gas group organic inc and dedica and is expected to begin production in southern jack county early in  this team along with william zuhone of dedica have the most experience in the shale today   the mississippianage barnett shale is one of the most uniform stratigraphic units in the basin outcropping along the flanks of the llano uplift in central texas where it is about  to  feet thick the barnett shale dips gently and thickens to the north reaching a maximum depth of around  feet and a maximum width of almost  feet near the texasoklahoma border large fracktures in the barnett shale are created by tectonic stresses created after deposition about  million years ago huge grids of small sized fracktures extend northeast southwest across the area but could not be produced until onset of newer frackturing techniques barnett shale production was first established in the newark east field in wise and denton counties where it grew from less than one billion cubic feet of gas from  wells in  to  billion cubic feet from  wells in  during the past five years production has more than doubled to  billion cubic feet from over  wells the barnett shale is really only to the west of i and leaves dallas county pretty much out of the play  chris sanders has created several new entities which all demand earth friendly and sustainable projects that are combined into his barnett shale projects  the new family geared to save the children on the planet are called sustainable angels  sanders drilling is now negotiating a drilling program with  million acres that are both ready for natural gas and wind farms  the firm continues to expand its play area with twenty wells in southeast jack county in  rich green  chevron  lng and chris sanders experimented with a new stimulation technique that employed water as the fracturing fluid required significantly less proppant and was about  percent less expensive than the conventional stimulation treatments the technique proved successful and has since been implemented field wide  september of  the team completed its  successful well in the barnett shale using this process with the injection of treated carbon dioxide in water  they also provide millions of cubic feet of oxygen to the atmosphere for our breathing environment because the substrate in the shale transforms this co into both natural gas and oxygen since then a new frack method called the soda pop has been developed with  wells that have already pushed  million dollars in natural gas returns  currently they are concentrating on the oil returns of the shale in the north west region of the play   devon with james hall demonstrated a technique for economically completing the upper barnett shale interval increasing reserves in their core area by  percent or  million cubic feet per well and expanding the play to previously marginal areas this new completion technique in combination with a acre spacing infill well drilling program is expected to allow devon energy to increase its barnett shale gas production and open up new areas for exploitation devon perforated the upper zone which george mitchell did not stimulate natural gas ng is hydrogen h the only difference is removing the  co air products and sanco have discussed two joint venture programs involving co extraction technologies from both the well head and also from the environment itself  the co belongs under the surface of the earth where it can be anatomically changed  just as the plants do here on the surface  this substrate does under the earth  because of my findings i have mandated sustainable energy integration field wide on all of my locations and projects so that we can do something for the environment  by using our natural gas more effectively the same amount of natural gas it takes to heat a sky scrapper can be converted into enough electricity to power an entire city california governor arnold schwarzenegger and new mexico governor bill richardson are now a part of the hydrogen hwy and family  the group pushes for texas because of its proven natural gas resources and areas like the barnett shale which currently produce  of the nations natural gas supply that can be converted to provide  of the nations electrical and hydrogen needs from hydrogen fuel cell technology that provide oxygen as emissions  company mandated sustainable integration on all company projects  these companies include texas environmental energy group inc    working interest partner program available in the barnett shale play of texas and the monterey shale play of california you must be an accredited investor being represented by a firm with knowledge of the risks and tax benefits  jv in the barnett shale starts at     million per county area of mutual interest ami accreditd investor information disclosure expansion plans   the group has dedicated their revenues for environmental remediation projects over the shale  through mr clem palmer and his friends at the tceq  texas commission on environmental quality  mr sanders has agreed to  help remediate some of his projects which might include the buffalo bayou a  mile stretch of river connecting houston texas with the gulf of mexico  already millions of trees are underway and ready for a new homes in texas  the tree is called a kiri tree and produces  times more oxygen than any other tree and reduces  times more co than any other tree  it loves toxicity and cleans up areas and provides a great return on lumber yields equivalent to mahogany and teak  in texas returns of  million dollars per square mile are expected in five years  thumbs up to the green team     mr torres will be in charge of our expansion efforts into libya where we will also ascertain sustainable integration efforts for the nations people so that we may also provide clean water along with our normal oil and gas production routines we will also be working with ways to use  volt solar powered dehumidification machines to provide clean water world wide on location not only to our troops but to all nations in need as a sign of peace  the two lifelong friends are dedicated to saving lives and together with the help of frank dux the team will spread the word wide water plan to save lives and provide all with clean water from the atmosphere  just the knowledge alone of sustainable integration in third world countries makes a tremendous impact and saves lives providing all with the cleanest fresh water throughout the united states we shall never be affected by a drought ever

of drilling and producing in the barnett shale the three key advantages of shale gas plays are as follows moderate development costs high success rates and slow production decline rates the rapid growth in the late s and early s in the barnett shale which is being repeated today in the antrim shale and san juan basins is driven by the powerful economic incentives of low risks and low reserve finding costs recent technological advances in hydraulic fracturing coupled with the application of multiple fracture stimulations over the life of a well to recover additional reserves create an attractive opportunity to produce in the barnett shale over  hundred wells have been drilled in the barnett without a dry hole many of these will produce over  bcf with the best at  bcf some areas produce less with an average of about  bcf the barnett shale gas has a btu from  in the south to about  in the fletcher area garnering a premium from  to mcf barnett shale wells have been producing for over  years thus some wells may produce for  years or more for many large producers their high overhead costs prohibit aggressively pursuing small yet highly productive areas like the barnett

rocks in the southern part of the province are identified at the ordovician ellenburger group stratigraphic level these faults and associated structures formed during development of the llano uplift and fort worth basin with faulting ending by the early missourian tectonic historyedit fort worth basinedit evolution of the fort worth basin and bend arch structures are critical to understanding burial histories and hydrocarbon generation the asymmetrical wedgeshaped fort worth basin is a peripheral paleozoic foreland basin with about  feet  m of strata preserved in its deepest northeast portion and adjacent to the muenster arch and ouachita structural belt the basin resembles other basins of the ouachita structural belt such as the black warrior arkoma val verde and marfa basins that formed in front of the advancing ouachita structural belt as it was thrust onto the margin of north america thrusting occurred during a late paleozoic episode of plate convergence bend archedit the bend arch extends north from the llano uplift it is a broad subsurface northplunging positive structure the arch formed as a hingeline by downwarping of its eastern flank due to subsidence of the fort worth basin during early stages of development of the ouachita structural belt in the late mississippian and west tilting in the late paleozoic which formed the midland basin there is disagreement on the structural history of the bend arch flippen  suggested it acted as a fulcrum and is a flexure and structural high and that only minor uplift occurred in the area to form an erosional surface on the chesterage limestones that were deposited directly on top of the barnett in contrast cloud and barnes  suggested periodic upwarp of the bend flexure from midordovician through early pennsylvanian time resulted in several unconformities the red river arch and the muenster arch also became dominant structural features during the late mississippian and early pennsylvanian general stratigraphyedit hydrocarbon production from ordovician mississippian and early pennsylvanian rocks is mostly from carbonate rock reservoirs whereas production in the midpennsylvanian through lowpermian is mostly from clastic rock reservoirs the sedimentary section in the fort worth basin is underlain by precambrian granite and diorite cambrian rocks include granite conglomerate sandstones and shale that are overlain by marine carbonate rocks and shale no production has been reported from cambrian rocks the silurian devonian jurassic and triassic are absent in the fort worth basin from cambrian to mississippian time the fort worth basin area was part of a stable cratonic shelf with deposition dominated by carbonates ellenburger group carbonate rocks represent a broad epeiric carbonate platform covering most of texas during the early ordovician a pronounced drop in sea level sometime between late ordovician and mississippian time resulted in prolonged platform exposure this erosional event removed any silurian and devonian rocks post viola limestone unconformity that may have been present barnett shale was deposited over the resulting unconformity provenance of the terrigenous material that constitutes the barnett shale was from ouachita thrust sheets and the reactivation of older structures such as the muenster arch postbarnett deposition continued without interruption as a sequenced of extremely hard and dense limestones were laid down these limestones have often been confused with the lower part of the overlying marble falls formation and they have never been formally named in the literature since the underlying barnett is generally assumed to be late mississippian chester in age the superposed carbonates are often referred to informally as the chester limestones clastic rocks of provenance similar to the barnett dominate the pennsylvanian part of the stratigraphic section in the bend arch–fort worth basin with progressive subsidence of the basin during the pennsylvanian the western basin hinge line and carbonate shelf continued migrating west deposition of thick basinal clastic rocks of the atoka strawn and canyon formations occurred at this time these mid and late pennsylvanian rocks consist mostly of sandstones and conglomerates with fewer and thinner limestone beds petroleum production historyedit hydrocarbon shows were first encountered in province  during the midnineteenth century while drilling water wells sporadic exploration began following the civil war and the first commercial oil discoveries occurred in the early s in  discovery of ranger field stimulated one of the largest exploration and development booms in texas ranger field produces from the atokabend formation a sandstoneconglomerate reservoir that directly overlies the barnett formation operators drilled more than  wildcats in and around the fort worth basin attempting to duplicate the success of ranger these wildcat efforts resulted in the discovery of more fields and production from numerous other reservoirs including strawn fluvialdeltaic sandstone atokabend fluvialdeltaic sandstone and conglomerate marble falls carbonate bank limestone barnett siliceous shale and ellenburger dolomitic limestone by  the province reached a mature stage of exploration and development as demonstrated by the high density and distribution of well penetrations and production wells oil and lesser amounts of gas are found throughout the paleozoic section but most hydrocarbons consist of oil in pennsylvanian reservoirs province  is among the more active drilling areas during the resurgence of us drilling which began after the opec oil embargo it has consistently appeared on the list of the  most active provinces in terms of wells completed and footage drilled  oil wells and  gas wells were drilled and completed in this area from  to  cumulative production in province  from conventional reservoirs prior to the  usgs assessment was  billion barrels × m of oil  trillion cubic feet × m of gas and  million barrels × m of natural gas liquids cumulative gas production through  from the continuous barnett fractured shale play in wise and denton counties was

currently over  trillion cubic feet × m of proven gas reserves are assessed for nef these production and proven reserve figures for the barnett play combined with estimates of underdeveloped barnett

secondary importance are early pennsylvanian and include dark finegrained carbonate rock and shale units within the marble falls limestone and the black shale facies of the smithwickatoka shale the barnett shale was deposited over much of northcentral texas however because of postdepositional erosion the present distribution of barnett is limited to province  the barnett shale is over  feet  m

whereas the primary zone of dry gas generation main gas window begins at a ro of  thermal maturity of barnett shale can also be derived from toc and rockeval tmax measurements although tmax is not very reliable for high maturity kerogens due to poor pyrolysis peak yields and peak shape the extent of kerogen transformation can be utilized for example barnett shale having a  toc and a hydrogen index of less than  is in the wet or dry gas windows with equivalent ro values greater than  toc in contrast low maturity barnett shale from lampasas county outcrops have initial toc values averaging

and slate strata along the eastern flank of the ouachitas the fort worth basin and bend arch lie entirely within north central texas covering an area of  square miles  km the southern and eastern boundaries are defined by county lines that generally follow the ouachita structural front although a substantial portion of this structural feature is included near dallas the north boundary follows the texasoklahoma state line in the east where the province includes parts of the sherman basin and muenster arch in the west the north boundary follows the northeast county lines of oklahomas three southwestern counties harmon jackson and tillman counties which include the south flank of the wichita mountains and the hollis basin the western boundary trends northsouth along county lines defining the junction with the permian basin where part of the eastern shelf of the permian basin lies in province  structural elementsedit major structural features include the muenster and red river arches to the north and the bend and lampasas arches along the central part of province  along the east portion is an area that includes the eastern shelf and concho arch collectively known as the concho platform the mineral wells fault runs northeastsouthwest through palo pinto parker wise denton counties and joins with the newark east fault system the fault system bisects the newark east field nef creating a zone of poor production in barnett shale gas reservoirs several faults that cut basement and lower paleozoic rocks in the southern part of the province are identified at the ordovician ellenburger group stratigraphic level these faults and associated structures formed during development of the llano uplift and fort worth basin with faulting ending by the early missourian tectonic historyedit fort worth basinedit evolution of the fort worth basin and bend arch structures are critical to understanding burial histories and hydrocarbon generation the asymmetrical wedgeshaped fort worth basin is a peripheral paleozoic foreland basin with about  feet  m of strata preserved in its deepest northeast portion and adjacent to the muenster arch and ouachita structural belt the basin resembles other basins of the ouachita structural belt such as the black warrior arkoma val verde and marfa basins that formed in front of the advancing ouachita structural belt as it was thrust onto the margin of north america thrusting occurred during a late paleozoic episode of plate convergence bend archedit the bend arch extends north from the llano uplift it is a broad subsurface northplunging positive structure the arch formed as a hingeline by downwarping of its eastern flank due to subsidence of the fort worth basin during early stages of development of the ouachita structural belt in the late mississippian and west tilting in the late paleozoic which formed the midland basin there is disagreement on the structural history of the bend arch flippen  suggested it acted as a fulcrum and is a flexure and structural high and that only minor uplift occurred in the area to form an erosional surface on the chesterage limestones that were deposited directly on top of the barnett in contrast cloud and barnes  suggested periodic upwarp of the bend flexure from midordovician through early pennsylvanian time resulted in several unconformities the red river arch and the muenster arch also became dominant structural features during the late mississippian and early pennsylvanian general stratigraphyedit hydrocarbon production from ordovician mississippian and early pennsylvanian rocks is mostly from carbonate rock reservoirs whereas production in the midpennsylvanian through lowpermian is mostly from clastic rock reservoirs the sedimentary section in the fort worth basin is underlain by precambrian granite and diorite cambrian rocks include granite conglomerate sandstones and shale that are overlain by marine carbonate rocks and shale no production has been reported from cambrian rocks the silurian devonian jurassic and triassic are absent in the fort worth basin from cambrian to mississippian time the fort worth basin area was part of a stable cratonic shelf with deposition dominated by carbonates ellenburger group carbonate rocks represent a broad epeiric carbonate platform covering most of texas during the early ordovician a pronounced drop in sea level sometime between late ordovician and mississippian time resulted in prolonged platform exposure this erosional event removed any silurian and devonian rocks post viola limestone unconformity that may have been present barnett shale was deposited over the resulting unconformity provenance of the terrigenous material that constitutes the barnett shale was from ouachita thrust sheets and the reactivation of older structures such as the muenster arch postbarnett deposition continued without interruption as a sequenced of extremely hard and dense limestones were laid down these limestones have often been confused with the lower part of the overlying marble falls formation and they have never been formally named in the literature since the underlying barnett is generally assumed to be late mississippian chester in age the superposed carbonates are often referred to informally as the chester limestones clastic rocks of provenance similar to the barnett dominate the pennsylvanian part of the stratigraphic section in the bend arch–fort worth basin with progressive subsidence of the basin during the pennsylvanian the western basin hinge line and carbonate shelf continued migrating west deposition of thick basinal clastic rocks of the atoka strawn and canyon formations occurred at this time these mid and late pennsylvanian rocks consist mostly of sandstones and conglomerates with fewer and thinner limestone beds petroleum production historyedit hydrocarbon shows were first encountered in province  during the midnineteenth century while drilling water wells sporadic exploration began following the civil war and the first commercial oil discoveries occurred in the early s in  discovery of ranger field stimulated one of the largest exploration and development booms in texas ranger field produces from the atokabend formation a sandstoneconglomerate reservoir that directly overlies the barnett formation operators drilled more than  wildcats in and around the fort worth basin attempting to duplicate the success of ranger these wildcat efforts resulted in the discovery of more fields and production from numerous other reservoirs including strawn fluvialdeltaic sandstone atokabend fluvialdeltaic sandstone and conglomerate marble falls carbonate bank limestone barnett siliceous shale and ellenburger dolomitic limestone by  the province reached a mature stage of exploration and development as demonstrated by the high density and distribution of well penetrations and production wells oil and lesser amounts of gas are found throughout the paleozoic section but most hydrocarbons consist of oil in pennsylvanian reservoirs province  is among the more active drilling areas during the resurgence of us drilling which began after the opec oil embargo it has consistently appeared on the list of the  most active provinces in terms of wells completed and footage drilled  oil wells and  gas wells were drilled and completed in this area from  to  cumulative production in province  from conventional reservoirs prior to the  usgs assessment was  billion barrels × m of oil  trillion cubic feet × m of gas and  million

gas generation main gas window begins at a ro of  thermal maturity of barnett shale can also be derived from toc and rockeval tmax measurements although tmax is not very reliable for high maturity kerogens due to poor pyrolysis peak yields and peak shape the extent of kerogen transformation can be utilized for example barnett shale having a  toc and a hydrogen index of less than  is in the wet or dry gas windows with equivalent ro values greater than  toc in contrast low maturity barnett shale from lampasas county outcrops have initial toc values averaging about  with hydrocarbon potentials

mostly gas and in some cases oil charged throughout their extent continuous accumulations commonly have transition zones that grade into more conventional accumulations boundaryedit vertical quartzite and slate strata along the eastern flank of the ouachitas the fort worth basin and bend arch lie entirely within north central texas covering an area of  square miles  km the southern and eastern boundaries are defined by county lines that generally follow the ouachita structural front although a substantial portion of this structural feature is included near dallas the north boundary follows the texasoklahoma state line in the east where the province includes parts of the sherman basin and muenster arch in the west the north boundary follows the northeast county lines of oklahomas three southwestern counties harmon jackson and tillman counties which include the south flank of the wichita mountains and the hollis basin the western boundary trends northsouth along county lines defining the junction with the permian basin where part of the eastern shelf of the permian basin lies in province  structural elementsedit major structural features include the muenster and red river arches to the north and the bend and lampasas arches along the central part of province  along the east portion is an area that includes the eastern shelf and concho arch collectively known as the concho platform the mineral wells fault runs northeastsouthwest through palo pinto parker wise denton counties and joins with the newark east fault system the fault system bisects the newark east field nef creating a zone of poor production in barnett shale gas reservoirs several faults that cut basement and lower paleozoic rocks in the southern part of the province are identified at the ordovician ellenburger group stratigraphic level these faults and associated structures formed during development of the llano uplift and fort worth basin with faulting ending by the early missourian tectonic historyedit fort worth basinedit evolution of the fort worth basin and bend arch structures are critical to understanding burial histories and hydrocarbon generation the asymmetrical wedgeshaped fort worth basin is a peripheral paleozoic foreland basin with about  feet  m of strata preserved in its deepest northeast portion and adjacent to the muenster arch and ouachita structural belt the basin resembles other basins of the ouachita structural belt such as the black warrior arkoma val verde and marfa basins that formed in front of the advancing ouachita structural belt as it was thrust onto the margin of north america thrusting occurred during a late paleozoic episode of plate convergence bend archedit the bend arch extends north from the llano uplift it is a broad subsurface northplunging positive structure the arch formed as a hingeline by downwarping of its eastern flank due to subsidence of the fort worth basin during early stages of development of the ouachita structural belt in the late mississippian and west tilting in the late paleozoic which formed the midland basin there is disagreement on the structural history of the bend arch flippen  suggested it acted as a fulcrum and is a flexure and structural high and that only minor uplift occurred in the area to form an erosional surface on the chesterage limestones that were deposited directly on top of the barnett in contrast cloud and barnes  suggested periodic upwarp of the bend flexure from midordovician through early pennsylvanian time resulted in several unconformities the red river arch and the muenster arch also became dominant structural features during the late mississippian and early pennsylvanian general stratigraphyedit hydrocarbon production from ordovician mississippian and early pennsylvanian rocks is mostly from carbonate rock reservoirs whereas production in the midpennsylvanian through lowpermian is mostly from clastic rock reservoirs the sedimentary section in the fort worth basin is underlain by precambrian granite and diorite cambrian rocks include granite conglomerate sandstones and shale that are overlain by marine carbonate rocks and shale no production has been reported from cambrian rocks the silurian devonian jurassic and triassic are absent in the fort worth basin from cambrian to mississippian time the fort worth basin area was part of a stable cratonic shelf with deposition dominated by carbonates ellenburger group carbonate rocks represent a broad epeiric carbonate platform covering most of texas during the early ordovician a pronounced drop in sea level sometime between late ordovician and mississippian time resulted in prolonged platform exposure this erosional event removed any silurian and devonian rocks post viola limestone unconformity that may have been present barnett shale was deposited over the resulting unconformity provenance of the terrigenous material that constitutes the barnett shale was from ouachita thrust sheets and the reactivation of older structures such as the muenster arch postbarnett deposition continued without interruption as a sequenced of extremely hard and dense limestones were laid down these limestones have often been confused with the lower part of the overlying marble falls formation and they have never been formally named in the literature since the underlying barnett is generally assumed to be late mississippian chester in age the superposed carbonates are often referred to informally as the chester limestones clastic rocks of provenance similar to the barnett dominate the pennsylvanian part of the stratigraphic section in the bend arch–fort worth basin with progressive subsidence of the basin during the pennsylvanian the western basin hinge line and carbonate shelf continued migrating west deposition of thick basinal clastic rocks of the atoka strawn and canyon formations occurred at this time these mid and late pennsylvanian rocks consist mostly of sandstones and conglomerates with fewer and thinner limestone beds petroleum production historyedit hydrocarbon shows were first encountered in province  during the midnineteenth century while drilling water wells sporadic exploration began following the civil war and the first commercial oil discoveries occurred in the early s in  discovery of ranger field stimulated one of the largest exploration and development booms in texas ranger field produces from the atokabend formation a sandstoneconglomerate reservoir that directly overlies the barnett formation operators drilled more than  wildcats in and around the fort worth basin attempting to duplicate the success of ranger these wildcat efforts resulted in the discovery of more fields and production from numerous other reservoirs including strawn fluvialdeltaic sandstone atokabend fluvialdeltaic sandstone and conglomerate marble falls carbonate bank limestone barnett siliceous shale and ellenburger dolomitic limestone by  the province reached a mature stage of exploration and development as demonstrated by the high density and distribution of well penetrations and production wells oil and lesser amounts of gas are found throughout the paleozoic section but most hydrocarbons consist of oil in pennsylvanian reservoirs province  is among the more active drilling areas during the resurgence of us drilling which began after the opec oil embargo it has consistently appeared on the list of the  most active provinces in terms of wells completed and footage drilled  oil wells and  gas wells were drilled and completed in this area from  to  cumulative production in province  from conventional reservoirs prior to the  usgs assessment was  billion barrels × m of oil  trillion cubic feet × m of gas and  million

production from the barnett shale for the first half of  was  billion cubic feet × m annual production for  was estimated at  billion cubic feet × m currently over  trillion cubic feet × m of proven gas reserves are assessed for nef these production and proven reserve figures for the barnett play combined with estimates of underdeveloped barnett resources indicate that technically recoverable

worth basin is mississippian chesterage barnett shale the barnett commonly exhibits high gammaray log response at the base of the unit other potential source rocks of secondary importance are early pennsylvanian and include dark finegrained carbonate rock and shale units within the marble falls limestone and the black shale facies of the smithwickatoka shale the barnett shale was deposited over much of northcentral texas however because of postdepositional erosion the present distribution of barnett is limited to province  the barnett shale is over  feet  m thick along the southwest flank of the muenster arch it is eroded in areas along the red riverelectra and muenster arches to the north the llano uplift to the south where it outcrops and the easternmost portion of the province where the barnett laps onto the eastern shelfconcho platform average total organic carbon toc content in the barnett shale is about  and toc is as high as  in samples from outcrops along the llano uplift on the south flank of the fort worth basin it has geochemical characteristics similar to other devonianmississippian black shales found elsewhere in the us eg woodford bakken new albany and chattanooga formations these black shales all contain oilprone organic matter type ii kerogen based on hydrogen indices above  milligrams of hydrocarbons per gram of toc and generate a similar type of high quality oil low sulfur  api gravity although kerogen cracking decomposition is a source of oil and gas from the barnett shale the principal source of gas in the newark east field is from cracking of oil and bitumen thermal maturityedit low maturation levels in the barnett shale at vitrinite reflectance ro estimated at  yield oils of ° api gravity in brown county oils found in shackelford throckmorton and callahan counties as well as in montague county are derived from barnett shale at the middle of the zone of oil generation oil window thermal maturities levels ≈ ro although condensate is associated with gas production in wise county barnett source rock maturity is generally  ro or greater the zone of wet gas generation is in the  ro range whereas the primary zone of dry gas generation main gas window begins at a ro of  thermal maturity of barnett shale can also be derived from toc and rockeval tmax measurements although tmax is not very reliable for high maturity kerogens due to poor pyrolysis peak yields and peak shape the extent of kerogen transformation can be utilized for example barnett shale having a  toc and a hydrogen index of less than  is in the wet or dry gas windows with equivalent ro values greater than  toc in contrast low maturity barnett shale from lampasas county outcrops have initial toc values averaging about  with hydrocarbon potentials averaging  by volume a good average value for barnett shale is derived from the mitcham  well in brown county where toc is  and hydrocarbon potential is  by volume using these data we can determine toc values will decrease  during maturation from the immature stage to the gasgeneration window samples from the t p simms well in the newark east gasproducing area have average toc values of  but greater than  of the organic matter is converted to hydrocarbons thus its original toc was about  with an initial estimated potential of  by volume any oil generated would be expelled into shallow or deeper horizons as in the west and north or cracked to gas where measured vitrinite reflectance is above  ro hydrocarbon generationedit the barnett shale is thermally mature for hydrocarbon generation over most of its area barnett source rock is presently in the oilgeneration window along the north and west parts of the province and in the gas window on the east half of the barnettpaleozoic tps expulsion of highquality oil from the barnett was episodic and began at low ro   thermal maturity thirtytwo oils from wise and jack counties were analyzed to determine the characteristics of the generating source rock api gravity and sulfur content were integrated with highresolution gas chromatography gc and gas chromatographymass spectrometry gcms analyses the api gravity of the oils ranges from ° to ° and sulfur contents are low  which is characteristic of high thermal maturity oils biomarkers from gcms analyses show oils were sourced from marine shale based on sterane distribution and the presence of diasteranes carbon isotopic analyses of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions support hydrocarbon generation from a singlesource unit in the main gasproducing area of fractured barnett shale the gas generation window is along a trend subparallel to the ouachita thrust front jarvie  reported the british thermal unit btu content of barnett gas is directly proportional to ro levels reservoir rocksedit reservoir rocks include clastic and carbonate rocks ranging in age from ordovician to early permian most production from conventional reservoirs is from pennsylvanian rocks whereas the only recognized production from unconventional accumulations is from mississippian fractured barnett shale and early pennsylvanian atokan fractured marble falls limestone conglomerate of the pennsylvanian bend group is the main producing reservoir in the boonsville bend field with cumulative production through  exceeding  trillion cubic feet × m of gas oil sourced from barnett shale is produced from numerous reservoir rocks in the bend arch–fort worth basin including barnett shale caddo formation canyon group chappel limestone bend group and ellenburger group seal rocksedit seal rocks in the barnettpaleozoic tps are mostly shale units and dense low permeability carbonate rock that are distributed on both regional and local scales barnett shale is a major regional seal for older reservoirs mostly porous carbonate rock reservoirs of the ellenburger group production from barnett shale is largely dependent on the presence or absence of marble falls and viola limestones although these formations are not considered seal rocks in areas where they are tight and not water wet they serve as barriers confining hydraulicinduced fracturing frac barriers and help retain formation pressures during well stimulation trapsedit traps for conventional hydrcocarbon accumulations are mostly stratigraphic for carbonate rock reservoirs and both structural and stratigraphic in clasticrock reservoirs combination structural and stratigraphic traps are also common in pennsylvanian sandstone reservoirs stratigraphic traps in carbonate rocks result from a combination of facies and depositional topography erosion updip pinchout of facies and diagenetically controlled enhancedpermeability and porosity zones a good example of a carbonate stratigraphic trap is the pinnacle reef traps of the chappel limestone where local porous grainstone and packstone are restricted to isolated buildups or reef clusters on lowrelief paleotopography of the eroded ellenburger group chappel pinnacle reefs are draped and sealed by the overlying barnett shale stratigraphic traps in pennsylvanian atoka sandstones and conglomerates are mainly pinch outs related to facies changes or erosional

mostly illitesmectite and illite  carbonate calcite dolomite and siderite  feldspar  pyrite and  toc average porosity in the productive portions is about  and matrix permeability is measured in nanodarcies three assessment units have been proposed for the barnett shale continuous accumulations each with different geologic and production characteristics a nef gas sweet spot where the barnett is siliceous thick within the gas generation window slightly overpressured and enclosed by dense tight overlying marble falls limestone and underlying viola limestone and simpson group as frac barriers an outlying area where the barnett is within the gasgeneration window but the subcrop is the porous ellenburger and the overlying marble falls limestone barrier may be absent and an area of lesser potential where overlying and underlying barriers may be absent and production includes oil and gas from fractured barnett shale the siliceous nature of the barnett shale and its relation to fracture enhancement in nef was noted by lancaster also the second assessment unit where the barnett shale subcrop is ellenburger group carbonate rocks is being tested by several operators the units resource potential unit will be guided by the results of current testing with directional wells and various completion methods to determine optimum completion techniques for gas recovery historically

basin holds nearly as many active oil and gas drilling rigs as the rest of the united states combined — and that includes offshore rigs in the gulf of mexico that’s according to the energy information administration’s november drilling productivity report which also showed that the permian is the only region where crude oil production was expected to increase for the third straight month the permian was back in the news this week as two major oilandgas companies announced multibilliondollar deals to snap up land in the area shares of noble energy inc nbl   were the third bestperforming on

following an uptick late last year after the organization of the petroleum exporting countries agreed on production cuts with nonopec producers also late last year the us geological survey announced that it assessed the permian’s wolfcamp shale and estimated that it contains  billion barrels of oil and  trillion cubic feet of natural gas that are “technically recoverable” — they can be produced using existing available technology and industry practices read also energy companies are about ready to loosen the purse strings the estimate is nearly three times as large as that what the usgs assessed in north dakota’s bakkenthree forks in  “making this the largest estimated continuous oil accumulation that usgs has assessed in the united states to date” the usgs said even in areas that

articlefiguresinfo  metrics pdf copyright  the american association of petroleum geologists all rights reservedabstract newark east barnett shale field fort worth basin texas is currently the most productive gas field in texas in terms of daily production and is growing at an annual rate of more than  however despite the fact that the barnett play has been studied intensely by very capable geologists and engineers from several companies over a period of many years there continues to be several misunderstandings concerning fundamental factors controlling the success of the barnett play of north texas barnett gas production is poorer in areas near faults and structural flexures anticlines and synclines fractures which are most abundant in these structural settings are detrimental to barnett production open natural fractures are rare in the barnett and have little or nothing to do with barnett productivity in areas where barnett shale is thermally mature with respect to gas generation it is slightly overpressured about  psift  kpam limestone beds within the barnett formation are the product of debris flows that originated on a carbonate shelf to the north of the present basin center it appears that the barnett can be used as an exploration model for other basins especially analogous basins of the ouachita trend the history of the development of the barnett reservoir in north texas provides an excellent example of how persistence can lead to success in nonconventional gas plays kent a bowker has been studying the barnett shale since  when chevrons nonconventional gas team drilled a vertical wildcat well in johnson county he began his career with gulf oil in  after earning his masters degree from oklahoma state university he worked at mitchell energy from  to  and is now an independent producer and consultant introduction in december  newark east barnett shale field in the fort worth basin became the largest single producing gas field in texas in terms of daily production currently the field is producing more than  bcfday of gas and annual production growth is substantially higher than  more than  of barnett production in north texas is from the newark east field several individuals who have worked in the barnett play believe that the greater newark east field will eventually surpass the hugoton field of kansas oklahoma and texas as the largest onshore gas field in the conterminous united states however despite being studied intensely by very capable geologists and engineers from several companies over a period of many years contention and misunderstandings surrounding several fundamental issues concerning barnett production continue in this article i review several of these contentious issues i have had discussions with numerous geologists and engineers that are familiar with the barnett play to many of them it appears simple it is a fracturedshale play just like other producing gasshale reservoirs however the barnett is not like the antrim lewis new albany the devonian shale production of the appalachian basin or any other productive shale in the united states an exception may be the recent success in the fayetteville shale of the arkoma basin but additional data from that nascent play are needed before that can be determined i do not believe anyone currently understands the true complexity of the largest producing gas field in texas but one thing is certain it is not just a fracturedshale play several factors however are key elements that make the barnett such a prolific reservoir the purpose of this article is to clarify many of the misconceptions among the cadre of barnett workers and to illuminate some of the unresolved issues so that those pursuing the barnett play may benefit from the collected knowledge of geologists and engineers who although not currently working on the barnett are familiar with these unresolved issues because of previous experience with similar unconventional reservoirs a vast literature exists eg wignall  concerning organicrich shales that is little used by most involved in barnett or other shalegas plays in particular the russian literature is an excellent source of research and information on black shales eg yudovich and ketris  with  references half in russian some basic understanding of the barnett shale gas play will be required for the reader to place the issues discussed here into their proper context articles by bowker  pollastro  and montgomery et al  and articles in this volume that review the basic geology and engineering of the barnett will aid the general reader in understanding the issues discussed here relationship of open natural fractures faults and structural flexures to production introduction the subject of open natural fractures is the most contentious within the community of barnett workers when first working with the barnett shale many including me have presumed that open natural fractures are critical to barnett gas production even when informed by experienced colleagues that this is not the case in fact if there was an abundance of open natural fractures within the barnett there would be a much smaller gas accumulation present within the reservoir open natural fractures if they existed would have led to major expulsion and migration of gas out of the shale into overlying rocks substantially decreasing pore pressure within the barnett and hence the amount of gas in place the barnett would not be overpressured that is overpressured relative to the bounding strata if copious open natural fractures existed note that the barnett is not just the gas reservoir but also the source trap and seal for the gas if the seal is fractured and inefficient then the present gas in place would be much less because the free gas would be lost and only the adsorbed gas would remain in the shale a similar situation to that of the antrim shale of northern michigan the initial exploration and exploitation strategy for many operators new to the play including mitchell energy and chevron when they first entered the play is to test the barnett near faults with the assumption that there is increased natural fracture density ie higher permeability in these areas this assumption is true the density of natural fractures is highest near faults but they are invariably completely healed with carbonate cements matrix porosity present in the barnett near faults is also partially occluded with calcite ie there is lower matrix porosity near faults the history of fracturefilling cementation within the barnett has not been studied but it is apparent from the macroscopic precipitation banding present in the larger fractures that there were several episodes of fracture filling this evidence indicates that fractures were once open but hot mineralladen water probably from the underlying ellenburger and possibly viola see hill et al  for a stratigraphic column of the basin moved up through the fractures forming these carbonate cements bethke and marshak  open natural fractures it generally takes about – yr of experience in the barnett shale play of north texas for the geologist or engineer to realize that open natural fractures are insignificant to the productivity of the barnett open natural fractures are of little importance to barnett production because they do not exist except in very rare and isolated examples i have only observed three open natural fractures each about  in  cm long in the hundreds of feet of core i have examined that is not to say that natural fractures are not abundant in barnett cores they are but they are nearly always healed with cement commonly calcite this counters the argument that we do not see the open natural fractures because we are relying on a vertical core an orientation that presumably would reduce the odds of finding natural nearvertical fractures our natural bias as conventionally trained engineers and geologists is to identify a fracturepermeability network that will transmit gas from the matrix of the rock to the wellbore the usual logic of those new to the barnett is that induced fractures created during completion operations must enhance the existing open naturalfracture network the matrix permeability of the barnett is measured in nanodarcys so it appears that this rock is too tight to transmit the large volumes of gas produced without the aid of natural open fractures to envision how gas could move through such dense shale which has the lowest matrix permeability of any strata within the sedimentary column of the fort worth basin without the presence of open natural fractures is difficult how can one of the most productive reservoirs in texas also be the least permeable open natural fractures may not be a factor in barnett gas production but several completion engineers active in the barnett believe that the healed natural fractures act to enhance the effectiveness of the induced fracture treatments eg h l matthews and r suarezrivera  personal communication their argument is persuasive the healed fractures act as zones of weakness that serve to deflect the growing induced fracture the following thought experiment helps to illustrate the point r suarezrivera  personal communication if one drills a hole in a thick block of glass that is under anisotropic lateral strain and then pressurizes the hole with water the glass will crack along a single plane however if we first shatter the glass and then glue the pieces back together perfectly so that there are no remaining voids and repeat the procedure the block of glass will fracture along many planes the presence of open natural fractures would actually inhibit the growth of induced fractures when a crack forms in a steel beam or piece of sheet metal the propagation of the fracture can be halted by drilling a hole at the tip of the fracture by eliminating the stress point at the tip of the fracture the stresses causing the propagation of the fracture are dispersed and the fracture no longer grows i believe that the combination of diffusion a very high gas concentration within the barnett and the rocks ability to fracture is what makes the play successful the barnett is not a fracturedshale play it is a shalethatcanbefractured play d miller  personal communication faults and structural flexures as noted above the barnett is highly fractured near major fault zones these fractures although now healed appear to weaken the physical integrity of the barnett within the fault zone this weakness in turn allows the energy and fluid from our hydraulicfracture stimulations to be diverted along the fault plane and into the underlying commonly more porous and commonly watersaturated ellenburger group carbonates several companies have drilled wells as close as  ft  m to known major fault zones where induced fractures did not propagate into ellenburger water but wells located within fault zones have not been successful to date on average wells located on structural flexures anticlines and synclines and karst tend to be poorer producers than those not associated with structures zhao  again because of natural fractures in these structural folds hydraulicfracture stimulations may not be contained within the barnett but may be diverted downward into underlying viola andor ellenburger formations thus resulting in the barnett being understimulated gas generation versus pressure preservation in nonconventional reservoirs the source of overpressure in the barnett shale a debate has been ongoing among respected colleagues concerning the overpressure found in various gas basins including the greater green river and fort worth basins the debate centers on a central issue the cause of presentday overpressuring in some basincentered continuoustype gas deposits generally two hypotheses are championed to explain this phenomenon hypothesis  the overpressured formations which are commonly not only the reservoir but also the source rock for the gas are in the hydrocarbongeneration window for example the barnett reservoir and hence hydrocarbon source in newark east field currently averages approximately °f °c putting it barely into the hydrocarbongenerating window the barnett has an average total organic carbon toc within the field of  wt classifying it as very rich therefore hydrocarbons are currently being generated within the barnett thus causing overpressure this hypothesis is commonly promulgated by workers that have a difficult time understanding the mechanics of hypothesis  described below that is they do not have a full comprehension of the power of capillary pressure the problem with hypothesis  is a misunderstanding of basic chemical kinetics any basin not currently experiencing progressive burial or increased heat flow equivalent at least to the maximum burial depth and heat flow reached during its geologic history ie every cratonic basin in north america cannot be presently generating hydrocarbons d m jarvie  personal communication the reason is that as organic material ie kerogen is subjected to increased heat complex molecules are broken down into smaller molecules for any given precursor organic matter the chemical bonds that hold the complex molecules together will break at a given temperature as burial depth increases and hence the temperature rises progressively simpler molecules will be generated by the breakdown ie cracking of more complex precursor molecules once a basin stops subsiding or there is no increase in heat flow this cracking of the more complex molecules ceases as a basin subsides the temperature and hence the activation energy experienced by the organic matter in the source rocks increases chemical bonds that are broken at say °f °c will be broken during burial as the source rock passes down through the °f °c thermocline during uplift the source rock may yet again be exposed to °f °c but the bonds that would be broken at °f °c have already been broken during burial thus no additional hydrocarbons can be generated for the barnett to generate more hydrocarbons it will have to be exposed to a higher temperature ie to a higher activation energy than it experienced in the past hypothesis  the presentday overpressure approximately  psift  kpam is actually preserved from a normal pressure gradient or slightly overpressured gradient formed by the generation of hydrocarbons at the time of maximum heat flow established in the geologic past the extremely low permeability more precisely the extremely high capillary pressure of the barnett permits this vitrinite reflectance profiles and basin modeling pollastro et al  from the fort worth basin indicate that several thousand feet of upper paleozoic and mesozoic sediments have been eroded since the time of maximum burial in the permian the current average depth of the barnett in newark east field is about  ft  m hence the average reservoir pressure in the barnett is if we assume a normal hydrostatic pressure gradient of  psift  kpam which is the porepressure gradient of the ellenburger in the basin we only need to have eroded of overburden to account for the  psift  kpam seen in the barnett we know that the barnett is the source of nearly all the hydrocarbons now found in the fort worth basin jarvie et al   pollastro  pollastro et al  montgomery et al  so the barnett must have been leaking throughout the time of hydrocarbon generation and subsequent uplift more so barnettsourced gas is presently migrating to the surface in the basin however the barnett is tight enough figure  to absorb the  psi  kpa differential this value is taken at the average depth of  ft  m cited above across the formation boundaries above and below the shale itself and retard the complete depressurization of itselfdownload figureopen in new tabdownload powerpointfigure  typical mercuryporosimetery curve for the organicrich facies of the barnett shale note that the average porethroat radius is  å the barnett is a very efficient seal in addition to being one of the most prolific gas reservoirs in texas several formal presentations primarily by personnel from devon report that the barnett shale outside the core producing areas of wise denton and northern tarrant counties ie johnson county is not overpressured i do not believe this is the case based on three lines of reasoning first the geologic history and processes that caused overpressure in the barnett within the core area are similar to those outside the core area johnson county the barnett burial history in johnson county would thus have to be much different than in the core area for the barnett not to be overpressured but stratigraphic and vitrinite reflectance profiles constructed for both areas show similar geologic histories second i suspect that those who state that the barnett in johnson county is not overpressured are unfamiliar with how the barnett was determined to be overpressured in the core area in the first place when mitchell energy initiated the development of the barnett in the newark east core area the company performed numerous prefracturetreatment day pressure dipin tests following limited casing perforation and a very limited breakdown of those perforations the well is shut in for  days a pressure bomb is then run in the hole to measure the bottomhole pressure to locate areas of pressure depletion caused by faulting the dipin tests actually measure formation deliverability better than they measure formation pore pressure of the more than  tests performed only a few showed gradients of  psift  kpam the remaining tests with lower gradients did not indicate lower reservoir pressure in the area of the tested well only that there was lower permeability because the maximum recorded pressure gradient was  psift  kpam this value for the barnett was reported by various mitchell workers in the literature lancaster et al  in johnson county only a few pressure buildup tests prior to fracture treatment were performed to definitively characterize the reservoir pressure gradient however i suspect that reservoir pressures are similar to newark east at  psift  kpam finally recent excellent production results from horizontal wells drilled in johnson county some of the best producing wells to date in the play are in johnson county indicates that the barnett is similarly overpressured as in the newark east core area origin of limestone beds and calcareous nodules within the barnett there has been some discrepancy among barnett workers regarding the nature of numerous limestone beds most of them less than  ft  m thick within the barnett including the forestburg limestone unit some believe for example johnson  that these limestone units resulted from marine regression and the resultant formation of carbonate shoals similar to those described as bahamian banks and shoals limestone beds within the barnett can be correlated for miles across the basin the origin of these limestone beds is of economic interest because although they are rarely productive any increased carbonate content lowers the volume of shale gas in place thus any depositional model that can predict location distribution and thickness of these limestone beds would be helpful in the exploration and exploitation of the barnett the shoaling model is however unreasonable unfortunately most barnett workers have apparently not had access to barnett core and have therefore based their interpretation solely on electricalimage logs evidence from visual core analysis indicates that these limestone beds within the barnett originated from submarine debris flows with a possible provenance in southern oklahoma an additional source of this carbonate debris has been proposed by hall  in the then nascent muenster arch but this seems unlikely because the muenster arch does not appear to have had any prominent relief until after the barnett was deposited core examination clearly shows that the carbonate material was deposited in beds that contain many of the defining characteristics of a debris flow scoured basal contact containing ripup clasts of barnett shale in a chaotic mixture with fossil debris finingupward sequence exhibiting characteristics of continuous deposition within a single event and upward gradation into blackshale deposition figures   isolith mapping of the forestburg limestone within the barnett clearly indicates that the greatest thickness of limestone within the barnett is where the barnett was and currently is structurally deepest figure  it seems unlikely that if the limestones truly represent shoaling sequences they would be concentrated in the deepest part of the

powerpointfigure  map showing the thickness of the forestburg limestone unit of the barnett contour interval is  ft  m the thickest forestburg is located near the deepest part of the fort worth basin modified from hall  limestone nodules in the barnett are occasionally observed on electricalimage well logs i believe that not all carbonate nodules in the barnett are of diagenetic origin but some may be the result of softsediment deformation the formation of recumbent folds within carbonate layers caused by sediment instability similar structures have been described in the green river formation oil shales by grabowski and pevear  examination of barnett core bolsters this contention however recent work by p k papazis  personal communication indicates that some carbonate nodules are indeed diagenetic in origin why some parts of the core area of the field are better than others within the main producing area of the newark east field called the “core” producing areas by barnett workers there are at least two welldefined areas where the barnett is most productive one is in southeast wise county centered on the pearl cox lease and the other is in northern tarrant county centered on the bonds ranch lease why these two areas are more productive no matter the completion technique is not certain but it must be for one or a combination of the following reasons  these areas have a better gastransmission mechanism or  more gas in place exists ie higher gas concentration understanding the geologic reasons why these two areas have higher productivity would aid in the exploration and exploitation efforts of the play but currently the reasons are unknown gas transmission no published study has systematically examined the permeability and diffusivity of the barnett and to my knowledge no such study exists in industry wireline logs do not directly determine permeability and diffusivity in the barnett thus we can only use measurements from core further only devon energy has sufficient core material across the field to conduct a systematic study gas in place in the barnett gas is stored in pore spaces and adsorbed onto organic matter clay does not appear to adsorb gas in the barnett based on limited adsorption experiments run on only the clay fraction extracted from the barnett in the barnett core area where production is greatest there may be a higher concentration of organic matter in the barnett resulting in higher gasinplace volumes only estimates of the concentration of organic matter present in the barnett can be derived from standard wireline logs and it is not apparent from these wireline logs that in fact there is an increased concentration of organic matter in these two areas again only the analysis of core samples can best provide the answer to these questions in addition differences in shale diagenesis in one area compared to another would directly affect the petrophysical properties of the shale and may explain local variations in gas production basin history and the role of ouachita heating the many foreland basins of the ouachita system with the possible exception of sections of the permian basin of west texas have experienced abnormally high thermal gradients in the geologic past bethke and marshak  these basins namely the arkoma fort worth certain subbasins of the permian basin and to some extent the black warrior have historically produced dry gas in the regions adjacent to the ouachita thrusting in the fort worth basin it has been shown that the proximity to the ouachita front and not the depth of burial is the major controlling factor in thermal maturity bowker  pollastro et al  hot brine squeezed out in front of the advancing ouachita system and moving forward through the ellenburger bethke and marshak  kupecz and land  appears to be the source of the increased heat flow because the movement of hot fluid through the ellenburger appears to have controlled the thermal maturity of the barnett structural features predominantly faults are a factor in determining the barnetts thermal maturity because  hot water probably flowed up faults into the overlying barnett increasing the thermal maturity in some fault blocks more than in others and  faults could have acted as baffles and diverted hot ellenberger water around certain fault blocks the calorific content of produced barnett gas varies systemically within a major fault block with the lower british thermal unit content closest to the ouachita front however the british thermal unit content will jump by several tens of british thermal units across a major fault eg the mineral wells fault that cuts across the northern core area of newark east field the calorific value of gas produced from the barnett or even shallower reservoirs can be used to map major fault trends a systematic examination of ellenberger core across the fort worth basin may illuminate the thermal history of the basin the barnett as an exploration model once one acquires a basic understanding of what makes the barnett so productive exploring for similar accumulations is straightforward the explorationist should not look for fractured gassaturated shales but instead for gassaturated shales that can be fractured the details are of course more complex but they are fundamentally associated with two primary related variables  shale composition mineralogy and  resulting gasinplace volumes gas in place to have an economic shalegas play there must be a sufficient amount of gas in place within the shale thus the shale must also be a hydrocarbon source rock that generated large volumes of either thermal or biogenic gas to have generated such large volumes of gas the shale needs to have been rich in organic matter relatively thick and have been exposed to a source of heat in excess of usual global geothermal gradients gas is stored in the barnett via two mechanisms gas is stored in the matrix porosity andor adsorbed onto organic matter bowker  thus the shale in question has to have sufficient organic matter andor enough matrix porosity to store quantities of gas sufficient to make the shale viable as an exploration target concentration of organic matter the organic carbon concentration in the barnett ranges from less than  to more than  wt with an average of about  wt bowker  and the amount of adsorbed gas is proportional to the amount of organic carbon in the barnett mavor  intervals with higher concentrations of organic carbon commonly exhibit higher gas in place and generally the highest matrix porosity and the lowest clay content all three of these factors probably act to make higher toc zones more prospective the minimum toc required for a prospective shale to become a viable exploration target is not known but appears to be about – wt thickness geoscientists do not know how thin the barnett can be and still produce economic quantities of gas in the michigan basin the productive zone within the antrim is about  ft  m thick in the productive fairway for the barnett it appears that  ft  m will prove to be thick enough for commercial production although in areas where the barnett is that thin it is also thermally less mature and it is relatively shallow but  ft  m may be too thin thermal maturation the prospective shale must have been well within the thermal gasgeneration window to be a potential exploration target for shalegas production jarvie et al  reviews the various techniques and analyses that can be used to assess thermal maturation to produce economic rates of gas the barnett must be well within the gas window matrix porosity some geoscientists think that approximately half the gas at newark east field is stored in matrix porosity bowker  however there is a growing belief among some barnett workers and based on apparently proprietary data that substantially more than  of the gas in place is stored in matrix porosity novel techniques first developed under contract of the gas research institute must be employed to accurately measure porosity in rocks as impermeable as the barnett conventional laboratory measurements are not adequate few laboratories are capable of determining these measurements accurately water saturation is even more difficult to measure in shales of course both porosity and water saturation must be known to adequately assess the viability of a new exploration play the organicrich parts of the barnett average approximately  porosity and  water saturation bowker  mineralogy most shales contain a high concentration of clay minerals conversely the barnett and many of the other productive shales do not in prospecting for barnetttype shales the explorationist must look for rock that can be fractured that is shale with a low enough concentration generally less than  of clay minerals to allow it to be successfully fracture stimulated these types of shales were mostly deposited in restricted areas and only during specific geologic time intervals eg the devonian–mississippian antrim shale of michigan or the subject barnett shale short note on the history of production from the barnett in north texas figure  shows the production history of newark east field it is unique in the oil and gas industry the most apparent feature is the large increase in production that began in  what happened in that year why did it take  yr for production to take off and why did mitchell energy stay with the play so long with so little to show for it productionwise another unusual aspect of the fields production history is that the combined production from wells that were completed before  actually have higher total yearly production in  than they did in  i cannot explain why mitchell stuck with the barnett for so long without seeing any real success i trust that history will be chronicled soon by those that were at mitchell during that period two reasons exist for the large production increase in  the discovery that the true gas in place is nearly four times what was previously believed and the successful application of water fractures basically a combination of water friction reducer bactericide scale inhibitor and low sand concentration in the play that decreased the total well costs substantially these two discoveries led to the restimulation of existing wells hence the increase in the production from pre wells mentioned above downspacing successful completions in the previously unproductive upper barnett and a huge overall improvement in the economics of the play see bowker  for a detailed account of how the gas content of the barnett was determined and walker et al  for a review of water fractures in the barnett of north texasdownload figureopen in

gas production starting in  data are from the texas railroad commission  the production curve figure  has steadily increased thanks to improved understanding of the barnett and most significantly the widespread deployment of horizontal drilling techniques in the play starting in  summary misunderstanding and confusion continue regarding the prolific barnett shale reservoir of north texas this article is an attempt to clarify some of these issues including the insignificance of open natural fractures in the productivity of the barnett the origin of limestone beds found in the barnett the source of the relatively high heat flow in the basin and the origin of overpressuring in the barnett many important aspects of the barnett continue to be a mystery no one completely understands the prolific nature of gas production from the barnett at the present time the barnett play continues to grow at an astonishing rate and it is serving as a model for similar gasshale plays now being developed acknowledgments most of my understanding of shale reservoirs came from discussions with numerous colleagues over the past several years starting with my teammates on chevrons nonconventional gas ncg team especially deane foss who brought me into the team and bryan cotner back in  the former president of chevron usa production company ray galvin had the foresight to anticipate the importance of nonconventional gas sources to the nations supply so he formed the ncg team my involvement in the team changed the direction of my career for which i am very grateful i am also thankful to my colleagues and management at mitchell energy where i had the pleasure and privilege to participate in the explosive growth of barnett gas production george p mitchell is owed the highest gratitude from me and the rest of those that are benefiting from his patience during the extended and hardly economic barnett learning period besides the barnett many of the nascent shale plays in the world would not have even been contemplated without g p mitchells steadfastness during the first  yr of barnett development ron hill rich pollastro who reviewed an earlier version of the manuscript
