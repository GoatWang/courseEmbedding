gratifying to followers and players of rugby to see so many maoris achieving high honours in the code the year  will be remembered from the maori rugby viewpoint as being one of the finest ever two of new zealands best loose forwards on the international field waka nathan and victor yates were maoris and then eventual recognition was given to the brilliance of mac herewini a first fiveeighth with a glorious future in the sport provincial teams also nor is such prominence to be found only on the international plane for there are also to be found strong and continual challenges by increasing numbers of maori players for position in provincial teams to recall a few there were porima raureti waikato maniapoto walsh herewini pryor nathan rangi auckland holders of the ranfurly shield nicholls taitoko manawatu walters yates north auckland tapsell orme taiaroa new zealand universities mahupoka wairarapa these are only a few of them there were dozens more in the east coast hawkes bay counties king country taranaki and the other provincial sides maori players were present in large and representative numbers new zealand can boast of having many excellent maori rugby players right down to club level among ‘greats’ of  in picking out the ‘greats’ of  it would not be permissible to go past the northern quartet of walsh herewini yates and nathan all but walsh a past all black of some distinction made the  new zealand team that toured australia and played the australian touring side in new zealand later in the year i feel that walsh was most unlucky in not being selected to an all black side this year he has been the pivot and ‘nursery man’ for the brilliant herewini—a combination upon which auckland shield successes must have rested strongly as individuals this years all black trio proved themselves as true internationals victor yates though his form was not what it was in  against the frenchmen still showed that he will be a very strong contender for the british isles tour in – mac herewini even if he keeps only reasonable form can ‘pack his bags’ the same can be said of waka nathan and perhaps there will be other maori players on the scene as well next year the trio are an example of the trend in rugby which i discussed last march in ‘te ao hou’ maori backs have always been a feature –  – view image nz herald photo mac herewini scoring a magnificent solo try in the ranfurly shield match auckland v taranaki last september mac herewini whose photo is on the cover of this issue of te ao hou comes from mokai a tiny mill settlement northeast of lake taupo when he was seven his family moved to auckland and for a period of two years in his early teens he was an apprentice jockey his career very nearly ended at one stage during this time when a savage horse reared threw him and fell on him as it fell one of the horses hooves struck the young boy in his chest the injury was extremely serious—but if it had been an inch higher it would certainly have been fatal at this stage mac rode at  stone a tiny wisp of a boy at  ft  ins he still looks pretty small on a football field but hes now a strongly built  st  lb and once hes in action its exceedingly clear that his height is no disadvantage to him mac worked for a time with his great friend waka nathan on meatboning contracts at the westfield works but then he took up draindigging work he has his own special machine now is his own boss and is doing very well at it hes also a good tennis player though theres been less time for this since his marriage and especially since the birth of his daughter—‘a great little kid’—a few months ago auckland star photo n z herald photo victor yates left and waka nathan right are both rugged intelligent and fiery forwards who have proved themselves

of new zealand rugby but now maori loose forwards are also coming into their own and it seems that maori players will again be contributing their bit to the continued supremacy of new zealand in international rugby lets hope that next winter another grand effort from maori sportsmen will be forthcoming—meanwhile to all players from club to international the ‘hasbeens’ and ‘willbes’ can say ‘thank you for a magnificent year’ we would very much like to be able to print more news in ‘te ao hou’ and would be grateful for more contributions from readers—accounts of meetings weddings obituaries photographs and anything else of interest they dont have to be long and they dont have to be very carefully worded you can always leave this to the editor if you wish we are always glad to receive stories articles and poems also all published contributions are paid for due to a misprint we referred in our last issue to the hon j r hanan minister of maori affairs as the hon j r hanana when we noticed this later we were rather embarrassed for a moment—till we realised that we had in fact simply given mr hanan the maori version of his name and whats wrong with that if you see a reference to a mr j k hana in ‘te ao hou’ at any stage itll probably turn out to be mr hunn in his maori disgui  unclear  e –  – view image letters to the editor the editor ‘te ao hou’ in your last issue mr atihana johns writes that the ‘hate’ between maori and pakeha lives on because ‘our maori sense of history does not allow us to forget’ may i suggest—  the word ‘hate’ is very much too strong for the mutual distrust and shyness which is often to be found to a varying extent between the two groups if mr johns were to live for a time in one of the countries where there is genuine racial hatred he would quickly learn how different the real thing is  if it is true that the maori ‘sense of history’ produces distrust and shyness on the maori side and i think there may be a certain truth in this then it is time maoris acquired a different sort of sense of history i should like to draw mr johns attention to the situation at the moment in europe the french and germans possess a highly developed sense of history they were at each others throats only  years ago as well as at frequent intervals before this but the french and german sense of history extends into the future as well as into the past and they can therefore see that it is now historically essential that they should become closely cooperating friends hence the european common market i agree with mr johns in his mention of the difficulties facing those maoris who must of necessity move into ‘the asphalt jungle’ what he says about this is very true but it seems to me that the pakeha who wrote the article to which he refers was not criticising maoris because of these problems he was trying to help ‘pono’ wellington we invite letters to the editor on any subject mentioned in ‘te ao hou’ letters signed with the writers name are preferred but we publish anonymous letters provided that the writers name is included as a sign of good faith the editor reserves the usual right to shorten letters if this is necessary for reasons of space with the last issue ‘te ao hou’ celebrated its tenth birthday this seems a useful moment to ask readers to tell us what they think of us—to say which things in ‘te ao hou’ they specially enjoy and which things they may feel they see too much of and to suggest any new subjects on which they should like ‘te ao hou’ to publish articles for instance would you like to see more articles on traditional cultural subjects—or fewer of them and on which particular cultural subjects more features on personalities and topical news—or not so many this is your magazine—let

audience members at many maori concerts may i add my plea to the suggestions made by alan armstrong in your september issue would performers on stage men in particular please not act as if most of the show was an amusement for slightly feeble minded children time and time again an otherwise enjoyable performance is marred by those in the rear who give the impression that they are fairly bored with the programme and are able only to survive the evening by passing derogatory remarks to one another or by repeating the refrain backwards the fine points of technique of gesture and of mood we know little about but movement timing costuming—they are so obvious speak so loudly of able or slipshod preparation … the public carries away an image—that image is all too often the only one they can call on when discussing maori culture … whatever it is thats at stake whether tribal or racial mana or sir apiranas maoritanga something has to be done fairly quickly the concert party is a salient as it

spines drawing with them in the smoothtrampled clay of the backyard or testing his courage by pushing one slowly into the tough skin under his big toe until he could bear it no longer once a spine had snapped in his fingers and a little black spot showed where part of it still remained in his toe eruera stared at that spot now his fat brown foot clutched to his jersey at the sound of childrens voices eruera dropped his foot and the stick and ran to the gate there were his school mates nino paul and isaac ‘were going fishing eru you coming’ they called in two minutes eruera had found his fishingline under the verandah and the four were on their way to the jetty but they didnt go straight to the jetty there were too many pleasant things to do along the way there were walnuts to gather under the huge tree that overhung the road there was the culvert where the taniwha answered you with long booming calls when you shouted into it they never stayed long at the culvert and noone ever stopped there or shouted into it when he was by himself they stopped at a ricketty wooden gate and stared for a minute or two at a little white cottage ‘theres good ginger beer in that house’ said isaac ‘thats my aunt sophies house she gives me ginger beer any time’ eruera said grandly ‘go and ask her for some now’ said nino at the back door eruera called timidly ‘hullo aunt sophie’ but was glad there was no answer the other boys coughed and whispered and stared around there was a little shed there its door open and half off its hinges inside was a crayfish pot a bundle of flax and rows of brown bottles their corks tied down with string there were a lot of bottles and aunty sophie was kind eruera was sure she would want them to take a bottle they opened it with ninos sheathknife –  –

from his hand and smashed on the concrete floor they took one quick look at the glass splinters and the spreading pool and then they were outside the ricketty gate again and heading for the jetty after this the boys were quiet for a long time they swung their bare legs over the jetty edge drawing patterns in the water with their toes the sun was very hot on their backs ‘perhaps shell think it burst itself’ said isaac they caught a lot of fish that day some spotties four blue cod and a kitful of herring ‘well take her the cod’ said nino threading them on to some flax this time smoke was coming from the chimney of the little white cottage old aunty sophie was surprised to see them and more surprised when they gave her the fish ‘you the good boys’ she said ‘you come back monday and i give you ginger beer not ready yet give you pain in te puku’ she stood at the door her old eyes soft with love in her brown wrinkled face the bundle of fish in her thin knotted hands ‘the good boys’ she murmured to their departing backs and went inside eruera could see mauis flax ropes reaching from the sky to the piripiri hills and all yellow in the setting sun when he reached his own gate he

given in percy s smiths ‘maori wars of the nineteenth century’  te aokapurangi and her husband te wera later went to live at mahia and it was there that she eventually died how aokapurangi saved her people this story concerns a woman of high rank aokapurangi who belonged to an arawa subtribe which lived on mokoia island in the middle of lake rotorua around about  when she was a girl aokapurangi was on a visit to maketu when she was taken prisoner by te wera an important chief of nga puhi te wera took her north to his home at the bay of islands and made her his wife he treated her kindly and as the wife of such an important man and a woman of great strength of character she came to have considerable presting among her husbands people living there happily for several years then in  trouble arose nga puhi who had been able to acquire a great many muskets from early settlers in the north and from their leader hongi hikas visit to england had for some years been sending down war parties which slaughtered great numbers of people in the southern tribes for very few of these other tribes possessed muskets on one of these expeditions a party of nga puhi were treacherously killed by the tuhourangi a branch of the arawa people who had been urged to do this by te rauparaha however a few survivors escaped and returned to the bay of islands to tell of this disaster when nga puhi and their leader hongi heard the news they immediately determined upon revenge they also decided that this would be a useful opportunity to attack the entire arawa tribe who at this time were very numerous but who possessed almost no muskets accordingly a great expedition was planned and people gathered at the bay of islands for this purpose from far and near when aokapurangi heard that her own people on mokoia island were to be among those slain she pleaded with her husband te wera to ask hongi to spare them te wera was very reluctant to do this but she wept so loudly and urged him so strongly that in the end he conveyed her request to hongi hongi also had no wish to allow her people to live but finally he said grudgingly that he would permit her to save the lives of any of her people who passed between her legs this was an ancient ceremony which gave new life to the person concerned—for example it was sometimes part of the ritual by which a tohunga cleansed someone who had broken the laws of tapu so hongi and his great fleet of canoes sailed from the bay of islands down to tauranga and then on to waihi the shallow harbour just to the east of maketu here they entered the pongakawa stream this stream flows from lake rotorua in the rotorua district but for some miles of its course it is subterranean and for much of the distance its valley is very narrow and rugged in spite of the very difficult nature of the country nga puhi dragged their canoes right up this valley to the place where the stream emerges from its underground course here they cut a track through the dense bush and with great labour dragged their canoes overland along this route this is why the road just south of lake rotorua is still known as hongis track the arawa people knew of the approach of the nga puhi expedition but it did not occur to them that hongi could possibly bring his war canoes with him they therefore thought that the best thing to do would be to gather on mokoia island taking all their canoes with them and laying in great quantities of food and water so that they would be able to withstand a siege so all the time that hongi and his men were dragging their canoes overland the arawa were gathering provisions and making more weapons—spears taiaha and other rakau maori shortly before nga puhi arrived some of te arawa wanted to abandon mokoia for they had only one musket between them in the whole tribe and they greatly feared the nga puhi guns also –  – view image they knew that if they were defeated there would be little chance of escaping from the island but most of the people were defiant of nga puhi and it was decided to stay to defend mokoia which was very dear to them being associated with five hundred years of their history then hongi finally reached lake rotoehu and took the canoes overland again to lake rotoiti from there he travelled up the ohau stream into lake rotorua by this time all the arawa were crowded on to mokoia having taken with them a great quantity of provisions expecting that they would have to withstand a long siege then to their horror they woke one day to see through the morning mists the shapes of canoes on the opposite shores and knew that they were at hongis mercy for two days nga puhi did not land on the island but amused themselves by circling around it and as they passed the arawa canoes drawn up on the bank each chief claimed one of them as his own by calling it after some part of his own body and thereby rendering it sacred to himself on the third day nga puhi landed hongi led the way a fearsome figure as he stood upright in the canoe flourishing his mere and chanting a warsong the sunlight shining on the steel helmet which had been given to him in england by george iv behind him was the fleet of warcanoes bristling with muskets before him was the great host of te arawa with the one musket amongst them just as his canoe touched the shore the arawa warrior who possessed the musket crept behind a flax bush and fired at hongi he was hit on the head and fell down into the canoe—a great cry rose from te arawa but hongi stood upright again in a moment he had only been stunned for his steel helmet had saved him but for a short time this happening caused a panic among nga puhi and this panic gave aokapurangi her opportunity she had been in hongis canoe with her husband and now she jumped on to the shore she remembered hongis promise that all who passed between her legs should be saved and she ran to the great carved meetinghouse in the village she stood on the carving over the door her legs over the entrance—and she called out to her people ‘it is aokapurangi come back from the north come inside your house you will be saved’ te arawa were fighting bravely but were defenceless against hongis muskets very great numbers of them were killed but many heard aokapurangis voice and fled to the house all day she stood there with buildings flaming around her calling to her people and all day they crowded into the meetinghouse and such was aokapurangis mana that those who reached the house were saved the warriors of nga puhi did not venture to attack them some others managed to escape by swimming to the shore some of nga puhi pursued them in canoes to secure them as slaves and often they succeeded though sometimes when the canoes became full of arawa captives they turned on the northern warriors killing them with the paddles and escaping into the forest with their bodies at the end of the day te aokapurangi obtained permission from hongi to go in search of her uncle hikairo who was hiding in the forest she took him to hongi and a peace was made as a token of this peace hongi gave hikairo his steel helmet which was given to him by george iv and which had just saved his life from the arawa musket nga puhi remained at mokoia for many days living on the ‘fish of tu’ then they returned the way they had come taking many prisoners with them some of these later returned and some became the wives of their captors this was the last time that nga puhi ever fought with te arawa the name of aokapurangi who saved so many of her people from destruction and was responsible for a lasting peace between the peoples is still famous and still when a meetinghouse is crowded full of people the saying is sometimes heard ‘ano ki te whare whawhao a aokapurangi ‘this is like the crowded house of aokapurangi’ the carved meetinghouse in which the people sheltered was called tamatekapua after the original ancestor of the arawa the big meetinghouse which stands at ohinemutu today the one where dances are held and in front of which tourists photograph each other is also called tamatekapua some of the carvings in this house are very old indeed though some of the old ones are partially obscured now by a danceband platform and it is likely that some of them formed part of this older tamatekapua on mokoia  years ago mrs mayla ngawhika of rotorua has gained top

maoris—one seventh of the total but the maori population is approximately onefourteenth of the total population of new zealand the maori drowning rate is therefore twice that for the whole population six of the maoris drowned during this time onethird of the total were  years or younger five were men between  and  and two were men in the – age group some were married men with families the six children were all young lives full of promise which a growing race can ill afford to lose how did they die these tragedies can teach us how to keep young lives safe two boys under five drowned while playing in water a river and a lagoon with other children but without an adult or responsible teenager to look after them you should never let toddlers near water of any sort without someone to protect them to be absolutely sure they are safe when playing around the house the yard must be securely fenced and the gate kept shut if possible all water hazards—wells troughs tanks reservoirs sheep dips and drains as well as creeks rivers lakes ponds and pools dangerously close to the house—should be made harmless by fencing them off when you can cover them over children need watching how

timothy te heu heu whose photograph is on the next page my year as an american school girl by marama paewai ten months at high school in des moines iowa a monthlong tour of the eastern states and a long vacation in sausalito california all add up to the most wonderful experience a school girl of seventeen could have i left hukarere maori girls school in august  and took this trip under the auspices of the american field service exchange programme i visited many places and the two traits of the american people that impressed me most were firstly their great and unselfish hospitality and secondly the students awareness of life they seem to realize that there is a future to be prepared for politically economically and socially as teenagers in a democracy they are remarkably aware of the workings of their government and recognize their rights to the full relaxed atmosphere at school socially the american teenager has loads of fun—the ball games the cheering squads the drivein movies the many parties the bowling alleys and the school proms school life at theodore roosevelt high a coeducational school with two thousand students is a phase of life which i miss very much the students there enjoy a very relaxed relationship with their teachers and the absence of uniform creates a casual atmosphere in the school however i never did decide whether or not i favoured this attitude my studies there included english american literature american government and economics latin and biology languages and all fields of science seemed to be the subjects most stressed the big city life which we hear so much about really exists chicago and los angeles are big industrial and therefore dirty cities but new york and san francisco impressed me as being marama paewai loved her year in america—but shes glad to be home again tremendously big beautiful clean and exciting cities family life which is stressed a great deal taught me many things the home of mr roger johnson in which i lived as a daughter was run on love and consideration i will not say that the children were not more demanding than we seem to be but very enveloping love and respect were always foremost visit to president kennedy on the th of june thirtythree afs students including myself left iowa for a months tour of the eastern states staying with families in the various communities the highlights for all i think were new york city the united nations and a visit to the white house where we met president kennedy i will always fondly remember the company during this time of european latin american and south east asian students after a month in san francisco during which i lived with an outstanding negro family i turned towards aotearoa and that was the most wonderful part of it all i

the national language ‘bulan bahasa’ is an annual event which is very important in malaya at the request of the new zealand high commissioner mr c m bennett dso the officer in charge of the party took several popular songs and gave them maori words and in one case actions and also wrote verses in malay telling of the party and its work the soldiers performance of these malay songs was an immediate hit in a special farewell article to the battalion the newspaper the ‘malay mail’ expressed this when it said that ‘by singing popular malay songs and by their friendly ways they have won the confidence of malayans and helped foster closer understanding between the two countries’ when the party came back to new zealand their malayan songs pleased audiences here too and this prompted ‘maori

impressive sight to see an entire meetinghouse travelling down the road as this one at the upokotataia pa in the taupo district did recently like many meetinghouses it had become rather isolated when the community shifted nearer to town so the owners of the house have moved the whole building three miles down the road to papakai where it will be more central and able to be used more when peter

hostel luxury at freezing works photographed by ans westra perhaps it is a bit much to describe any hostel as being luxurious exactly but the boys in the hostel at the gear meat works petone are certainly pretty comfortable they have individual wellplanned rooms of their own some of them going in for some pretty striking forms of interior decoration and their communal rooms include a kitchen where they make themselves supper an allpurpose room used for such things as practices by the hostel band and a sittingroom complete with pingpong tables tv and comfortable armchairs there is also a football field where floodlit games can be seen going on most evenings boys feel responsible much of this comfort is due to the companys concern for their welfare but the big thing is that the boys have been led to feel responsible for the place and as a consequence to be proud of it they have been encouraged to acquire the facilities for many sparetime activities but they have mostly raised the money for these things themselves the tv and their expensive band instruments for example were paid for through their own fundraising efforts they know that they could ask the company for money—but they take a pride in being independent this pride is surely the reason for the spotless condition in which things are kept and for the happy atmosphere there during the peak season at the works there are up to  boys nearly all of them maori living at the hostel and even in the offseason there are about sixty of them nearly all of them are under  after this if theyre not married they usually share a house with friends and they come from all over new zealand—from waikato northland taranki the east coast wellington itself and elsewhere they get on very well at the gear meat works where  per cent of all the workers are maoris ‘we really welcome maoris here’ mr steve watene the companys welfare officer told ‘te ao hou’ maoris have a natural aptitude for the work he said provided a company looks after them they are exceptionally good workers good with their hands mr watene who has been welfare officer at the company for six years told us many interesting things about maoris in freezing works they manage well because they are particularly good at using their hands and enjoy doing so this capacity to enjoy their work especially when they are in groups a capacity which in general is probably more typical of melvin king has made himself pretty cosy in his hostel room melvin comes from taranaki one of the many boys whose homes are outside wellington –  – view image maoris than pakehas makes all the difference though they get on well with their pakeha mates they prefer on the whole to work in all maori groups they dont like detailed work such as meat processing jobs but are very good at the heavy work like butchering and dressing the expert teams of ‘tally men’ are  per cent maori simply because maoris are usually better at this work than pakehas maoris dont like the cold though it seems there are few of them in the freezing chambers even though the pay is good there in the last few years maori workers have been especially encouraged to take on responsible positions and at present three out of fifteen supervisors are maori with seven more training for the job this is quite different from the situation a few years ago when maoris had responsible jobs at the works and when things did not always go smoothly as regards the maori employees there the change in atmosphere which has occurred since then is due to a new managements intelligent interest in the welfare of their employees one aspect of this is the especial attention which they have paid to maori welfare both as regards the hostel and in other respects much of the credit is certainly due to mr watene who came to the company in the first instance simply as its welfare officer and only by chance found himself concentrating upon maori problems mr watene who comes from auckland he used to be with hellabys there has done a great deal to improve the situation at the works the company is certainly benefiting from their new policy also there hasnt been a single work stoppage at the gear meat works in the

fowler at the beginning of this september the annual maori competitions were held before a capacity audience in the opera house gisborne for the eleventh year in succession some of those who had been six seven and eightyearolds in the primary section when the competitions were first held were this year star performers in the front row of the seniors to begin with the competitions were between teams representing parishes or maraes the winner of one years aggregate shield became the hosts for next year they were responsible for organising the competitions and they took the profit which was made change of organisation four years ago the representatives of various teams got together and under the lead of some of the more successful teams decided to put the management of the competitions under a central committee composed of delegates from each performing team this move was greeted with some misgivings at the start but it has proved very successful the winning team in gaining the highest number of points now receives nothing more than the mana which accompanies the kariatiana tamararo shield but every team whatever its standard receives a mileage allowance of  a mile toward the expense of running buses with the district now spreading from waiapu in the north to maungahaumi in the west and to wairoa in the south hiring buses can be an extremely heavy burden a mileage cheque for £ to £ can make all the difference between a teams being able to compete and its having reluctantly to decide to stay at home –  – view image the quickness of the hand deceives the camera the mangatu juniors performing at gisborne this year this year for the first time new teams were able to hire piupius from the central committee at the rate of  a piupiu for seniors sixpence for juniors and threepence for primaries this is opening the door to many young teams who have so far been unable to raise funds to buy their own and have been diffident about borrowing them the central committee were fortunate in getting a poundforpound subsidy from the maori purposes fund board for the purchase of their piupius held on their own the competitions differ from others of their kind only in the fact that they are held in their own right they are not an associate part of a hui or church gathering but are held purely for the purpose of keeping alive this aspect of maori culture in the area there are no paid officers everyone who works does so in a voluntary capacity the central committee does not undertake billeting but a meal is provided for distant teams on arrival and there is a supper for teams and supporters at pohoorawiri marae after the concert on the final night all expenses are borne by the committee high standard maintained there is seldom much left in its bank account after the expenses and mileage grants are paid but everyone concerned has had the satisfaction of seeing a high standard of haka competition being maintained for yet another year the east coast districts have a very wide reputation for this class of maori culture and it is undoubtedly true that the incentive offered by these annual maori competitions has played a part in keeping interest so much alive in the wide district from which the competing teams come –  – view image annual celebrations at ngaruawahia this year the five thousand people who came to the annual coronation

the king movement in the past many of these people come as visitors rather than as actual adherents of the movement—but either way the popularity and success of ngaruawahia gatherings such as this

view image kumaras and kumara magic this stone carving is one of the religious statues usually known as ‘kumara gods’ it represented rongo the god who personified and protected kumaras and the days of the old maori religions it was placed with great ceremony beside the field of growing plants so that it would care for them this particular statue is now in the wanganui museum you will find other ones in other museums though there are not very many of them probably a lot were buried in the ground for safekeeping in time of danger and were lost when their owners didnt come back to collect them we have photographed this figure standing in a little kit of kiwi feathers this kit is not an old one so it should not be regarded as being strictly authentic but is is known that on important occasions maoris decorated their sacred carvings with feathers so probably it once did look something like this it would almost certainly be painted with red ochre as well –  – view image in most parts of new zealand kumaras were maoris most important food certainly they were their most important cultivated crop because of this kumara growing even more perhaps than fishing was a very sacred undertaking involving many solemn rituals when the first long whistling notes of the pipiwharauroa the shining cuckoo were heard in the spring and when the stars showed that the right time had come the ground was made ready for the kumara light warm sandy soil suits kumaras best and when the soil was heavy women and slaves used to carry hundreds of baskets of gravel and sand to lighten it if much land was to be planted the men all around would form a working party to dig the ground—perhaps twenty or thirty or forty men all keeping time as they dug swinging their ko rhythmically from side to side and singing an ancient chant often they ornamented their heads and the tops of their ko with feathers and sometimes they hung aurei the white crescentshaped matpins of bone from the tops of the ko these clattered together as they dug making a pleasant sound behind them came other men who heaped the soil into mounds fields were tapu the field where the kumaras were to grow had to be made tapu as part of this ceremony and usually before the kumaras were planted long poles were brought and placed upright around the field these poles represented the gods connected with the cultivation of the kumara—gods such as rongo maui kahukura and marihaka sometimes the people put the dried heads of famous ancestors upon the tops of these poles and sometimes they brought other bones of their ancestors also painted with red ochre and ornamented with feathers these were put to watch over the fields so that their mana might ensure food for their descendants sometimes stone statues such as the one which we illustrate were also brought to guard the fields these seem usually to have represented rongo the chief of the gods associated with agriculture but some statues had other names mokoia island in lake rotorua for instance was a very tapu island largely because of the presence of the ancient statue called matuatonga which is still there today kumaras grew very well on mokoia and this was attributed to the great powers of matuatonga because of this each year before the planting began the tohungas from the surrounding districts would bring their seedkumara to the island so that they could touch the figure of matuatonga thereby gaining its mana ritual of planting the day on which the field was planted was very sacred the planters arrived at the field before sunrise and the tohunga chanted a prayer to rongo while they all faced towards the rising sun then the priest took a sacred basket of kumara and planted them with ritual gestures in a specially tapu part of the field after this the men planted the rest of the field when the work was over they ate a ceremonial meal of kumara from two sacred ovens this was part of the ritual of removing the tapu which rested upon them during the planting while the plants were growing it was forbidden for strangers to approach them if in travelling across the country you accidentally stumbled across the other tribes kumara plantations you were very likely to be attacked during the summer the only people allowed near the kumara were the workman who did the weeding when the stars showed that the time had come to harvest the kumara there were once again elaborate ceremonies performed by the tohunga and once again the men working the fields no women were allowed were in a tapu condition after all crop was lifted and after ceremonial offerings of kumara had been made to the gods and all the necessary rituals were performed it was the time of year for going visiting a time when neighbouring friendly tribes entertained each other with elaborate feasts when kumara and fish were displayed in great piles on tall platforms and there were speeches games dancing singing and festivity readers interested in the nature and significance of the ceremonies by which the tohunga ensured fertility for the fields will find an authoritative and very interesting discussion of this in j p johansens ‘studies in maori rites and myths’  over the page we publish one of the many different stories which tell how the kumara first reached new zealand –  – view image this carving in a meetinghouse at manutuke near gisborne depicts the bird on whose back pourangahua flew to aotearoa how the kumara came to aotearoa pourangahua was a man who lived on the east coast of the north island near where the town of gisborne now stands he and his wife had a small son whom they loved very much now when this child grew big enough to run about they noticed something very strange their son kept on poking out his tongue and he did this always in the same direction toward the sea if he was walking along he would turn around and poke it out if he was lying down he would roll over and do so pourangahua and his wife asked themselves what this could mean they thought of many things but in the end pourangahua said ‘perhaps our son is hungry’ and his wife agreed that this must be so then the two of them brought the child great quantities of the best food they could find fernroot and berries fish eels pigeons and tuis but it was no use still he continued to poke his tongue in the direction of the sea then pourangahua said ‘the food for which our son hungers must be across the sea i will go in my canoe to find it’ so he said farewell to his wife and son and paddled out into the vast ocean for many days he travelled and saw no land then at last he reached an island the people on this island made him welcome and took him to their village there they set before him a strange food porangahua ate this and found that it was much better than any food he had ever tasted it was the kumara which was not grown in his own land then pourangahua knew that it was the kumara for which his son had been hungry pourangahua stayed for some time on the island as a guest of that people and their priest tane but after a while he became homesick and wished to go again to his own country however his canoe had disappeared and there was no way for him to return tane saw that his friend was sad and asked –  – view image him the cause of this when pourangahua had told him tane said ‘there is a way for you to go but it is very dangerous only the bravest of men could attempt it if you wish to return to your own land i will lend you my bird you must sit upon its back and it will carry you across the ocean’ this bird was a pet of tanes a fierce and beautiful creature with huge wings ‘and there is yet more danger’ tane said ‘after a time you will come to a mountain called hikurangi on this mountain there lives the monster tama and as you fly past him he will attack you therefore you must go past as the sun is setting at this time of day the level rays of the sun will blind his eyes so that he will not be able to see you and you will escape his clutches ‘there are as well two conditions which i will require of you if you borrow my bird you must treat him with kindness and you must alight from his back as soon as you reach your country otherwise he will not be able to return past the monster at the time when it is safe to do so’ pourangahua promised tane that he would abide by these conditions and he climbed on to the birds huge back he took with him a basket of kumaras so that he might grow this wonderful food in his own land then the bird clapped its great wings and rose in the air it flew fast and high above the ocean until it came to the mountain where the monster tama lived then the monster reached out to catch and devour them but the sun was almost setting and its rays came straight across the water and blinded tamas eyes and thus they escaped this peril at last pourangahua saw in the distance the hills of his home but then he forgot the two promises he had made to tane he had said he would treat the bird with kindness but now he reached out and pulled a long feather from its back this feather sank down through the water beneath them and at the bottom of the ocean it grew into a tall spreading tree but that is another story pourangahua had also promised that he would alight from the bird as soon as they came to his country but now he was so eager to see his wife and son again that he forgot this and made the bird take him all the way to his own village because of this by the time the bird flew back it was the middle of the day at this time the monsters eyes were not blinded by the sun and as the bird came past him he seized and devoured it when he heard of the fate of his bird the priest tane through his magic sent across the sea the three diseases which attack the kumara so it is because of pourangahua that the maori people have the kumara but it is because of pourangahuas unkindness that they must work so hard to cultivate it and it does not always flourish  when a yearold auckland maori shoemaking apprentice won the £ first prize in the golden kiwi a few months ago he sought to buy a house for his wife and himself when the youth pleasant presentable and welldressed told a group housing salesman he wanted something about £ and would pay cash the salesman laughed—and lost a sale after buying a house from a vendor who took him seriously the youth sought to buy furniture for it from a leading city furniture store the salesman showed him only junk would not listen when told the customer wanted quality—and lost a threefigure order  mr f b katene has recently retired from his position as district welfare officer for the ikaroa district an extensive district which extends from cooks strait south to the manawatu wairarapa wellington and hawkes bay he served four years overseas in active service during world war i worked for a time as land agent in wellington then in the new zealand railways till  since then he has been with the maori affairs department for a period of  years in wellington mr katene is better known as ‘uncle fred’ perhaps a phrase that explains the virtues of this sympathetic kindly and quiet gentleman his work has not been a job to him but a lifes work of sheer devotion to the needs of the maori people and the mission of racial harmony on a personal and group level without men like fred katene the ngati poneke association would not be the respected and vigorous organisation that it is today there have been many times when i felt mr katene was the ngatiponeke association like all men in ‘needle’ positions he has been subject to frequent criticism many destructive but with a smile and a shrug he has carried on his merry way with continued success wherever there is ‘dirty’ work to be done during or after social gatherings there you will find ‘uncle fred’—keeping things going and planning behind the scenes in his daily welfare duties he has always been energetic and persistent whereever he is—and usually he is there whether it be the magistrates court conferences tribal meetings youth gatherings or church meetings—‘uncle fred’ stands out as a distinctive and alert personality his retiring from the ‘old school’ of welfare officers means the passing of an era—his day was not the day of the trained social scientist but a time when success depended more on an officers personality personal

hundred others with much animation recently at tauranga a conference last september was attended by  people from a wide area and five discussion groups exchanged ideas on education health housing and employment it was this conference too that the muchdebated question ‘should women be able to speak on maraes’ was raised in some parts of the country they have done so for hundreds of years in other parts particularly in the arawa district they are never allowed to do this there was much passionate oratory on this subject especially from the arawa men present after the voting on the question had twice been disputed tradition finally won by  votes to  second ruatoria conference there was also a conference at ruatoria at labour weekend there had been one conference there earlier this year in may this was so successful that committees were set up which studied specific topics raised at that time and presented the results of their researches at this second conference in the first conference the chief subject discussed was education in the second by a natural progression the emphasis was on employment some of the delegates who discussed a wide range of subjects at the waiariki regional

voyage which he hopes to make back in the direction of hawaiki the homeland of the maori we mention this fact because a background of filing cabinets and office paraphernalia isnt really a very suitable one for a man with such very outdoor ambitions department to find out the regulations concerning mr metekingi had just been to see the marine small craft on ocean voyages the forestry department to enquire about trees for the canoe the national publicity department and several other government departments he said he was very encouraged by the interest his idea was causing and that if finance an estimated p can be obtained and if the project receives the support of the maori people he is convinced that such a voyage would be practical and worthwhile doublehulled canoe the canoe is to be a doublehulled one as were the canoes which originally came to new zealand there are still some people he said who have the knowledge to make canoes and who know the correct karakia to recite in connection with this noone knows exactly where hawaiki is but the immediate settingoff place is generally agreed to be tahiti and before this perhaps hawaii hawaii has a special interest for mr metekingi because of the polynesian village which the mormon church is building there at present he is a member of the mormon faith and would very much like to there for the opening of this village next september spirit of adventure now he is looking for thirty men maoris for preference who possess the necessary spirit of adventure for an expedition of this kind—‘im not interested in anyone who says it cant be done the men i want must have a positive outlook and be prepared for some degree of hardship with cheerfulness and optimism’ the vessel will have to carry radio lifeboats lifebelts and rafts but apart from this he plans to make the conditions as traditional as possible the main diet for all will be taro and kumera and a quantity of dried fish and karaka berries will also be included ‘as far as im concerned at the moment there will be nothing cooked on the voyage everything will be either dried or preserved and for the entire trip members of the expedition will be living on a spartan diet’ training would be required and much of it would have to be done in their own time selfdiscipline would be a basic requirement because the early maori voyagers were able to travel for long distances without water one other difficulty will be that the ocean winds are not nearly as favourable for a voyage from new zealand to the central pacific as they are for canoes coming in the other direction mr metekingi gives his reasons for the voyage as being sentimental historical and scientific and hopes to be able to make a start in a few months sometimes it is pretty puzzling to

maori club kiwi md in  ep both records reviewed in this issue have been on sale for some time they are presented by two of the best maori groups in the country ‘maori action songs’ is an unpretentious little record which makes very pleasant listening because it was originally designed merely to illustrate a number of action songs featured in a book which was subsequently published the record does not really show the versatility and brilliance of the putiki group to the best advantage but there is little fault to find in what is essentially a competent presentation of straight action songs understandably they are refreshingly free of the jazzingup which seems almost compulsory in many of the maori discs which have appeared recently ‘kuarongorongo’ and ‘te ope tuatahi’ have not been recorded for some years and make a welcome appearance in this record songs of enchantment st josephs maori girls college choir viking vp in   lp ‘songs of enchantment’ will similarly please any who purchase it the technical quality of the recording is very good indeed and this is matched by the clarity of diction and pleasing harmony of the performers a numbers of old chestnuts such as ‘po atarau’ and ‘pokarekare’ are given an airing along with several items which as far as i know have not previously been recorded such as ‘maranga mai’ ‘kumea’ and others it is a shame though that on a record of such a generally high standard there are some uneven patches ‘po atarau’ for example gets away to a very shaky start and there is a tendency towards stridency in some of the items ‘karu’ would be greatly improved by a variation in volume and emphasis to achieve some light and shade i do wish producers of records would realise that the reverse side of the cover can be put to better use than advertising other records a few notes on the items are always appreciated especially by european listeners and forgive my ignorance but just where is st josephs maori girls college the cover of

nz reviewed by john booth in  the government set up a commission of enquiry to look into all aspects of education in new zealand after hearing the views of many different people and seeing for themselves what was being done in schools all over the country the commission has brought out a massive and most valuable report of over eight hundred pages although the department of education acknowledges that there are many problems facing the  maori children in new zealands schools the commission was not asked specifically to examine maori education everywhere it looked however it saw that overhead above the ordinary difficulties facing every child and every school maori children and maori schools had special difficulties that could only be overcome by making special provision for extra help just as is done for other children who are handicapped in some way some maoris might be worried by the thought that more money should be spent on their children than on most pakeha children they do not want any special privileges this however is not how the educational authorities look at the situation because it is their job to give equal opportunity to every child no matter where he comes from and to help him climb as high as he can up the hill of education some groups are going to cost more to educate than others but whatever the cost the country cannot afford to have the talents of a large section of the population going to waste ways to help realising the importance of maori education the commission devotes a whole chapter to it in this report it makes it clear that there is a very great effort needed now by all concerned with the education of our maori children there are so many of them who have the ability to do well at school but who for a variety of reasons are not successful there are so many who because they have not been able to get the most out of their education must always stay in jobs that make use of only half their intelligence the commission makes twentythree recommendations in connection with maori education all of which it thinks will help your children in one way or another while the report deals with the problems of teaching maori of providing scholarships big enough to meet the cost of boardingschools of meeting the needs of the preschool child most attention will probably be focused on the suggestion that the department of education should aim at handing over all maori schools to education board control within the next ten years at first sight this looks as if it will be a most unpopular suggestion we all know how proud many settlements are of their maori schools and how strongly they have opposed this change in the past what the report proposes however is going to give far more than it takes away and deserves careful thought on the part of all maori parents at the present time only onechild of the maori children at primary schools attend the maori schools which are administered by the department of education the other twothirds attend schools run by education boards even though some of them have only maori children on their rolls the commission proposes that all schools with more than a certain proportion of maori children should be classed as ‘maori service’ schools being given special assistance on a higher scale than maori schools receive at present these maori service schools would have extra money for library books extra teachers to help children overcome reading difficulties and other specialists to guide the pupils in their school work and to advise parents how to help their children this would apply to secondary schools as well as to primary ‘a special need’ probably some people will say that maoris should be content with the same education that is available to everyone else this is a shallow argument that supposes all children to be the same what the schools try to do is to provide the very best education for all children whether they are bright dull or only average whether they are blind in hospital or perfectly healthy whether they are islanders pakehas or maoris the commission says this ‘that maori education must become an area of special need requiring special measures and inevitably increased expenditure it the commission believes that the maori has as good a right to claim this from our community as have any other groups where children are handicapped through no fault of their own…’ the recognition of this special need is a good starting point not everyone will agree with the commissions next step the replacement of maori schools under the education department with maori service schools under the boards in the writers view however the gains should be far greater than the losses and should result in a far better educational deal for maori children than they get at present –  – view image ‘new zealand in colour’ vols i  ii a h  a w reed each vol s these big twin volumes contain wellprinted colour photographs of new zealand scenery

him up—some children still come to school scared out of their wits with stories about the teacher before he starts here are some ways you can help him to learn to read before he comes to school it helps if he has had some picture book to look at some simple toys to play with and if he has had things explained to him does your three or fouryearold ask ‘why’ all the time if he doesnt he ought to another useful thing is to take the new child along to school yourself two or three times before he actually starts this helps him to get used to the idea that soon he will be going to stay there all day read your children stories or tell them about what things were like when you were small—or if you havent got time for this get one of the other children to get a book from the infant mistress to read the small ones it helps to keep them quiet too use kindergarten of the air and the childrens session on the radio join the infant mothers club or the pta if you possibly can take sonny to a play centre—you may find theres one near your home perhaps one thats just being started as many are these days in the ‘standards’ after about two years in the infant department sonny will go into standard one he has learned to read is everything going to be plain sailing now in the primer classes and the early standards nearly all the childs time was spent in learning how to recognize words on a page learning new words and reading simple stories meanings were simple so that the stories could be read easily and stories were told in a very few words the words which any child who has learned english fairly well uses when he speaks—words such as come little see dog run and so on now sonny learned his english and i hope his maori too from you and the rest of the family if your english is not very fluent then he has to learn his correct english somewhere else teachers help a little but his main learning will come from reading and writing you know i cant think of any more important thing for a primary school child to do than read widely and well every day every one of us has to read something whether it is for fun to get information or to keep ourselves alive put it this way—all the

forever history read a book how people live in china read a book how to grow pumpkins read a book how to build a house bake a cake travel from auckland to wellington read a book to understand more about ourselves and other people read books books and more books do you see why i think reading is so important very well but to do all these things the school has to have a very carefully worked out programme teachers are very conscious of this and all the time they are trying to keep up with new ideas about teaching children to read at an evening course in auckland recently more than eight hundred teachers attended each night every class has an important part to play in the reading programme but in general the upper standards are trying to do two things they are trying to keep childrens interest in reading high they have to compete against radio tv and pictures to do this and they are trying to help children to find out the meaning of what they read how to help now what can you do to help if you live in town you can make sure that your child is a member of the childrens section of the public library this usually costs a small fee but borrowing is free standard three or even earlier is about the right time for this make sure that the children borrow regularly and return their books on time in the country enquire from the school about library services the national library service god bless them supply all the schools with an issue of books each year some schools allow the children to take these home please see that they are returned the school has to pay for lost books but a book from the school library once every couple of weeks is really not enough for a child in standard four or higher most children in my class read three or more books in a week have a look at the books your children bring home you will probably find that you can get some fun out of them too time well spent reading takes time i know that it is a temptation to get sonny to go out and chop some more wood or his sister to go and give the baby its bottle these jobs are important children should help in the house but reading is important too and i dont think it will do any harm if after tea you turn off the radio for half an hour or so and say ‘sit down and read a book’ they will be getting something from it and so will you well theres my case in favour of reading as a school teacher i think that learning to read is important but not half as important as what comes from reading reading is a little like eating you have to vary things a bit—fish and chips is all right now and then but not every day of the week a comic may do to fill in half an hour but comics shouldnt be the only things that your boy or girl reads they dont let them learn nearly enough about the things they need to know things reading can tell them the schools part was to start your children off in reading your part is to see that they get the food their minds should have and dont have to go hungry the minister of transport mr mcalpine says that he is concerned at the number of maoris killed on the roads each year ‘last year  were killed nearly three times the rate of europeans on a percentage basis ‘that is the known number with european names so common among maoris accidents involving maoris are not necessarily reported to us as such its a pretty frightening picture’ the maori usually was a

fiib –  – view image farming pests to watch for by a e gibson this month i would like to discuss some of the pests of farming which you are likely to have to deal with over the next few months damage done by these pests can be just as destructive on a sheep farm as on a dairy farm the grass grub it is important to understand the life cycle of the grass grub the adult beetle commonly known as the brown beetle is on the wing in november to early january eggs large and white are laid at least  inches in the soil and the young grubs hatch out in – days to start feeding on the roots of pasture plants these grubs grow over the summer autumn and spring feeding all the time and remain within – inches of the top of the ground until september or october when they burrow to a depth of from – inches to pupate—a new generation of beetles appearing in november to start another cycle most farmers are familiar with the type of damage done to pasture by large numbers of grass grubs in such circumstances most of the grass is killed and the dead turf can be rolled up like a carpet this type of damage is so obvious that no effort is required to persuade the farmer to use an insecticide to bring the grubs under control recent investigations however carried out by the dsir which involves the sampling of  paddocks in the north and south islands showed that whereas in grubfree pastures the leaf length could be as much as – inches in – weeks areas of the same paddocks harbouring – grubs per square foot had leaf lengths of only – inches the average reduction was over  inches in any – week period between the end of january and the end of august the pastures at no stage showed what farmers usually consider to be typical grass grub damage this rather startling discovery emphasises the necessity to treat pastures with ddt where grubs are known to exist in the district even though no damage is visible on a farm if ddt is properly used it will proof the pasture against grass grub damage one pound of  per cent ddt per acre should be used where no evidence of grub can be seen but where there is a likelihood that they do exist in other words this dressing will be an insurance and should be used particularly where new pastures are sown down where a pasture has been attacked and grubs are working actively the application rate should be doubled to two pound of  per cent ddt per acre during march and april farmers are advised to go over the farm with a spade digging bits of soil to see if any grubs are present it should be remembered that they will be working in the top  inches of soil and that they will be very small at that time of the year ddt prills have proved an efficient insecticide and make it possible to apply accurately a comparatively small amount of ddt required per acre without first having to mix the insecticide with fertiliser the recommended rat of application in  lb of prills per acre which contains  lbs of  per cent ddt but good results have been recorded from the use of  lb prills that is  ½ lbs of  per cent ddt and this lesser amount may be an economic proposition the total cost including application should not exceed  per acre crickets the main effect of the cricket is felt in the auckland province particularly about hauraki plains and the north auckland peninsula where soils and climate are ideal for this pest when seasons are favourable the cricket population can build up to immense hordes which cause widespread damage to pastures it usually occurs around dry autumns when pastures plants have little power of recovery and it continues until the cooler weather when again the plants lack the vigour required to repair damage from february onward the light coloured cigarshaped eggs about a tenth of an inch long are deposited by the female into the turf or just below the soil surface some eggs hatch in the following few weeks if conditions are satisfactory but generally it does not begin until october a nymph emerges from the egg which is similar to an adult but is wingless and very small it begins to feed immediately and as it feeds passes through a succession of moults until it becomes a winged adult it is usually near the adult stage before damage is noticed the cricket is a surface feeder it lives on rye grass as the most favoured pasture and although cocksfoot is readily eaten by the cricket it has strong powers of recovery from damage clovers are much less attractive and are usually left until –  – view image other species are eliminated as this damage is always associated with dry weather and as the crickets will also consume any seed which has fallen there is little hope of recovery of the pasture dieldrin applied as a dust in dieldrin superphosphate at  cwt to the acre kills crickets quickly and effectively in this form  ozs of dieldrin is used per acre dusting with ddt is not effective early february is the most effective time to treat affected pastures as if they are treated too early in december or january a second crop of crickets may infest the area but on the other hand treatment should not be delayed until pasture damage is severe the army worm the army caterpillar which is often referred to as army worm is the caterpillar stage of a common native nightflying moth it has often devastated crops in summer or early autumn and in a number of districts has severely damaged pasture on river flats and swamp areas usually after summer flood followed by warm muggy weather an attack by army caterpillar cannot be predicted with complete precision but we can tell when conditions are suitable for the pest and keep a close watch for it hay after mast especially paspallum newly sown pastures or cereal crops or land subject to summer flooding are all vulnerable to army worm infestation and should be watched very carefully with a view to making remedial measures caterpillars usually confine their feeding to sunny faces on hill country and shady faces are generally not depleted they prefer plants of the grass family and the way in which they avoid patches of dominant clover pasture is really remarkable thus areas of pasture showing high fertility with plenty of clovers are usually not affected if unchecked they may continue to feed well into june caterpillars can be controlled by spraying with either ddt or dieldrin and either killed off completely or prevented from moving on to fresh areas effective sprays applied by helicopter or aeroplane are  ½ pints of  per cent dieldrin in – gallons of water according to the lankness of the growth where water is being used or else  pints of  per cent ddt in similar quantities of water per acre dieldrin is much quicker acting than ddt but the latter is quite effective a method of control is for a band of  to  feet in width to be sprayed with one pass of the aeroplane or helicopter and the perimeter of the advancing caterpillars half of the band is applied on the advancing caterpillars and half on the
