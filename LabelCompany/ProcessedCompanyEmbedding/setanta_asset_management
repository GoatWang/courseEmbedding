what is the background location  ownership of setanta asset management  how is setanta different to other asset managers  what is the background location  ownership of setanta asset management company background setanta is a dedicated value manager investing in attractively valued companies within a global sector framework setanta has built a strong track record in global equity management delivering out performance in nine of the ten calendar years since we were appointed manager of the global equity fund in june  the global equity strategy is the research engine at setanta the majority of setanta’s regional and specialist strategies’ holdings are selected from the stocks held in the global equity strategy which is also part of many of setanta’s balanced strategies setanta has been managing global equities along sector sleeves as part of a larger balanced portfolio since its inception in  location setanta is based in dublin ireland and the portfolio management and investment decisions for all products and the global equity strategy are made and implemented by the investment team in dublin the client servicing team is also based in the same office ownership setanta was established in  and is a wholly owned subsidiary of canada life irish holding company limited the greatwest life assurance company acquired canada life in   the greatwest life assurance

insurance investment retirement savings and reinsurance businesses primarily in canada and europe greatwest life has more than c billion in assets under administration for current information on greatwest life’s and canada life’s rating and financial strength see the corporate information section on wwwgreatwestlifecom wwwcanadalifecom  as of th june   how is setanta different to other asset managers we are dedicated value managers it is estimated that only  of the global investment community follow a true value investment strategy because of many factors fund managers generally revert to portfolios which do not differ significantly from the index  in many cases investment horizons are short and fund managers often make decisions based on their expectation about the future at setanta we seek to calculate the difference between price and value through fundamental research and then take a long term view we are investors not traders in contrast to many of our peers who manage money within regional sector sleeves setanta have consistently focused on global sectors we are not afraid to be contrary we have always taken a global view of the world companies are global and where they are listed is becoming significantly less relevant our global equity fund has no geographic or market capitalisation restrictions we look at risk as the “risk of permanent impairment” we believe that the risk for any investment is that the value becomes permanently impaired we seek to mitigate this risk through thorough research our research focuses on three risks – financial operation and valuation risk with primary focus on the valuation as the risk of permanent impairment is increased if you pay too much for an investment we invest conservatively looking for a good “margin of safety” and a strong balance sheet the latter being one of a number of quality attributes that we look for  challenge culture is key to investment decisions at setanta we foster a culture of challenge the investment case for buying or selling a stock is presented to the investment team who act as ‘devils advocate’ by rigorously questioning assumptions and crucially questioning the valuation case this feedback from other portfolio managers with a different perspective and experience is extremely valuable to the investment process clear accountability of portfolio manager sharpens the decision making process setanta is somewhat unique in that each portfolio manager finds researches selects and presents each investment case to buy or sell a stock from the global sector they manage that is the portfolio manager and analyst role are combined this clear responsibility leads to better learning for the individual and a sharper investment decision making process register for our newsletter
