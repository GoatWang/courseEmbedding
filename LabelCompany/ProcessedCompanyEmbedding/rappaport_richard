german girl  nos  and  born  age – pittsburgh pennsylvania nationality american education carnegie mellon university brooklyn college known for painting richard rappaport born  in pittsburgh is a classically trained painter of portraits and largescale figurative works whose pictorial evolution has spiraled towards and away from the renaissance ideal for half a century in his work even when taking the image to abstraction rappaport keeps the iconic figure as primal source besides portraits of psychological depth rappaport in the tradition of painting as an act of remembrance borrows christian iconography to represent the holocaust the nigerian civil war and the war in vietnam a former student and friend of robert l lepper at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh pa rappaport is one of the artists influenced by lepper’s course “individual and social analysis” his  paper “robert lepper carnegie tech and the oakland project” is the principal source on lepper’s influence on andy warhol philip pearlstein mel bochner and jonathan borofsky when they were lepper’s students since  rappaport’s use of the advertisement pages of international art magazines as a place of exhibition has been his principal form of public presence this includes issues of art in america artforum flash art bomb modern painters world art the new criterion and limn contents  life and work  the carnegie tech years robert lepper  six characters in search  ship of fools july   the paris years iconic abstractions joseph accused  the new york years portraits in grattage the public theatre hangings  the return to pittsburgh a visit to paris the german girl  ashes in the wind the work of mourning a commemoration  awards and exhibitions  references  external links life and workedit from early on rappaport showed unusual promise in drawing the human face making emotionally credible portraits of family and friends from his eighth year on of which the culminating work is the reverential drawing of his greatgrandmother  made soon after his tenth birthday then for three years starting in fifth grade the young artist attends the carnegie institutes now the carnegie tam oshanter art class which is followed at thirteen by a year of saturday afternoons in traditional apprenticeship in painting with the realistsurrealist artist abe weiner already an accomplished draftsman at seventeen rappaport is awarded the gold medal in drawing in the national scholastic art  writing awards in the spring of  before entering the department of painting  design at carnegie institute of technology now carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh that autumn the same time his older brother robert rappaport who would become the television art director of the mike douglas show and the miss universe pagent enters the drama department in stage design the carnegie tech years robert lepper  six characters in searchedit one of the most significant works that will inform this artists future practice made while on christmas vacation his first year at carnegie tech is the four foot high self nude scratchboard  of himself waisthigh highlighting a bare arm shoulder and halfface against the black background it proves to be a watershed when eight years later the artist returns to the concept of scratchboard by adapting it to layers of oil paint on canvas in grattage works such as joseph accused  in which the image is made by scratching through the smoothed paletteknife applied top layer of cadmium red to the lighter midcolor of turquoise and yellowwhite base in august  the summer following his freshman year rappaport paints his first suite of mature portraits which include those of mrs ress  ann weiner  and the standing threequarter length self nude  whose straighton depictions of character relate to the portraits of alice neel whom the artist is unaware of at the time winning for himself the art departments leisser award for work done independently and affording him the occasion of his first exhibition of these portraits lining its central hallway at the beginning of his sophomore year his father on seeing the show gives him an account for art supplies which makes possible his painting large works on linen canvas for his remaining three years at school   burial of christ  detail from then on he is only nominally a student choosing his themes independently and working outside of the classroom that sophomore year with his sights on rembrant and titian while painting the first state of his mothers portrait woman with red hands  and burial of christ  whose stark representation an homage to the medieval villeneuvelesavignons pieta is the first of a number of works made over the years where he portrays himself in the role of the alienated outsider   family portraitdetail these are followed in his junior year by the doubleportrait of the actors michael tucker and laurie jefferson  and his own partial family portrait  that portrays only his mother younger brother ronald and himself during the highly emotional period when his parents have separated executed on rabbitskin glue sized but not primed linen canvas the faces in both paintings are built up from the absorbent weave that owe much to the example of edgar degas  especially that of the artists mother to degas portrait of a young woman  that summer of  in six characters in search  the artist paints himself as rebellious protagonisttarget of ridecule and prosecutor of judgment that takes its cue from michelangelos christ in the last judgment and senior year jewess accused  which shifts emphasis in the story of christ and the woman taken in adultery to express the ostracism and accusation of crimes levied against the jews that lead to the holocaust this is followed in his last semester by we are all somnambulists  all of which are painted from live models   six characters in search   jewess accused however rappaports work is out of phase with the dominant art movements emerging in the sixties pop art minimalism and conceptualism and at odds with new realism whose program of objectivity in representing the human figure by eliminating all subjective response implying the spiritual dimension discredits the overt romanticism in rappaports painting only alice neel and larry rivers in new york francis bacon and lucian freud in england and balthus in france are privileged to paint figuratively with any response to an inner life given their subjects or any implied narrative consequently rappaports practice is marginalized already as a student and in these early works expressing universal themes of the human condition his painting takes on an autobiographical aspect apart from painting rappaport is constantly drawing his most evolved graphic series he does his sophomore year in a series of drawings lithographs and etchings executed directly from a theatrically lit display case at the carnegie museum of a naturally mumified skeletal figure buried in fetal position which was already a fascination for the artist when a fifth grader at the museums tamoshanter classes and to which used as a symbolic motif of the holocaust the artist will return thirtyfive years later in painting the ovens womb  x drawn in a simplified manner as if cave painting on a color field of cadmium red in the ground floor sculpture studios rappaport regularly sees jonathan borofsky who is a sculpture major two years ahead of him and during his sophomore year becomes better acquainted with mel bochner who having graduated five years before has returned to pittsburgh for the year as both come from the same neighborhood rappaport gives the older artist rides in the evenings to the campus where they work in the print room and from which bochner often visits robert l lepper in his studio just down the hallway and on returning shares his enthusiasm for leppers speculative conversations on art practice in the autumn of  that following year rappaport takes leppers the oakland project and retrospective classes entitled individual and social analysis and soon forms a close bond with the older man however while rappaport is fascinated by leppers logic and eloquence on a broad range of perceptual and communicative issues his direction cannot be categorized with that of leppers famous former students andy warhol philip pearlatein mel bochner and jonathan borofsky who made conscious of changing hierarchies of value due to the impact of the machine and media on society are directly influenced by leppers work in industrial design and bauhaus leanings addressing the potential of technologys role in contemporary art practice which along with leppers conceptual paradigm communication as intention expressed and followed logically leads to making art the focus for following human reason engaged in the perception of its own awareness  a strategy seen in bochners conceptual practice rappaport as much as he remains devoted to lepper for the next twentyfive years and all the while following the progression of leppers ideas in the evolution of the abovementioned artists work consequently leading to his writing in  robert lepper carnegie tech and the oakland project cannot be considered in leppers camp this will be made more evident some seventeen years after leppers death in his essay robert lepper  six characters in search that reviews leppers legacy four decades later instead rappaport keeps to his own agenda already evident in the burial of christ painted the year before meeting lepper which merges in expressive figurative painting the autobiographical with the sociopolitical which are options in artistic direction laid out in leppers introduction to his classes and exemplify the expressive force in what lepper is pointing to in the retrospective whose primary goal bracketedoff from the sociopolitical evokes the emotive psychic power of unmediated memory in response to autobiographical material most importantly rappaports departure in the late s from traditional brush painting to his employing grattage technique does owe a debt to leppers own example of arriving at the conclusion that the paintbrush was not his tool but those of the industrial fabricator were and in looking back to the great figurative tradition of western art as a resource and inspiration rappaport is doing so informed by leppers latemodernistpostmodernist perspective and his injunction to allow for the unexpected by letting the process suggest where the work should go and not rush to expectations that set limitations on expression the autumn of  proves to be an auspicious time when soon after beginning robert leppers class rappaport meets herbert a simon one of the most influential social scientists of the th century whose computer simulated pioneer work in decision making parallels the communicative functions in leppers conceptual strategies and following rappaports gift of a lithograph drawing of simons daughter barbara which initiates their acquaintance simon becomes an early supporter and longtime friend of the young artist and whose portrait herbert a simon  rappaport paints in the summer of  for carnegie mellon university as its first nobel prize laureate on the faculty and which is followed a week later by leppers portrait ship of fools july edit ship of fools by richard rappaport  upon graduation in june  rappaport is offered a loft space on west th street new york for the summer where he paints his first work that is no longer dependent on live models but instead employs an expressively gestural execution in drawing the figures with large areas of washedon color taking a cue from a photograph of chagall painting his murals for lincoln center on the floor as well as japanese scroll painting in a book left by his benefactor which includes an image of a typhoon swept boat in the mongol armadas failed invasion of japan in the sixteenth century rappaport with hieronymus boschs version already in mind for its subject begins painting ship of fools  within hours of the announcement of the united states first bombing raids into north vietnam escalating the war ship of fools not only marks a major historical event artistically it marks a turning point from which the twentyoneyearold artist enters into the beginning phase of a fouryear evolution towards an iconographic figuration that in some works of  comes close to reducing traces of the figurative element almost entirely   oratory mural detail  the annunciation rappaports next major work in that evolution the oratory mural  comes as a result of exhibiting ship of fools at skibo hall at carnegie mellon university in november  when father philip walsh of the pittsburgh oratory commissions rappaport to paint a triptych for their proposed retreat house and arranges for the artist a studio space in the former chancellery behind st pauls cathedral in pittsburgh where the artist paints the canvasses on the floor in its gothic library the mural declined remains rolled for twenty years whereupon through the auspices of michael a roosevelt it finds a home on extended loan to the institutes for the achievement of human potential philadelphia in    oratory mural escape through the desert in working out the iconography on this fourteen by twentyfive foot triptych the artist becomes an admirer of the frescoes of giotto though only the escape through the desert on the left canvas of the oratory mural suggests openly that influence and in general in spite of the seriousness of the subject in giottos cycle on the life of christ in the scrovegni chapel there is a playfulness in the pantomime that informs its celebratory mood that rappaport responds to in his mural and that is expressed in the decorative modernist function of the gessoed patterns playing in tandem with the figurative representation on a structural level it is in works a few years later however hidden his example where giottos condensed compositions within the square that collapse the architectural space or as in the cycle on st francis in assisi the mountainous canyons in which his figures find themselves that becomes a source of inspiration for rappaports more abstracted figurative works contained in shallow relief as in valley of the kings  and asleep by the tomb  giotto however is not alone as an iconographic source for the mural in robert campins annunciation  the round table that discreetly separates the angel gabriel from mary becomes for rappaports image the circle of acceptance upon which mary is about to place her hand and where rappaport adds above her head the face of another angel representing her consciousness of her sons future looking upwards to the baptism and from which evolves several years later into the surreal and abstracted motif of courtship in providence in motion  while working on the oratory mural the artist having graduated nonetheless is given for a short time the privileged use of the print room at carnegie tech transcribing onto a large deeply bit etching plate a linear adaptation of his mothers portrait woman with red hands  the artist fashions a severe icon of his mother which when combined with the motif in the etching of evelyn ress with the double view of her head one dropping below the other as she falls asleep becomes the prototype for a series of paintings that start with mourning clown  that expresses the artists sorrow over the death of his good friend mrs ress and the work of mourning  that turns to the greater theme of the holocaust and which make a seamless progression into the works that evolve in france in the autumn of  the paris years iconic abstractions joseph accusededit in september  upon being awarded the chaloner prize through the rome prize competition rappaport begins what would be an almost threeyear sojourn in france first living in vincennes and the following year through the auspices of darthea speyer the americaninparis gallerist is awarded a residency at the cite internationale des arts   father vulture holy butterfly although picassos weeping woman is suggested in these works in paris as is tutankhamuns gilded face mask and rouaults the king in biafran madonna st ver  and rabbi  along with the formal structure in the romanesque altarpieces of cimabue in father vulture holy butterfly  and the paintencrusted shieldlike shapes of oceanic effigies in death has no master  it is his own etchings and above all the etching process itself from rolling a coating of wax onto the plates surface  to drawing into that wax ground  to scraping away unwanted lines after the plate is bit in the acid bath that leads rappaport to the way he will soon execute in paint in a twostage process the works of  and  that are shaped by scraping away the multiple layers of paint applied in the initial stage of the image both when malleable and once dry to form reductively the final image  a process to which the artist gives the general term in grattage as such the tactile almost violent manner in the acknowledgment of process and material in forming these primitivemodernist figurative icons which are as much carved and sculpted as painted and the resulting symbolism that explores the devastation of time upon mans endeavors or portrays malevolence against the innocent anticipates neoexpressionism and relates to the work of anselm kiefer   joseph accuseddetail two years later in the autumn of  while his solo exhibition of the more recent of these iconic abstractions is hanging at the cite des arts rappaport upon reading thomas manns joseph and his brothers begins joseph accused  followed by joseph in the pit  and jacob in mourning  which are made in a scratchboardlike technique in which the drawn image is scratched through the dry surface layer of cadmium red into the base layers of turquoise and yellowwhite on the canvas  a method to which the artist also gives the term grattage and which its effect in joseph accused suggests ancient egyptian temple wall reliefs precisely cut into red granite in which the figures are styled as a consequence in shallow space deliberately flattened and silhouetted by overstated contours the ritualized gesture of josephs arms extending downwards as if bound together to two open hands a sign of supplication and innocence is a studied and mimetic quotation this combined with the addition of the second arm and hand is an obvious restructuring of the desperately outstretched arm and hand of the man being strangled in max beckmanns die nacht which rapport sees as a symbolic precursor to kristallnacht the nazi night of broken glass the night of terror perpetrated on the jewish community on november   generally considered marking the beginning of the holocaust consequently rapport considers his representation of the biblical story of joseph accused with its formalistic and iconographic pictorial dependency on the art of max beckmann as an iconographic statement for modern history to the horrific antisemitism in nazi germany and a testimony to the theme stranger in a strange land in thomas manns four book epic honoring the ancient hebraic spiritual quest the new york years portraits in grattage the public theatre hangingsedit throughout most of the s while simultaneously painting works that have evolved from the iconic abstractions of paris rappaport makes over twenty portraits in grattage beginning with the double portrait of jake and esther schwartz  in philadelphia while staying at his brothers on his return from france in the summer of  for the sculptor barbara schwartz the model for potiphars wife in joseph accused then once in new york luke  that will be shown along with works by warhol and philip pearlstein in new york city  carnegie mellon alumni exhibition at westbroadway gallery in  the tapestrylike devotional icon of the guru baba muktananda  and its technical twin the white sisters  that evolves through several metamorphosis then finally scrapeddown to a bare tint of color on the canvas threads leaving only the lyrical contours as an art nouveau tableau finished just months before the artists return to traditional brush painting with the barren womb    jack  richard  detail but before his new york period begins the artist is stricken and operated for pericarditis in the spring of  spending most of the summer at his brothers in philadelphia convalescing before needing a second operation in early september then two theatre friends of his brothers from the carnegie tech drama department invite the artist to new york by commissioning their portraits in grattage the first the double portrait of jack  richard  of the stage designer jack doepp and aspiring opera singer richard magpion is made during the artists stay at jacks studio on west th street for the remainder of the year and owes the decorative aspect and theatrical staging of the two figures emerging from the densely luminous red surface to gustav klimts gilded paintings the portrait nonetheless is declined and five years later in  is purchased by pamela newhouse the second the more sober portrait of dean brown  is finished that spring when the artist moves to east seventh street in the east village manhattan   jacob in mourning in  at the home of conde nast publisher si newhouse jr rappaport is introduced to joseph papp the founding director of the new york public theatre who offers to hang the nine feet high joseph in the pit and jacob in mourning in the public theatres innerlobby they are installed that autumn of  and remain there till the autumn of  soon after their return the artist reworks joseph in the pit painting josephs hand red to stand for the painting of blood on the doorposts as a sign to warn away the angel of death in the passover story of exodus compounding it with the original story in genesis and adding the huge face of a female apparition suggesting that angel drawn from the portrait catherine kirkwood  that with the artist being the model for joseph adds an autobiographical layer to this episode of josephs struggle with selfdoubt that prefigures the story of jesus in the new testaments christ on the mount of olives in this rappaport follows the western art practice of the continuous narrative  the layering of stories separated by centuries while alluding to stories further into the future attacked late at night by a knifer while walking through tompkins square in the east village in early  rappaport shaken by the incident and discouraged after his paintings are taken down at the public theatre abandons his apartment on east seventh street and spends more than several months in washington dc before moving to brooklyn in  when he enters the masters program at brooklyn college with the thought of eventually teaching earning his mfa in  given a portion of his modest inheritance when his father is stricken by a major heart attack rappaport begins in the december  issue of art in america his first suite of multiple ad pages that continue in the following issues through april  coinciding with that last issue in april rappaport stages an exhibit in a carriagehouse studio at  downing street in the west village nyc of seven current paintings including the abode  and white madonna  attracting judd tully who intrigued by rappaports independent media campaign includes mention of it in his review for that summers issue of flash art international two years later rappaport joins the cooperative blue mountain gallery in new york where he has five solo exhibitions through  the return to pittsburgh a visit to paris the german girledit in  he returns to pittsburgh then after a series of seven selfportraits made in the summer of  a number of which are shown with blue madonna  at blue mountain gallery towards the end of that year that following summer upon being commissioned by herbert simon to paint his official portrait for carnegie mellon university the artist also begins a series of elders and former teachers which includes that of robert l lepper  writing in  robert lepper carnegie tech and the oakland project as a tribute to his former teacher who leaves a copy of it with his papers in the carnegie mellon university faculty archives a short threemonth sojourn to italy in late summer of  provides the artist the occasion to leave the expressionism of buddha from the cross  and red ashen skies    painting two works that restate in a more traditional manner standard renaissance themes the first a baptism later renamed narcissus    painted in florence in august and september and followed that october in the sienna countryside with an expulsion from the garden    both early states of these works are shown in the artists last exhibition at blue mountain gallery in new york in late december  into early january  after a romantic encounter in april  while visiting friends in paris the artist returns to france that autumn moving into a garden studio in vincennes for ten months there painting in a rite of exorcism the selfportrait the performer  as counterpart to the series of single female nudes the german girl which owe their eroticism to the example of egon schiele but without the latters explicitness an exhibition of these paintings is shown as la noia alemanya nua at galeria magdalena baxeras in barcelona in december  following an introduction by the cuban photographer herman puig who having photographed rappaport in the vincennes studio has invited the artist to visit barcelona four of puigs photographs of the artist sitting by his paintings are reproduced on advertisement pages in the flash art novemberdecember  issue and in artforum in the november  december  and

stretching back fortyfive years to jewess accused  here painted with reticence and deep respect for the human being is a parallel expression to the works addressing the disastrous consequences of barbarity as seen from the opposite side of that dark history those of anselm kiefer although one might wish to make a categorial statement on rappaports work given its emotional undercurrent its often painful subjectmatter and expressive execution it may be incorrect to place the whole body of work solely on the expressionist side of the classicalromantic divide without acknowledging that in his work as a whole there is a strong sense of formal structure and a tendency towards finding equalibrium that plays a reciprocal and balancing role to the more expressive dynamic and this may explain its spiralling evolution whereupon once reaching a saturation of effect in a period of work the artist returns to a grounding in order simplicity and coherence and always with reverence for

richard rappaport born  in pittsburgh is a classically trained painter of portraits and largescale figurative works whose pictorial evolution has spiraled towards and away from the renaissance ideal for half a century in his work even when taking the image to abstraction rappaport keeps the iconic figure as primal source besides portraits of psychological depth rappaport in the tradition of painting as an act of remembrance borrows christian iconography to represent the holocaust the nigerian civil war and the war in vietnam a former student and friend of robert l lepper at carnegie

the principal source on lepper’s influence on andy warhol philip pearlstein mel bochner and jonathan borofsky when they were lepper’s students since  rappaport’s use of the advertisement pages of

 external links life and workedit from early on rappaport showed unusual promise in drawing the human face making emotionally credible portraits of family and friends from his eighth year on of which the culminating work is the reverential drawing of his greatgrandmother  made soon after his tenth birthday then for three years starting in fifth grade the young artist attends the carnegie institutes now the carnegie tam oshanter art class which is followed at thirteen by a year of saturday afternoons in traditional apprenticeship in painting with the realistsurrealist artist abe weiner already an accomplished draftsman at seventeen rappaport is awarded the gold medal in drawing in the national scholastic art  writing awards in the spring of  before entering the department of painting  design at carnegie institute of technology now carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh that autumn the same time his older brother robert rappaport who would become the television art director of the mike douglas show and the miss universe pagent enters the drama department in stage design the carnegie tech years robert lepper  six characters in searchedit one of the most significant works that will inform this artists future practice made while on christmas vacation his first year at carnegie tech is the four foot high self nude scratchboard  of himself waisthigh highlighting a bare arm shoulder and halfface against the black background it proves to be a watershed when eight years later the artist returns to the concept of scratchboard by adapting it to layers of oil paint on canvas in grattage works such as joseph accused  in which the image is made by scratching through the smoothed paletteknife applied top layer of cadmium red to the lighter midcolor of turquoise and yellowwhite base in august  the summer following his freshman year rappaport paints his first suite of mature portraits which include those of mrs ress  ann weiner  and the standing threequarter length self nude  whose straighton depictions of character relate to the portraits of alice neel whom the artist is unaware of at the time winning for himself the art departments leisser award for work done independently and affording him the occasion of his first exhibition of these portraits lining its central hallway at the beginning of his sophomore year his father on seeing the show gives him an account for art supplies which makes possible his painting large works on linen canvas for his remaining three years at school   burial of christ  detail from then on he is only nominally a student choosing his themes independently and working outside of the classroom that sophomore year with his sights on rembrant and titian while painting the first state of his mothers portrait woman with red hands  and burial of christ  whose stark representation an homage to the medieval villeneuvelesavignons pieta is the first of a number of works made over the years where he portrays himself in the role of the alienated outsider   family portraitdetail these are followed in his junior year by the doubleportrait of the actors michael tucker and laurie jefferson  and his own partial family portrait  that portrays only his mother younger brother ronald and himself during the highly emotional period when his parents have separated executed on rabbitskin glue sized but not primed linen canvas the faces in both paintings are built up from the absorbent weave that owe much to the example of edgar degas  especially that of the artists mother to degas portrait of a young woman  that summer of  in six characters in search  the artist paints himself as rebellious protagonisttarget of ridecule and prosecutor of judgment that takes its cue from michelangelos christ in the last judgment and senior year jewess accused  which shifts emphasis in the story of christ and the woman taken in adultery to express the ostracism and accusation of crimes levied against the jews that lead to the holocaust this is followed in his last semester by we are all somnambulists  all of which are painted from live models   six characters in search   jewess accused however rappaports work is out of phase with the dominant art movements emerging in the sixties pop art minimalism and conceptualism and at odds with new realism whose program of objectivity in representing the human figure by eliminating all subjective response implying the spiritual dimension discredits the overt romanticism in rappaports painting only alice neel and larry rivers in new york francis bacon and lucian freud in england and balthus in france are privileged to paint figuratively with any response to an inner life given their subjects or any implied narrative consequently rappaports practice is marginalized already as a student and in these early works expressing universal themes of the human condition his painting takes on an autobiographical aspect apart from painting rappaport is constantly drawing his most evolved graphic series he does his sophomore year in a series of drawings lithographs and etchings executed directly from a theatrically lit display case at the carnegie museum of a naturally mumified skeletal figure buried in fetal position which was already a fascination for the artist when a fifth grader at the museums tamoshanter classes and to which used as a symbolic motif of the holocaust the artist will return thirtyfive years later in painting the ovens womb  x drawn in a simplified manner as if cave painting on a color field of cadmium red in the ground floor sculpture studios rappaport regularly sees jonathan borofsky who is a sculpture major two years ahead of him and during his sophomore year becomes better acquainted with mel bochner who having graduated five years before has returned to pittsburgh for the year as both come from the same neighborhood rappaport gives the older artist rides in the evenings to the campus where they work in the print room and from which bochner often visits robert l lepper in his studio just down the hallway and on returning shares his enthusiasm for leppers speculative conversations on art practice in the autumn of  that following year rappaport takes leppers the oakland project and retrospective classes entitled individual and social analysis and soon forms a close bond with the older man however while rappaport is fascinated by leppers logic and eloquence on a broad range of perceptual and communicative issues his direction cannot be categorized with that of leppers famous former students andy warhol philip pearlatein mel bochner and jonathan borofsky who made conscious of changing hierarchies of value due to the impact of the machine and media on society are directly influenced by leppers work in industrial design and bauhaus leanings addressing the potential of technologys role in contemporary art practice which along with leppers conceptual paradigm communication as intention expressed and followed logically leads to making art the focus for following human reason engaged in the perception of its own awareness  a strategy seen in bochners conceptual practice rappaport as much as he remains devoted to lepper for the next twentyfive years and all the while following the progression of leppers ideas in the evolution of the abovementioned artists work consequently leading to his writing in  robert lepper carnegie tech and the oakland project cannot be considered in leppers camp this will be made more evident some seventeen years after leppers death in his essay robert lepper  six characters in search that reviews leppers legacy four decades later instead rappaport keeps to his own agenda already evident in the burial of christ painted the year before meeting lepper which merges in expressive figurative painting the autobiographical with the sociopolitical which are options in artistic direction laid out in leppers introduction to his classes and exemplify the expressive force in what lepper is pointing to in the retrospective whose primary goal bracketedoff from the sociopolitical evokes the emotive psychic power of unmediated memory in response to autobiographical material most importantly rappaports departure in the late s from traditional brush painting to his employing grattage technique does owe a debt to leppers own example of arriving at the conclusion that the paintbrush was not his tool but those of the industrial fabricator were and in looking back to the great figurative tradition of western art as a resource and inspiration rappaport is doing so informed by leppers latemodernistpostmodernist perspective and his injunction to allow for the unexpected by letting the process suggest where the work should go and not rush to expectations that set limitations on expression the autumn of  proves to be an auspicious time when soon after beginning robert leppers class rappaport meets herbert a simon one of the most influential social scientists of the th century whose computer simulated pioneer work in decision making parallels the communicative functions in leppers conceptual strategies and following rappaports gift of a lithograph drawing of simons daughter barbara which initiates their acquaintance simon becomes an early supporter and longtime friend of the young artist and whose portrait herbert a simon  rappaport paints in the summer of  for carnegie mellon university as its first nobel prize laureate on the faculty and which is followed a week later by leppers portrait ship of fools july edit ship of fools by richard rappaport  upon graduation in june  rappaport is offered a loft space on west th street new york for the summer where he paints his first work that is no longer dependent on live models but instead employs an expressively gestural execution in drawing the figures with large areas of washedon color taking a cue from a photograph of chagall painting his murals for lincoln center on the floor as well as japanese scroll painting in a book left by his benefactor which includes an image of a typhoon swept boat in the mongol armadas failed invasion of japan in the sixteenth century rappaport with hieronymus boschs version already in mind for its subject begins painting ship of fools  within hours of the announcement of the united states first bombing raids into north vietnam escalating the war ship of fools not only marks a major historical event artistically it marks a turning point from which the twentyoneyearold artist enters into the beginning phase of a fouryear evolution towards an iconographic figuration that in some works of  comes close to reducing traces of the figurative element almost entirely   oratory mural detail  the annunciation rappaports next major work in that evolution the oratory mural  comes as a result of exhibiting ship of fools at skibo hall at carnegie mellon university in november  when father philip walsh of the pittsburgh oratory commissions rappaport to paint a triptych for their proposed retreat house and arranges for the artist a studio space in the former chancellery behind st pauls cathedral in pittsburgh where the artist paints the canvasses on the floor in its gothic library the mural declined remains rolled for twenty years whereupon through the auspices of michael a roosevelt it finds a home on extended loan to the institutes for the achievement of human potential philadelphia in    oratory mural escape through the desert in working out the iconography on this fourteen by twentyfive foot triptych the artist becomes an admirer of the frescoes of giotto though only the escape through the desert on the left canvas of the oratory mural suggests openly that influence and in general in spite of the seriousness of the subject in giottos cycle on the life of christ in the scrovegni chapel there is a playfulness in the pantomime that informs its celebratory mood that rappaport responds to in his mural and that is expressed in the decorative modernist function of the gessoed patterns playing in tandem with the figurative representation on a structural level it is in works a few years later however hidden his example where giottos condensed compositions within the square that collapse the architectural space or as in the cycle on st francis in assisi the mountainous canyons in which his figures find themselves that becomes a source of inspiration for rappaports more abstracted figurative works contained in shallow relief as in valley of the kings  and asleep by the tomb  giotto however is not alone as an iconographic source for the mural in robert campins annunciation  the round table that discreetly separates the angel gabriel from mary becomes for rappaports image the circle of acceptance upon which mary is about to place her hand and where rappaport adds above her head the face of another angel representing her consciousness of her sons future looking upwards to the baptism and from which evolves several years later into the surreal and abstracted motif of courtship in providence in motion  while working on the oratory mural the artist having graduated nonetheless is given for a short time the privileged use of the print room at carnegie tech transcribing onto a large deeply bit etching plate a linear adaptation of his mothers portrait woman with red hands  the artist fashions a severe icon of his mother which when combined with the motif in the etching of evelyn ress with the double view of her head one dropping below the other as she falls asleep becomes the prototype for a series of paintings that start with mourning clown  that expresses the artists sorrow over the death of his good friend mrs ress and the work of mourning  that turns to the greater theme of the holocaust and which make a seamless progression into the works that evolve in france in the autumn of  the paris years iconic abstractions joseph accusededit in september  upon being awarded the chaloner prize through the rome prize competition rappaport begins what would be an almost threeyear sojourn in france first living in vincennes and the following year through the auspices of darthea speyer the americaninparis gallerist is awarded a residency at the cite internationale des arts   father vulture holy butterfly although picassos weeping woman is suggested in these works in paris as is tutankhamuns gilded face mask and rouaults the king in biafran madonna st ver  and rabbi  along with the formal structure in the romanesque altarpieces of cimabue in father vulture holy butterfly  and the paintencrusted shieldlike shapes of oceanic effigies in death has no master  it is his own etchings and above all the etching process itself from rolling a coating of wax onto the plates surface  to drawing into that wax ground  to scraping away unwanted lines after the plate is bit in the acid bath that leads rappaport to the way he will soon execute in paint in a twostage process the works of  and  that are shaped by scraping away the multiple layers of paint applied in the initial stage of the image both when malleable and once dry to form reductively the final image  a process to which the artist gives the general term in grattage as such the tactile almost violent manner in the acknowledgment of process and material in forming these primitivemodernist figurative icons which are as much carved and sculpted as painted and the resulting symbolism that explores the devastation of time upon mans endeavors or portrays malevolence against the innocent anticipates neoexpressionism and relates to the work of anselm kiefer   joseph accuseddetail two years later in the autumn of  while his solo exhibition of the more recent of these iconic abstractions is hanging at the cite des arts rappaport upon reading thomas manns joseph and his brothers begins joseph accused  followed by joseph in the pit  and jacob in mourning  which are made in a scratchboardlike technique in which the drawn image is scratched through the dry surface layer of cadmium red into the base layers of turquoise and yellowwhite on the canvas  a method to which the artist also gives the term grattage and which its effect in joseph accused suggests ancient egyptian temple wall reliefs precisely cut into red granite in which the figures are styled as a consequence in shallow space deliberately flattened and silhouetted by overstated contours the ritualized gesture of josephs arms extending downwards as if bound together to two open hands a sign of supplication and innocence is a studied and mimetic quotation this combined with the addition of the second arm and hand is an obvious restructuring of the desperately outstretched arm and hand of the man being strangled in max beckmanns die nacht which rapport sees as a symbolic precursor to kristallnacht the nazi night of broken glass the night of terror perpetrated on the jewish community on november   generally considered marking the beginning of the holocaust consequently rapport considers his representation of the biblical story of joseph accused with its formalistic and iconographic pictorial dependency on the art of max beckmann as an iconographic statement for modern history to the horrific antisemitism in nazi germany and a testimony to the theme stranger in a strange land in thomas manns four book epic honoring the ancient hebraic spiritual quest the new york years portraits in grattage the public theatre hangingsedit throughout most of the s while simultaneously painting works that have evolved from the iconic abstractions of paris rappaport makes over twenty portraits in grattage beginning with the double portrait of jake and esther schwartz  in philadelphia while staying at his brothers on his return from france in the summer of  for the sculptor barbara schwartz the model for potiphars wife in joseph accused then once in new york luke  that will be shown along with works by warhol and philip pearlstein in new york city  carnegie mellon alumni exhibition at westbroadway gallery in  the tapestrylike devotional icon of the guru baba muktananda  and its technical twin the white sisters  that evolves through several metamorphosis then finally scrapeddown to a bare tint of color on the canvas threads leaving only the lyrical contours as an art nouveau tableau finished just months before the artists return to traditional brush painting with the barren womb    jack  richard  detail but before his new york period begins the artist is stricken and operated for pericarditis in the spring of  spending most of the summer at his brothers in philadelphia convalescing before needing a second operation in early september then two theatre friends of his brothers from the carnegie tech drama department invite the artist to new york by commissioning their portraits in grattage the first the double portrait of jack  richard  of the stage designer jack doepp and aspiring opera singer richard magpion is made during the artists stay at jacks studio on west th street for the remainder of the year and owes the decorative aspect and theatrical staging of the two figures emerging from the densely luminous red surface to gustav klimts gilded paintings the portrait nonetheless is declined and five years later in  is purchased by pamela newhouse the second the more sober portrait of dean brown  is finished that spring when the artist moves to east seventh street in the east village manhattan   jacob in mourning in  at the home of conde nast publisher si newhouse jr rappaport is introduced to joseph papp the founding director of the new york public theatre who offers to hang the nine feet high joseph in the pit and jacob in mourning in the public theatres innerlobby they are installed that autumn of  and remain there till the autumn of  soon after their return the artist reworks joseph in the pit painting josephs hand red to stand for the painting of blood on the doorposts as a sign to warn away the angel of death in the passover story of exodus compounding it with the original story in genesis and adding the huge face of a female apparition suggesting that angel drawn from the portrait catherine kirkwood  that with the artist being the model for joseph adds an autobiographical layer to this episode of josephs struggle with selfdoubt that prefigures the story of jesus in the new testaments christ on the mount of olives in this rappaport follows the western art practice of the continuous narrative  the layering of stories separated by centuries while alluding to stories further into the future attacked late at night by a knifer while walking through tompkins square in the east village in early  rappaport shaken by the incident and discouraged after his paintings are taken down at the public theatre abandons his apartment on east seventh street and spends more than several months in washington dc before moving to brooklyn in  when he enters the masters program at brooklyn college with the thought of eventually teaching earning his mfa in  given a portion of his modest inheritance when his father is stricken by a major heart attack rappaport begins in the december  issue of art in america his first suite of multiple ad pages that continue in the following issues through april  coinciding with that last issue in april rappaport stages an exhibit in a carriagehouse studio at  downing street in the west village nyc of seven current paintings including the abode  and white madonna  attracting judd tully who intrigued by rappaports independent media campaign includes mention of it in his review for that summers issue of flash art international two years later rappaport joins the cooperative blue mountain gallery in new york where he has five solo exhibitions through  the return to pittsburgh a visit to paris the german girledit in  he returns to pittsburgh then after a series of seven selfportraits made in the summer of  a number of which are shown with blue madonna  at blue mountain gallery towards the end of that year that following summer upon being commissioned by herbert simon to paint his official portrait for carnegie mellon university the artist also begins a series of elders and former teachers which includes that of robert l lepper  writing in  robert lepper carnegie tech and the oakland project as a tribute to his former teacher who leaves a copy of it with his papers in the carnegie mellon university faculty archives a short threemonth sojourn to italy in late summer of  provides the artist the occasion to leave the expressionism of buddha from the cross  and red ashen skies    painting two works that restate in a more traditional manner standard renaissance themes the first a baptism later renamed narcissus    painted in florence in august and september and followed that october in the sienna countryside with an expulsion from the garden    both early states of these works are shown in the artists last exhibition at blue mountain gallery in new york in late december  into early january  after a romantic encounter in april  while visiting friends in paris the artist returns to france that autumn moving into a garden studio in vincennes for ten months there painting in a rite of exorcism the selfportrait the performer  as counterpart to the series of single female nudes the german girl which owe their eroticism to the example of egon schiele but without the latters explicitness an exhibition of these paintings is shown as la noia alemanya nua at galeria magdalena baxeras in barcelona in december  following an introduction by the cuban photographer herman puig who having

rappaport keeps the iconic figure as primal source besides portraits of psychological depth rappaport in the tradition of painting as an act of remembrance borrows christian iconography to represent the holocaust the nigerian civil war and the war in vietnam a former student and friend of robert l lepper at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh pa rappaport is one of the artists influenced by lepper’s course “individual and social analysis” his  paper “robert lepper carnegie tech and the oakland project” is the principal source on lepper’s influence on andy warhol philip pearlstein mel bochner and jonathan borofsky when they were lepper’s students since  rappaport’s use of the advertisement pages of international art magazines as a place of exhibition has been his principal form of public presence this includes issues of art in america artforum flash art bomb modern painters world art the new criterion and limn contents  life and work  the carnegie tech years robert lepper  six

drawing the human face making emotionally credible portraits of family and friends from his eighth year on of which the culminating work is the reverential drawing of his greatgrandmother  made soon after his tenth birthday then for three years starting in fifth grade the young artist attends the carnegie institutes now the carnegie tam oshanter art class which is followed at thirteen by a year of saturday afternoons in traditional apprenticeship in painting with the realistsurrealist artist abe weiner already an accomplished draftsman at seventeen rappaport is awarded the gold medal in drawing in the national scholastic art  writing awards in the spring of  before entering the department of painting  design at carnegie institute of technology now carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh that autumn the same time his older brother robert rappaport who would become the television art director of the mike douglas show and the miss universe pagent enters the drama department in stage design the carnegie tech years robert lepper  six characters in searchedit one of the most significant works that will inform this artists future practice made while on christmas vacation his first year at carnegie tech is the four foot high self nude scratchboard  of himself waisthigh highlighting a bare arm shoulder and halfface against the black background it proves to be a watershed when eight years later the artist returns to the concept of scratchboard by adapting it to layers of oil paint on canvas in grattage works such as joseph accused  in which the image is made by scratching through the smoothed paletteknife applied top layer of cadmium red to the lighter midcolor of turquoise and yellowwhite base in august  the summer following his freshman year rappaport paints his first suite of mature portraits which include those of mrs ress  ann weiner  and the standing threequarter length self nude  whose straighton depictions of character relate to the portraits of alice neel whom the artist is unaware of at the time winning for himself the art departments leisser award for work done independently and affording him the occasion of his first exhibition of these portraits lining its central hallway at the beginning of his sophomore year his father on seeing the show gives him an account for art supplies which makes possible his painting large works on linen canvas for his remaining three years at school   burial of christ  detail from then on he is only nominally a student choosing his themes independently and working outside of the classroom that sophomore year with his sights on rembrant and titian while painting the first state of his mothers portrait woman with red hands  and burial of christ  whose stark representation an homage to the medieval villeneuvelesavignons pieta is the first of a number of works made over the years where he portrays himself in the role of the alienated outsider   family portraitdetail these are followed in his junior year by the doubleportrait of the actors michael tucker and laurie jefferson  and his own partial family portrait  that portrays only his mother younger brother ronald and himself during the highly emotional period when his parents have separated executed on rabbitskin glue sized but not primed linen canvas the faces in both paintings are built up from the absorbent weave that owe much to the example of edgar degas  especially that of the artists mother to degas portrait of a young woman  that summer of  in six characters in search  the artist paints himself as rebellious protagonisttarget of ridecule and prosecutor of judgment that takes its cue from michelangelos christ in the last judgment and senior year jewess accused  which shifts emphasis in the story of christ and the woman taken in adultery to express the ostracism and accusation of crimes levied against the jews that lead to the holocaust this is followed in his last semester by we are all somnambulists  all of which are painted from live models   six characters in search   jewess accused however rappaports work is out of phase with the dominant art movements emerging in the sixties pop art minimalism and conceptualism and at odds with new realism whose program of objectivity in representing the human figure by eliminating all subjective response implying the spiritual dimension discredits the overt romanticism in rappaports painting only alice neel and larry rivers in new york francis bacon and lucian freud in england and balthus in france are privileged to paint figuratively with any response to an inner life given their subjects or any implied narrative consequently rappaports practice is marginalized already as a student and in these early works expressing universal themes of the human condition his painting takes on an autobiographical aspect apart from painting rappaport is constantly drawing his most evolved graphic series he does his sophomore year in a series of drawings lithographs and etchings executed directly from a theatrically lit display case at the carnegie museum of a naturally mumified skeletal figure buried in fetal position which was already a fascination for the artist when a fifth grader at the museums tamoshanter classes and to which used as a symbolic motif of the holocaust the artist will return thirtyfive years later in painting the ovens womb  x drawn in a simplified manner as if cave painting on a color field of cadmium red in the ground floor sculpture studios rappaport regularly sees jonathan borofsky who is a sculpture major two years ahead of him and during his sophomore year becomes better acquainted with mel bochner who having graduated five years before has returned to pittsburgh for the year as both come from the same neighborhood rappaport gives the older artist rides in the evenings to the campus where they work in the print room and from which bochner often visits robert l lepper in his studio just down the hallway and on returning shares his enthusiasm for leppers speculative conversations on art practice in the autumn of  that following year rappaport takes leppers the oakland project and retrospective classes entitled individual and social analysis and soon forms a close bond with the older man however while rappaport is fascinated by leppers logic and eloquence on a broad range of perceptual and communicative issues his direction cannot be categorized with that of leppers famous former students andy warhol philip pearlatein mel bochner and jonathan borofsky who made conscious of changing hierarchies of value due to the impact of the machine and media on society are directly influenced by leppers work in industrial design and bauhaus leanings addressing the potential of technologys role in contemporary art practice which along with leppers conceptual paradigm communication as intention expressed and followed logically leads to making art the focus for following human reason engaged in the perception of its own awareness  a strategy seen in bochners conceptual practice rappaport as much as he remains devoted to lepper for the next twentyfive years and all the while following the progression of leppers ideas in the evolution of the abovementioned artists work consequently leading to his writing in  robert lepper carnegie tech and the oakland project cannot be considered in leppers camp this will be made more evident some seventeen years after leppers death in his essay robert lepper  six characters in search that reviews leppers legacy four decades later instead rappaport keeps to his own agenda already evident in the burial of christ painted the year before meeting lepper which merges in expressive figurative painting the autobiographical with the sociopolitical which are options in artistic direction laid out in leppers introduction to his classes and exemplify the expressive force in what lepper is pointing to in the retrospective whose primary goal bracketedoff from the sociopolitical evokes the emotive psychic power of unmediated memory in response to autobiographical material most importantly rappaports departure in the late s from traditional brush painting to his employing grattage technique does owe a debt to leppers own example of arriving at the conclusion that the paintbrush was not his tool but those of the industrial fabricator were and in looking back to the great figurative tradition of western art as a resource and inspiration rappaport is doing so informed by leppers latemodernistpostmodernist perspective and his injunction to allow for the unexpected by letting the process suggest where the work should go and not rush to expectations that set limitations on expression the autumn of  proves to be an auspicious time when soon after beginning robert leppers class rappaport meets herbert a simon one of the most influential social scientists of the th century whose computer simulated pioneer work in decision making parallels the communicative functions in leppers conceptual strategies and following rappaports gift of a lithograph drawing of simons daughter barbara which initiates their acquaintance simon becomes an early supporter and longtime friend of the young artist and whose portrait herbert a simon  rappaport paints in the summer of  for carnegie mellon university as its first nobel prize laureate on the faculty and which is followed a week later by leppers portrait ship of fools july edit ship of fools by richard rappaport  upon graduation in june  rappaport is offered a loft space on west th street new york for the summer where he paints his first work that is no longer dependent on live models but instead employs an expressively gestural execution in drawing the figures with large areas of washedon color taking a cue from a photograph of chagall painting his murals for lincoln center on the floor as well as japanese scroll painting in a book left by his benefactor which includes an image of a typhoon swept boat in the mongol armadas failed invasion of japan in the sixteenth century rappaport with hieronymus boschs version already in mind for its subject begins painting ship of fools  within hours of the announcement of the united states first bombing raids into north vietnam escalating the war ship of fools not only marks a major historical event artistically it marks a turning point from which the twentyoneyearold artist enters into the beginning phase of a fouryear evolution towards an iconographic figuration that in some works of  comes close to reducing traces of the figurative element almost entirely   oratory mural detail  the annunciation rappaports next major work in that evolution the oratory mural  comes as a result of exhibiting ship of fools at skibo hall at carnegie mellon university in november  when father philip walsh of the pittsburgh oratory commissions rappaport to paint a triptych for their proposed retreat house and arranges for the artist a studio space in the former chancellery behind st pauls cathedral in pittsburgh where the artist paints the canvasses on the floor in its gothic library the mural declined remains rolled for twenty years whereupon through the auspices of michael a roosevelt it finds a home on extended loan to the institutes for the achievement of human potential philadelphia in    oratory mural escape through the desert in working out the iconography on this fourteen by twentyfive foot triptych the artist becomes an admirer of the frescoes of giotto though only the escape through the desert on the left canvas of the oratory mural suggests openly that influence and in general in spite of the seriousness of the subject in giottos cycle on the life of christ in the scrovegni chapel there is a playfulness in the pantomime that informs its celebratory mood that rappaport responds to in his mural and that is expressed in the decorative modernist function of the gessoed patterns playing in tandem with the figurative representation on a structural level it is in works a few years later however hidden his example where giottos condensed compositions within the square that collapse the architectural space or as in the cycle on st francis in assisi the mountainous canyons in which his figures find themselves that becomes a source of inspiration for rappaports more abstracted figurative works contained in shallow relief as in valley of the kings  and asleep by the tomb  giotto however is not alone as an iconographic source for the mural in robert campins annunciation  the round table that discreetly separates the angel gabriel from mary becomes for rappaports image the circle of acceptance upon which mary is about to place her hand and where rappaport adds above her head the face of another angel representing her consciousness of her sons future looking upwards to the baptism and from which evolves several years later into the surreal and abstracted motif of courtship in providence in motion  while working on the oratory mural the artist having graduated nonetheless is given for a short time the privileged use of the print room at carnegie tech transcribing onto a large deeply bit etching plate a linear adaptation of his mothers portrait woman with red hands  the artist fashions a severe icon of his mother which when combined with the motif in the etching of evelyn ress with the double view of her head one dropping below the other as she falls asleep becomes the prototype for a series of paintings that start with mourning clown  that expresses the artists sorrow over the death of his good friend mrs ress and the work of mourning  that turns to the greater theme of the holocaust and which make a seamless progression into the works that evolve in france in the autumn of  the paris years iconic abstractions joseph accusededit in september  upon being awarded the chaloner prize through the rome prize competition rappaport begins what would be an almost threeyear sojourn in france first living in vincennes and the following year through the auspices of darthea speyer the americaninparis gallerist is awarded a residency at the cite internationale des arts   father vulture holy butterfly although picassos weeping woman is suggested in these works in paris as is tutankhamuns gilded face mask and rouaults the king in biafran madonna st ver  and rabbi  along with the formal structure in the romanesque altarpieces of cimabue in father vulture holy butterfly  and the paintencrusted shieldlike shapes of oceanic effigies in death has no master  it is his own etchings and above all the etching process itself from rolling a coating of wax onto the plates surface  to drawing into that wax ground  to scraping away unwanted lines after the plate is bit in the acid bath that leads rappaport to the way he will soon execute in paint in a twostage process the works of  and  that are shaped by scraping away the multiple layers of paint applied in the initial stage of the image both when malleable and once dry to form reductively the final image  a process to which the artist gives the general term in grattage as such the tactile almost violent manner in the acknowledgment of process and material in forming these primitivemodernist figurative icons which are as much carved and sculpted as painted and the resulting symbolism that explores the devastation of time upon mans endeavors or portrays malevolence against the innocent anticipates neoexpressionism and relates to the work of anselm kiefer   joseph accuseddetail two years later in the autumn of  while his solo exhibition of the more recent of these iconic abstractions is hanging at the cite des arts rappaport upon reading thomas manns joseph and his brothers begins joseph accused  followed by joseph in the pit  and jacob in mourning  which are made in a scratchboardlike technique in which the drawn image is scratched through the dry surface layer of cadmium red into the base layers of turquoise and yellowwhite on the canvas  a method to which the artist also gives the term grattage and which its effect in joseph accused suggests ancient egyptian temple wall reliefs precisely cut into red granite in which the figures are styled as a consequence in shallow space deliberately flattened and silhouetted by overstated contours the ritualized gesture of josephs arms extending downwards as if bound together to two open hands a sign of supplication and innocence is a studied and mimetic quotation this combined with the addition of the second arm and hand is an obvious restructuring of the desperately outstretched arm and hand of the man being strangled in max beckmanns die nacht which rapport sees as a symbolic precursor to kristallnacht the nazi night of broken glass the night of terror perpetrated on the jewish community on november   generally considered marking the beginning of the holocaust consequently rapport considers his representation of the biblical story of joseph accused with its formalistic and iconographic pictorial dependency on the art of max beckmann as an iconographic statement for modern history to the horrific antisemitism in nazi germany and a testimony to the theme stranger in a strange land in thomas manns four book epic honoring the ancient hebraic spiritual quest the new york years portraits in grattage the public theatre hangingsedit throughout most of the s while simultaneously painting works that have evolved from the iconic abstractions of paris rappaport makes over twenty portraits in grattage beginning with the double portrait of jake and esther schwartz  in philadelphia while staying at his brothers on his return from france in the summer of  for the sculptor barbara schwartz the model for potiphars wife in joseph accused then once in new york luke  that will be shown along with works by warhol and philip pearlstein in new york city  carnegie mellon alumni exhibition at westbroadway gallery in  the tapestrylike devotional icon of the guru baba muktananda  and its technical twin the white sisters  that evolves through several metamorphosis then finally scrapeddown to a bare tint of color on the canvas threads leaving only the lyrical contours as an art nouveau tableau finished just months before the artists return to traditional brush painting with the barren womb    jack  richard  detail but before his new york period begins the artist is stricken and operated for pericarditis in the spring of  spending most of the summer at his brothers in philadelphia convalescing before needing a second operation in early september then two theatre friends of his brothers from the carnegie tech drama department invite the artist to new york by commissioning their portraits in grattage the first the double portrait of jack  richard  of the stage designer jack doepp and aspiring opera singer richard magpion is made during the artists stay at jacks studio on west th street for the remainder of the year and owes the decorative aspect and theatrical staging of the two figures emerging from the densely luminous red surface to gustav klimts gilded paintings the portrait nonetheless is declined and five years later in  is purchased by pamela newhouse the second the more sober portrait of dean brown  is finished that spring when the artist moves to east seventh street in the east village manhattan   jacob in mourning in  at the home of conde nast publisher si newhouse jr rappaport is introduced to joseph papp the founding director of the new york public theatre who offers to hang the nine feet high joseph in the pit and jacob in mourning in the public theatres innerlobby they are installed that autumn of  and remain there till the autumn of  soon after their return the artist reworks joseph in the pit painting josephs hand red to stand for the painting of blood on the doorposts as a sign to warn away the angel of death in the passover story of exodus compounding it with the original story in genesis and adding the huge face of a female apparition suggesting that angel drawn from the portrait catherine kirkwood  that with the artist being the model for joseph adds an autobiographical layer to this episode of josephs struggle with selfdoubt that prefigures the story of jesus in the new testaments christ on the mount of olives in this rappaport follows the western art practice of the continuous narrative  the layering of stories separated by centuries while alluding to stories further into the future attacked late at night by a knifer while walking through tompkins square in the east village in early  rappaport shaken by the incident and discouraged after his paintings are taken down at the public theatre abandons his apartment on east seventh street and spends more than several months in washington dc before moving to brooklyn in  when he enters the masters program at brooklyn college with the thought of eventually teaching earning his mfa in  given a portion of his modest inheritance when his father is stricken by a major heart attack rappaport begins in the december  issue of art in america his first suite of multiple ad pages that continue in the following issues through april  coinciding with that last issue in april rappaport stages an exhibit in a carriagehouse studio at  downing street in the west village nyc of seven current paintings including the abode  and white madonna  attracting judd tully who intrigued by rappaports independent media campaign includes mention of it in his review for that summers issue of flash art international two years later rappaport joins the cooperative blue mountain gallery in new york where he has five solo exhibitions through  the return to pittsburgh a visit to paris the german girledit in  he returns to pittsburgh then after a series of seven selfportraits made in the summer of  a number of which are shown with blue madonna  at blue mountain gallery towards the end of that year that following summer upon being commissioned by herbert simon to paint his official portrait for carnegie mellon university the artist also begins a series of elders and former teachers which includes that of robert l lepper  writing in  robert lepper carnegie tech and the oakland project as a tribute to his former teacher who leaves a copy of it with his papers in the carnegie mellon university faculty archives a short threemonth sojourn to italy in late summer of  provides the artist the occasion to leave the expressionism of buddha from the cross  and red ashen skies    painting two works that restate in a more traditional manner standard renaissance themes the first a baptism later renamed narcissus    painted in florence in august and september and followed that october in the sienna countryside with an expulsion from the garden    both early states of these works are shown in the artists last exhibition at blue mountain gallery in new york in late december  into early january  after a romantic encounter in april  while visiting friends in paris the artist returns to france that autumn moving into a garden studio in vincennes for ten months there painting in a rite of exorcism the selfportrait the performer  as counterpart to the series of single female nudes the german girl which owe their eroticism to the example of egon schiele but without the latters explicitness an exhibition of these paintings is shown as la noia alemanya nua at galeria magdalena baxeras in barcelona in december  following an introduction by the cuban photographer herman puig who having photographed rappaport in the vincennes studio has invited the artist to visit barcelona four of puigs photographs of the artist sitting by his paintings are reproduced on advertisement pages in the flash art novemberdecember  issue and in artforum in the november  december  and

postmodern pastiche and parody they are set at no psychological distance from the viewer and instead call for a meditative and empathetic response such a commemoration for the victims of nazi hatred stretching back fortyfive years to jewess accused  here painted with reticence and deep respect for the human being is a parallel expression to the works addressing the disastrous consequences of barbarity as seen from the opposite side of that dark history those of anselm kiefer although one might wish to make a categorial statement on rappaports work given its emotional undercurrent its often painful subjectmatter and expressive execution it may be incorrect to place the whole body of work solely on the expressionist side of the classicalromantic divide without acknowledging that in his work as a whole there is a strong sense of formal structure and a tendency towards finding equalibrium that plays a reciprocal and balancing role to the more expressive dynamic and this may explain its spiralling evolution whereupon once reaching a saturation of effect in a period of work the artist returns to a grounding in order simplicity and coherence and always with reverence for

through the whole extensive immigration process he is extremely knowledgeable unbelievably patient and tactful with people and he has an amazing personality mr weinman deserves not all the  rating stars but  and i will be very specific with you as i have been in the position of a person who reads tons of reviews looking for a good lawyer lets start with the fact that before hiring mr weinman i personally met with about  lawyers some of them even recommended by friends the problem was that i wasnt happy with any of them i worked for  years as a human resource specialist and i have the training to recognize the people that can get the job done frankly spoken some of the lawyers i met at that time were very convincing but i was also very wellprepared for my appointments with them and at the end they didnt seem to me either very competent or honest enough or something else was missing then i was browsing online reading different reviews and i found mr weinman there were several nice reviews and i decided to try with an initial appointment yet when you open the door you see that his office is organized in a manner that is only possible for someone confident knowledgeable and honest the next pleasant surprise was that he doesnt make you wait and he doesnt need to as he gains immediately the clients respect with his positive and honest approach and his extensive knowledge we discussed l visa h visa e and e and i decided to hire him right on the spot  months later i am so happy with my decision because he helped my mother then my father and then my best friend  out of  absolutely successful cases two of them i know were extremely difficult thank you mr weinman you are a true blessing for me and my family and for those of you who took the time to read my review i wish you just a little good luck because i know now that you will be in the hands of a great lawyerlaw office of ganesh n viswanathan esqmaria r ratedi am a woman from the caribbean island and even though i have been living here for a number of years i have had very little interaction with the court systems and litigation a person who is from the same islands married me a decade and half ago and we have a child after many years into the marriage i was not even aware he went ahead and filed for divorce over the years he has accumulated a lot of savings in pension plans and retirement funds and he is quite smart in understanding how the legal systems work i was not aware of any of his assets one day he filed for a divorce and then pretended as if nothing happened he never served on me directly but was devising a way to fool me by not serving but going ahead and obtaining a default order with no disclosure and no distribution to me i was naive but something in my mind was telling me something was not alright because my neighbors told me somebody like a process server came to my home in my absence i went and checked the court and to my horror i found out my husband filed a divorce action against me more than a year ago this is the time when i somehow came into contact mr viswanathans office and his office did a brilliant job in bringing into light everything that happened right on my back and explained everything to me my law office immediately moved the court and in detail put forth in the papers before the court everything that happened now my case proceeding very well far beyond my expectations i shall be entitled to a share in his assets further i am going to be entitled to a good spousal support and a child support i did not even imagine that i would be entitled to a penny from my husband all because of the great investigative legal work carried out by mr viswanathan and his excellent team i am now so happy because of their great work my husband whom i meet every week is sulking and the nature of his talk completely changed  for the betterthe law office of lance fletcherkurtnyc ratedstop looking around the internet and just read i just got a new job and my coworkers took me out for a celebration we went out for drinks and to make matters worse i started drinking shots big mistake because i had several im done with shots from this point on i got into a fight  apparently  i dont remember the details but i woke up in a cell with cuts and bruises i got charged with assault for hitting a guy and pushing him to the ground and resisting arrest and i thought my life was over because you cant get a good job with a record i was scared frustrated confused and i started looking around for a good lawyer to take my case i came across lance fletchers website and it looked pretty good you never know if that means its gonna be a good lawyer so i called him for a consultation when i went to see him i was a nervous reck and couldnt sleep i didnt want to lose my job or go to jail during the consultation we discussed similar cases hes had like mine turns out hes a former prosecutor and he really knew what he was talkin about after i saw him i had the best nights sleep since the arrest he looked me in the eye and explained how he was going to keep my record clean and fight the case most of the lawyers i spoke to just wanted money right away but mr fletcher was more interested in me and the case he took the time to meet and discuss the details on the first court date he filed a motion to dismiss he got a copy of the medical records saw that the other guy wasnt really hurt and got the da to drop the criminal charges i had to do a brief anger class but i avoided jail and no criminal record i got to keep my job and i cant thank him enough one thing  i wish i saw him sooner because my family tried to set me up with a lawyer but that guy didnt know what he was talking about and had me pretty scared turk hugh m jdperry ratedthere was little to no response not even taking two minutes to send a followup email or telephone call to my many inquiries for help with my case from one of the lawyers and his secretary of this firm the wheels of justice may move at a very slow pace yet apparently something else was going on here undoubtedly they are preoccupied with larger concerns however if certain people within this office are unable unwilling or uninterested in assisting the one who is inexperienced in legal matters perhaps with unrealistic expectations yet unfortunately forced into a legal circumstance though small in scope then simply say so but please do not ignore an individual for monthsespecially after promising to help initially you had given hope to this expunged criminal and after he pleaded again and again for assistance some action was finally taken now it appears it is all over the abusive unchecked and condescending authorities have won the incurring frustration seemingly endless wait as well as the expensive fees were paid by this innocent victim and despite the adversities and disappointments he will go on wishing well of authorities legal professionals and most of all hoping to be safeguarded from both professions since he is simply a lawabiding citizen who probably needs to forget the injustice committed against him and only wants to make his way in this world with malice toward none may there be mutual respect honesty and compassion among all peoples and our various ways of lifelaw offices of lauren goldberg pllceli b ratedi had lost all hope that i would get through my horrible

was zero hope for me to resolve at the request of my family i sought legal counsel not knowing where to turn to find a lawyer it was the first time i had even sought such help i researched the best tax lawyers online via yelp and other sites tim’s reviews were all very positive and some of them reminded me of my problem so i thought maybe he can help me tooi was nervous speaking to him for the

paul r kenneymissdiatribe ratedafter over a year of negotiating a real estate agreement frustrations mounted and i needed to hire an attorney around the busy th of july season i reached out to a few referrals from friends and neither of those attorneys got back to me however through some online research i came across great reviews of the law offices of paul kenney which is conveniently located on the upper west side in a more serene location than the insanity of midtown and wall st paul responded to my inquiry right away and was wonderful with followup from there on out his fees were incredibly reasonable and i had no idea how much easier the process would be with him facilitating our first meeting took away all the mounting anxiety i had accumulated and the entire process became painless and stressfree paul managed to get all that i wanted put into the contract and approved he has a unique talent for finding the right approach in handling the eccentric and sometimes difficult characters that saturate the real estate market in nyc his savvy and pleasant disposition completely disarmed the other party he made himself available to me for any questions or concerns that popped up and was incredibly diligent in handling all the details i would absolutely recommend him to anyone in need of a real estate attorneylaw office of paul r kenneylara b ratedi was suddenly thrown into a roommate battle with a friend i had lived with for over a year regarding a sublease and frantically started searching for tenant lawyers paul was the very first to get back to me and after hearing my story he was very straight forward and clear in explaining what my options were he wasnt intimidating to talk to and didnt ask for payment before telling me his opinion and advice this unofficial consultation would have cost over  for at the other lawyers i had reached out to as quoted in their emails i told him id like to continue working with him until the issue was solved and he became my savior through the whole process he worked with my roommates lawyer to settle the issues and kept me updated every step of the way even when i got nervous and would call him at random times during the day he took my call and would reassure me that he is on top of the situation and that he would continue to work on any other issues that arose with her when all the issues were resolved he stuck to the very reasonable price that he originally quoted me  no surprise fees or over charges i would recommend him to any and all of my friends and i would go back to him in a heartbeat i feel very lucky to have found him the law office of lance fletcherscottm ratedi hired this lawyer for a felony a very unfortunate thing happened over the holidays while i was on probation for dwi i got arrested again

away he was smart and honest and a good guy from the moment i first met him his passion and confidence really impressed me during the case he kept in touch about things the da was trying to do to me it looked like i was going to jail for a while buy mr fletcher said we had to keep fighting and giving them motions and push for better it was all good in the end because i got off with only a fine some classes and no driving for a while i even avoided a felony record i still cant believe i stayed out of jail every other lawyer i talked to before hiring mr fletcher told me i was going to jail
