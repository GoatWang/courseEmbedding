stephenthere are numerous introductions to poetry and prosody available but none at once so comprehensive and so accessible as this with the increasing emphasis on free verse the past generation has developed a widespread impression that the study of poetic meter is old fashioned or even that form doesnt matter in poetry it is an impression that has not been dispelled by the emphasis of some of the existing texts in the area on forms that are now rare or outmoded the irony is that simultaneously in the past decade interest in formal matters among many poets and literary scholars has been on the increase the reality is that prosody is today on the cutting edge of literary studiesstephen adams text provides a full treatment of traditional topics from the iambic pentameter through other accentualsyllabic rhythms trochaic dactylic and so on and covering as well other metrical types stanza structure the sonnet and other standard forms adams also includes a variety of topics not covered in most other introductions to the topic perhaps most significantly he provides a full chapter on form in free verse moreover he treats rhyme extensively and includes a comprehensive chapter on on literary figures poetic designs is thus much more that an introduction to prosody it is a concise but comprehensive introduction to the nature of poetry in english it is a book for the general reader and the aspiring writer as well as for the student a book intended in the words of the author to help heighten the experience of poetryrhetoric poetrycondition used  goodhpb condition ratingsnew item

shes pregnant and hes not the daddy as if things arent bad enough for the man the bottom of his world falls even further when hes almost killed in a bust gone awry and he ends up in a coma he miraculously pulls out of this stall and fights hard to regain his feet only to find that his pregnant wife has been kidnapped and is being held by a local gang led by his former partnergone bad

producing quality and challenging movies on a smaller budget obviously not content with simply cranking out one mindless actioner after another to clutter our shelves van damme once again trys something a little different within his chosen genre  and as a big fan of the belgian bruiser its great to see him once again not only flexing his pecs but also his acting musclesdirected by simon fellows who shot the wesley snipes actioner  seconds and the disappointing jc vehicle second in command until death is a dark and nightmarish thriller which follows detective anthony stowe van damme who is universally despised by both his work collegues and to a lesser extent his wife addicted to heroin and spiralling into his own personal hell stowe has just come off a drug bust that has gone horribly wrong resulting in the death of two of his comrades and now finds himself in a coma when gunned down by arch nemesis gabriel callaghan played in somewhat hammy fashion by the usually reliable steven rea what follows is a tale of redemption as jc comes back from the brink of death  and given a second chance he attempts to make everything right with his life  including his job and his recently pregnant wife who has been kidnapped by callaghan in an attempt to draw out stowe there is more to the story but that is the basic premise in a nutshell  but what pulls it out of the usual direct to video dreck is the assured central performance from van dammetaking a cue from his last ringo lam collaboration the excellent in hell van damme once again attempts a complex and nontoo likeable character who finds redemption through the combination of violence honour and love to see jc perform these kind of roles is wholly satisfying  he is proving on a smaller scale that he isnt just the guy who does the splits and another low rent video seagal clone hes a strong movie star who can offer a range of emotions and ultimately create a fully rounded character for an audience to connect with and follow through the moviethe rest of the cast are hit and miss stephen rea is miscast in a larger than life bad guy role and he seems to be just reading his lines and hitting his cues jcs wife valerie selina giles isnt that stong either and someone deeper is needed to pull the role off  however this is really van dammes show all the way it was weird watching it because the first  minutes of the movie jc is quite despicable and you finding yourself not really liking him  and its not until the last half hour do we see the van damme that we know from movies of old its a testament to his talent that he can produce a fully rounded dislikable character at this time of his career  i just hope that their are a number of bigger budgeted producers out there watching what he is doing on the small screen because i would rather see him in a medium budgeted actioner than the new wave of dull tv extra lite stars that we are getting today its quite a shame that this went direct to video because it is far more involving than most movies i have to sit through in theatres with a slightly higher budget and a stronger supporting cast until death could have been a contnder jc really has paid his dues now its time he came back in a bigger movieall in all if you are a van damme fan then this movie is a given and one of his best movies in a long time if you arent a fan then this still ranks as a high end dvd release and well worth a peakread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsa pretty van damme good moviebydaniel jolleyhall of fametop  revieweron  august format dvdi havent seen all that many van damme movies but the ones i have seen have all been pretty good im one of the few people that actually liked second in command i had my doubts early on this time around though as van damme looked like death warmed over and his character was pretty hard to sympathize with even for an antihero but you know what van damme himself may be showing some age now but he is far from washed up i see until death as a transition film of sorts for him he shows that he can still be a tough guy without relying on elaborate martial arts displays and more importantly that he has developed into a decent actor anthony stowe isnt your stereotypical onedimensional cop theres a lot going on with this guy and van damme does a really nice job of revealing both the bad and the good in the characterstowe is a narc on the new orleans police force and hes carrying two huge monkeys on his back a seemingly personal mission to bring down the citys most notorious gangster and a secret addiction to heroin obviously he does not fit the description of a good cop watching fellow cops die as a result of his continually futile efforts to catch callahan stephen rea doesnt do much for his already abrasive attitude he has no qualms about roughing up potential criminals innocents or fellow cops he doesnt work well if at all with a partner and the heroin isnt helping his job performance his personal life is in even more of a shambles as he has just learned that the wife he has been neglecting is pregnant  with someone elses child yep youd think life couldnt get much worse than it already is for old anthony  until the guy hes hunting finds him and leaves him lying in an alley with a bullet in his skullmiraculously stowe survives the shooting but it is several months before he emerges from a coma as his physical rehabilitation progresses he starts taking steps to rehabilitate his life as well apologizing and making amends to those he has hurt along the way unfortunately though the people he cares about the most remain in harms way as long as callahan is still out there  and hes really out there having wiped out any and all criminal competitors and solidified his position as king of the criminal dung heap during stowes absence you know an ultimate showdown between stowe and callahan is coming and the movie does not disappoint serving up an exciting actionpacked endingvan damme isnt going to win any best actor awards but he actually does quite a commendable job bringing out the nuances of his character as stowe tries to put his life back together again following his grievous injury until death isnt focused entirely on action and more action theres a really human element here that i wasnt expecting to find if this film is any indication van damme isnt going to disappear from the cinematic radar any time soonread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starssolid memorable movie van damme still deliversbyms kimberley l sturton  may format dvdalthough van damme is an oldschool action star most popular for his martial arts and quick fun action films he still delivers great character acting and action scenes  years on from from his popular s early s features until death is now in my top  van damme favorites unlike steven seagal jean claude has aged with grace and diginity taking his roles seriously and puts out some dynamic character acting that gives this film good weight and a suspense unlike that of his more popular movies this is far more then just an action screen favorite doing a lowbudget dated  easy money flick for the fans until death holds its own and differs greatly in style and suspense from personal favs such as awol and double impact its more brutal and bleak then cheesy and s coolvan damme plays a beatdown heroin addicted cop whos having a string of bad events in and out of work resulting in a real mess of man who has to pick himself out of a partly selfmade gutter the synopsis could read like that of an action movie years old but the execution is modern and fresh with van damme giving a strong performance mixed with ballsy and dramactic action scenes i feel long term fans and general actiondrama viwers will certainly get their moneys worth in checking out this filmread

which closed and filed for bankruptcy in  pleaded guilty wednesday to a charge of withholding information about a scheme to defraud the federal government of  on a fruits and vegetables contract john stephen alexander who was cfo for adams produce from  until the company closed in april  pleaded guilty during a hearing before us district court judge virginia hopkins alexander had been charged in a may  indictment with one count of conspiracy and  counts of aiding and abetting wire fraud but in a plea agreement with the us attorneys office alexander pleaded guilty to one count of misprision  withholding information on a crime in exchange for his plea and cooperation with prosecutors the us attorneys office agreed to drop the charges in the indictment the plea agreement and todays guilty plea evidence mr alexanders acceptance of his responsibility in the sequence of events at adams produce company alexanders attorney augusta dowd stated in a prepared release mr alexander has been fully cooperative with the governments investigation into the wrongdoing at adams produce dowd stated alexander provided assistance to both the internal investigation and to the government and was one of the first adams produce officers to voluntarily meet with the us attorneys office assistant us attorney george martin declined to comment after wednesdays hearing attorneys for former coo steven craig finberg who also was indicted earlier this year also were monitoring wednesdays hearing the attorneys said that finberg maintains he is innocent of the charges five other former adams produce officials have pleaded guilty to charges and have been sentenced to prison or probation in the investigation in the past year four of the men were also ordered by judges to jointly pay  restitution to the government alexander under his plea agreement also will be jointly responsible for paying the restitution the more than centuryold company was counted among birminghams oldest and largest it had expanded to four states by the time the adams family sold it to groups of investors in  within two years the company had filed for bankruptcy had laid off more than  employees and its top executives had come under federal investigation related to an alleged government fraud scheme according to the plea agreements the scheme went like this adams produce had contracts with the defense logistics agency for the defense supply center in philadelphia to provide fruits and vegetables for use at military bases and schools the federal government would pay a certain price above what it would cost adams produce to get the produce from its suppliers adams produce was required to submit proof of its costs according to the indictment and other court documents certain adams produce officers and employees between august  and november  arranged transactions with the georgia location of tlc tom lange company a major nationwide wholesale produce company to create fraudulent purchase orders reflecting a higher cost to adams produce of purchasing fruits and vegetables adams officials then submitted the fraudulent purchase orders to the defense logistics agency as proof of what the produce cost on oct   alexander instructed kirkland and obrien  general manager for the adams produce distribution center in pensacola fla  to gradually end the scheme to defraud  telling them to bring it in for a soft landing  rather than ending it immediately so as to avoid raising red flags and better avoid detection by dla according to the indictment after the company filed bankruptcy a lawsuit was filed by adams produce shareholders against the accounting firm of frost cummings tidwell group which had audited the books of adams produce the suit claims the audit made the company seem healthier that it was inducing the investment firm to buy a majority stake in the company for  million a trial in the lawsuit was to begun sept  but two weeks before it was to have begun attorneys notified us district judge madeline haikala that they had reached a settlement in the case the judge gave both side until nov  to file a joint stipulation of dismissal or a joint report updating the court on the
