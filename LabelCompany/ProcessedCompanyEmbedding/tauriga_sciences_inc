space today announced it has completed the formulation graphics and packaging for its proprietary cbd infused roll on product for muscle tension relief branded and trademarked under the name rolleaf as previously disclosed the company is forming a new subsidiary called collumauxil therapeutics llc collumauxil to focus on the development marketing and licensing of nonopioid products and product lines that specifically target muscle tension a key component of pain from a logistics standpoint the company believes the rolleaf products will be ready for marketing and distribution to the retail marketplace during the st calendar quarter of a key ingredient of the product is cannabidiol cbd isolate which is  pure anhydrous crystalline cannabidiol cbd that is extracted from hemp because the companys formula utilizes  pure cbd isolate that contains no thc the company formulated the rolleaf products with the expectation that sales of this product would be legal in all  states south america europe and australiaon december   the united states drug enforcement agency the dea added a notice to the federal register that quietly informed the public that it had established a new drug code for marihuana extract the deas argument is that the agency is entitled to regulate cbd oil because all extracts contain trace amounts of thc the active ingredient in cannabis which remains illegal at the federal levelas a result tauriga sought legal advice from several reputable law firms and legal sources to ensure that its shareholders are protected and that the company complies with all federal and state regulations after careful legal review the company believes at this time that rolleaf remains legal to sell throughout the united states specifically section  of the  congressional farm bill hr   agricultural act of  of the th congress defines hemp as distinct from marijuana and is therefore removed from the definition as a controlled substance when grown under a compliant state program additionally cannabidiol cbd is not listed on the federal schedule of controlled substances and the final rule published on december th by the dea was not a scheduling action but rather an administrative action related to record keeping however in light of these recent events the company believes that there may be increased risk in the future with respect to cbd due to the deas recent categorization effortsit should also be noted that tauriga has obtained rd party laboratory certificate of analysis coa confirming that the cbd isolate used in formulating rolleaf is both pure and within the guidelines of what is currently legal to sell in the united statestaurigas ceo seth m shaw expressed the company has been excited about the prospects of a commercial launch of its cbd infused roll on product over the past few weeks there has been significant potential interest expressed to the company from both distributors and retailers alike the company has worked diligently to complete what it believes to be an excellent product with a focus also on the graphics logo and packaging to enhance attractiveness due to the deas december th proclamation the company has been extremely cautious and diligent in understanding and complying with the legal landscape and potential future consequences to launching a product such as rolleaf the company will continue to follow developments very closely and fully commits to its shareholders that it will work to comply with all federal or state laws in its efforts to build potential long term businesses and revenue streamsabout tauriga sciences inctauriga sciences inc  otc pink  taug  is a current reporting life sciences company engaged in the development marketing distribution and potential licensing of a broad

in building businesses in the life sciences space today announced it has completed the formulation graphics and packaging for its proprietary cbd infused roll on product for muscle tension relief branded and trademarked under the name rolleaf as previously disclosed the company is forming a new subsidiary called collumauxil therapeutics llc collumauxil to focus on the development marketing and licensing of nonopioid products and product lines that specifically target muscle tension a key component of pain from a logistics standpoint the company believes the rolleaf products will be ready for marketing and distribution to the retail marketplace during the st calendar quarter of  a key ingredient of the product is cannabidiol cbd isolate which is  pure anhydrous crystalline cannabidiol cbd that is extracted from hemp because the companys formula utilizes  pure cbd isolate that contains no thc the company formulated the rolleaf products with the expectation that sales of this product would be legal in all  states south america europe and australia on december   the united states drug enforcement agency the dea added a notice to the federal register that quietly informed the public that it had established a new drug code for marihuana extract the deas argument is that the agency is entitled to regulate cbd oil because all extracts contain trace amounts of thc the active ingredient in cannabis which remains illegal at the federal level as a result tauriga sought legal advice from several reputable law firms and legal sources to ensure that its shareholders are protected and that the company complies with all federal and state regulations after careful legal review the company believes at this time that rolleaf remains legal to sell throughout the united states specifically section  of the  congressional farm bill hr   agricultural act of  of the th congress defines hemp as distinct from marijuana and is therefore removed from the definition as a controlled substance when grown under a compliant state program additionally cannabidiol cbd is not listed on the federal schedule of controlled substances and the final rule published on december th by the dea was not a scheduling action but rather an administrative action related to record keeping however in light of these recent events the company believes that there may be increased risk in the future with respect to cbd due to the deas recent categorization efforts it should also be noted that tauriga has obtained rd party laboratory certificate of analysis coa confirming that the cbd isolate used in formulating rolleaf is both pure and within the guidelines of what is currently legal to sell in the united states taurigas ceo seth m shaw expressed the company has been excited about the prospects of a commercial launch of its cbd infused roll on product over the past few weeks there has been significant potential interest expressed to the company from both distributors and retailers alike the company has worked diligently to complete what it believes to be an excellent product with a focus also on the graphics logo and packaging to enhance attractiveness due to the deas december th proclamation the company has been extremely cautious and diligent in understanding and complying with the legal landscape and potential future consequences to launching a product such as rolleaf the company will continue to follow developments very closely and fully commits to its shareholders that it will work to comply with all federal or state laws in its efforts to build potential
