fluctuation by acquiring equity positions in wellestablished and profitable businesses in wide ranging business sectors the company is committed to invest in “low beta” or “low risk” business operations that show very low volatility and present a steady return over the long term to the average investor early to midstaged business life cycle opportunities presenting long view returns mcgraw

have gone hand in hand since the inception of the world wrestling entertainment “wwe” in  wwe is an american publicly traded company that deals primarily in professional wrestling with major revenue sources also coming from film music product licensing and direct product sales the ultimate fighting championship “ufc” is the largest mixed martial arts “mma” promoter in the world and features most of the topranked fighters in the sport ufc recently sold for  billion the most expensive transaction for an organization in sports history while we may not be as successful we hope to emulate such models like the wwe and the ufc mcgraw plans to capitalize on this now largely mainstream mma industry as a licensed promotion company and athlete training and recruiting division for the mma industry specifically mcgraw intends to acquire a licensed and proven training center for mma athletes that supplies professional talent directly to the mma industry mcgraw also intends to acquire an mma events promotion company that would be licensed by one of the existing mma entities and would be responsible for regional mma events that would be televised nationwide to a large and growing audience by entering this space mcgraw believes it will have acquired a highly lucrative component of a wildly successful and profitable industry entertainment fitness has very few corporate players and mcgraw will seek to establish itself as a serious player incurring only a modest dollar commitment   financial services  insurance services ken mcgraw the principal of mcgraw has significant experience in the financial and banking industries mr mcgraw intends with necessary funding to acquire a company that offers loans for residential and commercial real estate small business loans car loans as well as insurance and reinsurance services mcgraw also intends to acquire again with adequate funding a finance company as well as an insurance andor reinsurance operation mr mcgraw having extensive prior experience in these financial industries consequently we believe the company will be able to invest wisely in low beta highly successful operations showing potential for significant revenue with minimal investment mcgraw in addition intends to seek ways to utilize its holdings in the finance and banking sector to reduce the cost of borrowing for all its other acquisitions and holdings   automotive services  dealership services additional business sectors that have traditionally and recently proven in our view to be a safe harbor for capital investment are the automotive dealership and dealership services industry the company with adequate funding expects to acquire an automotive dealership services company or companies to offer onsite dealership services regionally…if not nationwide dealership services is a niche industry that services auto boat and airplane dealerships we intend to acquire such dealership services to enrich the automotive holdings for the company offering the ability to market goods and services across multiple industry platforms mcgraw intends to acquire a thriving automotive dealership once the adequate funding has been achieved pairing dealership services with an automotive dealership owned by mcgraw will create in our opinion a symbiotic revenue relationship that should benefit the company   construction  real estate our analysis suggests that the construction and real estate sectors are showing signs of growth and such market sectors have traditionally been safe harbor investments for longterm investors along with traditional construction plans for highend residential and incomeproducing commercial buildings if successful in its money raise mcgraw plans to operate inside a niche market of the construction industry medical facilities construction and management the medical field especially senior care or “longterm care” we are convinced is soon to experience its largest growth cycle in a generation we believe the rate of retirees is set to exceed all generations by a large multiple very specifically mcgraw plans to combine the stable and increasing construction industry with the stable and high growth longterm care industry mcgraw intends to join with a wellestablished and experienced medical group servicing a significant patient list the company with adequate funding will be able to build up multiple medical facilities and grand open each location  presold and occupied we expect to be able to staff and manage those facilities with properly licensed medical staff and operated by the contemplated partnerjoint venture medical group upon completion of each facility mcgraw intends to maintain options to retain ownership of each property and participate in revenue sharing acting as the landlord or negotiate a price to sell each property to the occupying medical group at a profit   oil  clean energy mcgraw intends to invest in actively producing oil wells in the southern united states and explore future investments in clean energy production to be considered oil fields by mcgraw must be producing hundreds of barrels of american oil every day and delivering it to refineries at a brisk pace such acquisition would we believe be consistent with the company’s objective to invest only in successful low beta revenue producing businesses in fact we believe we can acquire operating companies with existing infrastructure already in place in each location thereby in our view providing mcgraw zero startup costs and ensuring all investment dollars from the company are ‘above ground’ and can contribute to growing an existing revenue stream into a major profit center mcgraw will also seek acquisitions that contribute to us energy independence in other ways such as harnessing wind energy mcgraw intends to work with government agencies and clean energy experts to decide upon the appropriate course of action for the company to enter the clean energy industry mcgraw’s objective among others is to help the united states achieve energy independence in an environmentally responsible manner   × email link to the email address below privacy notice conditions of use my account

and philosophies the result may stall important business decisions and create poor working conditions subsequently costing the company time and money and possibly resulting in the investors losing their investment although the current principal has had significant cumulative experience and expertise in the identification acquisition and operation of various businesses he has not operated such an extensive array of operations the company contemplates for example the targeted lines of business include owning and managing under the indicated circumstances and networks of relationships medical facilities auto dealers and services sports entertainment even oil fields even though the sole principal of the company has not previously engaged in those activities investors will have no right or power to take part in or direct the management of the company accordingly no investor should purchase shares unless such investor is willing to entrust all aspects of the operations of the company to current management including the selection of businesses andor controlling interests in companies it may acquire to the company’s management this potential risk is even more important in this offering

result of this offering the company is expected to expand into activities in which management has not previously operated and anticipates generally experiencing significant expansion this includes expansion into entertainment via television with no experience by the current management in this and other areas automotive financial services food manufacturing and distribution for instance the company could have difficulty in finding management personnel that could effectively operate the associated activities and therefore could cause the loss of the investment into those sectors to reduce that potential risk and to tap into preexisting expertise the company will typically enter into joint ventures andor purchase agreements with time tables for acquisition only with established firms whose senior management andor ownership have agreed to longterm employment contracts with the company it is possible as a result of these recent preliminary activities  and potential future projects and joint ventures that the company’s management will be required to manage larger business operations than historically has been the case it is possible that the company will fail at its attempts to effectively implement the organizational and operational systems necessary for optimal management integration of its expanded activities which could cause a loss of the investor’s money        table

regulation a offering and finra’s permission to have a symbol issued and our stock quoted our stock will not subject to “penny stock” rules as defined in the securities exchange act of  rule a unless the share price will have dropped at the time of the trading market commencing if that were the case because of the constraints on trading resulting from the “penny stock” definition investors may encounter difficulty in selling their stock the commission has adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks we do not currently anticipate that our common stock will be subject to these penny stock rules transaction costs associated with purchases and sales of penny stocks are likely to be higher than those for other securities that are listed on a national regional or international stock exchange penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq proprietary system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system        table of contents   the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document to its customer that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation   in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from such rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common shares in the united states and shareholders may find it more difficult to sell their shares    once trading commences the price of our shares may experience substantial volatility in recent years the securities markets in the united states and canada particularly in respect of mining companies have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market price of securities of many mineral exploration companies have experienced wide fluctuations in price which have not necessarily been related to the operating performance underlying asset values or prospects of such companies the price of our common shares is also likely to be significantly affected by shortterm changes in the price of capital or in our financial condition or results of operations as reflected in our quarterly earnings reports other factors unrelated to our performance that may have an effect on the price of our common shares once they are trading if at all include the following the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business may be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not follow our securities lessening in trading volume and general market interest in our securities may affect an investor’s ability to trade significant numbers of our common shares the size of our public float may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our securities and a substantial decline in the price of our common shares

proved to be safe harbors for capital investmentassuming a viable business vehicle is acquired those lines of business include automotive dealerships automotive services construction oil and clean energy financial services and insurance services industries management deems mainstays in the current economy and well understood business models to the average investor mcgraw can be viewed as seeking out existing companies in lines of business with a low beta or risk inside industries that have large upside potential including the automotive industry by way of example dealership services

across multiple industry platforms   the company believes that the construction and real estate sectors are showing signs of growth and such market sectors have traditionally been safe harbor investments for longterm investors along with traditional construction plans for high end residential and income producing commercial buildings mcgraw plans to operate inside a niche market of the construction industry medical facilities construction in management’s opinion the medical field especially senior care or “longterm care” is soon to experience its largest growth cycle in a generation we believe the rate of retirees is set to exceed all generations by a large multiple mcgraw plans to combine the stable and increasing construction industry with the stable and high growth longterm care industry management believes it can join with a wellestablished and experienced medical group servicing a significant patient list the company with adequate funding will be able to build up multiple medical facilities and grand open each location at  presold and occupied we expect to be able to staff and manage those facilities with properly licensed medical staff and operated by the

preferred stock or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal for instance the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable a holder to block such a transaction in addition under certain circumstances the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock although our board of directors is required to make any determination to issue preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of our shareholders our board could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some or a majority of our shareholders might believe to be in their best

board of directors however occurring including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of our board may only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors then in office

to the stockholders a resolution to amend our articles of incorporation that would prohibit written consents by a majority of the stockholders if adopted by the stockholders this proposal may lengthen the amount of time required to take stockholder actions and would prevent the amendment of our bylaws or removal of directors by our stockholders without holding a meeting of stockholders        table

or disclosures   in february  the fasb issued asu no  “leases” which requires lessees to recognize rightofuse assets and lease liabilities for all leases with the exception of shortterm leases at the commencement date of each lease this asu requires lessees to apply a dual approach classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee this classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straightline basis over the term of the lease this asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted the amendments of this update should be

was somewhat illusory and when interest rates rose to offset inflation conglomerate profits fell investors noticed that the companies inside the conglomerate were growing no faster than before they were purchased whereas the rationale for buying a company was that synergies would provide efficiency by the late s they were shunned by the market and a major selloff of their shares ensued to keep the companies going many conglomerates were forced to shed the industries they had recently purchased and by the mids most had been reduced to shells the conglomerate fad was subsequently replaced by newer ideas like focusing on a companys core competency in other cases conglomerates are formed for genuine interests of diversification rather than manipulation of paper return on investment companies with this orientation would only make acquisitions or start new branches in other sectors when they believed this would increase profitability or stability by sharing risks flush with cash during the s general electric also moved into financing and financial services which in  accounted for about  of the companys net earnings ge formerly owned a minority interest in nbcuniversal which owns the nbc television network and several other cable networks in some ways ge is the opposite of the typical s conglomerate in that the company was not highly leveraged and when interest rates went up they were able to turn this to their advantage it was often less expensive to lease from ge than buy new equipment using loans united technologies has also proven to be a successful conglomerate with the spread of mutual funds especially index funds since  investors could more easily obtain diversification by owning a small slice of many companies in a fund rather than owning shares in a

disadvantagesedit the extra layers of management increase costs accounting disclosure is less useful information many numbers are disclosed grouped rather than separately for each business the complexity of a conglomerates accounts make them harder for managers investors and regulators to analyze and makes it easier for management to hide things conglomerates can trade at a discount to the overall individual value of their businesses because investors can achieve diversification on their own simply by purchasing multiple stocks the whole is often worth less than the sum of its parts culture clashes can destroy value inertia prevents development of innovation lack of focus and inability to manage unrelated businesses equally well brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment product area or quality price or cachet some cite the decreased cost of conglomerate stock a phenomenon known as conglomerate discount as evidential of these disadvantages while other traders believe this tendency to be a market inefficiency which undervalues the true strength of these stocks media conglomeratesedit further information media conglomerate

commercial applications the bussmann division of mcgrawedison manufacturers distributes and sells fuses and fuse accessories and is the worlds largest manufacturer of small and medium dimension fuses mcgrawedison registered its trademark tron in  for electrical fuses and  for fuse holders clip clamps and fuse clips and has used the trademark tron to identify a line of fuses and fuse accessories placing the tron mark on both the product and its packaging the defendants do not dispute that mcgrawedisons registrations for the trademark tron are in full force and effect and are the only registrations for the mark tron on the us trademark register  between  and  mcgrawedison sold more than  million worth of tron fuse products and spent more than  million in advertising tron products tron fuse products are sold in a variety of outlets including drug stores grocery stores discount stores eg target kmart venture woolcowoolworths hardware stores eg ace hardware true value hardware and electrical supply and catalog houses eg advent newark tron products are advertised in magazines trade directories catalogs and through point of sale materials  walt disney productions is in the entertainment industry notably the production of motion pictures television programs and the operation of amusement parks in june  disney purchased a screenplay entitled tron and developed a motion picture with the same name in early  disney began to develop a merchandising program to attract prospective manufacturers to produce and sell merchandise associated with the tron motion picture at the same time that disney was developing the merchandise licensing program it engaged tcr service inc to conduct a trademark search in order that disney might determine whether the use of the name tron would conflict with third party uses of similar names on like goods disney discovered that the mego toy company mego owned a federal trademark registration for the mark trons for futuristic toys dolls and toy robots as well as federal registrations for variations of the term tronsuch as biotron microtron alphatron and betatronalso for use on futuristic toys dolls and robots disney negotiated with mego and acquired megos registrations and rights in the mark trons and the variations of tron biotron microtron etc owned by mego disneys trademark search also disclosed mcgrawedisons registration for the trademark tron covering electric fuses and accessories but disneys senior legal counsel did not consider mcgrawedisons registrations as a bar to disneys use of the mark tron  as a result of its licensing and merchandising program disney entered licensing agreements with manufacturers for a wide variety of products displaying the tron mark for sale throughout the country specifically disney licensed the mark tron to the defendant bally for video games and software and to other manufacturers for items such as telephones phonograph records wristwatches tee shirts and sweatshirts posters

entitled tron and asserted its rights in its registered trademark tron after negotiations failed to resolve the dispute between mcgrawedison and disney and bally disney brought a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on the same day mcgrawedison filed its complaint in the present action against disney and bally count i of mcgrawedisons complaint alleged that disneys and ballys use of the tron mark is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive consumers as to the origin and sponsorship of the products of mcgrawedison disney and bally in violation of the lanham act  usc sec  sec a count ii claimed that the defendants use of mcgrawedisons tron trademark constituted unfair competition caused injury to mcgrawedisons business reputation and good will and diluted the distinctive character and quality of mcgrawedisons tron mark in violation of illrevstat ch  sec  ch   secs  and illinois common law mcgrawedison sought to enjoin disney and bally from further use of the tron mark requested an accounting of all profits the defendants derived from their use of the mark tron and prayed for compensatory as well as punitive damages  the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that the undisputed facts demonstrated that the continued respective uses by the parties of the name tron cannot result in confusion nor is it likely that the defendants continued use of the name tron will diminish the value of plaintiffs trademark used in connection with the sale and promotion of its fuse products the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on both counts of the complaint and rejected mcgrawedisons claim that the existence of material issues of fact precluded summary judgment stating those issues presented by mcgrawedison are either not material or are legally based  in determining whether the defendants had created a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of its products as required to prove a violation of  usc secs   the district court considered the seven factors delineated by this court in helene curtis industries inc v church

of evidence of actual confusion on the part of consumers the lack of concurrence of markets and advertising the difference in printing of the two marks and the lack of intent on the part of defendants to pawn off their products as plaintiffs the court finds that no likelihood of confusion exists  with respect to mcgrawedisons state law claims in count ii the court noted that the illinois deceptive trade practices act illrevstat ch   sec  imposes liability upon an infringer only if a likelihood of confusion exists the court concluded that the defendants were not liable under the statute referring to its previous conclusion that no likelihood of confusion existed the district court also granted summary judgment with respect to the plaintiffs claim under the illinois antidilution act illrevstat ch  sec  on the basis of its finding that mcgrawedisons mark tron was not distinctive on appeal mcgrawedison claims that there are genuine issues of material fact which preclude summary judgment on the issue of likelihood of confusion and that the district court committed errors of law in dismissing its dilution claim ii  in reviewing the district courts grant of summary judgment we note that judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and  the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law  black v henry pratt co  fd   th cir

factors piper aircraft  fd at  mcgrawedison contends that a factual dispute existed for each of these factors except one the strength of plaintiffs mark which mcgrawedison maintains the district court nevertheless resolved in defendants favor on the basis of improper and inadmissible evidence and that the district court improperly resolved factual disputes in defendants favor on all of the remaining issues except the similarity of the marks we will consider each of the factors enumerated in helene curtis in turn   the degree of similarity between the marks  the district court acknowledged differences between the plaintiffs and defendants presentation of the mark tron  the word tron as presented by plaintiff is spelled in straight block letters in one color in addition wherever the word tron appears in plaintiffs packaging or product the term buss or bussmann also appears indicating production by plaintiffs bussmann division sometimes the mark buss is as prominent as the mark tron  the mark tron as presented by defendants is spelled with somewhat unique futuristictype lettering with darker colors usually above lighter colors in the letters in some of the packaging or advertisements for products tied into the movie the word tron is spelled in block letters as plaintiff contends  in each case however the corresponding product itself has the uniquely patterned letters in addition in each instance where the word tron appears walt disneys name also appears though in very tiny letters  despite these differences in presentation the court concluded that there is a high degree of similarity between the marks and though their presentation is different the possibility of confusion exists based upon the marks alone nevertheless the district court cited the difference in printing of the two marks in support of its ultimate conclusion that there was no likelihood of confusion between the plaintiffs and the defendants products mcgrawedison contends that some of the disney licensed products fail to include any mention of disney and that some of the products do not incorporate the described color scheme mcgrawedison further claims that disney considers the use of tron in block letters to be within the scope of its disneys rights in view of these contentions the failure to include disneys name on all disney licensed tron products and the failure to employ the described color scheme on all of disneys tron items mcgrawedison argues that the district court improperly distinguished the parties marks on the basis of disneys futuristic lettering style and the inclusion of walt disneys name on any disney tron product were we to accept mcgrawedisons view of the facts regarding disneys use of the tron mark failing to place disneys name on all disney licensed tron products or incorporate the disney color scheme on all disney tron merchandise the fact remains that the marks are distinguishable since wherever the word tron appears on mcgrawedisons packaging or products the term buss or bussmann also appears disney licensed products obviously do not include the term buss or bussmann the marks thus are not identical and the district court could properly conclude that there is a high degree of similarity between the marks yet consider the differences between the marks in determining whether a likelihood of confusion existed between mcgrawedisons and defendants products  the similarity of the products  according to the district court the product lines carrying disneys tron label and plaintiffs tron label are very different plaintiffs tron line  includes high quality utilitarian electrical products the products carrying disneys tron label are entertainmentbased video games pajamas toy watches tshirts and costumes have little to do with high quality fuses the court concluded that the mcgrawedison and disney product lines are entirely unrelated mcgrawedison contends the district court failed to recognize the wide scope of disneys licensing program and emphasis on electrical and electronic products and overlooked the fact that mcgrawedison fuses are compatible and consistent with the type of products licensed by disney the defendants argue without providing any statutory or case law support the only material issue in determining similarity of the products is whether any of the goods actually licensed by disney are in any way related to fuses  the fact that the products at issue may be very different is not dispositive of the issue of the similarity of the products in determining the existence of a likelihood of confusion between products the question is whether the products are the kind the public attributes to a single source e remy martin  co sa v shawross international imports inc  fd   th cir the rights of an owner of a registered trademark  extend to any goods related in the minds of consumers in the sense that a single producer is likely to put out both goods id see also sign of the beefeater  fd at  in finding the parties product lines to be entirely unrelated the district court apparently ignored the question of whether the purchasing public might believe a single source could produce both electronic fuses manufactured by mcgrawedison and video games and telephones licensed by disney ignoring this question seems especially significant in this case since mcgrawedison introduced evidence that  of persons shown photographs of both mcgrawedison and disney tron products believed the products were manufactured by the same company mcgrawedisons survey is discussed infra  further the district courts opinion failed to address the fact that the defendant bally has been a customer of mcgrawedison and uses mcgrawedison fuses in at least some of its video arcade gamesa fact which conceivably could lead a consumer to believe that tron fuses and tron video games are in some manner attributable to a single source accordingly we hold that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether the products are the kind the public attributes to a single source and the district court erred in finding the product lines of the parties to be entirely unrelated  the area and manner of concurrent use  the district court found the tron products licensed by disney are generally sold to those who have seen or are interested in the movie  while plaintiffs products are generally sold to industrial users  to  and electronic experts  to  the court further stated  of the  to  percent purchased by the public the fuses are sold in electrical stores or electrical departments of general stores only  per cent of plaintiffs advertising is directed to the lay consumer though some stores may carry both plaintiffs goods and disneys licensed goods the intersection is small  generally public purchasers of plaintiffs goods will purchase them in electrical outlet stores where goods licensed by defendant disney with the tron mark will usually not be available  our review of the record has failed to disclose any evidence supporting the courts initial finding that disneys tron products are generally sold to those who have seen or are interested in the movie  further the district court found that only  percent of plaintiffs advertising is directed to the lay consumer while the record reveals that in addition to the approximately ten percent of the tron advertising funds expended directly in the residential consumer market mcgrawedison provided an undisclosed amount of advertising materials to its distributors who in turn advertised to residential customers thus the total amount of advertising directed to residential consumers cannot be established on the basis of the record before the court finally the record reflects that disney does not limit the type of retail outlets where its licensed products are sold except to exclude outlets that are incompatible with the disney image such as barrooms or poolrooms or dance halls but rather disney allows its products to be sold in hardware stores through mail order and catalog sales and in department stores such as kmart sears montgomery ward and woolcowoolworths the record also discloses that mcgrawedison tron fuses are sold in drug stores grocery stores hardware stores and department stores such as target kmart venture and woolcowoolworths but we have been unable to discover any evidence in the record documenting the percentage of tron fuses sold to the general public through hardware or department stores as opposed to electronic specialty stores nor have we found evidence in the record demonstrating the percentage of disney licensed tron products sold in hardware and department stores as opposed to mail order or catalog outlets or other retail outlets where mcgrawedison tron products are not available thus on the record we are unable to find support for the district courts conclusion that mcgrawedison and disney tron products are not sold in similar outlets since the defendants have failed to provide evidence establishing who purchases disney tron products the extent of mcgrawedison tron advertising directed to residential consumers and the number of stores carrying both disney tron products and mcgrawedison tron fuses we hold that the defendants have failed to meet their burden of proving the lack of a genuine issue of material fact concerning the area and manner of concurrent use of the plaintiffs and defendants products   the degree of care likely to be exercised by consumers  the district court compared the types of products manufactured by mcgrawedison and licensed by disney and concluded generally consumers buying fuses would take more care than those buying the products licensed by disney as our review of the record has failed to reveal evidence supporting this conclusion of the district court we hold that the defendants have failed to establish the lack of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the degree of care likely to be exercised by consumers  the strength of mcgrawedisons mark  it is undisputed that mcgrawedisons registration of tron is the only registration for that trademark the court noted however the existence of numerous registrations for trademarks similar to tron for example trons celtron ztron u v tron filtron trinitron acutron ticketron and voltron the court also noted that mcgrawedisons trademark tron is always accompanied by buss or bussmann and that the majority of tron advertising has been geared toward a narrow sophisticated audience through trade journals according to the court these factors indicate that tron is a relatively weak mark outside its narrow area of high quality fuse products  in assessing the strength of the mcgrawedison tron mark we initially must determine which category of trademarks the word tron belongs to  trademarks may be placed into four categories according to strength and the corresponding amount of protection which will be accorded them trademarks can be  descriptive or generic ie the mark describes the product or service itself  suggestive ie the mark describes or suggests a characteristic of the product or service  arbitrary ie the mark is a word in common use but applied to a product or service unrelated to its meaning so that the word neither describes nor suggests the product or service and  coined ie the mark is a word devised or invented for the purpose of identifying the product  tisch hotels inc v americana inn inc  fd   n  th cir see also sun banks of florida inc v sun federal savings  loan  fd   th cir one commentator has referred to coined marks as fanciful  fanciful marks consist of coined words which have been invented for the sole purpose of functioning as a trademark such marks comprise words which are either totally unknown in the language or are completely out of use at the time as with obsolete or scientific terms mccarthy trademarks and unfair competition sec   nd ed we believe that the district court properly characterized the mark tron as somewhat fanciful as the presentation of evidence in the record fails to disclose the origin of the tron mark or whether tron has any meaning as a word cf jb williams co inc v le conte cosmetics inc  fd   th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   conti considered to be a strong mark because the origin of the name was unknown and there was no evidence that it was a word with meaning of its own but we are unable to ascertain from the record whether the district court considered the fanciful nature of the tron mark in finding tron to be a relatively weak mark outside its narrow area of high quality fuse products  furthermore the third party registrations of trademarks similar to tron discussed by the district court are material in determining the strength of the tron mark only to the extent that the similar marks are promoted by their owners or recognized by the consuming public a trademark which is found only in the records of the patent and trademark office does not materially affect the distinctiveness of anothers mark which is actively used in trade callmann unfair comp trademarks  monopolies sec   th ed  the significance of thirdparty trademarks depends wholly upon their usage defendant introduced no evidence that these trademarks were actually used by third parties that they were well promoted or that they were recognized by consumers as the court pointed out in lilly pulitzer inc v lilli ann corp  fd    the existence of these registrations is not evidence of what happens in the marketplace or that customers are familiar with their use   scarves by vera inc v todo imports ltd inc  fd   d cir see also stanadyne inc v lins  fd   ccpa  smith bros mfg co v stone mfg co  fd   ccpa  also since the record before us fails to contain any evidence that these similar trademarks are actually used by third parties or that they have been promoted and are recognized by consumers we conclude the defendants have failed to prove the absence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the strength of the tron mark  actual confusion  our review of the record reveals that the defendants have failed to provide any evidence to show that there was no likelihood of confusion between its tron products and mcgrawedison tron products mcgrawedison commissioned elrich and lavidge inc a marketing research firm to conduct a marketing research study to determine whether there existed a likelihood of confusion between the plaintiffs and the defendants tron products the survey consisted of  personal interviews conducted in five cities the people interviewed were shown a photograph of mcgrawedisons tron electric fuses along with a photograph of one of disneys licensed products bearing the tron name when asked whether the products were put out by the same company or a different company  out of  people interviewed  replied that it was the same company mcgrawedison submitted the survey to the court as evidence of actual confusion between mcgrawedisons and disneys products bearing the tron mark the district court discounted this survey stating that it had  problems similar to a survey discussed in henris food products co inc v kraft inc  fd   th cir in henris the questions tended to bring to the interviewees mind the products which contained the allegedly infringed mark the interviewee was then asked who made the infringing product the court held that the previous questions had potentially contaminated the latter question  the plaintiff in henris commissioned two separate and distinct surveys to be conducted neither of which employed the same methodology as the survey in the present case while the survey in the case at bar presented photos of both disneys and mcgrawedisons tron products to the interviewees and asked whether the goods were put out by the same or different companies both surveys discussed in henris presented the interviewee with a single product and asked either who do you believe makes this product or who puts out this product in one of the henris surveys the question of who puts out this product was preceded by five other questions that potentially contaminated the responses to the final question concerning the origin of the product the district courts comparison and application of that survey to the survey in this case is both inappropriate and misapplied as they used a completely different methodology in comparison with the present survey we thus disagree with the district court that the survey introduced by mcgrawedison suffered from the same problems as the survey in henris furthermore the henris court acknowledged that the defendant pointed to several flaws in one of the surveys which caution against giving it too much weight but the court also stated we cannot conclude however that the survey should be ignored henris  fd at  we see no logical or legally sound reason nor has the district court given any persuasive reasoning or explanation of why the survey results are not probative as to confusion among the consuming public although the district court suggested that a flaw of the survey was its presentation of both disney and mcgrawedison products to a single interviewee instead of giving each interviewee either a mcgrawedison product or a disney product and inquiring who put out the product we believe the district courts concern regarding the manner of presentation to the interviewee goes to the weight to be accorded to the survey results rather than providing a reason to ignore the survey evidence altogether we thus conclude the district court improperly disregarded the results of mcgrawedisons survey showing that  of those interviewed believed the mcgrawedison and disney products shown to them were put out by the same company  reason tells us that  very little proof of actual confusion would be necessary to prove likelihood of confusion world carpets inc v dick littrells new world carpets  fd   th cir indeed while likelihood of confusion can be proven without any evidence of actual confusion such evidence if available is entitled to substantial weight helene curtis  fd at  since the defendants have failed to offer any evidence to demonstrate that there is no likelihood of confusion and on the other hand the plaintiff has offered its survey results revealing that  of those individuals interviewed were confused as to whether the mcgrawedison and disney tron products shown to them were manufactured by the same company we conclude the defendants have not established the lack of a material question of fact regarding actual confusion   the intent on the part of the alleged infringer  the district court noted that disney and bally were aware of mcgrawedisons tron trademark when they licensed products bearing that mark but found no evidence that disney intended to confuse consumers in fact the evidence clearly shows that disney believed it was not infringing upon plaintiffs mark intent therefore does not come into play in the courts calculations mcgrawedison argues to the contrary that disney disregarded mcgrawedisons rights since its efforts in licensing and marketing tron products increased the likelihood that a consumer would be confused into believing there was a common sponsorship or authorization between the parties or their products and increased the dilution of plaintiffs mark the record reveals that disney knew of mcgrawedisons registration of the mark tron and mcgrawedisons use of that mark went to their own retained counsel to support their theory that mcgrawedisons registrations of the tron mark did not bar disneys use of tron and proceeded with licensing and merchandising its own line of tron products without even contacting mcgrawedison subjective issues such as good faith are singularly inappropriate for determination on summary judgment american international group inc v london american international corporation ltd  fd   d cir see also central national life insurance v f  d co of maryland  fd   n  th cir where intent is a controlling element courts must be especially cautious in granting summary judgment since the resolution of that issue depends so much on the credibility of the witnesses  in view of the fact that disney proceeded to license tron products despite its awareness of mcgrawedisons registered tron trademark we conclude that the district court improperly resolved the issue of the defendants intent against mcgrawedison on the motion for summary judgment  since we are convinced that the defendants have failed to meet their strict burden of proof in establishing the lack of genuine issues of material fact with respect to  whether the products bearing the mcgrawedison tron mark and the products bearing the disney tron mark are the kind the public attributes to a single source  the area and manner of concurrent use of the products  the degree of care likely to be exercised by consumers purchasing mcgrawedisons and disneys tron products  the strength of mcgrawedisons tron mark  the extent of actual confusion among consumers and  the intent of disney we hold that the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that no likelihood of confusion exists and in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on count i b count ii  in count ii mcgrawedison asserted claims under illinois deceptive trade practices act illrevstat ch   sec  and the antidilution act illrevstat ch  sec  under the illinois deceptive trade practices act a defendant is liable only if the plaintiff can establish a likelihood of confusion between the parties products hooker v columbia pictures industries inc  f supp   ndill  likelihood of confusion has the same meaning in unfair competition cases under the deceptive trade practices act as it has in traditional infringement cases id as we have found that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the likelihood of confusion between defendants and plaintiffs products bearing the tron mark we conclude that the granting of summary judgment was unwarranted and improper on mcgrawedisons claim under the illinois deceptive trade practices act  under the antidilution act the relevant factors to be considered by the court are the distinctiveness of the mark and whether the mark is being diluted hyatt corporation v hyatt legal services  fd   th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   the district court reiterated its finding that mcgrawedisons mark tron was a weak mark noting that many products have names similar to or incorporating the tron name and that the tron name is almost always used in connection with bussmann or buss further the court noted that the word tron is not extraordinarily unique taken as it is from the word electronic  finding the plaintiffs mark not to be distinctive the court failed to analyze whether the defendants use of the tron mark diluted the strength of mcgrawedisons mark mcgrawedison argues to the contrary that its mark tron is distinctive emphasizing  that its mark tron has been registered since  and is the only trademark registration with that name  that it has spent over  million in advertising tron products since   that the district court found the word tron to be somewhat fanciful and create  images of high level electronics  that it has sold over  million of tron products since  and  that its bussmann division which markets tron products is the worlds largest manufacturer of small and medium dimension fuses in hyatt we stated that the factors to be considered in determining the distinctiveness of a mark include the type of mark a mark that is coined or invented may make distinctiveness easier to show the length of time of the mark has been used the scope of advertising and promotions the nature and extent of the business and the scope of the first users reputation  fd at  we have already concluded above that the defendants have failed to prove the absence of genuine issues of material fact with respect to the strength of mcgrawedisons tron mark specifically regarding the use of similar trademarks registered by third parties and the scope of mcgrawedisons advertising and promotion of tron products to residential consumers accordingly we hold that the existence of these factual issues precludes the court from finding that mcgrawedisons tron mark is not distinctive as a matter of law and we hold that it was error for the district court to grant summary judgment on the state law claims asserted in count ii of mcgrawedisons complaint  in reversing the district courts grant of summary judgment we express no view as to the merits of mcgrawedisons claims rather we only conclude that on the present record the district court should not have decided the disputed issues in the case on a motion for summary judgment iii  the judgment of the district court is reversed  the honorable robert

causes likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding as to the source sponsorship approval or certification of goods or services  causes likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding as to the affiliation connection or association with or certification by another illrevstat ch   sec   according to disney the plot of the movie involved a real world in which people are controlled by an evil conglomerate using a master computer program and an electronic world inside the computer program the hero of the film is transported into the computer program where he wages a battle against evil in a setting filled with sights and sounds typical of a video game the characters in the electronic world are counterparts to characters in the real world among these characters is a video warrior named tron   disney subsequently dismissed its declaratory judgment action against mcgrawedison in the united states district court in new york  although the district court concluded that the word tron is taken from the word electronic we have found no evidence in the record to support this hypothesis or speculation which might actually be accurate but a look into websters third new international dictionary unabridged discloses that tron is a suffix denoting a vacuum tube or denoting a device for the manipulation of subatomic particles  onehalf of those interviewed were asked are these two products put out by the same company or by different companies and onehalf were asked the question in the reverse order are these two products put out by different companies or by the same company  mcgrawedison also claimed that the defendants had engaged in unfair competition in violation of illinois common law we need not address this claim separately as the illinois deceptive trade practices act illrevstat ch   sec  et seq is merely a codification of the illinois common law of unfair competition mcdonalds corp v gunville  f supp  ndill affd  fd  th cir media conglomerates flashcards
