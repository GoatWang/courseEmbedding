shareholders the online retail industry in china is intensely competitive our current or potential competitors include i major online retailers in china that offer a wide range of general merchandise product categories such as alibaba group which operates taobaocom and tmallcom and amazon china which operates amazoncn and ii major traditional retailers in china that are moving into online retailing such as suning appliance company limited which operates suningcom walmart which holds a majority interest in yihaodiancom and gome electrical appliances which operates gomecomcn we also face

it accumulates and if it’s ecofriendly  more importantly how about the high running costs   as a solution we are proud to introduce vessel’s new “cleanwalkereasy” reusable sticky mat model cwez   unlike most conventional peeloff tacky mats the “clean walker easy” is constructed of a gellike polyurethane material and its strong adhesive power effectively removes contaminants from the bottom of shoes and wheels  its elastic surface picks up dust and dirt particles in hard to reach areas such as in the tiny grooves on the bottom of shoes and on the outer edges of wheels from trolleys and carts   install at the entrance of clean rooms in air shower booths for cleaning trolley wheels etc  ideal in facilities manufacturing semiconductors electronics precision devices foodstuffs packaging materials in printing or painting plants in pharmaceutical and medical facilities etc   the cwez is composed of a threelayer structure with a nonwoven fabric core which results in high durability to prevent tears under the pressure of trollies and carts being rolled over the mat   also the lowprofile ” mm thickness will not obstruct doors when opening and closing  the front and backside of the mat are both adhesive so you can install on either side and flip the mat over when one surface gets dirty   this ecofriendly product is truly reusable  it’s an efficient and costeffective solution when compared to the conventional disposable “peeloff” sticky mats that require a yearly running cost the clean walker can last up to three years and potentially pay for itself over a short period of time   the vessel clean walker easily cleans with water  when the mat becomes dirty simply clean off the surface with tap water using a mop a squeegee or a damp cloth  also the mat is designed into two separate tiles which makes it easy for an operator to pick the mat off the floor bring it to a sink for washing and it can be hung to dry using the builtin “hookholes”  the adhesive power returns once the mat is fully dried the cwez comes with two individual tiles covering a total area of w x l is ” thick weighs approximately  lbs and is rohs compliant to find out more information about the

industrial ion gun with led light beam model bbze     the rugged industrial ion gun is designed to neutralize and eliminate dust while effectively cleaning the surface on large plasticmade products while working in an upright position     the bbze provides a very accurate ion balance within v at a higher air pressure psi which results in effective cleaning for blowing contaminants off a large surface area  using a powerful airflow at psi it can rapidly neutralize an area at a ” distance in less than  seconds or ” distance in less than  seconds     unlike other models the bbze is outfitted with an integrated led light beam for visual dust confirmation and does not have an external transformer  instead it’s composed of a safe highfrequency piezoelectric transformer that’s built into the handle  this compact design saves valuable workspace and makes it easier to move from one location to another     the nozzle angle is ergonomically crafted to help alleviate any burden on the operator’s wrist while pointing to the targeted area for dust removal  it has a nonslip grip even for clean room gloves is very compact and ultra lightweight only  lbs both sides of the grip have a “green” operating led and a “red” highvoltage led which enables both left and righthanded users to check the operational state at a glance     also the unique silent straight nozzle is very quiet only  dba at psi and helps reduce “windroar” noise levels in factories  the low noise characteristics have almost no effect on other electronic devices     the “screwtype” nozzle construction allows for easy maintenance  the tungsten electrode needle gh can quickly be cleaned or replaced by using the optional removal tool gdr  various attachments are available for better work efficiency such as brushes an air tube adapter and a “silent” or flaredshape nozzle     other features include a durable ’ power cable for working in a large area a vibrationresistant screwin connector between the power cable and the body for improved durability a safe low voltage v dc power supply holds the ce marking and complies with rohs standards       to find out more information about the vessel bbze

conventional fantype ionizers are used in many industries for several different types of applications  for instance electronic part manufacturing and assembly plants use fantype ionizers for preventing electronic components from being damaged caused by electrostatic discharge esd  in this situation a fantype ionizer is placed on the workbench for static removal over a wide range at a close distance  also since “space” is limited on a workbench using compact designed equipment is preferred moreover resin forming factories and printing plants use fantype ionizers for preventing dust adherence on the surface of parts that is caused by static electricity  an ionizer is installed into the system for static erasing from a remote location which may require neutralizing the air in a straight pattern so that it reaches a further distance in either case the area coverage that is needed for static erasing is different as a solution jdv products inc is proud to announce the release of vessel’s new “butterfly louver” ultraslim fantype ionizer model fe unlike most conventional fantype ionizers the fe has a unique adjustable front panel that can disperse the airflow in a “wide” or a “straight” pattern for a close or remote distance  this versatile design is suitable for a wide range of static removal applications such as for a bag making machine a highspeed automated line for substrate manufacturing for liquid crystal film cutting equipment over a forming machine conveyor for a soldering or film attachment and in electronic device component stock area the fe has a very fast decay time within  seconds at a ” distance straight louver max airflow setting  it’s equipped with an ac corona discharge method for an accurate ion balance within v a reliable highfrequency piezoelectric transformer for minimizing ion loss and is outfitted with an adjustable threespeed fan which is powerful and capable of blowing ionized air to remote locations in addition it’s crafted with a super slim and compact body ”h x ”w x ”d with stand and is very lightweight only  lbs so it saves valuable workbench space and makes it convenient for easy installation on the front of the unit there is a clear operator led display panel  a  “green” led indicates good operating condition and a “red” led represents a highvoltage or a fan lockup warning  also since there is a unique builtin terminal connector the high voltage warning signals can be sent to external equipment and it enables up to two units to be daisychained together using one power source easy access to the internal components simplifies maintenance the front cover can be quickly removed and there is a safety device that shuts off the circuit and fan when the front cover is open  there are no tools required for removing the stainless steel electrode needle discharge unit  it’s installed into the front panel so its easily accessible for removing or cleaning it other features include a safe low voltage v dc power supply a swivel stand that can be bench or wallmounted the ce marking and it is rohs compliant to find out more information about the vessel new butterfly louver fantype ionizer model fe please
