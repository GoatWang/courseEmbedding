grain pattern with a deep brown chocolate hue black walnut is used in highend guitar crafting piano construction and other premium applications known for its responsive curve and tight bass black walnut produces a clean sound with a strong emphasis on midtones and a superior lowend response relative to the other tonewoodscherry cherrywood has a simple yet elegant straightgrain pattern with a light reddishbrown hue less commonly used as a tonewood today due to its high cost cherry has a long history in highend string instrument crafting cherrywood emphasizes midtones resulting in a crisp balanced sound highlighting the tonal nuances of vocal performances mahogany mahogany a favorite of makers of stringed instruments ─ known as luthiers’ mahogany ─ is a “goto” in the crafting of acoustic guitars bass guitars and many other stringed instruments this tonewood is often described as “earthy” due to its unique crossgrain structure with a responsive mid range mahogany highlights more natural and mellow soundsmaple with a bright crisp sound and creamy white complexion maple’s light and bright appearance is belied by its strength and considerable heft maple is a dense hard heavy wood capable of capturing the widest spectrum of the tonewood options as the hardest of the four tonewoods maple does not resonate as much as the others producing a higher definition of sound

bluetooth speakers has parallel walls which cause sound waves to hit each other squarely and bounce off these waves cancel each other out or “stand” on each other making them inaudible when users hear a humming or buzzing coming from a rectangular speaker it’s usually caused by these standing waves site’s triangle shape eliminates this possibilitysite tech specificationsaccessoriescustomers can

glossary of terms early stage vs late stage companies the startup lifecycle spans idea generation to an eventual exit through an acquisition initial offering liquidation or failure with several inflection points throughout seed and early stage investments seed and early stage companies are typically seeking capital to invest in product development building a team of employees and formalizing customer acquisition strategies while seed stage companies are focused on product development early stage companies typically have a handful of users testing a beta product while finetuning their gotomarket strategy and building out sales channels • focused on product development and preparing for a broader market launch • product is usually in use by early beta customers for testing and feedback • typically cashconstrained and seeking its first outside investors through family friends and angel investors investments within this stage typically take two forms convertible notes and preferred equity the form of investment is dependent on the company’s relative maturity with seed stage investments typically structured as convertible notes while early stage companies issue preferred equity in exchange for investor funds in institutional venture capital terms these are known as series seed series a and at times series b • officially launched and focused on customer acquisition • implementing its sales channel strategy and attempting to reach breakeven cash flow • generating revenue but pursing additional capital from institutional investors to invest in customer acquisition and business development   latestage investments late stage companies have typically demonstrated viability as a going concern and generally have a wellknown product with a strong market presence late stage companies have generally reached a point of positive cash flow generation and begin to experiment with expanding into tangential markets regardless investments in both earlystage and latestage companies involve a considerable amount of risk • wellknown product which has successfully penetrated its initial market and learned where and how to move next • may be cash flow positive and introducing its product into tangential markets • investors are seeking liquidity as the company begins to position itself for an acquisition or an initial public offering investments

is paramount in accurately capturing the risks and return characteristics associated with that investment risks involved investments in earlystage and latestage companies are highly speculative and involve significant risks due to among other things inconsistent cash flows the competitive landscape and short operating cycles these investments are generally illiquid and highly speculative and are
