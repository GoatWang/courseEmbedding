surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using

are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond management’s control although sprague believes that the assumptions underlying these statements are reasonable investors are cautioned that such forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and involve risks that may affect our business prospects and performance causing actual results to differ from those discussed in the foregoing release a number of important factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forwardlooking statements including the parties’ ability to consummate the transaction the conditions to the completion of the transaction including the receipt of certain consents required in connection with the transaction which may not be obtained on the terms expected or on the anticipated schedule the parties’ ability to meet expectations regarding the timing completion and accounting and tax treatments of the transaction the possibility that the parties may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all or be unable to successfully integrate carbos operations into those of sprague the possibility that the integration of carbo into sprague may be more difficult time consuming or costly than expected resulting increases in operating costs customer loss and business disruption including without

information or future events  you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date of this press release nongaap financial measuresadjusted ebitda and permanent leverage ratio are measures not defined by united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap”  we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization which sprague refers to as ebitda adjusted for unrealized hedging gains and losses in each case with respect to refined products and natural gas inventory prepaid forward contracts and natural gas transportation contracts spragues permanent leverage ratio is calculated by dividing the aggregate of its acquisition facility borrowings capital lease obligations debentures and other debt by the consolidated trailing twelvemonth adjusted ebitda as defined by the credit agreement  sprague’s management uses certain nongaap financial measurements to evaluate its results of operations including adjusted ebitda and our permanent leverage ratio adjusted ebitda is one of the supplemental financial measures used by management to describe its operations and economic performance to investors trade suppliers research analysts and commercial banks to assess economic results of its operations the market value of its inventory and natural gas transportation contracts for financial reporting to lenders as well as for borrowing base purposes and repeatable operating performance that is not distorted by nonrecurring items or market volatility  management believes the permanent leverage ratio is helpful to investors in assessing the partnerships overall debt profile and is used by management to evaluate its ability to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions sprague believes that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that are used by its management and that these measures are useful to investors because they aid in comparing its operating performance with that of other companies with similar operations spragues calculations of nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other businesses because they may be defined differently by other companies you can find additional disclosures on our use of these nongaap measures as well as reconciliations between gaap and these nongaap measures in
