circumstances of any particular investor or suggest any specific course of action investment decisions should be made based on an investor’s objectives and circumstances and in consultation with his or her advisors risk considerations there is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective an investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them this trust is unmanaged you can lose money investing in this trust this trust terminates approximately two years from the initial date of deposit investing in the trust units may involve a high degree of risk and is highly speculative and aggressive and therefore an investment in trust units may not be suitable for someone with low risk tolerance common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any issuer’s dividend may vary from time to time a portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors this trust is concentrated in the energy sector there are certain risks specific to the energy sector including the potential adverse effect of state and federal regulation increasing costs of natural resources commodity price risk supply and demand risk depletion risk and exploration risk this trust is concentrated in the utilities sector because this trust invests significantly in the utility industry it may be highly susceptible to any economic political or regulatory occurrences affecting this industry stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes products or financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the united states this may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries us or foreign tax treatment and the potential lack of liquidity government supervision and regulation this trust invests in preferred securities preferred securities are equity securities of the issuing company which pay income in the form of dividends preferred securities do not generally have the growth potential of common stocks they are also sensitive to interest rate changes and the market price generally falls with rising interest rates in addition they are more likely to be called for redemption in a declining interest rate environment in the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy preferred securities will not be repaid until the issuer’s other debt securities which have priority have been satisfied income payments on preferred securities may generally be deferred without default although such payments will continue to accrue until paid this trust and certain funds held by the trust invest in master limited partnerships “mlps” most mlps operate in the energy natural resources or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors including commodity price risk supply and demand risk depletion risk and exploration risk mlps are also subject to the risk that us taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of mlps for federal income tax purposes which could have a negative impact on the aftertax income available for distribution by the mlps this trust invests in the real estate market and energy reits reits may concentrate their investments in specific geographic areas or in specific property types such as energy infrastructure and such reits will be subject to the risks that affect those areas or property types additional factors can have an impact on the performance of reits and real estate companies including cash available for distribution the credit quality of a particular reit or the real estate industry in general risks associated with ownership of real estate include global and local economic conditions declines in real estate values changes in interest rates the strength or weakness of the real estate market and declines in the value of energy companies and energy assets this trust invests in shares of closedend funds you will bear not only your share of the trust’s expenses but also those of the underlying funds by investing in other funds the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the funds shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market and the net asset value of closedend fund shares may decrease certain closedend funds may employ the use of leverage in their portfolios while leverage often increases the yield of a closedend fund it also increases risks including the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the closedend fund’s common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises not fdic insured  not bank guaranteed  may lose value incapital unit trust series  is a unit investment trust that consists of
