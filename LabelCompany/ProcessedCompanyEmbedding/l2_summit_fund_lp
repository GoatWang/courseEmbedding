movementbest usescasual wearhikingcomments about thenorthface mens l fleece midlayergreat jacket with some flaws very warm for a fleece that is semi see through when shining a light at it breathes very well feels awesome to the touch overall length is good can wear around town if needed some issues i have with tnf is their sizing i normally wear small in jackets it this small was way too tight the medium fell like a small from other companies the armpit and under the armpit to the back is crazy tight where it kind of bothers me even when i just have a t shirt on and im not muscular not sure how a very fit muscular person can wear it reaching up is fine but reaching forward is very restrictive cant really wear a large since it will be too big and sleeves will be too long i have talked to some tnf staffs and some have said the same thing about their sizing issues some main say you cant judge it by the fit but that is a major part of clothing i would recommend this to a friend if it can fit their body im still debating on returning it or not i have the l jacket also and the fit is slightly better but not by muchfitfeels too smallsleeve lengthfeels true to lengthwas this a

recreationalproscomfortablelightweightstylishwarmconsbest usescasual wearcold weatherrunningcomments about thenorthface mens l fleece midlayeri have been a brand loyal north face consumer since  i have always loved the summit series product line because east coast weather in the winter time is so unpredictable i have had oreviius hooded jackets before from the north face co but this one is exceptionally well designed and sewn together mechanically designed seams and architecture had my eyes welded on this jacket i purchased a stretch hooded jacket and super diez down jacket before both were warm but the hooded jacket developed holed from my keys in the stretch materials and the down clumped after washing with the super diez so i need to upgrade and discovered the summit series l and l for layering and warmth man what a great decision i made i am truly warm all the time and when i get to warm i can loose the coat and just wear the l jacket it warm comfortable and soft i hope this

immediately fell in love with look and fit i was a bit skeptic about how warm it would actually be i ended up being very pleased i live in nova scotia and i use a lot of base layers once the cold weather starts i actually bought the l summit series as a companion call it the ironman layer when combined i would rate it  tops i am   pounds with and athletic build fits snug but thats what you

one very durable piece that will probably last be a very long time without tearing at the seems a nice part about the jacket was how the reflective bits sewn in never felt like they would get caught on something and tear off the biggest problem was how hard it was for the jacket to bend but that problem was fixed once i wore the jacket long enoughwas this a giftyesbottom line yes i would
