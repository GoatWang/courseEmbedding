navigating global bond markets navigating global bond markets    the global bond markets are changing the global bond market is undergoing a series of profound changes challenging the traditional role of income and stability that bonds have played and creating new opportunities we believe investors should understand these changes and adapt their portfolios to the new fixedincome landscape interest rates may challenge investors opportunities exist across the globe across the spectrum divergence in global growth lower liquidity may mean higher volatility can your portfolio keep up we believe investors should consider dynamic and flexible fixed income investments that attempt to neutralize or even benefit from rising interest rates investors should also consider strategies that seek value across all sectors of the global fixed income market allowing them to diversify geographically and take advantage of diverging growth patterns  overall investors may prefer highly liquid mutual funds

in the past fixed income managers only had to make three investment decisions the direction of interest rates the allocation to government and corporate bonds and the selection of individual securities today multiple factors may impact the global bond markets making a skilled manager essential the gsam global fixed income team has experience actively investing across the global spectrum

still see opportunities in select areas and relative value strategies where we see value in high yield bonds we believe select areas of the highyield bond market can offer attractive compensation
