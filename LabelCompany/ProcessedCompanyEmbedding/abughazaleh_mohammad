industry oversupply of grapes in our banana business segment net sales decreased to  million compared with  million in the first quarter of  the result of lower net sales in all of our regions in europe net sales were lower due to the lower selling prices a result of unfavorable exchange rates and higher industry volume net sales in asia and north america were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes in the middle east selling prices were significantly lower a result of a competitive market overall volume was  higher than last years first quarter worldwide pricing decreased  to  per

year period and gross profit decrease  million to  million compared with  million in the first quarter of  in our gold pineapple category net sales decreased  to  million during the quarter primarily due to lower volume in north america the result of lower yields in our costa rica operations overall volume decreased  unit pricing was  lower and unit cost was in line with the prior year in our freshcut category net sales increased  to  million compared with  million in the prior year the increase was a result of higher sales volume in all of our regions along with higher selling prices in

during the quarter compared with income tax expense of  million in the prior year the decrease primarily due to lower earnings and as it relates to capital spending we spent  million on capital expenditures in the first quarter of  and we expect to spend approximately  million in  total year this concludes our financial review operator we can now turn it over for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from jonathan feeney from consumer edge research your line is open jonathan feeney good morning thanks very much i wanted to thanks for the questions a few questions first i want to understand am i right is thinking this the chilean business the nontropical fruit business that’s over now you move on to a new season and you kind of how does that happen that you want that with higher costs when prices market were prices were falling and what if anything does that tell us about that nontropical business for the rest of the year i dont think it helps us much but if you could kind of walk us through what kind of happen in nontropical be helpful mohammad abughazaleh good morning jonathan jonathan feeney good morning mohammad abughazaleh the chilean business this year compared to   season is completely different   season was good and one and two different ways first the quality of the fruit was excellent that is the   secondly the industry of california was on the low side so it  and the fruit volume in chile was shorter in general so it was like a perfect scenario excellent quality short volume and lower inventory in california in   was the opposite completely bad quality because of rain and very bad weather conditions during the growing season in chile the inventory in california was record high and the quality was  i mean the volume was much higher than the previous year so it was bad all sides the quality was bad the volume was over the market needs and a lot of inventory in california and that in my opinion is the case i dont believe never we can never tell but next season which starts in december this year could be completely different scenario however in our case we try to mitigate this by quality problem should go back to the grower pockets and not our pocket so this is a business that every few years you will get a hiccup and we need to adjust as well because the red grapes usually now are not becoming a very favorable start i mean to start the season you have to start with more white grapes rather than red grapes because of the californian inventories so it’s like a scenario where we have to live with every few years jonathan feeney understood but doesn’t necessarily repeat in next year being the wholly set of variables mohammad abughazaleh i doubt that it will be the same that we saw this year i doubt very much that we will see the same thing that happened this year jonathan feeney can you  mohammad can you give us a sense how do we think about what the margin profile is up this fast growing freshcut business can you tell us whether that gross margin is higher or lower than the other fresh produce average mohammad abughazaleh it is one way higher than the other produce for sure margins but it’s a consistent business jonathan that’s the difference this is a growing consistent business and the more recognize the better margins we will get and that’s the kind of target and course of action that we are taking right now is because of the increase of oils and increase of demand we cannot dependent  on labels because it’s a very intensive and  in terms of labor needs so we are mechanizing we are automating you know the process and that should help us and reducing course and improving margins jonathan feeney last question you weighted capital expenditure remains elevated what are the primary areas where above the maintenance of your infrastructure that youre investing in right now mohammad abughazaleh mainly actually infrastructure and production as i mentioned earlier that we are already in the built out our new houston facility which should be operational end of august this year and that about  million and capital expenditure that another one that we are just closing on the delaware facility we are investing in a production in costa rica production in philippines you know that we have already concluded our agreement with panamanian government regarding our new plantations there so that before the end of the year we should start spending as well there on production at the very berry labs for plantation in  jonathan feeney and just had a followup the richard and mohammad you’ve talked in the past about i think with a five year target in payback would you say that’s still is the sum to think about it at your capital expenditures over and above the maintenance need something like it’s targeting a five year payback mohammad abughazaleh that’s a policy that something that is you know it’s like  we don’t change that every investment that to has to be in compliance with that strategy jonathan feeney thank you very much mohammad abughazaleh thank you jonathan operator operator instructions our next question comes from mitch pinheiro from wunderlich securities your line is now open mitch pinheiro yes hi good morning mohammad abughazaleh good morning mitch mitch pinheiro so mohammad question for you regarding sort of your statement about optimism so i certainly understand optimism your fresh produce segment particularly your fresh cut business was had a terrific quarter but how would you describe your optimism on the banana business are you equally as optimistic on the banana business i mean margins were down how do you view that in this near term and then obviously with an eye towards the longer term mohammad abughazaleh let me just state one thing the banana business is banana business it will  we’re exposed to several factors weather supply demand and market last year for instance this time the asian market was like sizzling we couldn’t cope even with supplying the markets unfortunately we noticed from beginning of this year that the market demand has declined and we didn’t know what was the reason i mean the supply wasn’t that oversupply in asia during the first three months of this year and we realize that the market is not bad now according to our survey and our research and questioning customers what was going on according to them quote unquote is that because of our shortage last year the prices went up and they had to fill their selves with other types of fruits now according to them that they continue using these same prices that they use that last year to have more margin and rather than not to have more volumes on the shelves that according to them but that’s actually what is happening in korea and japan as we speak as far as north america is concerned north america hasn’t changed it’s the same the same competitive environment that we had all over the years europe hasn’t been bad i think what happened during the first couple of months of this year is that we have a lot of carryover from  at the end of  we had a lot of fruits lot of supplies that’s spilled over in the first two months of  and has actually impacted pricing in terms of excess volume that had to be sent to other markets where it was sold below cost saying that i would like just to highlight one thing which is very important to look at few years ago our total banana i mean the pie was like  or over  of our total pie today we are about   and our target is not to exceed  hopefully within the next year or two so that tells you we are shifting our business not reducing our volumes in bananas or reducing our market share in bananas but we are shifting our business from being depend on bananas as a major source of income to other diversified products and that’s why i say i’m optimistic i know where we’re going i know what we’re doing and i’m not so much concerned really about because  about the bananas in particular because i know the bananas are cyclical they can go from  a box  per box or less and  but what we are doing is we are building all the other businesses that will take care of this kind of cyclicality mitch pinheiro okay i mean and then i mean how that in the very near term so for the last year banana margins were significantly higher than it’s historical averages how do you view  relative to historical averages do you think i mean i know you have a month in to the second quarter here but do you see it’s still been  banana margins kind of revert back the old days or is there a new paradigm perhaps mohammad abughazaleh no we’ve seen improvement in the last six weeks which i hope will continue going forward in the year but we have seen improvements mitch pinheiro okay when you look at avocado you know prices that i see in the marketplace when i kind of do my own price surveys is that  it’s up maybe  to  your pricing was up in the last in the quarter up about  or  i forgot the number of percent how are you outperforming on price while gaining share how is that  how’s that happened mohammad abughazaleh that’s our secret how can i tell you mitch pinheiro i mean… mohammad abughazaleh but let’s say we are now number three i mean leading retail largest exporter out of mexico or retail largest let’s say distributor in the us and that in a short time and hopefully that will be ahead of that in the future mitch pinheiro so i mean are you  i mean was pricing that good or was it just your channels the way your mix i mean how  it was a very good mohammad abughazaleh we managed the business intelligently let’s put it that way our infrastructure and our  that’s our leverage i believe our distribution and our reach to our customers our quality consistent quality i think  and our ability to deliver to customers timely without any and we a lot of customers that work with competition and they come to us because they have short of one or two loads or three loads and they request and once they do that they realize how consistent and how reliable we are and then they shift to us and that’s what is going on mitch pinheiro what kind of  what percentage of your avocado business goes to food service to customers mohammad abughazaleh that much mitch pinheiro that much okay mohammad abughazaleh we have but the majority is going to retailers mitch pinheiro got it and then two more question on pineapples i mean obviously high margin business for you and it was a  it was just  it was an awful quarter in pineapples i guess weather in central america hurt your volume how do you see that playing out here over the next quarter in year here mohammad abughazaleh will be back normal be back to normal mitch pinheiro okay does that also  how does  does that  how does that with your  with the pineapple juices and things you had in you called that out actually in the quarter how does that  with that in any way does it do costs come down for that businesses or some other what are the metrics around that mohammad abughazaleh no you’re talking about the concentrate maybe mitch pinheiro the concentrate i don’t know if you have any if that so put you supply concentrate to that business mohammad abughazaleh we do concentrate that’s part of our prepared business you know that richard mentioned a while ago about the prepared business mitch pinheiro right mohammad abughazaleh concentrate under that mitch pinheiro so i so i guess two things one so pineapples you think the business in general the fresh will be back to normal does  did you see any benefit from lower pricing in the concentrate business or that really not a factor at all mohammad abughazaleh the pricing on the concentrate has gone dramatically down compared to the last previous two years and the reason for that is because thailand is back into production and they have so much over supply and they reduced their prices tremendously but definitely when we produce gold pipe apple you know it’s a different type of juice which come higher premium and priority over the traditional kind of pine apple juices mitch pinheiro okay alright well that’s all i had for you thank you very much mohammad abughazaleh thank you operator i am showing no further questions i would now like to turn the call back to mohammad abughazaleh for any further remarks mohammad abughazaleh i’d like to thank everybody for having the time to attend our call today and i hope to speak to you in the next quarter with the good news as well thank you operator ladies and
