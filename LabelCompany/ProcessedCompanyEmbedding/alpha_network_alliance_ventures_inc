generally a function of the website’s brand strength and the success of its marketing strategies its user capacity and reliability and its ability to accommodate and integrate evolving technology and features such as smartphone or twitter compatibility for example additionally with regard to the online retail component of our business competition is generally a function of the assortment and continuity of merchandise selection offered reliable order fulfillment and delivery and the level of brand support for products offered we will be required to compete with a large number of niche social networking and merchandising websites many of which have significantly greater resources than we do many of our competitors also have the ability to develop and market products and services similar to and competitive with our products and services specifically we compete with the major niche social networking websites such as facebook and twitter we also compete with several smaller niche social websites brands such as sosyalancom risingstarsph and greatpinoycom we believe that we are currently one of the smallest in the industry as we currently have only a nominal web presence and no revenues from our business operations management believes we can offset any such competitive disadvantages by being a price leader in the marketplace first by offering free access to our website and thereafter by offering more competitively priced premium package services initially general subscriptions to our site will be free and premium package subscriptions will be only approximately  per month we will also seek to differentiate ourselves by providing our subscribers with more attractive social network features such as tools for subscribers to easily communicate with
