regrainers partners press videos stores beer brewing eating blog sign in impact regrained harvests grain from urban craft breweries and upcycles it to create delicious nutritious and sustainable food we love beer but brewing it requires a lot of grain roughly one pound of grain is used per six pack of beer before it eventually becomes the backbone of beer barley is first grown then it is malted after the brewing process the industry has classically considered the remaining grain “spent” that’s because the malt’s sugars have been extracted so its ability to make more beer is literally spent however we think you’ll agree that there is still a richness of value in these “spent” grains that is worth saving to be sure brewing beer is an ageold practice and the “spent” malt is not a newly discovered byproduct for millennia breweries and farmers have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship the farmers come pick up the grain and use it to enrich their soil and feed their animals however the boom in craft beer has complicated this historical paradigm in 5 two new breweries opened per day to our delight we’re seeing these innovative flavorforward ventures pop up everywhere this growth is especially concentrated in cities where dense populations of beer drinkers offer an attractive market for craft beer entrepreneurs the classic farmerbrewer partnership is simply less practical in an urban beer production environment the fuel tolls and time costs required for a farmer to complete a supply run into city though mean that urban breweries see less demand for their grain so many urban brewers have no better option than to have their grain hauled to compost where it is available and landfill where it is not in this inefficiency we see opportunity at regrained we propose that “spent” beer grain instead be harvested and used to close a nutrient loop in other words we propose that the leftover grain be recovered from the waste stream and regrained why because regrained grain makes for a phenomenal food ingredient it is high in protein by weight close to as much as almonds and fiber more than x that of oatmeal low in sugar the sugar ends up in the beer and as most curious homebrewers inevitably discover it has a great flavor yum from our first product line of bars to those that will come in the form of breads cookies cereals chips and more—we will develop delicious products built around regrained grain our vision is to enable urban ecosystems to do more with less through creativity and innovation with every decision we seek to positively impact the community and planet in which we live and run our business  as consumers we get to decide what matters most through what we choose to buy regrained’s mantra is simple “brew good bake good do good” we invite you to
