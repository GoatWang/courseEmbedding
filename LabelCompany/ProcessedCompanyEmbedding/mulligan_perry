subscribe now  digital edition  buyers guide  slideshow stressopedic chooses freudenbergs fr fabric david perry may   bedding producer stressopedic said it is using freudenbergs celestia flameretardant material in its bedding lines freudenberg said the producer began using its fr fabric at the beginning of this year when californias new open flame resistance law took effect this marks the first publicly identified bedding customer for freudenbergs fr products only a handful of bedding producers have revealed which fr suppliers they are working with stressopedic is using celestia on its stressopedic and select rest mattress designs mike mulligan president and ceo of stressopedic said he chose celestia based on its demonstrated ability to meet californias requirements while allowing the companys mattress designs to retain all of their visual and physical properties before making our decision he said we tested numerous fr products to ensure that the presence of an added material would not have an adverse effect on the aesthetics or performance of the mattress itself we found that the physical presence of the celestia fr material was virtually imperceptible while offering superior protection for our customers mulligan said that other fr products tested tended to nullify the surface comfort and he said that celestia contains no chemicals that could be harmful these factors combined with the longstanding reputations of both freudenberg and their strategic partner hickory springs converting of north carolina finalized our decision he said stressopedic includes openflame fr protection on all beds not just those sold in california we believe the public deserves all the safety we can give them when they buy our product mulligan said david perry
