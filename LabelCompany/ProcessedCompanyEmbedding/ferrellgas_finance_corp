quarterly report on form q are for informational purposes only and are not intended to be hyperlinks accordingly no information found andor provided at such internet addresses is intended or deemed to be incorporated by reference herein the following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form q the discussions set forth in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections generally refer to ferrellgas partners and its consolidated subsidiaries however in these discussions there exist two material differences between ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership those material differences are because ferrellgas partners has outstanding  million in aggregate principal amount of  senior notes due fiscal  the two partnerships incur different amounts of interest expense on their outstanding indebtedness see the statements of earnings in their respective condensed consolidated financial statements and ferrellgas partners issued common units during fiscal  and repurchased common units in fiscal  table of contents overview propane and related equipment sales we are a leading distributor of propane and related equipment and supplies to customers in the united states as measured by the volume of our retail sales in fiscal  and a leading national provider of propane by portable tank exchange we serve residential industrialcommercial portable tank exchange agricultural wholesale and other customers in all  states the district of columbia and puerto rico our operations primarily include the distribution and sale of propane and related equipment and supplies with concentrations in the midwest southeast southwest and northwest regions of the united states we use information on temperatures to understand how our results of operations are affected by temperatures that are warmer or colder than normal we use the definition of normal temperatures based on information published by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration based on this information we calculate a ratio of actual heating degree days to normal heating degree days heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage weather conditions have a significant impact on demand for propane for heating purposes primarily during the months of november through march the winter heating season accordingly the volume of propane used by our customers for this purpose is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in the regions we serve and can vary substantially from year to year in any given region sustained warmerthannormal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane usage while sustained colderthannormal temperatures will tend to result in greater usage although there is a strong correlation between weather and customer usage general economic conditions in the united states and the wholesale price of propane can have a significant impact on this correlation additionally there is a natural time lag between the onset of cold weather and increased sales to customers if the united states were to experience a cooling trend we could expect nationwide demand for propane to increase which could lead to greater sales income and liquidity availability conversely if the united states were to experience a warming trend we could expect nationwide demand for propane to decrease which could lead to a reduction in our sales income and liquidity availability we employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase storage transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies on a shortterm basis we attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts we enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time these commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment our open financial derivative propane purchase commitments are designated as hedges primarily for fiscal  and  sales commitments and as of october   have experienced net mark to market losses of approximately  million because these financial derivative purchase commitments qualify for hedge accounting treatment the resulting asset liability and related mark to market gains or losses are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as prepaid expenses and other current assets other assets net other current liabilities other liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income loss respectively until settled upon settlement realized gains or losses on these contracts will be reclassified to cost of salespropane and other gas liquid sales in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings as the underlying inventory is sold these financial derivative propane purchase commitment net losses are expected to be offset by increased margins on propane sales commitments that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception at october   we estimate  of currently open financial derivative propane purchase commitments the related propane sales commitments and the resulting gross margin will be realized into earnings during the next twelve months our crude oil logistics segment generates income by providing crude oil transportation and logistics services on behalf of producers and endusers of crude oil bridger services include transportation through its operation of a fleet of  trucks  tank trailers and  railcars primarily servicing texas louisiana north dakota pennsylvania colorado and wyoming pipeline services in north dakota montana wyoming new mexico mississippi oklahoma and texas and crude oil purchase and sale in connection with pipeline management services we also operate  pipeline injection terminals approximately  mbblsd of capacity on multiple crude oil pipelines and barge capacity to transport a minimum of  mbblsd table of contents water solutions during the quarter ended october   goodwill related to the midstream operations  water solutions segment was determined to be fully impaired see note f  goodwill and intangible assets net overview of net loss attributable to ferrellgas partners lp net loss attributable to ferrellgas partners lp in the three months ended october   was  million compared to  million in the prior year period this increased loss was primarily due to the following a  million goodwill impairment charge a  million increase in loss on disposal of assets and other a  million increase in depreciation and amortization expense a  million increase in interest expense a  million increase in operating expense and a  million decrease in gross margin in the propane and related equipment sales segment partially offset by a  million increase in gross margin in our newly created midstream operations  crude oil logistics segment during the three months ended october   we determined that the continued and prolonged decline in the price of crude oil constituted a triggering event for its midstream operations  water solutions business that required an update to the goodwill impairment assessment as of october   upon completing the second step of an impairment test as of october   for the midstream operations  water solutions reporting unit we determined that goodwill was fully impaired and have written off the entire

expanding rapidly in the late s and early s another such propane retailer was buckeye gas products company buckeye traced its roots to  when standard oil company formed the buckeye pipeline co to move petroleum products to refineries in northwestern ohio by the s the company was supplying refineries from chicago to buffalo and following world war ii it expanded its pipeline network into new york new jersey and pennsylvania in  the pennsylvania railroad acquired buckeye since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s rightofway across the midatlantic states the pennsylvania railroad merged with the new york central railroad in  when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive three years later in  the merged penn central railroad filed for the thenlargest corporate bankruptcy in american history buckeye meanwhile remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries in the s the company made a sizable investment in

goldman sachs  co to act as lead underwriter the planned offering did not go well and goldman advised management that the placement would go better if buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane

the company closed  acquisitions ranging from the  million gallons sold by united cities propane gas in georgia to the  gallons retailed by fessler mill  hardware in wisconsin the company continued its penetration into the northeast with major acquisitions in new jersey and rhode island the need to access capital for acquisitions and internal growth gave james ferrell the idea to form a master

formededit in  investment bank goldman sachs brought james ferrell an idea that would help him transition into retirement the idea was for ferrell to sell his interest in ferrellgas to the companys

business serving as office manager and bookkeeper the business began a slow steady decline when mabel died in  the business continued on with ac electing to diversify by selling furniture and televisions a massive flood in atchison in  destroyed much of the companys merchandise prompting ac to move the business from commercial street to rented space across the river in missouri ac and mabels oldest son and middle child current company chairman james ferrell enrolled in the university of kansas in  that same year he married a yearold freshman from nearby benedictine college named elizabeth zibbie james ferrell graduated from college in  with a business degree as an undergraduate he participated in rotc enjoying the discipline and the regimen while learning the principles of leadership that would aid him throughout his career as an entrepreneur and international businessman after graduation he went to fort benning georgia to attend infantry school after being stationed

a nationwide companyedit ferrellgas wasnt the only propane company in the nations heartland that was expanding rapidly in the late s and early s another such propane retailer was buckeye gas products company buckeye traced its roots to  when standard oil company formed the buckeye pipeline co to move petroleum products to refineries in northwestern ohio by the s the company was supplying refineries from chicago to buffalo and following world war ii it expanded its pipeline network into new york new jersey and pennsylvania in  the pennsylvania railroad acquired buckeye since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s rightofway across the midatlantic states the pennsylvania railroad merged with the new york central railroad in  when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive three years later in  the merged penn central railroad filed for the thenlargest corporate bankruptcy in american history buckeye meanwhile remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries in the s the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure and in  buckeye expanded into new england with the acquisition of the pipeline company jet lines inc in  penn central created a master limited partnership to spin off buckeye and hired goldman sachs  co to act as lead underwriter the planned offering did not go well and goldman advised management that the placement would go better if buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane components and sold separately a wall street banker james ferrell met in the early s who would later become a member of the ferrellgas board of directors andy levison contacted james ferrell in  to let him know that buckeye’s propane subsidiary was for sale at an estimated  million and asked if he wanted to bid on it the purchase would elevate ferrellgas from a regional company to the countrys third largest retail propane marketer the initial public offeringedit with the acquisition of buckeye safely under its belt ferrellgas spent the late s and early s consolidating its operations and expanding into new geographical territory the november   acquisition of dupane gas service operations in rhode island was especially exciting dupane gas served  rhode island customers with  million gallons of propane a year it gave ferrellgas its first entry into the competitive and potentially lucrative northeast market ferrellgas continued its acquisition efforts in  and  in the latter year the company closed  acquisitions ranging from the  million gallons sold by united cities propane gas in georgia to the  gallons retailed by fessler mill  hardware in wisconsin the company continued its penetration into the northeast with major acquisitions in new jersey and rhode island the need to access capital for acquisitions and internal growth gave james ferrell the idea to form a master limited partnership mlp in june  ferrellgas issued partnership units of ferrellgas partners lp on the new york stock exchange nyse under the ticker symbol fgp employee stock ownership plan esop formededit in  investment bank goldman sachs brought james ferrell an idea that would help him transition into retirement the idea was for ferrell to sell his interest in ferrellgas to the companys employees in a leveraged employee stock ownership plan or esop the plans which were supported by the clinton administration helped provide tax incentives for the transfer of ownership to a broad base of employees on july   thousands of ferrellgas employees gathered in  meetings across the united
