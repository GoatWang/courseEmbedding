turn conference over to mr jeffrey bacha chairman and ceo please go ahead sir jeffrey bacha thank you very much and thank you everyone for taking the time this afternoon to hear the update this is a time that’s very exciting for our company we’ve find ourselves in a position relative to strength with having recently completed a  million financing to support advancement of val into a pivotal phase  clinical trial weve also begin to see expanded – fruit being born from our research efforts into other tumor types where were really able to leverage val all of the historical information behind it with a modern understanding of the science that we believe will address significant unmet medical need in a number of different tumor types weve also then continued to expand our research collaborations as you know we recently announced collaboration with duke university in their brain tumor drug discovery group that will last far beyond the commercialization of val and position us to identify subtypes of glioblastoma tumors as well as opportunities for combination therapy as we go forward val as you know is really a pipeline of single product opportunity some of the highlights around this as that crosses the blood brain barrier it was readily – it was approved internationally and has been extensively studied at nci et cetera in europe as well the safety database has more than  patients that we can leverage from that historical work and what our research has really highlighted is the novel mechanism of action that we now understand is different than other standard chemotherapies that are used broadly in the treatment of cancer this enables us to differentiate solve problems and also identify biomarkers for patient selection to really personalize this as a therapy going forward and this is the basis of our segment and is the basis of our developing pipeline around this val as our initial product opportunity not only in gbm but in other solid tumor types not only as a single agent but very importantly in combination therapy as we go forward id like to highlight our efforts in glioblastoma as this is our lead program with val as many of you know gbm is one of the tumor types that has been largely left behind in the advancements that have been made in the treatment of cancer we see relatively few new treatments entering the market and relatively no impact on improved survival over the last  to  years and we believe that val has the opportunity to change that the treatment paradigm for gbm many of you are familiar with diagnosis surgery with a median overall survival of approximately  months for the general population with temodar plus radiation as the primary therapy most patients will fail that and have a very poor prognosis but even the patients who respond will tend to recur in a resistance setting and again with a very poor prognosis we believe that val will address these issues just a little bit about the resistance mechanisms of temozolomide the primary treatment for newly diagnosed gbm temozolomide it suffers from resistance due to a repair enzyme called mgmt that leads to treatment of resistance and cancer growth on the other side of the equation even the patients that have a low expression of that enzyme have the tendency to develop resistance to temozolomide through the mismatch repair pathway we have now demonstrated that val is active and can overcome both of these primary resistance mechanisms the temozolomide which is the reason that we believe it is potentially a superior alternative in terms of newly diagnosed patients as well as recurrent patients with glioblastoma the data regarding mgmt is wellknown weve presented this a number of times in a number of ways this is again a reminder of the simple invitro study were demonstrating independence to the mgmt repair mechanism and that val is actually more active than temozolomide even where temozolomide is active the new information that we presented at the world federation for neurooncology last month is really demonstrating activity independent of that secondary repair mechanism mismatch repair you can see here from this experiment the val is equiactive in both mmrproficient and mmrdeficient cancer cell lines in vitro and in this unique anticancer mechanism of val and the independence from both mgmt and mmr that positions val as potentially a superior chemotherapy for use in the treatment of gbm we can also point at the activity that were aware of with val in gbm and it’s certainly the benefit versus radiation alone and the overall survival compared to currently standard of care temozolomide and the other agents which temozolomide replaced stand out to us these are the data that got us excited originally now combined with our modern efforts to understand mechanism is what positions us to believe that we are in the cusp of a new paradigm in the treatment of glioblastoma that will allow us to identify patients through using mgmt as a biomarker address the known resistance mechanisms with a superior treatment unlock the potential of the drug to create a new paradigm have an impact on survival for the first time in decades and obviously we hope unlock tremendous shareholder value we are putting stakes in the ground across all lines of therapy in gbm as you know were advancing into a pivotal phase  trial in post avastin gbm we have launched a second line study in the first recurrence in collaboration with md anderson and we are preparing to launch a study in newly diagnosed patients so truly across the continuum we will be offering a new solution to patients with this terrible disease our work todate has been in the post avastin setting and our initial gotomarket strategy will be in patients that have failed with temozolomide and avastin you can see here this is the data that we had presented at asco last year and you can see a suggestion of a superior survival outcome in this very core population and this in comparison to other chemotherapies in the published literature suggests that we certainly have the potential for a superior survival outcome as you know we took these data to the fda about a year ago and talked to them about designing a phase  trial that will enable us to move this forward into this population in a pivotal setting that would move toward a approval relatively rapidly in parallel with our efforts to move the drug val toward newly diagnosed patients where we believe we can have the greatest benefit based on the outcome of that meeting we designed a pivotal phase  clinical trial which has now been submitted to the fda the acronym study in temozolomideavastin resistant glioblastoma star phase  study is the study we plan to move forward with there will be  patients randomized in a two to one fashion treatment of val versus standard established chemotherapy with the primary overall survival endpoints the statistical design is to be done at  power and designed to show the three month benefit roughly between val and the control arm we expect this trial to take roughly two years to complete and will be run at  centers in the united states the next slide outlined some of how we arrived in our assumptions in the trial design as you know in the val side we saw a median survival of  months following avastin failure in our phase  study for those patients who were receiving therapeutic dose if we assume a four week washout that would be roughly  months in terms of the overall survival expectation and to be conservative we backed that down to  on the control arm an assumption of two to five months from the literature again assuming a four week washout from avastin failure would be one to four months and to be conservative selecting  months as the control assumption that gives us a hazard ratio of  powering that at  with a two to one randomization requires  events with a  patients to be enrolled to achieve those events in under two years in parallel with these efforts for enrollment we will be validating the control arm assumption by looking at patients who had failed avastin and gone on to one of the control medicines in the months preceding the opening of our trial this we believe will help to mitigate the risk of misassumption on the control arm which as you know is a major reason for many trials failure and we anticipate being able to present these data from that retrospective analysis later this year showing that we have again validated our control assumption in the event that we find the assumption on the control arm was off we will be able to adjust the trial design without statistical penalty in realtime we are making steps rapidly to initiate the phase  clinical trial this is an update from the slide that we presented last quarter over the course of the fall we had developed a protocol and presented a summary design for feedback to our key opinion leaders during january to april of this year we have finalized the protocol selected our cro which will be pra health sciences and finalized the protocol for advancement during the next coming months we are in the process of negotiating with the initial clinical trial sites submitting to institutional review board’s for approval of the protocol to launch the study we will have an opportunity for the fda to give feedback but of course this is not required and we anticipate being open for enrollment as we get into the earlier parts of this summer in parallel with the phase  study we have an ongoing phase  study at md anderson in first recurrence of disease the primary endpoint in this study is overall survival the comparator arm is the lomustine arm of the recently published eortc  trial with an overall survival comparator of  months we also anticipate launching a study in newly diagnosed patients the initial site in guangzhou china is ready to begin enrolling patients we are waiting for final approval from the office of human genome administration in china that will allow us to begin this trial the primary endpoint will be progressionfree survival you can see the comparator here the rtog  with a progression free survival of  months as a secondary endpoint we will be looking at overall survival again comparing to the rtog  study with an overall survival in the unmethylated patients of  months this is the study that will drive the future paradigm shift to treatment of val in gbm using mgmt as a biomarker for patient selection to get val to the patients that we know are not going to respond to temozolomide and we believe this will have a significant impact on the overall outcome of patients with this disease timing of key events in the val gbm trials you will see are going to be regular beginning with the initiation of our phase  study interim analysis in  primary endpoint we expect in  and nda submission in  in parallel of the two phase  trials which are open label we anticipate having interim update at scientific meetings going through  and  we anticipate achieving the primary endpoint in the md anderson firstrecurrence gbm trial in  and in the newly diagnosed gbm trial we anticipate having the primary safety endpoint in  as well as potentially the pfs primary endpoint in  had overall survival depending on the survival of the patients in that trial will come thereafter i’d like to now turn it over to scott praill to walk through the corporate overview and financial results scott praill thank you jeff and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon our clinical operations are located in menlo park california and our head office is in vancouver bc our team is comprised of  employees reflecting the financing vehicle let me just complete it we have a  million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis we have  million shares outstanding as a result of financing in april we have working capital to fund ourselves through to the end of the next calender year accounting year  and that’s partly depended on enrollment rates in our pending phase  study slipping to operating results on side  i would draw your attention to our q which we filed on friday the week before last i have all that detail in there this is a snapshot of the three months ended march   compared to march   for the current quarter we have a loss of approximately  million compared to a loss of  million on a cash basis the quarterly revenues were approximately  million and for the first nine months of this year that has been pretty consistent if you look at the cash flow in our q it’s approximately  on cash basis for the first nine months the reason for the increase is primarily as jeff discussed on previous slides a significant clinical activity in particularly the study design for our phase iii – pending phase iii study as well as of course the protocol development for that study as well as cmc and manufacturing costs the commencement of our phase  md anderson study and the general regulatory and support class that goes on for those activities selected balance sheet data on slide  this reflects the march quarter that we just filed just before the april financing and we have pro forma basis  million in cash which equates to  million in working capital total assets of  million and stock holders equity of approximately  million the next slide is very important one to point out that we have available to us a nondiluted financing over  million from the exercise of warrants in particular drawing your attention to the fact that a significant portion of the  million comes from share – warrant exercise prices between  and  and i think anyone who has additional questions or more detail i’m happy to answer during the qa session at the end and as i mentioned of course a lot of detail is in our q filed week before last jeff jeffrey bacha thank you scott just to wrap up the summary growing our intellectual property portfolio we now have  patent families with multiple patents filed comprising over  filings and provisional applications on a global basis currently there are seven us and eight international patents that have been issued which gives us patent protection to  in the united states and globally it’s similar val has also been granted orphan designations in united states for gliomas ovarian cancer and medulloblastoma and in europe for gliomas which provides us with additional market exclusivity on top of the patent protection that we have already indiscernible of course the key milestones for us is here the initiation of phase  over the course of the summer and bevacizumab failed glioblastoma continued progress and initiation of additional studies in our phase  trials in glioma continued progress in the interim updates with other indications outside of glioblastoma and peerreviewed meetings as well as in glioblastoma and then of course weve talked a lot about moving forward into other tumor types such as ovarian cancer and lung cancer and you can expect to see continued progress to those extents as well so the last slide just as a reminder of val is a firstinclass small molecule with broad anticancer activity that was then demonstrated in prior clinical trials in the nci we’ve had promising interim results in our phase  study and now are moving rapidly into a pivotal phase  trial that will propel us into a commercial setting in refractory glioblastoma we believe that we have an opportunity to displace the current incumbent therapy with a superior alternative for the majority of patients who were diagnosed for gbm and also have opportunities to leverage our research into others tumor types as i said at the onset of the call this is a very exciting time for delmar pharmaceuticals with a strong balance sheet moving into a phase  pivotal trial as well as expanding opportunities into new tumors types as we go forward to the balance of the year so thank you very much and id be happy to entertain any questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we would take our first question from jason mccarthy maxim group please go ahead jason mccarthy hi jeff thanks for taking the questions could you just give us a little bit more color on the retroactive analysis that youre going to do for the control group avastin failures im assuming that temozolomide failures as well what do you expect to see in that analysis and how long after you get that data do you have to make any adjustments to the start of retrial jeffrey bacha right i think that’s a great question thanks jason so the color of the analysis will be essentially to create a set of near masked patients so these would be patients that would generally have met the inclusion criteria for our phase  trial that have been treated with one of the control medicines prior to the initiation of our trial so these would be patients that had glioblastoma that had recurred following treatment with temozolomide and avastin and then gone on to receive one of either temozolomide lomustine or carboplatin the goal here is to confirm that a month median survival assumption is reasonable as you may have recalled from many publications and even james perry’s key opinion leader presentation in new york a couple of months ago there are many many examples of assumptions on control arms that are made in trials that are built around on historical data and if you look at the publications that we are referencing as we build our control arm assumptions theyre relatively old and so what we want to do is manage that risk and so by looking at several dozens of patients who would have been eligible to be on our control arm are in our study – excuse me and had being treated with one of the control medicines we feel that is the best way to do that in terms of how long we have to adjust the trial well as long as were not looking at our own data that can be essentially done at anytime we want to do it as early as possible so we would hope to have these data available to us this fall as were getting into the first few months of enrollment of the trial it would be a relatively simple adjustment if we need to make it for example if we find out that the – its really  months and not  months then we would adjust the trial size to be slightly larger to maintain the  power with the revised hazard ratio if we find out that were actually good that were assuming  months and its really three then well leave the trial alone and have a very highly powered study as we go forward that certainly would be a good problem to have does that answer your question jason mccarthy thank you and just another one on the clinical side can you give us a sense of the size of the trial in china the sense of the timing of when we can start to see some data and how are you going to be able to leverage that data with us regulators that was one jeffrey bacha okay so the size of the trial in china the initial state is anticipated to enroll about  patients  patients  is the protocol that is because there is an opportunity for a dose confirming step we may be able to be a little more aggressive with the dose for example because were not seeing patients that have been teed up by therapies that are true newly diagnosed patients the first end point of the study is going to be safety of our dosing regimen in combination with regular therapy that will come very quickly if that’s measured in the first cycle of treatment so within the first few weeks each patient coming in will have that safety confirmation we dont anticipate that to be an issue but its a step we have to take the next comparison will be six months survival endpoints as you know from the eortc – excuse me the rtog  study patients that are unmethylated and treated with temozolomide tend to recur very quickly and so well be looking at that very closely based on the literature we expect to beat that number by a bit and its really those two key drivers into partnering opportunities and international development as a newly diagnosed product in glioblastoma that are going to drive us we have set the trial up to be managed under ich guidelines the data will be useful internationally we brought in a division of quintiles to be the moderate for the trial and the initial investigator is the chair of the chinese society for neurooncology so all across the board we had set this up not to be able to leverage it in the united states europe globally because this is where were going to make the most difference for patients in the newly diagnosed setting the opportunity to move quickly in china where weve always pointed to obviously has been drawn out a little bit by the new requirement for the ohgra authorization to look at genetic testing as a foreign trial supporter thats taken the timeline out to a little bit longer than we had anticipated but of course the leverage that were getting from the funding by our manufacturing partner to undertake the study enables us to move forward without an impact on – any significant impact on our own pl so major milestones there safety one will come very quickly and we’ll be able to begin reporting that data within the first few months of the first few patients enrolled then we’ll be looking at meaningful numbers of patients so looking at half the trial enrolled  –  patients to  patients and looking at their sixmonth outcome as a an indicator of our success and a driver into international studies as a potential replacement of our front line for temozolomide jason mccarthy okay just a real quick financial question i missed it you said that the warrants between  and  are  million jeffrey bacha no im going to turn this over to scott real quick the entire amount of warrants including ones that had a strike price of the  that are cash only are  million but scott will help to break that down jason mccarthy got you scott praill hi jason yes so this probably  million is between  and  so it’s the  in change is between  and  jason mccarthy okay okay great thank you jeffrey bacha right welcome operator we’ll take our next question from robert leboyer aegis capital please go ahead robert leboyer good afternoon and thanks for taking my question i was wondering if some of these other tumor types were going to be presenting data in the next several months or if there was any kind of ind on the on the horizon for them dennis brown yes we are actively looking at that timelines for submitting protocols here in the us or internationally in other tumor types as you’re well aware we are very excited about what were doing in glioblastoma but were also beginning to be equally excited about opportunities in other tumor types just like the story in gbm these are all cases where clinical activity was validated by the nci in prior study so we can be confident about the activity against one tumor type or another but its the science that we’ve undertaken in collaboration with the british columbia cancer agency md anderson ucsf now duke that has really given us the opportunity to identify underserved populations where we can address with val so i think over the next short while youll start to see some expanded regulatory filings from us and certainly opportunities for partnering to help support that activity as we go forward robert leboyer can you disclose the types of tumors that you are looking at jeffrey bacha well i think if you look at – into all of the data that we have presented at scientific meetings recently certainly ovarian cancer certainly nonsmall cell lung cancer would be highlighted primarily by those presentations at recent conferences but weve also been fairly vocal in the progress that weve made in looking at some of the rare pediatric tumors as well which of course as you know would be a great benefit to young patients but also have significant impact in terms of accelerated regulatory approval robert leboyer okay great thank you very much operator well take our next question from sherry grisewood dawson james securities please go ahead sherry grisewood thank you for taking my question jason got part of it but let me go to another question that i’d like to get some insight too as you move into registration files of course manufacturing becomes critical and i was wondering if you could do two things for me give me a bit of color on how the formulation of val is changed over time from that of gag ph and what kinds of refinements or changes are likely to be made in the manufacturing process when you get ready to have to submit cmc section of the filing jeffrey bacha right sure that’s a great question it’s a very astute one because cmc is often a part of the filing that kind of tends to get left behind it is something that is were very familiar with and have been very focused on since day one one of the nice things is that the overall formulation development from the work that was done at nci to today not much has changed the formulation that were using its essentially lyophilized drug that are not significantly recipients or other additives that have been introduced into the product since the nci’s time one of the things that weve been blessed with as weve gone from a startup company to now the edge of phase  as a relationship with an experienced manufacturer overseas who has supplied our drug product for our early stage clinical trials this is of course is guangxi wuzhou pharmaceutical and weve been very pleased with the great collaboration that we have had and continue to have with them one of the risks of course associated with clinical development at the late stage is fda inspection of those facilities and while we are very confident in guangxi wuzhou theyve never been inspected by the fda and as we disclosed previously we have now taken steps to move manufacturing both of the api and the drug product to facilities and companies that had vast experience in drug product manufacturing and fda inspection so were very confident that this would be relatively smooth sailing going forward do we plan to make many changes to the drug product or the material as we enter into a pivotal trial theres really not any reason to this has been a product that has been well established over the years that we can leverage all of those activities the one thing that we will plan to do in the future is to consider development of an oral formulation as a second generation product currently the formulation is iv which is appropriate for many indications but in terms of patient compliance and easeofuse in the future and we would look at development of an oral formulation of course we benefit from the fact in the knowledge of drug is orally bioavailable that was established by the nci and its just a matter of investment in terms of bringing that forward as a modern product formulation but were not planning to make any significant changes other than making sure that the manufacturers for the pivotal trial or those types of companies that have been well established well inspected and have a good understanding and experience with the us regulatory process sherry grisewood thank you operator operator instructions we have a question from ram selvaraju rodman  renshaw please go ahead mitchell kapoor hi there this is mitchell on for ram and thanking for taking our questions my question is how do you plan to prioritize the clinical testing for  for cancers beyond gbm and what do you see as the highest possibility and fastest maturing of these opportunities jeffrey bacha that’s a fantastic question i think if you look at one of the earlier slide slide  which is really the development status in val is a pipeline of product opportunity and while we are blessed with a wealth of opportunities that has driven by great science our resources would not allow us to tackle them all at once so how do we prioritize its going to be driven by a number of factors number one how clear is the established clinical activity from the nci is it can we be very confident in that activity thats a key step that gets our attention out of the gate number two is what is the unmet medical need that we believe we can address by differentiating the drug if its something for example like platinumresistant ovarian cancer with a p mutation that’s a pretty straight line for us based on the data that we have established todate and then third factor is going to be what is the space look like and how quickly is it changing the lung cancer space for example as we all know has evolved very rapidly with the addition of immunotherapies pdl pd into that space and its very much influx so understanding where the market is going and where the unmet medical needs are going to resonate as we bring val forward in the lung cancer setting is going to be much more complicated than in ovarian cancer or even in pediatric tumors so its really those three factors established clinical activity the differentiation in the clear pathway into an unmet medical need as well as the competitive landscape and how quickly things are changing in the tumor type that are going to drive our decision these are all big markets its not a question of can we – is there unlocking of tremendous shareholder value of success clearly in any of these cases thats going to be true so its really those three major factors of clinical establishment differentiates based on our audio gap and the competitive positioning in the changing market that are going to drive our decisions mitchell kapoor okay thank you for that detailed answer my next one is when do you plan on applying for breakthrough therapy designation and is there something that has kept you from already doing that jeffrey bacha nothing that’s kept us from doing it other than we want to get our phase  trial up and running as quickly as possible this is certainly an exercise of bandwidth based on our differentiation of val visàvis the mgmt repair mechanism that’s something that we would hope the agency would consider to be a breakthrough its just a process and we will certainly get there mitchell kapoor okay thanks and one last one for me can you give us an update on the accurexa collaboration jeffrey bacha sure we are continuing to work with accurexa and the formulation folks and you should expect to see some initial data coming out of that collaboration little bit later this year mitchell kapoor okay great thanks operator we can take our next question from ed nagel please go ahead unidentified analyst hi jeff jeffrey bacha hi eddie unidentified analyst could you tell us a little on the md anderson trial last you enrolled one patient you had like seven pending where are we at today on that jeffrey bacha the screening process has continued i believe there are currently three patients that have been enrolled and we’ll give a further update at the asco meeting in a couple of weeks the trial is expected to take about a year or two to enroll everything starts at a ramp up phase and so we are now in the acceleration phase there we are certainly also considering the opportunity to openup other sites now that we have a little bit more financial backing behind us and so we’ll take those steps so we believe we’ll be on track to enroll that trial as projected and have the data beginning to readout next year unidentified analyst one last question in china i know its rather confusing our relationship and the drug is already approved there what we are doing now sun yat sen would this make us a class  or a class  drug a foreign one or they consider this drug a chinese drug at the moment jeffrey bacha so what mr nagels referring to is the different classes of approvals in china and class  being very similar to our nda class  is a special designation for a foreign approved products that have been brought into china that reclassified approach requires the drug to be approved outside of china before its introduced to the chinese market so that would not be available to us this is going to be either a category one or potentially a category six but category one is certainly the most appropriate for us we believe as a new indication and a very modernized setting compared to whats been done in the past unidentified analyst thank you operator and it appears we have no further questions at this time so ill turn our program back over to our presenters for any final or closing comments jeffrey bacha thank you very much for your attention and your well thoughtout questions again we are very excited about where we are as a company with some very nearterm milestones that we believe will unlock a lot of value strengthen our balance sheet from our recent financing and moving into a pivotal phase  trial that we believe is going to make a very big difference for patients that currently have no available treatment well look forward to sharing our progress as we achieve these milestones over the next several months we will be at the asco meeting in a couple of weeks in chicago we have a presentation there again on our glioblastoma program i will look forward to speaking with all of you very soon thank you very much and have a good afternoon operator and this does conclude today’s program thank you for your participation you may now

the call will be open for a questionandanswer session it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to mr jeff bacha jeffrey bacha thank you david and good morning everybody thank you for taking the time to listen to our quarterly update were going to jump right into slide number four outlining the recent highlights particularly from the prior quarter where we saw substantial progress in the development of our lead program val in glioblastoma we have initiated studies in mgmtunmethylated gbm phase ii trial with md anderson and that plans to move into a frontline international study shortly both of these studies designed can be found on the clinicaltrialsgov and identifiers are on the slides in addition we made substantial progress toward initiation of a pivotal phase iii trial in avastin or bevacizumab failed glioblastoma we presented the topline trial design at the society for neurooncology meeting in november  we also continued the expansion of val opportunity beyond glioblastoma presenting meaningful data at major scientific meetings including the ovarian cancer research symposium the world congress on lung cancer and the aacr advances in pediatric research conferences we also accessed additional nondiluted findings through support from the government of canada and through warrant exercise which gives us working capital to support our current operations through the end of calendar  we also of course continue to build and expand our intellectual property portfolio which now consists of ph seven united states and eight international patents issued and final claims covering val uses manufacture and compositions to  lets just talk a little bit more specifically about our lead product candidate and plans for the first half of  as well as some of the recent progress scientifically that was made in the second half of  slide five outlines what we all know about val our first product candidate its a firstinclass small molecule therapy that readily crosses the blood drain barrier and it benefits from substantial research for prior national cancer institute sponsored studies where we learn some of the interesting things about its mechanism interesting opportunities for activity in terms of prior published clinical data as well as a robust safety database on which we can build our business model as outlined on page six is to take that prior clinical validation wrap new ip around it and invest and understanding the mechanism and that information combined with the prior clinical validation is what drives us to solve unmet medical needs in the treatment of cancer today slide seven is a cartoon outlining of some of what we learned about val its a very complicated slide but its important to know that we have leveraged our relationships with leading cancer centers to develop this information on the mechanism of action of val leading centers like md anderson ucsf the bc cancer agency and the university of british colombia slide eight drive homes what weve learned we now know that val targets the n guanine leading to dna interstrand crosslinks irreparable double strand dna breaks s phase arrest and activation of the homologous repair pathway the table below illustrates settle differences between the mechanism of val and foundational chemotherapies that are used broadly in the treatment of cancer today for example the platinum based chemotherapies are experienced by nearly  of cancer patients who are diagnosed worldwide and being able to differentiate here certainly would offer to us many large opportunities slide nine outlines how we look at these opportunities when we notice a difference in mechanism that is correlated with resistance to a standard chemotherapy where val has established clinical activity from prior nci data that gives us an opportunity to solving unmet need in a major cancer indication the next few slides we’ll go through are how we’re looking at some of these indications and then we’ll talk about our lead program in val in glioblastoma slide  is exactly what we are looking at in gbm where being be most common aggressive from of brain cancer which affects about  new patients a year in the united states unfortunately in terms of the vast improvements in research and quality of care and outcomes across the board in cancer glioblastoma has been left behind the medium survival for these patients back in the original ovarian cancer and the mix in administration was about  months from diagnoses today it’s still the same the suspect in patient’s failure of treatment is a dna repair enzyme called mgmt what we know about val was that it appeared to be distinct from the currently available chemotherapies and what we’ve now proven is that val’s activity in fact is independent of that mgmt repair enzyme and there is some data on this slide outlining this where patients whose tumors have a low expression of mgmt will respond to current standard of care with temozolomide and they will also respond to val of the majority of patients who have an unmethylated or high express of mgmt will not respond to current therapy but they will still respond to val and that’s what’s drives us forward into this indication where we have an orphan drug designation in united states and europe and again activity validated from prior and nci trials beyond gbm our research has taken us into nonsmall cell lung cancer as outlined on slide  the leading cause of cancer dead worldwide with the five year survival rate of about  current treatment consistent radiation platinumbased chemotherapy tyrosine inhibitors and pdl antibodies in terms of immunotherapy but progression free survival in most patients remains less than six months val’s activity was validated against nonsmall cell lung cancer in prior nci clinical trials and interestingly it’s approved overseas for the treatment of lung cancer the way we’ve been able to differentiate from our research is based on differences from platinumbased chemotherapy the type of crosslinks that is formed with the nposition is distinct between val and those platinumbased agents and the downstream effects of those two lesions are very different this means that we are active where platinum agents are not we are active in the failure of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and we’ve also been able to demonstrate synergy in combination with platinum based therapy as is shown on this slide in ovarian cancer the female cancer in terms of dead worldwide standard of care is platinum based chemotherapy followed by parp inhibitors for brcadeficient tumors  of the patients were relapsed with the p mutation and the median survivals in platinum resistant recurrent ovarian cancer is six to nine months val by differentiating away from these mechanisms has been able to demonstrate activity in platinumresistant ovarian cancers as well as synergy with the new exciting parp inhibitors as is shown on the slide here today slide  in terms of childhood brain tumors in medulloblastoma the most common pediatric brain cancer which is currently treated with surgery radiation and chemotherapy mgmt resistance is a major factor just like it is in adult glioblastoma and recurrence tumors with the p mutation had a particularly poor diagnoses val has been driven as orphan drug designation for medulloblastoma in united states and demonstrated activity against these tumors in prior nci trials what we have shown is that it acted independent of p mutant chemoresistance cell lines and we have synergy with other therapies that are used in the treatment of medulloblastoma such as topoisomerase inhibitors so in all of these cases we have prior clinical validation our recent research has demonstrated differences in mechanism where we can exploit underserved niches within these very important tumors for benefit of the patients that has enable us on slide  to build a very attractive pipeline where our lead programs in glioblastoma and moving into phase iii and phase ii clinical trials with other solid tumors and major cancer indications coming behind and as you can see we have been able to establish collaborations to advance a number of these programs with minimal effect on our cash burn rate there is data from all of those conferences and more data on our website from all of the research activity and i invite you to enjoy looking at that at your leisure moving forward i’d like to spend some time talking about our primary focus which is val and establishing a paradigm shift in the treatment of glioblastoma and as you can see on slide  we believe we could have an extension of life in refractory disease but more importantly we believe we can change the outcome paradigm for two of three newly diagnosed gbm patients and give them a real change to beat the disease and this of course will provide validation in the multibillion dollar front line gbm opportunity slide  just a refresher on gbm the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer treatment consist of chemoradiation and recurrence in mgmt mediated resistance is common in about two out of three patients median survival from recurrence is well under nine months val was demonstrated to be active in gbm historically we have shown that it’s active in mgmt expressing gbm and we have said the established promising phase ii data in a refractory disease setting and we are now advancing to phase iii clinical trials in this program slide nine marries the historical clinical data with our new understanding of mechanism and differentiation where the val actively versus current chemotherapies was established in published gbm trials from the national cancer institutes and delmar has established that val is active against gbm independent of mgmt putting these two things together is what gives us the opportunity for the paradigm shift as you know on slide  we have undertaken that phase iii clinical trial in refractory post avastin gbm gbm is treated with surgery temozolomide and radiotherapy and then avastin two out of three patients will fail somewhat due to mgmt mediated resistance and avastin has no impact on survival what we saw in this very difficult population in our phase iii trial was a promising survival signal others salvage therapies based on published literature have an expected survival in this population of two to five months and our data suggests survival of greater than eight months these promising data as outlined on slide  what we took to fda in end of phase ii meeting where we all agreed that the data was promising and suggested dose response in a potential survival benefit in avastinfailed gbm patients but readily acknowledging that these data from a small cohort open label versus historical control they must be validated in a randomized pivotal trial we also confirmed with fda that the dosing regimen is suitable for advancement to registration directed trials that a single pivotal trial would be sufficient to support a new drug application in avastinfailed gbm and that delmar may leverage historical nonclinical and clinical data that support the nda filing under the b statues so we have gone on to develop as is outlined on slide  a proposed pivotal phase iii trial design in avastinfailed gbm we presented this design at the society for neurooncology meeting in november it will be approximately  patients with histologically confirmed recurrent gbm randomized in a  fashion with val having two out of three patients and salvage chemotherapy getting one we propose to enroll the study at approximately  centers with overall survival at the end point based on our historical experience with our phase ii study we anticipate that this study will take less than two years from initiation the most statistical design is at  power and will include an interim analysis to allow for superiority futility as well as sample size readjustment as we go through the trial slide  i think is what a lot of people are wondering as where are we in the process of taking steps to initiate that phase iii trial of course last summer we completed the phase ii trial we have the end of phase ii meeting presented data at asco and began moving forward toward making some updates to our manufacturing this past fall we developed a protocol statistical design based on fda input and presented that design at the society for neurooncology meeting we also sought feedback key opinion leaders on the design and have incorporated that into protocol revisions as we have gone into the first part of the year we have also set a request for proposals to a short list of selected cros to assist us with implementing the phase iii trials weve also updated our clinical manufacturing plant to our ind with the fda this month we are finalizing the cro bid defense and making final selection of the company we will work with going forward to manage this larger phase iii trial and protocol revisions maybe made based on the input from the final selected cro going forward the key steps are to finalize the cro contract select the sites and get them under contract submit the protocol to the institutional review board at those sites which will position us to be ready for patient enrollment as we move into the spring this is a very rapid process and weve been working very hard to move it forward as quickly as possible its important for everybody to keep in mind that the fda will not approve our protocol or tell us that we can start at any date but they can provide guidance and input at any time throughout the protocol development process and throughout the trial when we feel that the protocol is in its near or final phase it will be posted on clinicaltrialsgov the anticipated study budget for this trial is about  per patient as we have previously disclosed and with  patients its roughly about an  million investment its also important to keep in mind that certain big ticket items such as the cro contracts site contracting and some clinical manufacturing steps will require upfront investment so there will be a point until we raise additional capital that we will be able to take the trial and then well have to work hard to make sure that we can fund it its also important to note that regarding that phase iii funding we are very comfortable with the group of existing shareholders that we will have an elegant solutions to the phase iii funding that we required you’ll recall the type of financing that we put together last year as we uplisted to nasdaq and you can expect us to do something that is accretive and friendly and creates great opportunities for all shareholders as we go forward now that phase iii trial is a very important step for us but as you go to slide  its important to keep in mind the big picture what were after is a paradigm shift in the treatment of all glioblastoma patients particularly those patients who are newly diagnosed who have a high expression of mgmt mgmt is readily measured and roughly two out of three patients have a high expression of that enzyme we want those patients to be on val instead of on temozolomide or other chemotherapies that dont work this will unlock the potential to overcome chemoresistance and create a new survival paradigm for the first time in decades and lay the foundation for a global development program to address more than  billion market as a chemotherapy of choice in unmethylated mgmtgbm to that end we are launching and have launched one of two collaborator supported phase ii studies for mgmtunmethylated gbm we have begun enrolling a study at md anderson which is a single arm trial in  patients who are unmethylated or have a high expression of mgmt who have failed standard of care with temozolomide overall survival is the primary endpoint of this trial compared to historical control the historical control is lomustine arm of the recently published eortc trial in addition we plan to launch shortly an international trial in newly diagnosed glioblastoma for patients who are unmethylated will not receive temozolomide in radiation they will receive val plus radiation progression free survival and safety will serve as the primary endpoints to access val’s treatment activity and this trial is designed to be a lead in to a very partnerable global phase iii trial which will position this drug val as the new paradigm in the treatment of unmethylated mgmtgbm slide  really outlines our overall strategy in gbm in the postavastin setting which is a severe unmet need our phase iii trial suggest that val may have a survival benefit a relatively small single pivotal trial is required to submit it to drug application for approval and this is really our first commercial opportunity but we have to recognize that this is the chance to live longer this is going to be a life extension and weve all seen the opdivo commercials this is great for these patients and were going to work hard to achieve this benefit but importantly in two out of three newly diagnosed patients with an unmethylated mgmt promoter we believe that addressing mgmt resistance with val will give more than  patients a year in united states a real chance to beat gbm the pressure here is actually from a charity bike ride that i participated in last summer and one of the people on the team here called the brainy ph x is the person that was diagnosed with gbm over eight years ago he had a good surgeon he responded to chemotherapy he had low express of mgmt and he has ridden this ride eight years in a row he had beat gbm and what we want to do is give more patients the opportunity to beat the disease that they don’t have right now slide  here is the value catalyst for the first half of  and the entire year the first half of  we will be ready to initiate a phase iii trial in bevacizumabfailed gbm refractory disease and most importantly we will be moving forward into two open label phase ii trials one of which is enrolling now which are collaborator supported to position this drug for that paradigm shift in the treatment of mgmt unmethylatedgbm throughout calendar  you can expect progress reports on our gbm trial and peer review meetings potential initiation of clinical trials and other solid tumor indications where the science is directing us to leverage prior clinical validation from nci trials continued validation of additional pipeline expensing opportunities as well as the collaboration and partnering opportunities slide  before i ask scott to run through the financials is just a review of our intellectual property portfolio what we were filing under  separate patent families we have seven us and eight international patents issued todate and there were more than  patents filings going through the various global systems in an addition of course we have been granted orphan drug protection in the united states for ovarian cancer glioblastoma and medulloblastoma in europe for glioma i’d like to turn it over to scott praill our cfo right now to briefly talk about the financial results for the quarter scott praill thank you jeff and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon slide  and  are overview of our financial results for the quarter as well as our financial position at december   i am sure you all know there is a lot more detail contained in our mda so if you have additional requirement of information you can take a look at there or during our qa session at the end i am happy to answer any more detailed questions at december   the working capital of approximately  million which as jeff has noted will fund our current operations through the rest of this calendar year capitalization at december we have  million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis of  million shares the bottom half of slide  is our selected balance sheet data i think it’s selfexplanatory so i won’t go into that in too much detail with respect to slide  we have our three months results for december ‘ compared to december ‘ and most of the numbers on the bottom part of the table pertain to noncash and derivative liability and things of that nature so draw your attention to the first two lines which are research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses the key thing to know here is our research and development has increased over the prior year while ga has actually gone down compared to the prior year as i noted in the mda some detail we also show a table in there where we carve out the noncash expenses and if you look at the noncash research and development this quarter is  million and the cash general and administration was  million indiscernible our burn was higher this quarter than we’ve had recently but as jeff has noted we had to incur some cost to move the pivotal phase iii trial forward to the point where we can be ready to start subsequent to financing and i think our expectation now on a go forward basis rest of this calendar year is our burn should decrease until such time we complete a financing so if you have any more detail questions please ask them during qa of course you can reach out to me via email or call after this call thank you everyone back to you jeff jeffrey bacha thanks scott just the last final wrap up slide on  just to remind val is the firstinclass small molecule chemotherapy with the unique mechanism of action that we believe overcomes very important mechanisms of chemo resistance in some very foundational and major chemotherapies that are used widely today the nci has tough us that val has clinical activity in a range of different tumor types and this is really what creates our opportunity in combination with our research into the mechanism we have seen promising interim outcomes data in avastinfailed refractory gbm and are advancing that program to phase iii but we believe we have a major opportunity to displace the incumbent gbm chemotherapy of two out of three newly diagnosed gbm patients with a high express of mgmt and phase ii clinical trials are underway we have pipeline expansion opportunities in high value oncology markets with robust ip protection and orphan drug designations in the united states and europe as you can see from the presentation there are multiple nearterm value driving catalyst particularly related to our gbm clinical trials and as weve discussed before our team has done this before same business model smaller opportunity with much success and were looking to capitalize on that experience with a much bigger opportunity with val thank you very much and well look forward to entertaining questions questionandanswer session operator thank you sir operator instructions and well take our first question from jason mccarthy your line is open jason mccarthy thank you for taking the questions could you give us a sense of for the anderson trial how fast do you expect it to enroll the  patients and maybe… jeffrey bacha sorry youre breaking out there a little bit the question was how fast do we expect the md anderson trial to enroll jason mccarthy right and when do you expect to see that we could see data from that study jeffrey bacha right so the enrollment rates md anderson according to their data and looking at that site as potentially one of the phase iii site theyre certainly one of the major centers in the world el young and his team are luminaries in the field and it’s really a go to place for gbm and for gbm trials so we expect to see a lot of potential patients coming through this trial is designed to be in first recurrence so prior to any sort of immunotherapy or other trials so we wont be necessarily competition with those agents its hard to say how quickly we will enroll from the point of opening the study we know that there were patients in line waiting we have treated the first patient already and expect to see others soon we will watch the enrollment carefully and if we are lagging beyond our expectations or behind our expectations well surely look at opportunities to expand to other md anderson sites or to other sites in general md anderson certainly has consortium relationships with a number of major centers that we can move into quickly jason mccarthy right and given that if it is open label single arm is there a possibility that we can get interim look at the data even if its halfway enrolled jeffrey bacha so absolutely so the thing that we need to understand here is that the median survival for newly diagnosed gbm patient treated with val in radiation back in the original nci work was just about  months now these are patients that are recurrence expect to see shorter but these are patients that were hoping to see on study for some time and to achieve a median survival substantial higher than the seven to eight month expectancy in recurrent disease because of being able to address the mgmt issue so in terms of the primary endpoint and overall survival were not expecting or hoping to see rapid events there in terms of being able to report how many patients are out    months from treatment as we go forward we can certainly well be able to do that because it is note with label study we will have visibility on those data additionally in terms of being able to report recruitments rates and that will be readily available so as we go forward into meetings like asco or into like some of the neurooncology meetings later in the summer and the fall we expect those kinds of updates for us but in terms of outcomes data we would expect it to be sometime out before we start seeing a lot of events jason mccarthy great okay thanks for taking the questions jeffrey bacha youre welcome operator well take our next question from ram selvaraju your line is open please go ahead ram selvaraju thank you very much for taking my questions firstly with respect to the proposed phase iii program how soon do you think it might be possible to map out some kind of formal fda feedback in accelerated pathway including potential specialized designation formal recognition that this would be priority review eligible and so and so forth and then secondly with respect to the proposed china trial could you give us a little additional color into what potential positive data from that trial might mean for real world utilization in the context of the gbm indication in the chinese market thank you jeffrey bacha right so in terms of the specialized designations of the fda because of the orphan designation as we move into a phase iii trial you could expect us to formalize sort of fast track designation with fda that sort of normal course of business as you move into a pivotal phase iii trial in terms of other opportunities such as breakthrough therapy status frankly its the ability to address the mgmt issue that is really the major paradigm shifting breakthrough here so as we go forward and have success in those arenas we can hope to achieve things like that as well so those are general normal course thing that we would look to see going forward in terms of the china trial this is the first opportunity for us to move into newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients in the mgmtunmethylated setting and i hesitated to flag it as the china trial and its really an international trial at a great center with a great investigator and because of the history of the drug in china we can move more quickly there in theory than we could have in europe or in the united states the investigator was identified to us by  introduced to us by one of our leading investigators from our phase iii trial the majority of his team is actually trained with indiscernible at md anderson so this has been a long developing relationship what these data will mean are twofold reconfirming that our modernized dosing regimen is safe and effective in combination with radiotherapy in the newly diagnosed gbm patient this was done at nci but were doing it again in the modern context will really be a stepping stone into a global trial and then also being able to differentiate for example the pfs progression free survival at six months from the expectations from temozolomide experience is going to be a big thing for us from this study what does it mean globally and what does it mean specifically in china val is not approved for gbm anywhere in the world so being able to assume that were going to see a lot of uptake off label in china is something that i wouldnt stick my neck out on too far but in terms of being able to position to take substantial market share in a very important disease indication globally thats what these data do for us and its really that that positioning and that paradigm shift and the opportunity to give two out of three patients who have no chance of a good outcome a real opportunity to beat this disease is what were after ram selvaraju okay thats very helpful and then two very quick things firstly maybe you could comment a little bit youve talked about breakthrough therapy designation already but specifically about the contextualization of your phase iii program in light of the recently promulgated st century cures act and whether or not there are specific provisions in that act that you think would potentially make the path easier for  going forward and then secondly if you could give us a little bit more information about what you anticipation for the joint venture that you have in place with accurexa and their efforts in that regard your ability to combine forces with them utilize their technology in the context of the gbm setting and what we might expect to see moving forward clinically this year thank you jeffrey bacha yes so taking those in order the st century cures act i think is an important piece of legislation and it in writing it appears that new therapies that have sort of paradigm shifting opportunities in serious diseases will be given some level of priority how that plays out in terms of this administration and new health’s human resources director and new leadership potentially at fda we really have to wait and see but were hopeful that the spirit of the legislation which is really geared toward addressing significant unmet needs like unmethylated gbm and refractory gbm will be very strongly working in our favor and other thing to point out is that that acts reenergizes something called the pediatric rare disease voucher and for example our focus in potentially in childhood brain tumors may give us an opportunity to seek what are very valuable vouchers in terms of assets that we can trade with pharma for substantial capital so we are certainly paying attention to that as well in terms of the accurexa joint venture we have been working on a formulations in the background with them i think there has been some good progress there the next steps are really to get these formulations in the hands of dr bram at johns hopkins for some nonclinical validation and all studies and if things looks good than later this year we’ll look at potentially taking over the program but it’s certainly something exciting in terms of the combination of  and temozolomide in a direct to tumor setting that again we’ll take advantage of what we know about the mechanism in a  what we believe a side effects bearing strategy is something that’s very  continues to be very exciting to us ram selvaraju i guess since you mentioned the prv could you remind us what the last one or two prvs were sold for jeffrey bacha i believe the united therapeutics one was on the order  million or  million that was it was sold to i think astrazeneca ram selvaraju thank you operator operator instructions and we will take our next question from indiscernible your line is open unidentified analyst gentlemen thank you for taking my call jeffrey bacha hi ves how are you unidentified analyst doing well doing well thank you for asking i only have a short question here could you just off the top of your head tell us how many investor cash warrants remain exercisable through  and how many through  and confirm the average exercise questions about indiscernible jeffrey bacha yes scott just pulling it up on his laptop right now but as you know there are some that are cash only exercise that will be expiring in the beginning of  and additional in  and scott will give those exact numbers for you here in a second unidentified analyst not a problem so thank you very much that’s all i wanted to ask jeffrey bacha he has got it here in one second sorry for the delay unidentified analyst not a problem i apologize usually this is included in the slides and its very helpful to see what’s available to the company from the warrant exercises scott praill yes so as we note in the financials in terms of the absolute number outstanding of  million roughly outstanding at the end of the december on a  some of them cash exercise provisions but  so on a cash basis of approximately  million if they were all exercise for cash unidentified analyst could you repeat that the last because… jeffrey bacha so the dollar value of the cash only exercise that is about roughly  million available to the company unidentified analyst  million okay and do you have any idea what was the  how many expire in  how many in  scott praill well the as you know when we went public in march  that tranches from that coming up for expiring on march  so it’s the combination between march  and march  we don’t have the exact breakdowns unidentified analyst no worries okay very well thank you very much jeffrey bacha we’ll get the information over to you ves unidentified
