listenonly mode later we will conduct a questionandanswer session as a reminder this conference is being recorded wednesday april   i would now like to turn the conference over to susan villare

press release and supplementary data have been posted to our ir website at sonusnet and submitted to the sec a recording of this call and the transcript will be available on our ir website shortly

certain gaap and nongaap financial measures a reconciliation of the nongaap to comparable gaap financial measure is included in our presentation on our website and in our press release issued today with that let me turn it over to the president and chief executive officer of sonus mr ray dolan raymond p dolan  sonus networks inc good morning and welcome to everyone on the call today im pleased to report that q was another solid operating quarter for sonus with results in line or better than the guidance we provided in february the combination of higher revenue and margins in q allowed us to narrow our forecasted operating loss even with a seasonally low revenue quarter we saw another quarter with booktobill ratio above  which led to positive operating cash flow and strong dsos the second quarter outlook we provided today reflects our current confidence that we will continue our momentum and we project the first half that is stronger than originally anticipated when first guided in  this solid start should help position us better for the full year although we remain heavily weighted to the second half performance to achieve our full year revenue and profitability targets our full year targets remain the same with full year revenue projected to be flat to lowsingledigit growth versus  and a nongaap eps of  before i ask susan to report the specifics of our performance id like to offer some comments regarding our strategic progress im very pleased to report that the large second half project to cut over a tier  volte network in north america remains on track this project replaces an incumbent supplier in the very heart of the wireless network and has visibility throughout the organization while this project continues has did also open doors in other business units within this customer we were pleased by the march announcement by verizon that sonus has been selected as the sbc for the virtual function or vnf in their vns platform they also publicly endorsed the work that weve been doing with palo alto networks for more than a year specifically the coordination between the sonus sbc and the palo alto nextgen firewall beyond this recent announcement by verizon we made similar strategic progress with other global service providers which we have not yet shared with you publicly i currently expect that you will hear additional customers endorsing sonus as their sbc vnf as well as our potential collaboration with additional firewall players throughout the remainder of this year this strategy of leveraging our leadership in virtualization to collaborate with the firewall industry has the potential to usher in the era of a completely new network architecture which ive now referenced in earnings calls for more than a year let me explain what this collaboration strategy is and why it is so strategically important as the networking industry uses sdwan to create a more secure apibased endtoend cloud experience the sonus name is synonymous with voice communications our first product offering  years ago was a gateway which enabled voiceoverip more recently we built an industry leading portfolio of sbcs or session border controllers which allow network operators to apply policy and security in an all ip environment so sonus has tremendous expertise in securing and managing voice as an endtoend application running overthetop of an ip network recently the industry has seen a significant spike in the attacks on voip reported by both service providers and enterprises ibm began tracking attacks in sip about two years ago and has noted a sixfold increase in that time things like denialofservice attacks on call centers fraud and more recently efforts to exfiltrate data which is the highest value attack that can steal customer data have become commonplace our customers are asking us to help them with these attacks and with potential future attacks they are the ones that now view our sbcs as voice firewalls and we are responding to their asks this is why we are partnering with established firewall vendors notably palo alto networks with whom weve collaborated and last quarter we announced our mobility use case at mobile world congress the verizon announcement was specifically related to our enterprise use case i offered this point during our february call and it bears repeating today spcs are fundamentally firewalls for voice enforcing security at network edges thats why they are called border controllers unlike a traditional firewall however they are already in the flow with an endtoend perspective and from this vantage point we believe they will play a critical role as networks virtualize decompose and evolve and then they will colocate on the edge and collaborate with nextgen firewalls they will both leverage the strength of each other while firewalls provide valuable detection and enforcement of vpis on critical data flows protecting the data networks they struggle with the realtime elements of uc or unified communications the realtime nature of uc operates in call rate that traditional firewalls simply cant do today together however these two premier sentinels can converge and collaborate to provide an even stronger defense than the two of them acting separately ultimately we believe this will permit a new endtoend approach and when this happens we will realize that what we did was to replicate a software what the old switch architecture did decades ago to run a secure voice network for many years weve been investing significantly in rd generally in the range of  of revenue and more per year we made a commitment to lead our industry on the path to virtualization and we did so the challenge for us was to decompose the sbc and leverage our psx in such a way that we can continue to perform the standard origination and termination functions for voice while creating a management layer in software that could apply to all flows over ip this collaboration with the firewall industry is designed to test that thesis and our early progress is quite encouraging as you will hear from susan now our core business is sound and our gross margin progress continues to drive sustained nongaap profitability and cash flow our balance sheet is strong the investments weve made over many years to lead the path to virtualized networks are now taking hold our customers turn to us increasingly to help them leverage the opportunity now inherent in sdn which is to create a new overall communications stack that is centered on the cloudfirst while creating an endtoend control plane that can deliver secure reliable and efficient communications networks the global digital economy is counting on a secure and affordable internet in the decades ahead were thrilled to play our part at this point ill hand it back to susan to discuss more details around our q performance as well as our q and full year outlook susan m villare  sonus networks inc thank you ray as a reminder gross margin operating expense operating income net income and loss per share are all discussed on a nongaap basis and have been reconciled for you at the end of todays press release and presentation the slides on our ir website have the details regarding our historical financial performance and our reporting framework is consistent with that which we have presented in prior periods we encourage you to get these materials from our website lets now move to slide  and take a closer look at our first quarter  nongaap financial results total revenue was  million as compared to our guidance of  million our nongaap loss per share was  which compares favorably to our guidance of a nongaap loss per share of  our favorable per share results were primarily due to both higher revenue as well as strong gross margin performance our nongaap actual operating expenses of  million were generally in line with our outlook id now like to move to slide  which is our condensed nongaap statement of operations we have added our q  actual results and as such you have nine quarters of actual nongaap historical performance in one table now lets move to slide  which is our condensed balance sheet cash and investments were  million at the end of the quarter days sales outstanding improved to  days in the first quarter of  as compared to  days in the fourth quarter of  our dso goal remains at about  days to  days but may vary based upon our linearity within a given quarter q of  mark the third consecutive quarter where our booktobill ratio was above  q  was the companys highest booking quarter looking back over the past  quarters we had very strong cash collections on these bookings which resulted in  million of cash being generated from a decrease in our accounts receivable in the quarter we remain debt free at the end of the quarter now turning to slide  this contains our statement of cash flows please note that this includes cash marketable securities as well as short and longterm investments in q  cash and investments increased by  million as compared to fiscal year end we generated  million of positive cash flow from operations and we did not repurchase any stock under our stock buyback program this past quarter now lets turn to slide  and ill briefly highlight a few items on our key stats we had one  customer in the first quarter which was verizon revenue from our top five customers represented  of total revenue in our first quarter as compared to  in q of  product revenue from enterprise customers was strong at  this past quarter this compares to  for both q  and q  our flagship sonus sbc  and sonus sbc  both performed very well product revenue from these products was  million in q  as compared to  million in q  and  million in q  now lets turn to side  which summarizes our forwardlooking outlook for  ray provided highlights of our outlook which i will recap and then well open up the call for questions we expect our first quarter revenue to be approximately  million with approximately  million anticipated in our second quarter assuming the  million revenue figure in the second quarter we anticipate a nongaap loss per share of approximately  if you combine our actual financial results for q  with our current outlook for q  you should take away that we have modestly increased our total revenue outlook in the first half by  million our nongaap loss per share outlook for the first half is slightly better than originally projected as well and is above current street consensus estimates we will continue to look to reduce spend on older technologies and vacate any redundant facilities related to prior acquisitions accordingly we anticipate a restructuring charge of approximately  million in q  which we did exclude from our projected nongaap outlook these charges relate to the continuation of the sonus and the taqua restructuring plans which we announced in the second half of  we believe these restructuring programs will be essentially complete by the end of q  turning now to full year  as ray previously mentioned we maintain our revenue and our nongaap fully diluted earnings per share outlook for fy  that we provided on our february call well that concludes our formal remarks operator we are now ready for our first question questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from jess lubert wells fargo securities please go ahead jess lubert  wells fargo securities llc hi guys good morning thanks for taking my questions a couple of questions here maybe just to start it sounds like you made some good progress with the large competitive replacement you highlighted last quarter it sounds like maybe youve upsized that youve made some progress with verizon you alluded there are some other carriers that youre working with so i guess i was just hoping you could provide a little insight into kind of how youre thinking about visibility into the second half of the year if things there havent improved and then ray maybe you could talk a little bit more about how you see the sonus security story playing out from here and to what extent this is a  revenue opportunity or if this is something that plays out over a longer period of time raymond p dolan  sonus networks inc sure jess good morning and thanks for the questions first we have made tremendous strategic progress im very pleased and really proud of the team the work that were doing on the large tier  volte project is massively complex it has actually started with a high level of trust between us and that tier  and that trust has just expanded significantly across the board because were delivering now theres – were not done yet it will score in the second half of this year but were through the fla process in a number of different areas weve made most of the complicated call flows so i couldnt be more proud of the team for doing what were doing and i feel personally comfortable having met with most of the senior executives on it that its reflecting very very well on sonus and its become basically a referenceable success thats really helping us strategically around the world and by the way its completely virtualized so it speaks to our leadership in virtualization everything there is softwarebased when we do get the chance to talk more about it – i think it would be even more impressive overtime and i expect well be able to talk more about it on the next call with regard – it hasnt been upsized at this point in time but it has led to additional opportunities both in that account and in other accounts let me speak to the visibility issue and then well talk to security the visibility into the second half is improving another booktobill quarter over  helps our second quarter is shaping up very nicely and right now is on plan to be booktobill above  and potentially even more so but we still have a steep hill to climb in the second half so were not going to take our pack off the third quarter is shaping up very very nicely and its right now likely to be where that tier  project comes in but when we guide q well let you know because if it moves to q so be it and we still have some work to do in q but that would be traditional for us at this point in time of the year we would never have visibility into q on a bottoms up basis its much more on a fumble basis i hope that answers your question jess this one project is probably the only big deal risk in the second half there are some other relatively large deals none of this size and all of which are established technologies  relationships with nowhere near the risk associated with the project that weve disclosed so i hope thats helpful on the security story i am very very encouraged by the pace of our progress the fact that weve had at least one tier  come out and endorse our approach was quite gratifying for me they literally asked to do that and we of course welcomed that we are making similar progress with other tier s around the world we are making similar progress with other firewall vendors this is an industry push it is now clear that the voice architecture is one of the options people have to implement sdwan you can either use a big data analytics engine to extract data from network nodes create context and push it back down and as you approach realtime over the next few years youll start to approach a network effect of dumb network elements or you can use whats worked for the last  years or more which is a control plane that created endtoend applications which is what voice is so out of the dust and ashes if you will of managing and securing voice for a very long period of time is now being recognized as an agile control plane and it rests on the higher layers of our sbc function which was a control plane that had an onboard psx and the fundamental policy architecture that has been endorsed in – and basically fits – theres hundreds of psxs out there among some of our tier  customer so whether or not it scores in  or  or it takes longer i expect it will have an impact on  it has the potential to have a marginal impact on  were going after customers together with our tier s were in qbrs ebcs people use different terms for these things but we are out on the road with executives from our tier  customers approaching some of their largest enterprise customers explaining this strategy there will be pax  later this year and into  but as far as revenue it would be risky to call it material in  but i would expect it to be material in  so this is not that far out jess jess lubert  wells fargo securities llc and then just one more for susan it looks like gross margins were a bit weaker than we would have expected so i was hoping to understand what happened there particularly on the product side given the sbc k and k seem to perform well and it sounds like the virtual story is getting some lift susan m villare  sonus networks inc sure i mean its just really a function of the overall revenue number so i mean obviously when we go back to the levels we saw in q q well be well above  jess lubert  wells fargo securities llc thanks guys susan m villare  sonus networks inc yep raymond p dolan  sonus networks inc thanks jess operator thank you our next question comes from mark kelleher of da davidson please go ahead mark kelleher  d a davidson  co great thanks for taking the questions just to go back to the large deal coming in in q just to understand that better is that – did i understand that thats going to be recognized as one deal one – it either comes in or it doesnt its not multiple pieces and the second part of that would be whats the service element of that should it be split evenly between service and product and then would that service continue on and what effect would that have on gross margins thanks raymond p dolan  sonus networks inc sure thanks mark last question is easier the effect on gross margins would be very positive so when it scores itll probably spike our margin profile a little bit depending on how it scores it will probably be balanced between q and q because when it scores itll probably go ratable between then and the end of the year well talk more about it as it gets closer but hopefully this is the kind of color that is at least appropriate for you now and im trying to be responsive to your question with regard to the product versus services mix i think it will be largely product when it scores mark kelleher  d a davidson  co okay great thanks raymond p dolan  sonus networks inc sure operator thank you our next question comes from mike latimore northland capital markets please go ahead mike latimore  northland securities inc hey ray thanks i guess you mentioned on that large project that youre opening doors with i think in other groups within that carrier i guess are you talking generally getting more into the access side of things there or what do you mean by that raymond p dolan  sonus networks inc were definitely evolving into access type discussions but if you think of – first of all in the enterprise side being a vnf in the whitebox solution which they call their virtual network services platform vns that is access if you will on the enterprise side for sure but with regard to the volte side the access side of the business is still largely in front of us were dealing on the core right now mike latimore  northland securities inc right okay got it and then did you make a comment that the first quarter bookings were one of your largest bookings quarters ever or i just kind of heard something like that or maybe thats not raymond p dolan  sonus networks inc no that was a reference to the fourth quarter bookings mike latimore  northland securities inc fourth quarter okay got it and then att it looks like it was not a  customer in a lower revenue quarter here i guess any general comments on att as it relates to  here raymond p dolan  sonus networks inc i feel very good about att and how its stacking up in  and even more so beyond that into  and  i would expect us to be a very large part of domain  or even domain  as it evolves which is probably the likely outcome by the end of the year mike latimore  northland securities inc great and then just as you look at the pipeline you mentioned sort of virtualization a lot i mean if you look at your pipeline on the product side how big is software lets say as a percent of the pipeline raymond p dolan  sonus networks inc one more time on that question mike or matt im sorry mike latimore  northland securities inc yeah just – in terms of the product pipeline software or virtualized products as a percent of the pipeline whats that looking like now versus even the six months ago or lets say a year ago raymond p dolan  sonus networks inc its increasing in two ways one there are more projects that are coming to us that have the potential to be purely virtualized and then of course theres a lot of fill in that were selling software on top of like k ks that were sold with partial software fills so thats kind of razorrazor blade so were definitely selling more blades which is coming in with software content and driving margin progress and in some cases its coming to us purely virtualized certainly when we move into the vnf piece were going to be into a purely virtualized revenue recognition model – a revenue model i should say and when we move into the cloud which is probably the next most exciting part of this story which ill share with you towards the back end of this year well be deploying in the cloud and pure software these issues are a little harder to forecast because well probably drive our transition to subscription as well i would expect us to have a meaningful portion of our revenue in  to be at least as a subscription revenue model mike latimore  northland securities inc all right and just last on microsofts skype for business do you expect that kind of revenue segment to be – i dont know – flat this year versus  or some growth there raymond p dolan  sonus networks inc probably flat potentially have a little growth in the back half of this year more than likely well see the growth in  microsoft skype for business is definitely evolving from sip termination onprem us versus audiocodes where you just kind of fight to the finish and its meeting the channel and its very challenging i mean we do fine but its very hard to be differentiated so its hard to get excited about that they are now evolving very nicely to a hosted environment where our core assets really shine our scale really shines and frankly theyre starting to peer or interconnect if you will at the api layer – or at least theyre exploring that with various other cloud players and so our peering background is going to help quite a bit in azure and in skype for business those two separate clouds will probably converge in  so id say from a revenue point of view the microsoft relationship is probably flat but from a strategic point of view the microsoft relationship is quite positive for sonus right now mike latimore  northland securities inc all right thanks susan m villare  sonus networks inc thank you operator thank you at this time id like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any closing remarks raymond p dolan  sonus networks inc thank you all very much for your support this has been a journey here as we continue to invest in rd but i really – im excited about the amount of indications from our tier s and from our large enterprises as to how positive they see our focus on virtualization so we look forward to sharing results in the second half have a great summer operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference
