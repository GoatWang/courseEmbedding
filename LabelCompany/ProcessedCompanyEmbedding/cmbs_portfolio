following manner todays price  change by asset class  todays intraday price performance percent change for each etp in each asset class is added together and then divided by the total number of etps in each asset class relative volume by asset class  using the day average of the daily volume for both the market and the security we divide the securitys average volume by the markets total volume to determine the normal percentage of the total volume that comes from each security throughout the trading day we will do a similar calculation comparing the current volume for that security to the total market volume at that point in the day the two calculations are compared and if the current days percentage is greater than the average the security has higher relative volume than the market prior day net flows as  of net assets by asset class  prior trading days etp net flows are added together for the asset class then divided by the total sum of net assets for each asset class price
