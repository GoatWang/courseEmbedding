glazer’s in legislative and regulatory matters with governmental organizations and associated agencies as well as direct the company’s lobbying efforts in all of its markets steen reports to alan n greenspan esq executive vice president and general counsel for glazer’s   alan steen was the administrator for the texas alcoholic beverage commission for  years his tenure there was marked by high levels of transparency and the ability to build coalitions among the industry tiers steen has also held leadership roles with the texas youth commission and was an adjunct professor at austin community college working in the criminal justice department he earned his bba from tarleton state university and an ms from the university of north texas   alan greenspan commented “we are truly

thirdgeneration family business was founded in dallas in    in  steen served as the executive director of the national cutting horse association for  weeks before quitting on aug  due to “misrepresentation and falsification of data issues with the association” according to an article in the fort worth star telegram  he sued the ncha as he had borrowed  to fully vest in his retirement fund when he resigned from the texas alcoholic and beverage commission to take the executive director job at the ncha  according to news reports the lawsuit was quickly resolved amicably to the satisfaction of both parties   information for the above article was retrieved from a press release from glazer’s and articles in the fort worth star telegram    comments phyllis  march   what a wonderful and encouraging article proof that “good guys” can still win hang in there with your intensive research objective reporting and support for the “little guys” like me sincerely a former ncha member who remembers when cutting was a pleasure and was just about good horses good competition and good friends  rather than how big the purse was reply phyllis  march   i really think you might have a strong influence on changing some of the negatives back to some of the positives of cutting hang in there i think you are tenacious enough that you become stronger the more you are attacked by those responsible for the state that the sport now finds itself those of us who mourn the loss what was good about cutting in the past regard you as our advocate i wish that those of us who fall into the afore stated position could revive the informal jackpot cuttings for the fun of it i have three trained cutting horses that are now just ranch horses because although they are “good” horses they do not have the “preferred” credentials that are necessary to win today and i don’t have the money to go show and donate to the owners of those preferred bloodlines a sincere thank you for being the conscience of the sport i have been an avid reader of the chatter and the quarter horse news for years but your articles are the only ones that i read any longer in regards to the sport keep up the
