services for corporate information and email its fullyintegrated suite of proprietary cloud services protects customers of all sizes from the significant business and data security risks to which their email system exposes them market opportunitythe growing need of organizations to mitigate the risks of email and data security continuity and archiving has already established a significant industry beyond the mail server based on recent gartner reports combined spending in markets catering to enterprise information and email security continuity and archiving which include secure email gateway backup and recovery software ediscovery software and data loss prevention was  billion in  and will grow to  billion in  mime believes there is a considerable need for a comprehensive integrated cloud solution that can address the needs of customers in these markets protects  manages emailmime protects customers from todays rapidly changing threat landscape where email has become a powerful attack vector and data leak concern mime also mitigates the significant business disruption that email failure or downtime causes in addition mimes archiving services secure store and manage critical corporate communications and information to address growing compliance and ediscovery requirements and enable customers to use this increasing archive of information to improve employee productivity email is a critical tool for organizations of all sizes protecting and managing email has become more complicated due to expanding security and compliance requirements and the rapid increase in both the volume and the importance of the information transmitted via email organizations are increasingly at risk from security breaches of sensitive data as sophisticated emailbased attacks or data leaks have become more common additionally organizations are not just using email for communication they are also increasing their use of email archives as an active repository of vital corporate information needed to meet compliance requirements and support employee productivity as a result email represents one of the highest concentrations of business risk that organizations may face traditional approaches to addressing these risks have left customers managing disparate point products from multiple vendors that are often hard to use costly to manage difficult to scale can fail to fully address todays increasing and rapidly changing threats and limit the use of corporate information to enhance productivity these approaches also suffer from inefficient overprovisioning because of the need to resource for occasional peak demand the resulting infrastructure complexity caused by disparate products and legacy architectures also makes it difficult to move more it workloads to the cloud which continues to be an increasing priority of organizations of all sizes proprietary cloud architecturemime developed its proprietary cloud architecture to offer customers comprehensive email security continuity and archiving capabilities in a single service that makes it easier for them to protect themselves effectively in a worsening and rapidly changing security and risk environment providing a fullyintegrated service also simplifies ongoing management and service deployment customers can then decommission the often costly and complex point products and onpremises technology they have traditionally used to tackle these risks mime also makes it easier for customers to move more of their it workloads to the cloud intellectual propertyas of september
