working at pathao when i initially saw how it actually made my life easier after i applied for the position i was called one evening and the head of human resources sifat hasan engaged in an eventful phone interview two days later i was asked to come to the office for a chat by the junior vp ahmed fahad two days later they confirmed my postion and i was asked to come in interviews are usually a cumbersome process but here it seemed more of a “getting to know each other” than an “interview”on the first day at pathao i went to their office and i was introduced to everyone by sifat hasan everyone was quite busy but they all seemed to have a great time and they took a few minutes off to talk to me a week in the office and i could feel that everyone here is working towards making peoples’ lives easier rather than working to meet deadlinesone of the best things here is the flat organizational nature you get to interact with the vp’s on a daily basis and not just to ask how they are doing but sharing your ideas about how things can be made better there is no stop in the flow of ideas everything moves fast fails fast and learns fast there are only formalities but no restrictions on how you want to work on your job here i was not eased into the job by being spoon fed i was given a task and all the help and i was expected to do it how i see fitas the whole organization it is still growing i feel its potential and also my own i feel that i can have an impact on its operations and my work here will be acknowledged i thought it would take a while for me to adjust and get my work done but when i saw people looking for me and asking me for solutions and ideas for ways a certain task could be done better i could understand that i was given more responsibility that i expected in the first month but that was not a bad thing i got all the help i needed and i also got the hang of my job faster not only that i could see the acknowledgement from people when i did my job and i knew it had an impact on the bigger picture pathao is growing really fast and it will be the future of bangladesh’s on demand service to serve the on demand needs of the country pathao needs a lot of people when i joined here there were about 0 people within two months the number grew to 80 plus new office space being acquired and all of us trying to make it feel like home there are weekly meetings which are not real meetings but just another reason to have a good time at the office the new joiners are introduced and the company achievements are shared with everyone through these meetings there are training sessions that happen every week on different topic that are relevant for the work we are doing and also for the careerhere at pathao we face challenges every day and we overcome them on a daily basis being challenged every day means we are working towards making pathao products better every day we work with the drive that our work here will greatly benefit the people out there i do not just have to assume the effects of pathao in dhaka i can see it in real timeworking at pathao has been a good learning and growing experience the future prospects of this company does not seem like hard work but more exciting i hope to be a part of this company while it reaches the lives of the people of the country and also to celebrate small

ondemand pointtopoint deliveries and packages’’ elius said they recognized the booming ecommerce industry and decided that is something that needs our service so that was their first target after that they moved on to transportation given the agonizing hours spent on cars and cngs we knew twowheelers to be the most viable option in a crowded but compact city like dhaka they are demo testing on demand motorcycle ride in dhaka city now   pathao’s plan with the recent investment pathao is currently looking to expand its team with industry leading professionals backed up by international

the data and a dash of luck to finally have a stable system that can cater to our hundreds of active merchants getting trust of businesses was the most crucial in the process we were fortunate to have a great team in place’’ they are also facing the problem of cash handling they are looking at cashondelivery as an opportunity instead of a problem if you are interested in using pathao app you can
