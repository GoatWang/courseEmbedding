called caterair international inc was created in  when marriott corp spun off its airline catering business to investors organized by the washington investment bank the carlyle group carlyle and its investors paid about  million for marriotts inflite services division which the hotel wanted sell so it could concentrate on its core business the investor group was headed by frederic v malek a carlyle senior advisor who had served as director of the  republican convention  the one that nominated vice president george hw bush it was malek who suggested that george w bush join the caterair board in  according to a  article in the new york times bushs fancy financial footwork by david ignatius the washington post aug   p a ignatius   the washington post amy goodman interview with dan briody author of the iron triangle inside the secret world of the carlyle group july   amy goodman can you talk about fred malek who he says came to him when they were putting the board together of the company and said look theres a guy who would like to be on the board hes kind of down on his luck needs a job needs a board position needs some board positions could you put him on the board dan briody this is a classic kind of cronyism that we see carlyle engaging in throughout its history fred malek had a couple pans on the stove going at one time at that point in time he was also chairman of northwest airlines and bear in mind at this point george hw bush was president of the united states at that time all these things were converging at the same time fred was doing some work for the carlyle group so he sort of engineered his own personal little triangle trade he said he did a favor for george w bush to get him on the board of caterair after george w bush had had some failed business experiences in the oil industry which you guys have talked about at length and so he put him on the board of caterair and in return he sort of got these favors from the administration in terms of certain faa restrictions and things like that for the airline business those things had nothing to do with the carlyle group those were personal favors basically for fred malek and so fred was able to engineer this brilliant little triangle trade that it helped  advantaged him in the sense that it furthered his airline business and then the airline business was then able to hire caterair to do its catering so it all wraps up very nicely and fred malek of course is the former nixon aide who was accused of counting the jews when nixon was afraid that the jews in the bureau of

military career he had his mentors and friends who helped him along and it is instructive to see who they were among the earliest was fred malek deputy director of the office of management and budget and one of president nixons hatchet men as powell himself puts it maleks ambition of which powell clearly approved was to gain control over the bureaucracy for the white house not to pursue any particular doctrine or policy from maleks maneuvering emerged one of my rules you dont know what you can get away with until you try playing powell politics the generals zest for power by eliot a
