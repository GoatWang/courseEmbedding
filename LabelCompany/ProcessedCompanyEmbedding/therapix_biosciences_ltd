reported this investigator initiated study is projected to be initiated during the third quarter of  subject to receiving necessary regulatory approvals in germany the study will be conducted at hannover medical school in germany under the leadership of principal investigator professor kirsten mullervahl the study will be a randomized doubleblind placebo controlled crossover proofofconcept phase ii clinical study to evaluate the safety tolerability and efficacy of up to twice daily oral thxts in treating adults with tourette syndrome the hannover study each subject will be randomized to receive either thxts or placebo in a  ratio via oral administration a total of  patients will be evaluated in a crossover design in the first stage the patients will be randomized to either treatment or placebo and will be treated for a duration of  weeks afterwards the patients will be crossedover and will be treated for an additional  weeks patients who initially received placebo will receive treatment and vice versa the primary endpoint of the hannover study is to evaluate the safety tolerance and efficacy of thxts the primary efficacy endpoint will be measured according to yale global tic severity scale total tic score a widelyaccepted index for assessing symptom severity and frequency in addition the effect of thxts will be evaluated by several secondary endpoints including additional scales for measuring tics severity as well as other mental disorders that often accompany tourette syndrome including ocd and adhd the therapeutic effect of thc in several cnsrelated

assets based on cannabinoid pharmaceuticals with this focus the company is currently engaged in two internal drug development programs based on repurposing an fda approved synthetic cannabinoid dronabinol thxts targets to the treatment of tourettes syndrome and thxuld targets the highvalue and underserved market of mild cognitive impairments please visit our website for more information at wwwtherapixbiocom about thxts thxts is a combination drug candidate for the treatment of tourette syndrome and it is based on two components  dronabinol the active ingredient in an fda approved synthetic analog of tetrahydrocannabinol thc which is the psychoactive molecule in the cannabis plant and  palmitoylethanolamide pea which is an endogenous fatty acid amide that belongs to the class of nuclear factor agonists which are proteins that regulate the expression of genes the combination of thc and pea may induce a reaction known as the entourage effect the basic tenet of the entourage effect is that cannabinoids work together or possess synergy and affect the body in a mechanism similar to the bodys own cannabinoid system which is a group of molecules and receptors in the brain that mediates the psychoactive effects of cannabis this entourage effect may account for the pharmacological actions of pea based on an activity enhancement of other physiological compounds pea may indirectly stimulate the cannabinoid receptors by potentiating their affinity for a receptor or by inhibiting their metabolic degradation and by doing so may increase the uptake of cannabinoid compounds such as thc thus it is speculated that the presence of the pea molecule likely increases the efficacy of orally administered thc while reducing the required dosage and decreasing associated deleterious adverse events about tourette syndrome tourette syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by physical motor tics and vocal phonic tics motor or phonic tics are sudden brief intermittent involuntary or semivoluntary movements or sounds respectively they typically consist of brief coordinated repetitive movements gestures or utterances that mimic fragments of normal behavior the tics associated with tourette syndrome can have significant effects on the academic and social development of children as well as affecting their overall selfesteem and mental health

pharmacological treatments have very limited efficacy and are almost always accompanied by severe side effects medications used to treat ts such as antipsychotic drugs alpha adrenergic agonists used for hypertension and migraine headaches and anticonvulsant drugs often have black box warnings for serious hazards unique approach several studies show the beneficial effects of thc in treatment of ts patients the thxts program takes a unique approach to cannabinoid formulation using the “entourage effect” in which endocannabinoid system constituents work synergistically together the entourage technology is licensed by therapix the therapix thxts compound is a combination drug based on dronabinol synthetic thc the psychoactive molecule in the cannabis plant cannabinoids such as synthetic thc are used in treating a wide range of medical conditions such as pain reduction antiinflammation and reduction or prevention of nausea they are used by cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and for mental health conditions such as anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder pea is naturally occurring in various food sources such as egg yolk soybeans and milk in parts of europe pea derived products eg normastž and pelvilenž have been marketed as a food for special medical purposes in april  health canada added pea to its list of natural health products a class of health products which includes vitamins mineral supplements herbal preparations traditional and homeopathic medicines probiotics and enzymes “entourage effect” the “entourage effect” was first described by professor raphael mechoulam in  professor mechoulam a world renowned expert on pharmaceutical cannabinoids and member of the therapix medical advisory board based on therapix research and preclinical studies dronabinol and pea have been shown to work better together than use of thc or pea alone pea is in the endocannabioid family and is believed to be a pain reliever and antiinflammatory agent combining pea with dronabinol may stimulate cannabinoid receptors inhibit metabolic degradation and thus increase uptake of thc the overall benefits of the pea combination are considered to be an increase in efficiency of oral administration enabling a decrease in dosage and lowering of side effects and adverse events therapix is seeking orphan drug designation for its compound thxuld ultralow dose thc to

impairment mci mci is a prealzheimer’s condition associated with problems with memory language thinking and judgement mci is a widespread condition that increases with age at a rate of  among – yearolds and  among – yearolds there is no fda approved treatment for mci therapix has compelling preclinical animal data demonstrating that ultralow dose dronabinol improves cognitive abilities recent studies have found that an ultralow dose of thc protects the brain from longterm cognitive impairment which may be caused by lack of oxygen supply seizures or use of drugs studies also suggest that ultralow doses of thc cause animals to improve performance in behavioral tests that measure learning and memory therapix plans to initiate a prospective open label randomized phase iia clinical trial to evaluate the safety tolerability and efficacy of thxuld in treating patients with cognitive impairment the primary efficacy endpoint of this trial will be change from baseline to end of weeks
