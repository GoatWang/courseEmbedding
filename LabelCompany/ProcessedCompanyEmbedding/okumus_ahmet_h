the information necessary to enable the court and the public to evaluate the proposed final judgment that would terminate this civil antitrust proceeding i nature and purpose of this proceeding on january   the united states filed a complaint against defendant ahmet h okumus ‘‘okumus’’ related to okumus’s acquisition of voting securities of webcom group inc ‘‘webcom’’ in june  the complaint alleges that okumus violated section a of the clayton act  usc a commonly known as the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of  the ‘‘hsr act’’ the hsr act provides that ‘‘no person shall acquire directly or indirectly any voting securities of any person’’ exceeding certain thresholds until that person has filed preacquisition notification and report forms with the department of justice and the federal trade commission collectively the ‘‘federal antitrust agencies’’ or ‘‘agencies’’ and the postfiling waiting period has expired  usc aa a key purpose of the notification and waiting period is to protect consumers and competition from potentially anticompetitive transactions by providing the agencies an opportunity to conduct an antitrust review of proposed transactions before they are consummated the complaint alleges that okumus acquired voting securities of webcom in excess of thenapplicable statutory thresholds without making the required preacquisition hsr filings with the agencies and without observing the waiting period and that okumus and webcom met the applicable statutory size of person thresholds at the same time the complaint was filed in the present action the united states also filed a stipulation and proposed final judgment that eliminates the need for a trial in this case the proposed final judgment is designed to deter okumus’ hsr act violations under the proposed final judgment okumus must pay a civil verdate sep  jan   jkt  penalty to the united states in the amount of  the united states and the defendant have stipulated that the proposed final judgment may be entered after compliance with the appa unless the united states first withdraws its consent entry of the proposed final judgment would terminate this case except that the court would retain jurisdiction to construe modify or enforce the provisions of the proposed final judgment and punish violations thereof ii description of the events giving rise to the alleged violations of the antitrust laws okumus is an investor with his principal office and place of business in new york city at all times relevant to the complaint okumus had sales or assets in excess of  million at all times relevant to the complaint webcom a delaware corporation headquartered in jacksonville florida had sales or assets in excess of  million on november   okumus filed under the hsr act to acquire voting securities of webcom okumus filed at the  million threshold as adjusted after the waiting period expired okumus was permitted under the hsr act to acquire additional voting securities of webcom for five years without making a new hsr filing so long as his holdings did not exceed the  million threshold as adjusted on june   okumus acquired additional voting securities of webcom as a result of this acquisition okumus held voting securities of webcom valued at approximately  million which was in excess of  million the as adjusted  million threshold in effect at the time although he was required to do so under the hsr act okumus failed to make an hsr filing and observe the statutory waiting period before consummating the june   acquisition on july   okumus sold voting securities of webcom as a result of this sale he no longer held voting securities valued in excess of  million and was no longer in violation of the hsr act the complaint further alleges that okumus’s june  hsr act violation was not the first time okumus had failed to observe the hsr act’s notification and waiting period requirements on september   okumus acquired voting securities of webcom as a result of this acquisition okumus held approximately  percent of the voting securities of po  frm  fmt  sfmt  webcom okumus did not file under the hsr act prior to making this acquisition relying on the exemption for acquisitions made solely for the purpose of investment see  usc ac however the exemption is limited to acquisitions that result in holdings that do not exceed ten percent of the voting securities of the issuer acquisitions that result in holding in excess of ten percent require an hsr filing regardless of the purpose of the acquisition on november   okumus made a corrective hsr filing for the september   acquisition and explained in a letter accompanying the corrective filing that his failure to file was inadvertent on december   the premerger notification office of the federal trade commission notified okumus by letter that it would not recommend a civil penalty for the violation but advised okumus that he was ‘‘accountable for instituting an effective program to ensure full compliance with the act’s requirements’’ iii explanation of the proposed final judgment the proposed final judgment imposes a  civil penalty designed to deter the defendant and others from violating the hsr act the united states adjusted the penalty downward from the maximum permitted under the hsr act because the violation was inadvertent the defendant promptly corrected the violation after discovery by selling voting securities and the defendant is willing to resolve the matter by consent decree and avoid prolonged investigation and litigation the relief will have a beneficial effect on competition because the agencies will be properly notified of future acquisitions in accordance with the law at the same time the penalty will not have any adverse effect on competition iv remedies available to potential private litigants there is no private antitrust action for hsr act violations therefore entry of the proposed final judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing of any private antitrust action v procedures available for modification of the proposed final judgment the united states and the defendant have stipulated that the proposed final judgment may be

alternative to the proposed final judgment the united states considered pursuing a full trial on the merits against the defendant the united states is satisfied however that the proposed relief is an appropriate remedy in this matter given the facts of this case including the defendant’s selfreporting of the violation and willingness to promptly settle this matter the united states is satisfied that the proposed civil penalty is sufficient to address the violation alleged in the complaint and to deter violations by similarly situated entities in the future without the time expense and uncertainty of a full trial on the merits verdate sep  jan   jkt  vii standard of review under the appa for the proposed final judgment the appa requires proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the united states be subject to a sixty  day comment period after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment is ‘‘in the public interest’’  usc e in making

‘‘need only provide a factual basis for concluding that the settlements are reasonably adequate remedies for the alleged harms’’ sbc commc’ns  f supp d at  moreover the court’s role under the appa is limited to reviewing the remedy in relationship to the violations that the united states has alleged in its complaint and does not authorize the court to ‘‘construct its own hypothetical case and then

entirely on the government’s exercising its prosecutorial discretion by bringing a case in the first place’’ it follows that ‘‘the court is only authorized to review the decree itself’’ and not to ‘‘effectively redraft the complaint’’ to inquire into other matters that the united states did not pursue microsoft  fd at –  as this court confirmed in sbc communications courts ‘‘cannot look beyond

bh files this competitive impact statement to set forth the information necessary to enable the court and the public to evaluate the proposed final judgment that would terminate this civil antitrust proceeding i nature and purpose of this proceeding on january   the united states filed a complaint against defendant ahmet h okumus okumus related to okumuss acquisition of voting securities of webcom group inc webcom in june  the complaint alleges that okumus violated section a of the clayton act  usc a commonly known as the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of  the hsr act the hsr act provides that no person shall acquire directly or indirectly any voting securities of any person exceeding certain thresholds until that person has filed preacquisition notification and report forms with the department of justice and the federal trade commission collectively the federal antitrust agencies or agencies and the postfiling waiting period has expired  usc aa a key purpose of the notification and waiting period is to protect consumers and competition from potentially anticompetitive transactions by providing the agencies an opportunity to conduct an antitrust review of proposed transactions before they are consummated the complaint alleges that okumus acquired voting securities of webcom in excess of thenapplicable statutory thresholds without making the required preacquisition hsr filings with the agencies and without observing the waiting period and that okumus and webcom met the applicable statutory size of person thresholds at the same time the complaint was filed in the present action the united states also filed a stipulation and proposed final judgment that eliminates the need for a trial in this case the proposed final judgment is designed to deter okumus hsr act violations under the proposed final judgment okumus must pay a civil penalty to the united states in the amount of  the united states and the defendant have stipulated that the proposed final judgment may be entered after compliance with the appa unless the united states first withdraws its consent entry of the proposed final judgment would terminate this case except that the court would retain jurisdiction to construe modify or enforce the provisions of the proposed final judgment and punish violations thereof ii description of the events giving rise to the alleged violations of the antitrust laws okumus is an investor with his principal office and place of business in new york city at all times relevant to the complaint okumus had sales or assets in excess of

securities of webcom for five years without making a new hsr filing so long as his holdings did not exceed the  million threshold as adjusted on june   okumus acquired additional voting securities of webcom as a result of this acquisition okumus held voting securities of webcom valued at approximately  million which was in excess of  million the as adjusted  million threshold in effect at the time although he was required to do so under the hsr act okumus failed to make an hsr filing and observe the statutory waiting period before consummating the june   acquisition on july   okumus sold voting securities of webcom as a result of this sale he no longer held voting securities valued in excess of  million and was no longer in violation of the hsr act the complaint further alleges that okumuss june  hsr act violation was not the first time okumus had failed to observe the hsr acts notification and waiting period requirements on september   okumus acquired voting securities of webcom as a result of this acquisition okumus held approximately  percent of the voting securities of webcom okumus did not file under the hsr act prior to making this acquisition relying on the exemption for acquisitions made solely for the purpose of investment see  usc ac however the exemption is limited to acquisitions that result in holdings that do not exceed ten percent of the voting securities of the issuer acquisitions that result in holding in excess of ten percent require an hsr filing regardless of the purpose of the acquisition on november   okumus made a corrective hsr filing for the september   acquisition and explained in a letter accompanying the corrective filing that his failure to file was inadvertent on december   the premerger notification office of the federal trade commission notified okumus by letter that it would not recommend a civil penalty for the violation but advised okumus that he was accountable for instituting an effective program to ensure full compliance with the acts requirements iii explanation of the proposed final judgment the proposed final judgment imposes a  civil penalty designed to deter the defendant and others from violating the hsr act the united states adjusted the penalty downward from the maximum permitted under the hsr act because the violation was inadvertent the defendant promptly corrected the violation after discovery by selling voting securities and the defendant is willing to resolve the matter by consent decree and avoid prolonged investigation and litigation the relief will have a beneficial effect on competition because the agencies will be properly notified of future acquisitions in accordance with the law at the same time the penalty will not have any adverse effect on competition iv remedies available to potential private litigants there is no private antitrust action for hsr act violations therefore entry of the proposed final judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing of any private antitrust action v procedures available for modification of the proposed final judgment the united states and the defendant have stipulated that the proposed final judgment may be entered by this court after compliance with the provisions of the appa provided that the united states has not withdrawn its consent page  the appa conditions entry of the decree upon this courts determination that the proposed final judgment is in the public interest the appa provides a period of at least sixty  days preceding the effective date of the proposed final judgment within which any person may submit to the united states written comments regarding the proposed final judgment any person who wishes to comment should do so within sixty  days of the date of publication of this competitive impact statement in the federal register or the last date of publication in a newspaper of the summary of this competitive impact statement whichever is later all comments received during this period will be considered by the united states which remains free to withdraw its consent to the proposed final judgment at any time prior to entry the comments and the response of the united states will be filed with this court in addition comments will be posted on the us department of justice antitrust divisions internet web site and under certain circumstances published in the federal register written comments should be submitted to daniel p ducore special attorney united states co federal trade commission  pennsylvania avenue nw cc washington dc  email dducoreftcgov the proposed final judgment provides that this court retains jurisdiction over this action and the parties may apply to this court for any order necessary or appropriate for the modification interpretation or enforcement of the final judgment vi alternatives to the proposed final judgment as an alternative to the proposed final judgment the united states considered pursuing a full trial on the merits against the defendant the united states is satisfied however that the proposed relief is an appropriate remedy in this matter given the facts of this case including the defendants selfreporting of the violation and willingness to promptly settle this matter the united states is satisfied that the proposed civil penalty is sufficient to address the violation alleged in the complaint and to deter violations by similarly situated entities in the future without the time expense and uncertainty of a full trial on the merits vii standard of review under the appa for the proposed final judgment the appa requires proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the united states be subject to a sixty  day comment period after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment is in the public interest  usc e in making that determination the court in accordance with the statute as amended in  is required to consider a the competitive impact of such judgment including termination of alleged violations provisions for enforcement and modification duration of relief sought anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered whether its terms are ambiguous and any other competitive considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment that the court deems necessary to a determination of whether the consent judgment is in the public interest and b the impact of entry of such judgment upon competition in the relevant market or markets upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit if any to be derived from a determination of the issues at trial id sec ea  b in considering these statutory factors the courts inquiry is necessarily a limited one as the government is entitled to broad discretion to settle with the defendant within the reaches of the public interest united states v microsoft corp  fd   dc cir  see

is limited because the government has broad discretion to determine the adequacy of the relief secured through a settlement united states v inbev nvsa no  jr  trade cas cch    us dist lexis  at  ddc aug   noting that the courts review of a consent judgment is limited and only inquires into whether the governments determination that the proposed remedies will cure the antitrust violations alleged

whether enforcement mechanisms are sufficient and whether the decree may positively harm third parties see microsoft  fd at  with respect to the adequacy of the relief secured by the decree a court

must be left in the first instance to the discretion of the attorney general the courts role in protecting the public interest is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree the court is required to determine not whether a particular decree is the one that will best serve society but whether the settlement is within the reaches of the public interest more elaborate requirements might undermine the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by consent decree bechtel  fd at  emphasis added citations omitted in determining whether a

that the court should grant due respect to the governments prediction as to the effect of proposed remedies its perception of the market structure and its views of the nature of the case   cf bns  fd

is constrained to look at the overall picture not hypercritically nor with a microscope but with an artists reducing glass see generally microsoft  fd at  discussing whether the remedies obtained in the decree are so inconsonant with the allegations charged as to fall outside of the reaches of the public interest   courts have greater flexibility in approving proposed consent decrees than in crafting their own decrees following a finding of liability in a litigated matter a proposed decree must be approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would impose on its own as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is within the reaches of public interest  united states v am tel  tel co  f supp   ddc  citations omitted quoting united states v gillette co  f supp   d

citing microsoft  fd at  united states v alcan aluminum ltd  f supp   wd ky  approving the consent decree even though the court would have imposed a greater remedy to meet this standard the united states need only provide a factual basis for concluding that the settlements are reasonably adequate remedies for the alleged harms sbc commcns  f supp d at  moreover the courts role under the appa is limited to reviewing the remedy in relationship to the violations that the united states has alleged in its complaint and does not authorize the court to construct its own hypothetical case and then evaluate the decree against that case microsoft  fd at  see also us airways  f supp d at  noting that the court must simply determine whether there is a factual foundation for the governments decisions such that its conclusions regarding the proposed settlements are reasonable inbev  us dist lexis  at  concluding that the public interest is not to be measured by comparing the violations alleged in the complaint against those the court believes could have or even should have been alleged because the courts authority to review the decree depends entirely on the governments exercising its prosecutorial discretion by bringing a case in the first place it follows that the court is only authorized to review the decree itself and not to effectively redraft the complaint to inquire into other matters that the united states did not pursue microsoft  fd at  as this court confirmed in sbc communications courts cannot look beyond the complaint in making the public interest determination unless the complaint is drafted so narrowly as to make a mockery of judicial power  f supp d at  in its  amendments congress made clear its intent to preserve the practical benefits of utilizing consent decrees in antitrust enforcement adding the unambiguous instruction that nothing in this section shall be construed to require the court to conduct an evidentiary hearing or to require the court to permit anyone to intervene  usc e see also us airways  f supp d at  indicating that a court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing or to permit intervenors as part of its review under the tunney act this language codified what congress intended when it enacted the tunney act in  as the author of this legislation senator tunney explained the court is nowhere compelled to go to trial or to engage in extended proceedings which might have the effect of vitiating the benefits of prompt and less costly settlement through the consent decree process  cong rec   statement of sen tunney rather the procedure for the public interest determination is left to the discretion of the court with the recognition that the courts scope of review remains sharply proscribed by precedent and the nature of tunney act proceedings sbc commcns  f supp d at  a court can make its public interest determination based on the competitive impact statement and response to public comments alone us airways  f supp d at    see also united states v enova corp  f supp d   ddc  noting that the tunney act expressly allows the court to make its public interest determination on the basis of the competitive impact statement and response to comments alone united states v midam dairymen inc no cvw  trade cas cch   at   wd mo  absent a showing of corrupt failure of the government to discharge its duty the court in making its public interest finding should    carefully consider the explanations of the government in the competitive impact statement and its responses to comments in order to determine whether those explanations are reasonable under the circumstances s rep no  at   where the public interest can be meaningfully evaluated simply on the basis of briefs and oral arguments that is the

november   okumus allegedly acquired a sufficient number of shares to become a statutory insider for purposes of section b on december   the november  calls expired unexercised on january   okumus wrote a second set of calls on allaire common stock okumus allegedly remained a statutory insider throughout this period  on march   allaire brought suit against okumus in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging that okumus was a statutory insider who was liable to allaire under section b of the securities exchange act of   usc § pb  for making shortswing trades in allaire common stock or its equivalent relying on rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec that govern section bs applicability to transactions in derivative securities allaire alleges that the expiration of the november calls in december constituted a purchase of allaire stock and that the writing of a new set of calls in january constituted a sale of allaire stock allaire argues that these two transactions ought to be matched with one another as a basis for holding okumus liable under section b for the profits okumus generated from them see rule a  cfr § a rule b  cfr § b  the district court thomas p griesa judge dismissed the action pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted allaire corp v okumus no  civ  wl   us dist lexis  sdny mar   the court concluded that the expiration of the first set of calls was not a purchase under sec rule b and that the plaintiff had therefore

even when the complaint is liberally construed that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle him to relief id internal quotation marks and citation omitted ii section b  section b of the securities exchange act of   usc § pb provides that statutory insiders of a corporation will forfeit any profits they make as a result of their shortswing trades in the equity securities of the corporation it reads  for the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner    by reason of his relationship to the issuer any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale or any sale and purchase of any equity security of such issuer other than an exempted security within any period of less than six months    shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer irrespective of any intention on the part of such beneficial owner    in entering into such transaction of holding the security purchased or of not repurchasing the security sold for a period exceeding six months    this subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale or the sale and purchase of the security involved or any transaction or transactions which the commission by rules and regulations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection   usc § pb   section a defines insider for these purposes as any person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than  per centum of any class of any equity security other than an exempted security which is registered pursuant to §  of this title  usc § pa  a short swing trade is a sale and a purchase of such equity security made within six months of each other see  usc § pb under the facts as alleged by allaire okumus was a statutory insider from november   through february   when he divested himself of all his equity interest in allaire  the sec has by regulation defined the term equity security to mean any equity security or derivative security relating to an issuer whether or not issued by that issuer  cfr § ad any purchase or its equivalent of an equity security in a corporation may be matched with any sale or its equivalent of such a security provided the transactions occur within six months of each other magma power co v dow chem co  fd   d cir the statutory definitions of purchase and sale are broad and at least arguably reach many transactions not ordinarily deemed a sale or purchase kern county land co v occidental petroleum corp  us    s ct   l ed d   iii rule ba  in  the sec issued regulations to govern the application of section b to derivative securities see ownership reports and trading by officers directors and principal security holders exchange act release no  investment company act release no   fedreg   feb   the commission is adopting a comprehensive regulatory framework in order to effect the purposes of section  and to address the proliferation of derivative securities and the popularity of exchangetraded options rule ba provides in relevant part  the establishment of or increase in a call equivalent position or liquidation of or decrease in a put equivalent position shall be deemed a purchase of the underlying security for purposes of section b of the act and the establishment of or increase in a put equivalent position or liquidation of or decrease in a call equivalent position shall be deemed a sale of the underlying securities for purposes of section b of the act      id  cfr § ba the principal issue before us on appeal is whether under rule ba the expiration of a short call option is a purchase thereby exposing its insiderwriter to section b liability if within six months after that expiration he or she also wrote sold another such call option  allaires reading of rule ba would require an affirmative answer to that question allaire points out that another section of the applicable regulations defines the term put equivalent position as a derivative security position that increases in value as the value of the underlying equity decreases including but not limited to a long put option and a short call option position  cfr § ah a party establishes a short call option position by writing a call option in doing so the writer obligates him or herself to sell the security to the holder of the option who is then in a long position with respect to the securities at the agreedupon strike price whenever the holder demands it except no later than the date the option expires the value of the writers derivative security position does indeed increase in value as the value of the underlying equity decreases id because the likelihood that the writer will be able to pocket the premium the purchaser paid him or her for the right to purchase the shares without the purchaser ever exercising that right increases as the value of the underlying equity decreases if the option does expire unexercised — presumably because the market price was below the strike price when the purchaser might otherwise have executed it — the writers obligation to sell the security ceases terminating his or her put equivalent position such an expiration allaire urges us to conclude represents a liquidation of or decrease in a put equivalent position and is therefore a purchase under rule ba as a purchase it must be matched with the set of calls okumus wrote on allaires stock on january   which is a sale allaire argues that there is thus a purchase and a sale sufficient to give rise to liability under section b  although this reading of rule ba is not implausible it appears to contradict the statutory purpose of holding traders liable only for those transactions in which they can exploit their inside information for their own profit we have previously held that the exercise of a fixedprice option is a nonevent for b purposes    because the insider by then is already bound by the terms of the option so the potential for abuse of inside information is minimal magma power  fd at  a fortiori when the option is written by the insider and not canceled leaving the insider with no control over whether or not it will be exercised his or her inside information at least in the usual case cannot be employed for his or her personal profit thus neither the holders exercise of the option nor the holders allowing the option to expire constitutes a transaction by the options writer  for this reason the district court correctly concluded that the references in rule ba to the establishment and liquidation of call and put equivalent positions refer not to the expiration of an option but rather to the initial transaction between the writer and the holder allaire corp  wl  at   us dist lexis  at  under the district courts view which we share section b covers only the transaction in which the parties agree to the terms of sale because that is the one in which the writer of the option can be deemed to be using his or her inside information to arrive at the options terms on a favorable basis just as the holders exercise of a call option is not a sale by the writer under rule ba neither is the expiration of a call option a purchase by the writer under that provision  allaire concedes that a holders exercise of an option is a nonevent for the writer but it attempts to distinguish the exercise of an option from its expiration while the writer has no control over whether the holder exercises the option allaire argues the seller writer of the option has the choice at any point from the writing of the option until the exercise date to close out the position by buying back the option appellants br at  emphasis in original by the same logic however an insider could be held liable under section b without having been involved in any transaction because such a person always has a choice as to whether to buy and sell stock within six months the issue is not what the option writer might have done it is what he or she in fact did iv rule bd  even if allaires interpretation of rule ba were consistent with the purposes of section b it cannot be squared with other portions of the sec regulations governing section b liability for derivatives cf united savs assn of texas v timbers of inwood forest assoc ltd  us    s ct   l ed d   a provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme — because the same terminology is used elsewhere in a context that makes its meaning clear    citation omitted  allaire relies principally on rule ba but only one subsection of rule b refers explicitly to the legal consequences of the expiration of an option rule bd provides in part  upon cancellation or expiration of an option within six months of the writing of the option any profit derived from writing the option shall be recoverable under section b of the act the profit shall not exceed the premium received for writing the option  id under this provision if an insider writes an option that expires unexercised within six months and profits from doing so on account of having been paid by the purchaser for a right to buy shares that the purchaser did not exercise the writer will be held liable under section b for the amount the purchaser paid him or her for the option see gwozdzinsky v zellchilmark fund lp  fd   d cir under rule bd any insider who writes a put option on securities of the issuer is liable under section b to the extent of any premium received for writing the option if the option is either cancelled or expires unexercised within six months of its writing an event that is deemed a sale for purposes of section b citing rule bd  allaires reading of rule ba would render this rule bd superfluous if the expiration of a call option were a purchase under rule ba what purpose would it serve to provide as rule bd does that the expiration of an option within six months of its writing triggers liability such an event would be covered by rule ba cf state street bank  trust co v salovaara  fd   d cir it is wellsettled that courts should avoid statutory interpretations that render provisions superfluous     allaire bases its reading of rule ba in large measure on its definition of a sale as including the liquidation of or decrease in a call equivalent position  cfr § ba but if the sec had intended rule ba to govern expirations the sec would presumably have used the word expiration to do so indeed the explicit reference to expiration of an option in rule bd indicates that the sec was aware of the potential significance of an options expiration suggesting that its omission from rule ba was likely intentional cf sosa v alvarezmachain  us   n   s ct   l ed d   rejecting governments request to read a provision of the federal tort claims act that did not contain the words act or omission as if it did when other parts of the act did contain those words thus proving that congress knew how to specify act or omission when it wanted to  by its terms rule bd plainly does not cover the trades okumus is alleged to have made this provision directs that the writer of an option may be held liable for any profit derived from the expiration of that same option within six months here the january  calls okumus wrote were for a different set of shares than those that expired on december  therefore those two events do not trigger liability under rule bd  the sec has itself lent support to this view in response to a letter from the law firm of sullivan  cromwell requesting guidance as to the applicability of rule b to the expiration of an option more than six months after its writing the sec took the position that the expiration of a call option more than six months following the date on which it was written would be the exempt closing of a derivative security position with respect to the writer in circumstances where no value is given in consideration for the expiration sullivan  cromwell sec noaction letter  wl  at   sec noact lexis  at  nov   it further concluded that such an expiration would not be construed as a purchase by the writer resulting from the decrease in a put equivalent position pursuant to rule ba that may be matched with another transaction by the writer pursuant to rule bc id  wl  at   sec noact lexis  at  emphasis added  the sec noaction letter does not bind us but we find it persuasive see mony group inc v highfields capital mgmt lp  fd   d cir noting that noaction letters may be relied upon for their persuasiveness here the letter confirms our view that the writing of an option may be a transaction under section b but that the expiration of an option when matched against any transaction other than its own writing is not conclusion  for the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court is affirmed notes  allaire is the successorininterest to another delaware corporation also named allaire corporation but there is no need to distinguish between the two for purposes of resolving this appeal  section   usc § p was amended in  pl  effective date dec  the expiration at issue in this case occurred on december   and the second sale of calls occurred on january   we therefore look to the statute in effect as of december   we note however that the  amendment does not affect the law at issue on this appeal both the plaintiff and the defendants refer to the amended version of the statute in their arguments as did the district court in its opinion  derivative securities are financial instruments that derive their value hence the name from an underlying security or indexmagma power co  fd at  a call option gives its holder the right to purchase shares of an equity from the option seller at a specified strike price see blacks law dictionary  th ed it is a derivative security because its value derives from the price of the security for which the calls are issued  by the same token the writer faces a loss if and when the market price of the underlying security rises above the options strike price because he or she will be forced to sell the shares to the purchaser for below market value  rule bc also appears to undermine allaires interpretation it sets forth the method for calculating an insiders profit from shortswing trade pairs consisting of at least one option transaction the provision does not provide a method for calculating profit where an options expiration is one half of the transaction pair in question if the sec thought an expiration ordinarily may give rise to insiders liability when paired with any other purchase or sale why did it not give so much as a hint in rule bc as to the proper means of calculating the insiders profit
