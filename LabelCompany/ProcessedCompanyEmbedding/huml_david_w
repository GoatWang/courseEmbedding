david rafes inc v huml email  print  comments  no cv view case cited cases david rafes inc appellant v michael huml and slowboy racing inc appellees court of appeals of texas first district houston opinion issued october   memorandum opinion terry jennings justice appellant david rafes inc challenges the trial courts judgment entered after a bench trial in favor of appellees michael huml and slowboy racing inc in rafess suit against huml and slowboy for defamation and tortious interference with prospective business relationships in three issues rafes contends that the trial court erred in not filing findings of fact and conclusions of law the takenothing judgment entered against it is against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence and the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support a finding in favor of huml and slowboy on their defensive theories we affirm factual and procedural background in its petition rafes doing business as turbochargerscom alleged that on february   huml and slowboy published defamatory statements in an internet article regarding rafes and the quality of a turbocharger produced and sold by rafes rafes asserted that in stating that rafess turbocharger was inferior the internet article was defamatory rafes challenged as false or unsubstantiated huml and slowboys claims that rafes had misled consumers regarding the genuineness of the turbocharger rafess turbocharger was a poorly manufactured turbo from china that would inevitably fail in a short amount of time the turbocharger was a chinese version using an inferior stainless in its composition and the turbocharger was composed of metal or some type of powdered metal that would not hold up to the heat and abuse typically encountered by turbochargers rafes also asserted that the internet article contained pictures that purported to depict its turbocharger but that actually depicted a turbocharger made by another entity rafes complained that huml and slowboy implied that scientific testing had been performed on the turbocharger when in fact no testing had been performed noting that the internet article was published for viewing by the general public competitor businesses and rafess past present and future customers rafes alleged that huml and slowboy published the defamatory statements with negligence and malice alleging that the defamatory statements injured rafess reputation and business it sought actual damages past and future lost profits damages for injury to the business reputation and goodwill and exemplary damages in their answer huml and slowboy asserted multiple affirmative defenses including immunity substantial truth consent and qualified privilege huml and slowboy asserted that rafes was libelproof and that rafess claims were barred by its criminal acts huml and slowboy also made counterclaims against rafes for violations of the lanham act on february  and   the trial court conducted a bench trial rafes presented the testimony of david rafes the owner of rafes thomas mabrey an employee of rafes randall king an expert witness who evaluated the turbocharger and the internet article and testified regarding the accuracy of the statements made in the internet article and kenneth lehrer an expert who testified regarding rafess damages huml and slowboy presented the testimony of huml president of slowboy and author of the internet article and andrew johnston an expert on turbochargers who testified regarding the turbocharger and the statements made in the internet article at the conclusion of the bench trial the trial court noted that it was making some preliminary findings of fact and although it seemed that some inaccurate statements were made in the internet article other statements were true or arguably true the trial court then stated from the plaintiffs witnesses or witness we have some concessions that there was something wrong    with the turbocharger just not anything that mr huml or that the defendants said was wrong with it i heard that statement that goes not to whether or not the plaintiff was slandered but the extent of the defendants damages because this was a bad product for reasons not known to mr huml never known to him but if the product would have failed anyway that goes to future damages for sure and to some extent to past damages to the extent to which warranty claims could have eaten up profits    at least preliminarily where i am at is there was some accurate statements made in the internet article and some inaccurate statements made the extent to which if only the inaccurate statements have been made would it have still hurt sales and even to the extent to which it did the extent to which the plaintiff has been damaged those are my preliminary findings following some additional discussion the trial court stated that it had some unresolved questions about the law of business disparagement and the damages issue the trial court then noted that the turbocharger was a bad product that would have failed anyway but not for any reason huml noted or was aware of after rafess counsel quoted the legal definition of defamation and contended that the article had damaged rafess reputation the trial court explained    but the other problems with the turbocharger in question go to damages if it was a bad product your client wouldnt have made a lot of money—causation of damages if your client wouldnt have made a lot of money from it anyway because as word got out it was in bad product if it had—it could have led to—the manufacturing problems that developed down the line would have cut severely into damages true after rafess counsel disputed whether there was any evidence that the turbocharger was a bad product the trial court replied well it is there trust me the court then told the parties that they had the trial courts findings and that it would come up with a damage figure if it found an award of damages was appropriate both parties filed posttrial briefs regarding their claims counterclaims and affirmative defenses and their proposed judgments findings of fact and conclusions of law in their briefing both parties challenged the trial courts preliminary findings and huml and slowboy emphasized among other things the evidence that supported their affirmative defense of substantial truth over one year later on july   the trial court signed a final judgment ordering that the parties take nothing on their claims and counterclaims on august   rafes filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law see tex r civ p  on september   rafes filed a notice of past due findings of fact and conclusions of law see tex r civ p  the trial court did not enter findings of fact and conclusions of law findings of fact and conclusions of law in its first issue rafes argues that the trial court erred in not filing the requested findings of fact and conclusions of law because the trial court was required to do so see id in response huml and slowboy assert that the trial court made implicit findings and argue alternatively that the trial courts failure to file findings of fact and conclusions of law did not harm rafes because the facts in this case are not in dispute here rafes timely filed its request for findings of fact and conclusions of law within twenty days after the judgment was signed see tex r civ p  however rafes untimely filed its notice of past due findings of fact and conclusions of law thirtyone days after filing its original request for findings of fact and conclusions of law see tex r civ p  providing that notice of past due findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be filed within thirty days after filing the original request because rafes untimely filed its notice of past due findings and conclusions we hold that it has waived its right to complain about the trial courts failure to file findings and conclusions see averyt v grande inc  swd   tex  las vegas pecan  cattle co v zavala county  swd   tex  see also alpert v crain caton  james pc  swd   tex apphouston st dist  pet denied holding that complete failure to file the notice required by rule  waives any issue concerning the trial courts failure to file findings of fact and conclusions of law fleming v taylor  swd   tex appcorpus christi  no writ holding that party that untimely filed notice thirtytwo days after original request waived complaint on appeal regarding trial courts failure to file findings of fact and conclusions of law we overrule rafess first issue affirmative defense of substantial truth in its third issue rafes argues that the trial court erred in entering the takenothing judgment against it on its claims against huml and slowboy because the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support a finding in favor of huml and slowboy on their defensive theories in a trial to the court where no findings of fact or conclusions of law are filed the trial courts judgment implies all findings of fact necessary to support it pharo v chambers county  swd   tex  when a reporters record is filed as in this case the implied findings are not conclusive and a party may challenge the both the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support these implied findings bmc software belg nv v marchand  swd   tex  in re estate of rhea  swd   tex appfort worth  no pet when legal and factual sufficiency issues are raised the applicable standard of review is the same as that to be applied in the review of jury findings roberson v robinson  swd   tex  the judgment must be affirmed if it can be upheld on any legal theory that finds support in the evidence worford v stamper  swd   tex  doe v tarrant county dist attorneys office  swd   tex appfort worth  no pet although we recognize that we are not bound by the trial courts preliminary oral findings and that such findings cannot serve as a substitute for actual findings of fact and conclusions of law we begin our analysis by examining the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial courts implied finding that rafess claims are barred by the affirmative defense of substantial truth we will sustain a legal sufficiency or noevidence challenge if the record shows one of the following  a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact  rules of law or evidence bar the court from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact  the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a scintilla or  the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of the vital fact city of keller v wilson  swd   tex  in conducting a legal sufficiency review a court must consider evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and indulge every reasonable inference that would support it id at  if there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support the challenged finding we must uphold it formosa plastics corp usa v presidio engrs  contractors inc  swd   tex  if the evidence at trial would enable reasonable and fairminded people to differ in their conclusions then the trier of fact must be allowed to do so keller  swd at  see also king ranch inc v chapman  swd   tex  a reviewing court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the trieroffact so long as the evidence falls within this zone of reasonable disagreement keller  swd at  in conducting a factual sufficiency review we must consider weigh and examine all of the evidence that supports or contradicts the trieroffacts determination plastex inc v us steel corp  swd   tex  london v london  swd   tex apphouston th dist  pet denied we may set aside the judgment only if the evidence that supports the finding is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong or unjust cain v bain  swd   tex  in a bench trial the trial court is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses assigns the weight to be given their testimony may accept or reject all or any part of their testimony and resolves any conflicts or inconsistencies in the testimony rich v olah  swd   tex appdallas  no pet we may not pass upon the credibility of the witnesses or substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact even if a different answer could be reached upon review of the evidence id to maintain a cause of action for defamation a plaintiff must establish that the defendant  published a statement about the plaintiff  that was defamatory  while acting with either actual malice if the plaintiff was a public official or public figure or negligence if the plaintiff was a private individual regarding the truth of the statement wfaatv v mclemore  swd   tex  henriquez v cemex management inc  swd   tex apphouston st dist  pet denied grotti v belo corp  swd   tex appfort worth  pet denied the truth of the statement in the publication on which an action for libel is based is a defense to the action tex civ prac  rem code ann §  vernon  a defendant may also defeat a libel claim by establishing the substantial truth of the statement grotti  swd at  citing mcilvain v jacobs  swd   tex  to determine if a publication is substantially true we consider whether the alleged defamatory statement was more damaging to the plaintiffs reputation in the mind of the average person than a truthful statement would have been and we look at the gist of the publication to determine whether it is substantially true id citations omitted the defense of truth does not require proof that the alleged defamatory statement is literally true in every detail substantial truth is sufficient gustafson v city of austin  swd   tex appaustin  pet denied howell v hecht  swd   tex appdallas  writ denied here the trial court heard sufficient evidence to support an implied finding that the turbocharger was defective or as the trial court bluntly summarized a bad product the trial court also heard sufficient evidence to support an implied finding that the statements made in the internet article were true or even if not literally true in every detail substantially true for example johnston huml and slowboys expert who was an independent consultant for turbocharger engineering issues and patent consulting testified that he reviewed the internet article and rafess turbocharger and that the main concerns expressed by huml regarding rafess turbocharger in the internet article were all valid johnston further explained that he also had serious concerns about every part of the turbocharger about which huml had raised concerns and most of his concerns were for the same reasons generally expressed by huml in the article johnston further stated that he had additional serious concerns about other design and manufacturing problems associated with rafess turbocharger that huml had not identified in the article after johnston had explained his concerns about these additional problems with the turbocharger the trial court initially stated that it wanted to focus on statements contained in the article but then stated that it agreed that evidence of these additional problems was relevant to the issue of damages regarding the specific statements made in the internet article johnston agreed that the turbocharger had been reproduced with a part number from a competing mistsubishi turbocharger product and that using the exact same part number would be intended to cause confusion in the marketplace and was a slippery slope from a legal standpoint johnston stated that rafes should have not have reproduced the exact same part number on its turbocharger because it left the impression that rafes was intentionally trying to cause confusion johnston also stated consistent with humls remarks in the article that there were strong reasons to be concerned about the quality of materials used by the parties that had produced rafess turbocharger in taiwan regarding the specifications of the turbocharger that huml discussed and criticized in the internet article johnston stated that humls concerns about the blades thickness and weight were all reasonable regarding the thickness of the blade used on rafess turbocharger compared to the thickness of the blade on the genuine mitsubishi product johnston explained that this indicated a lack of casting quality control on rafess part and given the fact that rafess blade was twice as thick rafes must have used low cost methods of manufacturing it when asked whether he agreed with the statement in the article that the material used in rafess turbocharger would not hold up to the heat and abuse of a typical user johnston explained that if the part had an air pocket it in it which he considered as a potential explanation for the blades weight difference from that used in the genuine mitsubishi product this could lead to immediate or long term failure of the turbocharger johnston like huml believed that parts of rafess turbocharger were inferior based upon coloration differences and he stated that his conclusions regarding the inferiority of the parts were later confirmed he also stated that it was reasonable based upon common industry knowledge for huml to raise concerns about the quality of the turbocharger based upon these coloration observations during his testimony johnston agreed that there were some inaccuracies in the internet article for example when asked about the specific statement in the article that rafess turbocharger was made of some type of powdered metal johnston remarked that huml had likely intended to refer to a powdery surface but johnston explained this distinction and the likely intent of humls statement johnston also admitted to other inaccuracies in the internet article but based upon johnstons testimony the trial court would have been entitled to conclude that such inaccuracies were minor the testimony reveals that johnston considered these inaccuracies to be insignificant additionally in concluding his testimony johnston opined that humls conclusions and actions were reasonable when compared to the standard of a quality assurance inspector in the industry an abstract of johnstons expert report was also introduced into evidence in the abstract of this report johnston stated after detailed explanation that humls essential comments and concerns were both technically correct and reasonable johnston further explained that in evaluating the turbocharger huml had used common industry practice by comparing the color of the turbocharger with a known standard part johnston also noted in the article that huml simply identified possible critical noncomplying components but stressed that rafes had recommended further scientific analysis and rafes alerted users to use caution pending further analysis we recognize that rafes presented testimony to dispute humls and johnstons testimony rafes also presented an expert who compared rafess turbochager against the internet article and disputed the accuracy of many of the statements made in the article however the competing experts in this case disagreed on several important points and johnston challenged the accuracy of rafess experts opinions johnston specifically testified that rafess expert had made at least three mistakes in examining the turbocharger and preparing his findings the trial court heard all of this evidence including the evidence from the dueling experts regarding the accuracy of the statements in the internet article and the trial court as the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses was entitled to accept or reject all or any part of the witnesses testimony rich  swd at  moreover from our review of the record it is clear that the trial court could have disbelieved at least some of the testimony presented by rafes and his expert for example although rafes offered an explanation as to why it used as a product number on its turbocharger the product number used on the mitsubishi product the trial court was not required to believe this explanation moreover the trial court could have determined that the testimony provided by rafes and his employee about an internet advertisement for the turbocharger was equivocal and lacked credibility huml and slowboy also introduced other evidence including consumer correspondence that indicated that at least some consumers had been confused about the origin of rafess turbocharger and whether it was a genuine mitsubishi product or a product designed and or manufactured at least in part by rafes in sum the trial court was presented with ample evidence substantiating the gist of the statements contained in the internet article regarding the production and manufacturing of the turbocharger accordingly we hold that the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the trial courts implied finding that rafess claims against huml and slowboy were barred by the affirmative defense of substantial truth we further hold that the trial court did not err in entering the takenothing judgment against rafes we overrule rafess third issue conclusion we affirm the judgment of the trial court footnotes  neither party contends that our appellate review should be limited to the trial courts preliminary oral findings and we note that such an argument would be unavailing because here the trial court expressly stated that its oral findings were preliminary and it invited the parties to file posttrial briefing indicating that it was still considering its rulings additionally we note that we cannot consider comments made by the judge at the conclusion of a bench trial as a substitute for findings of fact and conclusions of law huang v don mcgill toyota inc  swd   tex apphouston th dist  no pet  although huml and slowboy do not raise this argument on appeal it is apparent from the face of the record that rafess notice was untimely we also note that nothing in the record indicates that rafes would be entitled to an enlargement of time for filing the notice see tex r civ p  providing for enlargement of time for filing for documents sent to the clerk by firstclass mail on or before the last day for filing the notice is filestamped september   and the certificate of service reflects that it was served on september   there is no postmark in the record indicating that it was mailed on an earlier date and although rafes contends that its notice was timely rafes agrees that the notice was filed on september    although the trial court in its preliminary findings indicated that it considered rafes to have a more significant problem establishing damages its repeated statements that the evidence showed that rafes had produced a bad product also indicates the potential applicability of the affirmative defense of substantial truth  rafes does not challenge johnstons expertise on appeal or his qualifications to offer any of his expert testimony  having held that the trial courts implied finding on the affirmative defense of substantial truth is supported by legally and factually sufficient evidence we need not address rafess second issue in which he argues that the takenothing judgment entered against it is against the great weight
