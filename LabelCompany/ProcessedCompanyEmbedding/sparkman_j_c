oral histories j c sparkman interview date thursday july  interview location denver co usainterviewer paul maxwellcollection hauser collection         maxwell hi im paul maxwell with the national cable center were here today with the gus hauser oral history project for the national cable television center and museum in denver were interviewing j c sparkman todayto start id like to ask j c to clarify a couple of things for us like what does jc stand forsparkman just j c i dont have a namemaxwell you dont have a namesparkman i came from a poor family we couldnt afford first namesmaxwell thats good well when did you get into cable televisionsparkman in maxwell you had been in the air force if i remembersparkman yes i was in the air forcemaxwell thats when they threw you outsparkman i was discharged october   and i went into the cable television business october  maxwell where was thatsparkman lewiston idahomaxwell were you from idahosparkman no i grew up in eastern washingtonmaxwell so it wasnt far awaysparkman it wasnt far awaymaxwell who did you go to work for theresparkman a company called aj distributingmaxwell aj distributing they were a cable companysparkman we actually sold material to cable customers as well as actually building cable systems throughout the idaho montana and washington areamaxwell what did aj stand forsparkman alan and james i believemaxwell alan and jamessparkman not me that wasnt minemaxwell not a presand is those dayssparkman no it was notmaxwell how long were you theresparkman three yearsmaxwell three years that taught you the cable business both from i assume the standpoint of how to build it plus a little bit of how to run itsparkman yes how to build them how to run them and also how to finance themmaxwell which if i remember right in those days was the critical elementsparkman the critical elementmaxwell a large number of companies got started by supplying and taking the risk at the same timesparkman exactlymaxwell so what happened to ajsparkman aj subsequently went out of business at a later time after i left it moved into some things other than cable and they didnt work out for themmaxwell and where did you go from theresparkman i actually ended up with jerroldmaxwell which was doing much the same thing at that time rightsparkman exactly yesmaxwell how old was jerrold when you joined itsparkman oh i dont know – probably maxwell im trying to remember when milt shapp started itsparkman me too i think probably maybe  –  years old maybe maxwell so this was  or  when you joinedsparkman actually indirectly i was with jerrold sic until  and then i joined jerrold in maxwell jerrold for hose who might not be familiar was the first major manufacturer of items that made a cable system worksparkman exactlymaxwell at jerrold did you have the western territory or what did you do for themsparkman i was working in the western territory my first job – i had an office in portland oregon and then i moved from portland oregon to the san francisco bay area with jerrold then i moved to kansas city to take over the regional job in kansas city its one of those – i bought a house in kansas city that we never moved into the evening after my wife and i had closed on the house and she was on her way back to san francisco i received a call from jim forgy who was my boss jim asked me to move to philadelphia at that point in time jerrold owned a house in kansas city and i moved to philadelphia but i never bought a home in philadelphiamaxwell milt was still running the company then wasnt hesparkman no by this time bob beissinger was running the company at that point in time was the time that they sold the company to general instrumentsmaxwell and that was monty shapiro rightsparkman monty shapiro – yes when they sold it to general instruments john malone was brought in by monty shapiro from mackenzie to figure out how to make jerrold a profitable company for general instruments then john was hired to run general instruments thats about the time i joined tcimaxwell gi had other businesses in those dayssparkman yesmaxwell half a dozen if i remembersparkman yes several including gaming for the race tracks and the chip business and so onmaxwell you also had  werent they one of the patent holders on tv tunerssparkman nomaxwell or was that later when they picked up somebodysparkman no that was not general instruments that was  gosh i cant say the name right now ill think of itmaxwell think of it yell it out when you think of it i was confused on  did they make them under patent thensparkman they made them under a patent yesmaxwell right because i remember seeing gi tuners at some point that i rememberedsparkman yes bill hamlin was the man that owned the patent on converters which we subsequently picked up an acquisition in tci which goes down the road a little waysmaxwell thats interesting john always looked for opportunities we do know thatsparkman yes yesmaxwell so how long were you in  did you follow john to tci or did you sparkman no i came to tci about the same time that john came on board at gi i came in  and i believe john came in maxwell i remember when john came in sparkman of course i knew john all that time so i joined tci in maxwell i think when i first met you in about  or so bob magness of course created tci and was running it if i remember you were in operations with bill brazeelsparkman yesmaxwell thats right because i remember i think bill first introduced me to you in those dayssparkman yes when i first came on board at tci bill brazeel – i worked for bill brazeel or with bill brazeel actually at the time i came on board in  tci had  cable subscribersmaxwell and how many subscribers did tci when you finally sold it to attsparkman i believe directly and indirectly in the  millionmaxwell whats the compound growth rate of that i wonder what it is well have to work that backwardssparkman a lotmaxwell a lotsparkman an awfully lotmaxwell when i first met the tci folks i met bob and you guys it was almost a family business or it felt like that with the way bob ran it betsy was here and you were just beginning to show some growth in those days by accumulating other systemssparkman yes we bought a few systems i think our first large acquisition was the systems of foot cone and beldon which included pueblo and several other areas from there we just kept goingmaxwell it never did slow down did itsparkman actually there was a time in  –  when it slowed down considerably it was a time like frankly quite like were experiencing today except there were some other factors that were even worse than we are today there was no money to be borrowed the credit lines had all dried up the interest rates were climbing at an astronomical ratemaxwell   and sparkman    interest rates as a matter of fact there was one point in time when our interest payments at tci were more than our total income which was very difficult to run a company that waymaxwell i can imagine was john here by thensparkman that was about the time john came on board to help us see if we could straighten it out anyway we prevailed through all of that and fortunately the bankers were in most cases cooperative therefore we grew through that then by  we had grown to about  cable subscribersmaxwell for people who dont know today in those days cable systems were relatively small scattered not so urban and they werent what they are today which is everybody subscribing to televisionsparkman practically no urban systems as a matter of fact i think at that point in time if you did the average cable system they were somewhere in the neighborhood of  –  subscribers i think todays average is up in the  –  to give a kind of thumbnail of what it was then versus nowmaxwell that sounds rightsparkman they were small systems we were a small system cable operator mainly in the mountain time zone for many years until we started expanding offmaxwell you did some of the early things to connect those systems too i cant remember the name of the microwave companysparkman western microwavemaxwell western microwavesparkman that was done by bob magness actually prior to both john and i coming on board bob magness and larry romrell actually were the two who put the microwave systems across wyoming and montana mainly to bring the salt lake city signals to montana which frankly made the systems in montana and wyoming very very successful operations they were key to the operations of those systemsmaxwell where was the first system  were you out of the denver headquarters the whole timesparkman yesmaxwell so you had operational authority you ran operations in effectsparkman yes i didmaxwell and made sure that things got installed that systems got upgraded and so on it must have been interesting going from the  i do remember an early tci system i saw that was sort of left over no it wasnt it was a teleprompter one one of the few they had up in montana that had paired wire still three channelssparkman thats what we call open wire cable theres an interesting story on the side line on that in vernal utah where tci owned the cable system we had an open wire line running  it was very low resistance and the signal would go along ways without amplification anyway we also ran power up them and we had  so we could get enough amperage a horse got in it and was killed we always talked about the horse we owned at tci it was rather an expensive horsemaxwell ill bet that was an expensive horsesparkman but yes the open wire cable was used in a lot of cable systems especially in the mountain areas because they would put antennas on top of the mountains and run the open wire cable off not as low as fiber but pretty low loss therefore they could run it a long waysmaxwell there wasnt a lot of interference in the air in those dayssparkman no there were not a lot of tv stations out there so it worked wellmaxwell i bet changing that stuff out was fascinatingsparkman very fascinatingmaxwell the construction effort of moving  cable has a history of having a capacity level it gets filled the capacity grows it gets filled the capacity grows its always that ying yang of content versus the conduit youve been putting in the fields and into peoples homes so that must have been an interesting thing to watchsparkman very much so when i first became involved if we could get three channels mainly the networks – the three networks existed at that point in time in the s – if we could get the three channels on a cable system we felt we had all the service we needed and we would ever need ive said that many times in my time in the cable industry frankly the amplification unlike what they are now jerrold had what we called strip amplifiers each of them were single channel you would come into the amplifiers then go into each individual one and then come out the other end marry them back together and go on down the line it was an interesting way of building a cable system you couldnt go very far between amplifiersmaxwell no i bet notsparkman at that time we used what was called coax cable and not the coax cable that weve used in the last  years the loss factors in it were very highmaxwell were they not shielded the samesparkman they were shielded the same just a different configuration that frankly they just didnt have the  the loss was much higher we would actually go into the customers home with what we called a pressure tap wed clamp a device around the cable and screw in a tap it would go in and touch the center conductor youd hook a piece of  and run it into the house it was very simple but it worked wellmaxwell not like todaysparkman as a matter of fact there was a point in time for many years  and this is what i think was one of the things that caused the cable industry to start growing – was that for the first time in the development of an industry the rural areas were getting more television service than the metro areas for a long time as you have lived in the denver area for a long time youll recall there was only three channels in denver period finally an independent then a few more channels came on but you would go to wyoming and they would have channels out of denver channels out of utah and on and on so they had a lot to choose from comparatively speakingmaxwell we called those distance signals in those days one of the things that continually has happened to the cable industry is washington finds us every once in awhile one of those things was the distance signal rules that came in the early s  sparkman early s exactlymaxwell i dont remember for sure but i remember that we had leap frog the rules were arcane and very interestingsparkman yes as a matter of fact it was another move frankly by competition and government to back up just a moment – the cable industry at the time was thought of in washington dc as a bunch of rebels and cowboysmaxwell in bob magness case it was truesparkman it was truemaxwell he was a cowboysparkman but they really kept trying to find ways to stifle us theyd throw a rock on the road and wed either go over it or go around it the broadcast industry which in retrospect if they had thought it through would have owned the cable industry from the getgo they decided to fight it rather than to join it by the fact that they pressured the government into making rules to stifle cable in turn they stifled themselves because of the rules they were unable to own cable in their own cities therefore it left the door open for companies like tci to go in it was a matter of time until public pressure said there will be no more of this controlling signals therefore via microwave we had brought the los angeles signals for example all the way into new mexico all the way into colorado there was a lot of services being moved around it was a matter of being able to deliver the things to the people they wanted to watch – sports movies and so forth it worked out wellmaxwell it changed viewer habits thats for suresparkman certainlymaxwell importation and the moving around of the independent signals especially began the deterioration of the ruling by the networks thats for suresparkman exactly the independent stations the one that really helped us move into the next level of cable was ted turner with tbs out of atlanta when he put that on satellite  theres an interesting story when ted was trying to raise the money to put this on satellite and move it around the nation he was going around making presentations to all of the major msos at the time he came into our office and he had been to several others before he got there and been turned down he started his presentation to us he was into his presentation and we knew what the value of an imported independent and especially an independent with sports on it would be so we were very interested in getting into this with tedmaxwell did he have the braves all the way back thensparkman yes he did he had the braves and the hawksmaxwell but he didnt own them but they had a licensesparkman he had a license for them and a license that he could move anywhere he could take them anywheremaxwell right there was no restrictionsparkman exactly so anyway about half way through his presentation he had himself so worked up as you know ted – he was walking around the room and we were wearing out the swivel in the chairs following him ted says the hell with you ill do it myself then he walked outmaxwell didnt even finish the presentationsparkman didnt even finish he presentation he said the hell with you guys ill do it myself and he didmaxwell and he was rightsparkman and he was right there can be people critical of ted but i think ted a big big factor in helping build the cable television industry then when he gets into cnn i mean maxwell it changed the worldsparkman it changed the worldmaxwell it did of course he followed jerry levin at hbo up on the satellitesparkman yes he didmaxwell you knew he once owned the wrong satellitesparkman im aware of thatmaxwell youre very aware of that im suresparkman im aware of that one yesmaxwell but thats a whole different storysparkman yesmaxwell not for here when hbo came along it changed the dynamics of how you could package and deliver programming i know you remember all the different crazy ideas about pay tv in those dayssparkman yesmaxwell can you talk about some of thosesparkman pay tv was a first of all the most difficult thing was how we were going to control it we could put it on the cable and we could deliver it to all the homes but delivering to the specific homes who were going to pay for became a big technical problem so we developed traps we developed a lot of things but the hbo going on satellite  i think its worth mentioning i think that most people forget that actually chuck dolan was the one who started hbomaxwell yes nobody really forgets thatsparkman frankly i dont know the processes of how it happened to end up as it did with time but hbo was really the beginning of the differential between cable and regular broadcast television very frankly hbo really terrified not only the broadcasters but hollywood so it brought us an entirely new political enemy if you will in the sense that hollywood was afraid that it was going to kill all the theaters it did have some impact im suremaxwell it did it had an impact as it would come to towns on movie ticket sales it actually didsparkman yes it actually did so thats when specific rules started being set up by the producers in hollywood in the sense that they would not release anything to hbo until it had gone through its entire theatrical presentations and so forth and so on even then it was a big big service for us we started launching hbo in  i cant remember the exact year but when we started launching hbo we were launching at least one sometimes three systems a week for the first year we launched i was at every launch it was a killer but it really worked wellmaxwell all those  meter dishes are sparkman yes yesmaxwell i helped put the one in at vero beach with dick jacksonsparkman the first one we put in was in minot north dakota it was the beginning to me of the really legitimacy of cable in the sense of public opinion no one could say that the only thing we survived on was signals we stole from the broadcasters that was used so many times and even one of our past vice presidents and presidential candidates made statements about how the cable industry was stealing it even from the satellite because he forgot that the private industry put up the satellites but anyway that was another issuemaxwell in dealing with customers in those days because up till then you were delivering what people in big cities took as a given – television signals – so people werent against paying or anything but it was always a problem of value versus what youre charging hbo changed those economics radicallysparkman they changed them radically for an example even when hbo became a factor when they started our monthly service fees in montana for example were in the    range we had some systems that were  a month per subscriber clearly it doesnt take an economic genius to figure out that you dont do a lot of work and upgrades on that kind of income when hbo came along we were charging in some cases more for hbo on a per month basis than we were for all the other channelsmaxwell if i remember it started at  and  rightsparkman yes and so subsequently it became a value issue with some of our customers because for example wed have  channels on a system that we were charging  a month for wed bring hbo in and wed want to charge  a month for people would say well how can you charge that much for one channel when we get ten channels for this very frankly as a marketing ploy i started raising the price in some of the plants and id raise the price far enough on the basic service that my hbo penetration would go up because it no longer became a value issuepeople in some cases  i shouldnt say people – i think cities – and for political reasons would continually talk about us charging for signals that were free and they are free if you take them off the airmaxwell if you deliver them to the house sparkman if you cant get them off the air and you have to deliver them to the house then they would never acknowledge the fact that we spent money on the wires and cable and maintenance on the cable and on and on and on it was a political issue more so for the politicians than the peoplemaxwell i think we were all seeing thatsparkman ive been to many many city public hearings on rates and whatever and have one or two people in the room the first thing i always did when i was able to ask the people questions who were testifying i would ask if they were a cable subscriber you would find the majority of the time they werent – the ones who were complaining about the rates – which was rather interestingmaxwell that is interesting thats a very interesting pointone of the things  by the way it was  when the satellite went upsparkman thats rightmaxwell and rolled out that fall the first ones which was a lot of fun actually in those days it was bringing space age to small towns you got a lot of mileage off that kind of positioning but all that time tci was growingsparkman we were growing and through that time and from the time the satellite we started acquiring companies not on the basis that we acquired when we were  after  – which ill get to in a moment but we were acquiring wed fix the ones we would acquire and then when we got that one so that we had it we would go borrow money on that one and go buy another onemaxwell rightsparkman in  at the anaheim cable show that was the first year that there was a lot of programmers who showed upmaxwell right that is the first yearsparkman so john and i had many many meetings at that show and companies that we talking  we were on the way to an investors meeting at about  am to be there at  john said are you seeing what im seeing i said john we got a choice he said we got a choice either we get big or get out so we never went tot he meeting we went back to the hotel checked out came back to denver and had a meeting with bob and presented bob with what we thought bob agreed at that time we had  cable subscribers in round numbers we took off my words to john and bob and donn fisher were if you guys can buy them and finance them i can fix them so we started doubling the size of the company every  months and we did that for several yearsmaxwell the s were when cnn launchedsparkman thats rightmaxwell and thats when mtv launchedsparkman thats rightmaxwell the value proposition for the customers changed toosparkman changed dramatically if you recall mtv launch it was a free service till we got everybody hooked then they started  not we got everybody till they got all the cable operators hooked then they started charging us big time but that was another issue we started buying several companies and getting systems in larger and larger towns then in the s with the satellite issue the early s the franchising frenzy started i will tell you that we at tci applied for most of them we won virtually none because we were somewhat practical in our approach when we would lose we would generally celebrate for losing because some of those franchises people bet the farm onmaxwell i know you also learned a lot about each of the cities while you were scouting themsparkman exactlymaxwell in the years as cable grew and the politicians paid attention here or there and other times i remember in particular an incident that you and bill brazeel actually allowed me to tag along on it turned out to be one of the more infamous events in cables history but cities got into the habit of demanding more and more and more tci wasnt very happy about just going along to get along always can you tell me about the famous turn offsparkman yes youre talking about vailmaxwell rightsparkman yes actually what happened the city of vail demanded certain things in the franchisemaxwell it was up for renewal rightsparkman it was up for renewal but it wasnt quite expired yet but it was up for renewal it was totally impossible economically to work with what they wanted to do so we said we cannot do that so the city council called a city council meeting and without public hearing without any due process cancelled our franchise the lawyers came into my office and said you cant operate that system in the state of colorado without a franchise its against the law so i said fine well take care of that thats when bill brazeel and i and you left for vail this was in midafternoon i had some technicians meet me at the headend actually what we did is  at that time we had a weather scan and we put a card on the weather scan saying if you wonder why your cable system is turned off call the city manager or the major and we put their phone numbers there we putt that on all channels then we shut the system off and it was just ten minutes into the movie bullitt then you and bill and i proceeded to go downtown to have dinner and waitedmaxwell we didnt wait longsparkman we didnt wait long until the mayor came storming into this place looking for usmaxwell i think we had our drinks just served when john dobson camesparkman yes i said to him as you probably recall we cannot operate a cable system without a franchise in the state of colorado until you reissue us a franchise we cant turn the system back on he said im giving you your franchise back i said i dont think you can do that that was on a friday i believe the system was off over the weekend monday they called an emergency council meeting and gave us our franchise back and we turned the system back onmaxwell but they missed a broncos game on that sunday which caused enormous consternation in the vail trail the papersparkman yes yes it was not something that we wanted to do it was something that created problems later with new rules out of the fcc and whatever there was a complete overreaction by a lot of people but no one wanted to listen to the fact of why we couldnt operate in the state of colorado without the proper authority we had no authority to operate there so we had no choice but to shut it offmaxwell we did have a good dinner thoughsparkman it was a good dinnermaxwell thats going into cables lore these days i remember we did a big spread on it in tv  communications magazine the trade journal that i worked for back in those days it was an interesting experience but legally there was simply no question right or wrong the city council yanked the franchisesparkman thats exactly rightmaxwell they thought they were holding that over your headsparkman rightmaxwell it turned out the other way aroundsparkman some people need to think where theyre going sometimes i guess and the other side of it too is that we didnt always do everything right in the cable but that was one where i felt totally right and had no choice  the only system we ever shut off actuallymaxwell its the only one that ever did get shut offsparkman yes yesmaxwell  for reasons like that channels have been yanked before recently even but that was an interesting time i must say that vail wasnt quite as antagonistic after it got back on and you guys did spend some money upgrading theresparkman of course we did we brought some more signals in via microwave because they decided that maybe if we were going to do all those things we should have a rate commensurate with what we were doing so they did that properly then they got everything they wanted as i told them many times when we were trying to get the franchise well do anything you want you just have to pay for itmaxwell an interesting conceptsparkman yes very interesting conceptmaxwell as you were acquiring a lot of companies in those years i remember one that you got from as we fondly called him in golf  devour which was from golf  western charlie bludhorne would go in this direction for awhile and change you picked up a company called athena which you reminded me of the name but that had a great second actsparkman the second act was a big big help to tci actually we paid i dont remember the exact figure but something like    million for the athena properties they had some good properties it turned out to be very good properties later anyway in the archives of that athena had been the owner of some resorts international stock when there was allowed to be casinos built in new jersey resort international ended up with one of the franchise for building a casino in new jersey that stock which was worthless at one time all of a sudden became worth about  million that was a big big big life to tci at a time when we needed the cash it gave us the opportunity to move on down the road and buy some moremaxwell that was a serendipitous piece of acquisition in that casesparkman yes it was – very much somaxwell so in the s you mentioned that tci began almost doubling every  months or so sort of like moores law for cable in those days that must have been an interesting thing to try to assimilate all those different companiessparkman it was devastating sometimes it was a time when frankly i would go many many weeks at a time without a day off because as we would buy these companies we would go in i had what i called a transition team made up of some very very good operating people we would go in and we would do whatever necessary changes to bring them into what we called the tci family fold and tci policies we would move very quickly sometimes we were closing as many as two companies a week therefore it really was a hard time but we were able to accomplish it and frankly we paid anywhere from  –  times the cash flow of the companies buying them through those timesmy job was to make sure that within six months time they looked like we paid under five times cash flow for them we were able to accomplish that with the team i had in every case except one – that was the storer acquisition as you are aware that was a different kind of a structure and frankly it took about  months to get that there but with that we were able to build a base in tci that was very solid a very solid company with solid fuel management we clearly did not have enough people to go into every acquisition and change all the people out generally the only people that left were the top people the other people we were able to convince tem that they would have a better life with us doing it the way we did it we had as youre aware a very very strong happy group of people at tci they worked very hard they built an incredible companymaxwell you did another thing in those years too you created some partnerships with some damn good operators toosparkman yes we didmaxwell this allowed you to jointly control some cost that helped everybody but some very very good cable operators were involved in that one of them that comes to mind is bill bresnansparkman yesmaxwell as you know bill bresnan is a very very dear friend of mine ive had a great deal of respect for bill sparkman hes about to be backmaxwell  i know   since the time when he was running the system in california in palm springs but anyway when bill left american cablevision when they sold out he came to us and we partnered with bill and bill was a good operator it was just a matter of  because bill did it all he did a good job we had a lot of partners in that light when we felt that we were stretched far enough managementwise for awhile till we needed to catch up that we would move into the partnerships to grow it worked out very wellmaxwell it did reallysparkman yesmaxwell some of the companies involved i know were big contributors to the whole culture of the place so when you were still at tci you retired sparkman six years agomaxwell six year ago the bell atlantic you were still there then werent yousparkman yesmaxwell you watched that fall apart that couldnt have been that disappointingsparkman yes and no it was a value issues we felt that it was going to be good value to the stockholders and whatever also looking on down the road we knew the businesses would be coming even more capital intensive because of the things we felt were going to have to be done when we looked at the two cultures and we really figured very quickly that there was just no way that the cultures were going to marry and work we could see it happening that it was just not going to work at first i was excited about it because frankly i was getting tired of running  hours a week thats what my job entailed i felt this might give me some relief but frankly two things happened we felt the cultures were going to be difficult then i think bell atlantic figured out that when the smoke cleared we would be in controlmaxwell i know that the due diligence team took up the entire hyatt across from the offices at that time i thought that was an entertaining thought all by itselfsparkman yes it was it was quite a time quite a timemaxwell you were gone though by the time att not fully gone sparkman i was still on the board i was involved to some degree on the board i was there when the att thing was going onmaxwell so were those cultures that different that you didnt think that would not worksparkman well i anticipated some problemsmaxwell i think everyone wouldsparkman  in putting together the cultures and there have been some problems i think like i discussed with you ive had people talk to me and really searching and digging for me to be uncomplimentary or critical of attmaxwell it doesnt make sensesparkman it makes no sense because frankly i look back on it going back as weve talked to this interview i started at tci when there was  cable subscribers i grew up with it so yes i had control of it and as you know i had very good control of it but i knew where everything wasmaxwell i think you hid half of itsparkman the complexity of it was something that didnt bother me because i didnt pay any attention to the complexity of it it is a very complex hared thing to run its not something that you turn the page and someone who it totally unfamiliar with it comes in and is able o pick up the ball and run with it that well it takes time it takes time and unfortunately as time goes on a lot of money gets spentmaxwell yes it does after you left tci though and it became part of att you got really bored sitting around i know well so what have you been up to in the last few yearssparkman i serve on several boards in cable as well as manufacturing programming i started a couple of small companies sold them about   years ago the company that my son was with became for sale we put together a group and bought that company so now im  then we bought a couple more companies here in the us and bought a company in the uk and are looking at some more companies in europe and so on i guess im back in the throe if you will and im not running  –  hours a week do not intend to but its a lot of fun im an avid golfer i play a lot of golf golf is not the only thing i like to do i enjoy building companies im enjoying what were in now as everybodys aware the economic structure of todays world is a tough one whether youre in the us or europe or asia or wherever you might be but ive always looked at bad economic times as times of opportunity and im finding that to be truemaxwell its hard to get cable out of your blood isnt itsparkman it certainly is you know i miss the family at tci the people we had some real real good timesmaxwell well we all miss bob magnesssparkman bob magness you know had got to be the  if there was a guy who was going to be king bob magness would be king he was a man who  if you didnt like bob magness you couldnt like yourself the guy was just an incredible man  to put it bluntly put up with one hell of a lot of mistakes from me – and never raised his voice he was just a great guymaxwell thats a good way to end the interviewsparkman thank youmaxwell thank you cable
