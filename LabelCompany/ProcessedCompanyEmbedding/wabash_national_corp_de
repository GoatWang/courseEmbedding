wabash national corporation take a postearnings dip newsfeedbackfoolcom tyler crowe jul   updated jul   what happenedshares of trucktrailer manufacturer wabash national corporation nyse wnc are down  as of  pm edt today the reason for todays decline is tied to the companys earnings which wabash reported after the close yesterdayso what  as is the case with any significant postearnings price move todays plunge relates to missing expectations the companys revenue of  million and pershare earnings of  both missed expectations those results were also well below wabashs results from the same quarter last year to add insult to injury management narrowed its  earnings guidance from  to  per share to  to  per share  image source getty imagesbacking out the lens though this market reaction seems a bit overdone to compare these results to the prioryears results and say that this one was a failure seems a bit shortsighted when you consider that q  was the best quarter in the companys historyalso fiscal firstquarter results were weaker than these but wall street decided to pump up shares by  after the priorquarters results whats more wabashs management also revised its guidance for trailers shipped this quarter to  to  yet when the company announces that it has slightly better results and narrows its earnings guidance it merits an  dropnow what this stockprice drop doesnt seem to coincide with whats going on at wabash national right now perhaps the trucktrailer market has hit a high point and the companys sales will deteriorate from here if thats the case then wall street would have a reason to sell off this stock looking at wabashs results though it seems that the trailer market is in okay shape for at least the rest of the year and tank trailers could see a nice boost as the petrochemical manufacturing boom hits the gulf coastalso the company seems to be in a great financial position to keep its share repurchases going for a while as well as fund its dividend to shareholders for those invested in wabash at the moment yesterdays earnings and todays stockprice reaction are hardly enough to change the investment thesis  stocks we like better than wabash

the trailer manufacturer neha chamaria nehams jun   at am what happened wabash national corp nysewnc stock was holding up well this year until it broke its winning streak last month and gave up all of its gains from april wabash ended may down  its worst month so far in   so what interestingly there was no news from wabashs end in may the last big announcement that the trailer manufacturer made was its firstquarter earnings release in the last week of april which sent the stock soaring and for good reasons wabashs q sales and earnings were down substantially from the yearago quarter which wasnt surprising given the sluggishness in the energy and chemical markets both of which are critical markets for the company wabash is north americas leading manufacturer of liquid transportation systems image source getty images two factors appear to have gotten the market excited wabash beat earnings estimates and raised its fullyear shipment as well as earnings per share outlook albeit only marginally by around  each nonetheless wabash reported operating income of  million  its secondbest q ever on that metric  and grew its free cash flow by  that second number was particularly noteworthy as the company had just reinstated its dividend last december after a hiatus of six years furthermore wabashs backlog also improved  sequentially to  million as at the end of the first quarter reflecting an improvement in demand for trailers backed by stronger freight fundamentals now what endmarket demand is nowhere close to where it was in  and  but wabash is striving hard to boost margins by deleveraging and cutting costs while it waits for demand to improve that is why management is confident of returning  to its historic gross margin norms in the range of  to  by the latter half of the year for perspective wabashs gross profit margin in  q was just around  i believe the drop in wabashs shares in may was simply a case of profit booking for longterm investors though this could just be the opportunity youve waiting for wabash boasts an incredible customer list that includes top trucking companies like fedex j b hunt and navistar international consumer companies like nestle and oil majors like bp to name a few also wabash serves several industries beyond its key chemical and energy clientele among them pharma food and consumer its only a matter of time before these industries start spending more and drive wabash back onto the growth track with its stock trading at less than  times trailing earnings you may well want to hop on wabash before the cycle turns

trailers is proving effective in boosting margins and offsetting the cyclical nature of the business tyler crowe tmfdirtybird apr   at am the market reacted rather favorably when wabash national nysewnc released its earnings and updated guidance for  much of that optimism can be attributed to managements efforts over the past several years to transform wabash from a cyclical manufacturer of a low margin product to a diversified manufacturer of transportation products that can handle the ups and downs of the market lets take a look at wabashs most recent results to see why this past quarter was another step in the right direction as well as what investors can expect from wabash in the coming quarters image source getty images by the numbers resultsq q q  revenue      operating income       eps       free cash flow      in millions except pershare data source wabash national earnings release like all earnings releases there are some good and bad points worth hashing over one thing that stands out as less than desirable is the decline in sales in the past quarter this was expected though as managements guidance for  was  trailers shipped in   down from s total sales of  trailers in fact sales for the quarter were better than expected as management was able to raise its trailer shipment guidance to  for the year  one thing that is worth celebrating is that the company appears on track to meet its product diversification goal a few years back wabash put a strategic plan out to  to improve profitability and returns on invested capital across the business one way it chose to do that was to diversify its product offerings in   of its revenue came from dry van trailer sales  these trailers are the ones towed by wheelers you see on the road in  that number had declined to  these diversified product offerings have higher margins and have helped drive bottom line results over the past few years nondry van trailer sales for the first quarter were a little weaker than expected management mostly attributed that to softness in the chemical and energy segments its true that the chemical manufacturing and energy industries havent been knocking it out of the park as of late but they are certainly two segments doing much better than a year ago it will be worth watching to see if its nondry van sales continue to struggle as these two industries are on the mend  one thing that stands out is wabashs free cash flow for the quarter which was up  despite earnings declining a large part of that was because of a  million drawdown of working capital that said free cash flow even after adjusting for the working capital changes was enough to pay dividends and buy back stock management expects it will be able to keep its dividends and buybacks going for a while now that it has drastically reduced its total debt load over the past few years wnc total long term debt quarterly data by ycharts from the mouth of management ceo dick giromini on the companys results for the quarter and his expectations for the rest of the year performance targets in cost management and execution were achieved within both commercial trailer products and diversified products as gross margins delivered were consistent with expectations previously communicated despite trailer shipments slightly below prior guidance due strictly to timing of customer pickup backlog grew once again coming in at a seasonally and historically strong  million continuing to support our longstanding belief that trailer fleet age regulatory compliance requirements and customer profitability provide strong support for a continued favorable demand environment additionally we remain focused on driving further productivity improvements throughout the business optimizing the cost structure and performance of our diversified products segment and developing growth opportunities through new product and market expansion efforts second takeaway manufacturing tractor trailers and other truckingrelated products is very much a cyclical business the past year or two have been some of the better years as customers have had to replace aging fleets of trailers and make up for underinvestments from the financial crisis based on the decline in orders as of late it would appear that we are either at the top of the cycle or are headed back down again luckily for wabash national investors the company has diversified its product offerings improved operating margins and strengthened its balance sheet since the last downturn these should help it weather a market downturn if we are indeed headed that way or it could mean wabash is poised to generate strong results as the market plateaus either way wabash national looks to be in much better shape than in years past and is worth putting on ones radar tyler crowe has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned the motley fool has a
