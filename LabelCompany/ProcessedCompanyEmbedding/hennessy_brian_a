needed to throw at it he called all his ecomcontentproducing friends and found out most everybody was still working in clunky spreadsheets just like thread was so brian enlisted some technical help

story straight skip to content we’re seeking oregon’s best and brightest startups and entrepreneurs » make a nomination for our  tom holce awards oregon entrepreneurs network rising starsrising star brian hennessy of talkoot wants to help consumer brands keep their story straight brian hennessy founder of talkoot stories come in all shapes and sizes all of us have our own life stories and then we have the smaller stories that comprise our daytoday similarly consumer product companies are constantly communicating stories to their customers—from big brand stories to smaller stories about the evolution of a single product but brian hennessy a recent graduate of the  gorge oen bootcamp thinks that most of these companies could be doing a better job he doesn’t want to just tell a company’s stories he wants to make those stories sing—preferably in harmony his software tool talkoot aims to do just that here’s more from brian the spark that inspired the birth of talkoot i’ve had the idea for a long time but it only came together recently i was the head writer at adidas for six years and came to understand how storytelling needed to stay consistent throughout an organization from a company’s brand to its product categories to its collections to its individual products and technologies my team was writing our part other agencies were writing their parts and it all came together at the last minute in the end we’d have five different campaigns each telling its own story nothing was syncing up even when everyone was doing great work it usually came across sounding schizophrenic and disjointed to the end consumer i’m constantly learning things i didn’t know i didn’t know” tweet this what talkoot does and how it works talkoot is a collaborative cloudbased writing tool that helps agencies and writing teams within large consumer brands write edit translate and approve copy quickly and at scale in other words it’s a tool that can help brands create seamless omnichannel stories for their customers with talkoot you can make sure every ecommerce description tweet facebook post banner ad and retail headline are singing from the same brandrelevant legalchecked songbook what differentiates you from your competition the behemoths like ibm citrix and microsoft all offer content management systems but they are so complicated and difficult to use no one actually writes in them most of the leading consumer brands we talked to in our market validation interviews wrote their copy in ms word or excel then cut and pasted it into these types of systems talkoot doesn’t replace those big grey enterprisewide systems it provides a highfunctioning humanfriendly front end that makes it easier and faster to feed those systems the kinds of great stories that sell products how you came up with the name “talkoot” is a finnish word that means a gathering of friends and neighbors for a common purpose the biggest surprise in your entrepreneurial experience to date i’m surprised every single day i’ve been running thread my own content marketing agency for a while now and i got very good at it launching a tech company however is very different i’m constantly learning things i didn’t know i didn’t know the world is constantly resetting for me and i always feel like i’m walking into the unknown it’s unnerving at times but it can be an amazing experience if you keep the right perspective the best thing about being an entrepreneur not having to feed the crazy in the past i’ve taken on work—both freelance projects and full time positions—that paid well but i wasn’t really inspired by now the hours are long and the future is less certain but i get to show up everyday to a job i love and work on projects i believe in with people i really like being around the biggest challenge managing expectations i have to be vigilant about keeping talkoot simple my employees at thread who are piloting talkoot have so many great ideas but if we try to solve too many problems the tool will become unwieldy next big milestone clients we’ll be piloting the system with adidas but we need a few more clients to test drive the software benefits of starting a business in
