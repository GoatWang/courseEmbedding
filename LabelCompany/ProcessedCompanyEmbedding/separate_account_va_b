benefit this rider is available during the accumulation phase but it will not be issued if the annuitant is younger than  or older than  the maximum issue age may be lower if required by state law   the  for life with growth rider may vary for certain policies and may not be available for all policies please contact transamerica at   for additional information regarding the availability of the  for life with growth rider   this supplement hereby amends and to the extent inconsistent replaces the prospectus disclosure   fee table   optional rider fees       for life with growth rider with additional death benefit            for life with growth rider without additional death benefit            the fee is a percentage of the total withdrawal base    for life with growth benefit   this benefit is intended to provide an accumulating withdrawal base during the growth period and then provide a level of cash withdrawals regardless of the performance of the variable investment options you select if you elect this benefit we will provide a maximum annual withdrawal amount regardless of your policy value while the annuitant is living your ability to change the frequency or amount of your withdrawal ceases if your policy value reaches zero under this benefit you can withdraw up to  of the total withdrawal base each calendar year that the annuitant is living unless your total withdrawal base is reduced to zero because of “excess” withdrawals see “total withdrawal base adjustments” below   this prospectus supplement must be accompanied or preceded by the prospectus for the transamerica landmark variable annuity dated may   example assume you are the owner and annuitant and you make a single premium payment of  when you are  years old further assume that you do not make any additional withdrawals or premium payments but that after five years your policy value has declined to  solely because of negative investment performance at that time you could still withdraw up to each calendar year for the rest of your life assuming that you do not withdraw more than  in any one year   of course you can always withdraw an amount up to your cash value pursuant to your rights under the policy at your discretion please note the amount of your gross partial withdrawal may impact the maximum annual withdrawal amount total withdrawal base and minimum remaining withdrawal amount and such impact may be on a greater than dollarfordollar basis   like all withdrawals withdrawals under this benefit also   •   reduce your policy value   •   reduce your base policy death benefit and other benefits   •   may be subject to surrender charges and excess interest adjustments   •   may be subject to income taxes and federal tax penalties and   •   may be limited or restricted under certain qualified policies   rider issue requirements the company will not issue the  for life with growth rider unless   •   the annuitant is at least  and not yet age    •   the annuitant is also an owner except in the case of nonnatural owners and   •   there are no more than two owners   maximum annual withdrawal amount you can withdraw up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount in any calendar year without causing an excess withdrawal see total withdrawal base adjustments and minimum remaining withdrawal adjustments below   •   the maximum annual withdrawal amount in the year the rider is elected is equal to  of the total withdrawal base prorated based on the number of days from the rider date to the end of the calendar year thereafter the maximum annual withdrawal amount for each calendar year is equal to  of the total withdrawal base   •   please note the maximum annual withdrawal amount described above is based on calendar years not rider or policy years   for qualified policies   if the annuitant is at least  ½ years old the maximum annual withdrawal amount for that calendar year and each subsequent calendar year is equal to the greater of   •   the maximum annual withdrawal amount described above or   •   an amount equal to a minimum required distribution amount calculated using only  the living annuitant’s age  the irs uniform lifetime table or if applicable the joint life and survivor expectancy table  the policy value of the base policy including the present value of any additional benefits provided under the policy to the extent required to be taken into account under irs guidance and  amounts from the current calendar year no carryover from past years an amount not calculated as set forth above cannot be used as the maximum

features benefits and guarantees except those provided by this rider are terminated in order to continue withdrawals guaranteed by this rider after your policy value reaches zero you must select the frequency of future withdrawals once selected the amount and frequency of future withdrawals after your policy value reaches zero cannot be changed   growth period the growth period begins on the rider date and ends at the earlier of the first withdrawal or the tenth rider anniversary   total withdrawal base we use the total withdrawal base to calculate the maximum annual withdrawal amount the total withdrawal base on the rider date is the policy value less any premium enhancement if the rider is added in the first policy year   the total withdrawal base during the growth period is equal to   •   the total withdrawal base on the rider date plus   •   premiums added during the growth period   •   accumulated at an annual effective rate of             the accumulation stops at the end of the growth period   the total withdrawal base after the growth period is equal to   •   the total withdrawal base at the end of the growth period plus   •   any premiums added after the growth period less   •   any adjustments for withdrawals as described under “total withdrawal base adjustments” below including the withdrawal if any which ended the growth period   total withdrawal base adjustments gross partial withdrawals up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount will not reduce the total withdrawal base gross partial withdrawals in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount “excess withdrawals” will reduce the total withdrawal base by the greater of the dollar amount of the withdrawal or on a pro rata basis possibly to zero see the sai for examples showing the effect of hypothetical withdrawals in more detail excess withdrawals may eliminate the guarantee offered by this rider   please note   •   upon the death of the annuitant the  for life with growth rider terminates and no additional guaranteed withdrawals exist   •   since the total withdrawal base of the rider is generally equal to the policy value on the rider date the maximum annual withdrawal amount may decrease if the policy value decreases prior to the rider date   additional death benefit available with the  for life with growth benefit   if you elect the  for life with growth benefit you can also elect for us to add an additional amount to the death benefit payable under the base policy upon the death of the annuitant the additional amount will be equal to the excess if any of the minimum remaining withdrawal amount over the base policy death benefit    minimum remaining withdrawal amount the minimum remaining withdrawal amount on the rider date is the policy value less any

date plus   •   subsequent premium payments less   •   adjustments for withdrawals as described under “minimum remaining withdrawal amount adjustments” below   minimum remaining withdrawal amount adjustments gross partial withdrawals up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount will reduce the minimum remaining withdrawal amount on a dollarfordollar basis gross partial withdrawals in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount will reduce the minimum remaining withdrawal amount by the greater of the dollar amount of the withdrawal or on a pro rata basis possibly to zero see the sai for examples showing the effect of hypothetical withdrawals in more detail excess withdrawals may eliminate the additional death benefit available with the  for life with growth rider   please note   •   if an owner who is not the annuitant dies and the surviving spouse continues the policy no additional amount is payable if the policy is not continued the surviving owner may elect to annuitize the maximum annual withdrawal amount instead of receiving the cash value if such an election is made the policy is terminated and the cash value is forfeited   •   the minimum remaining withdrawal amount and policy value do not accumulate    for life with growth rider fee a rider fee        of the total withdrawal base on each rider anniversary if you do not elect the additional death benefit and        of the total withdrawal base on each rider anniversary if you do elect the additional death benefit is charged annually prior to annuitization we will also deduct the rider fee pro rata upon full surrender of the policy or other termination of the rider once we have received all necessary regulatory approvals the rider fee is deducted from each investment choice in proportion to the

required allocations any transfer requests to and from the select investment options and flexible investment options will be validated using the prior market day’s policy value to ensure compliance with the required allocations for rebalancing at the time of the request transfer requests that do not comply with the required allocations for rebalancing will be deemed not in good order changes in

prospectus you may elect one of the following optional riders under the policy that offers guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits the retirement income max ® rider or the transamerica income edge rider important aspects of each of these riders are summarized in the “appendix – guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit comparison table” and are described in more detail below you should consult with tax and financial professionals to determine which of these riders if any is appropriate for you the following is added to the additional features section of the prospectus transamerica income edge rider   if you elect the transamerica income edge rider identified below which provides certain guaranteed benefits the company requires a certain percentage of your policy value to be allocated to the stable account and to select investment options with the remainder to be allocated to the select investment options and flexible investment options one or more of the select investment options and flexible investment options may include a volatility control strategy volatility control strategies in periods of high market volatility could limit your participation in market gains this may conflict with your investment objectives by limiting your ability to maximize potential growth of your policy value and in turn the value of any guaranteed benefit that is tied to investment performance volatility control strategies are intended to help limit overall volatility and reduce the effects of significant market downturns during periods of high market volatility providing policy owners with the opportunity for smoother performance and better risk adjusted returns volatility control and similar terms can encompass a variety of investment strategies of different types and degrees therefore you should read the applicable annuity and underlying fund portfolio prospectuses carefully to understand how these investment strategies may affect your policy value and rider benefits the company’s requirement to invest in accordance with the required allocations which may include volatility control strategies may reduce our costs and risks associated with this rider you pay an additional fee for the rider benefits which in part pay for protecting the rider benefit base from investment losses since the rider benefit base does not decrease as a result of investment losses volatility control strategies might not provide a meaningful additional benefit to you you should carefully evaluate with your financial advisor whether to allocate to subaccounts that invest in underlying funds with volatility control strategies taking into consideration the potential positive or negative impact that such strategy may have on your investment objectives your policy value and the benefits under the transamerica income edge rider if you determine that underlying funds with volatility control strategies are not consistent with your investment objectives there continue to be other investment options available under the transamerica income edge rider that do not invest in underlying funds that utilize volatility control strategies    transamerica income edge  summary you may elect to purchase the optional transamerica income edge rider which provides you with  a glwb and  an opportunity for increases in the rider withdrawal amount this rider is available during the accumulation phase and requires that you allocate a certain percentage of your policy value to the stable account and to select investment options and flexible investment options some of which are designed to help manage our risk and support the guarantees under the rider if you elect the transamerica income edge rider you cannot elect another glwb the tax rules for qualified policies may limit the value of this rider please consult a qualified tax adviser before electing the transamerica income edge rider for a qualified policy please note this rider may not be issued or added to inherited iras sometimes also referred to as beneficiary iras or a nonqualified annuity under which death benefits are being distributed under a stretch withdrawal option the benefits under the transamerica income edge rider are based on our claimspaying ability under the transamerica income edge rider you can receive up to the rider withdrawal amount each rider year first as withdrawals from the policy value excluding the stable account until other investment options are depleted of value and if necessary because your policy value goes to zero by other than an excess withdrawal as payments from us starting with the rider year immediately following the annuitant’s or the annuitant’s spouse if younger and the joint life option is elected attainment of the minimum benefit age as provided in your rider and lasting until the annuitant’s or the annuitant’s spouse if the joint life option is elected death unless your withdrawal base is reduced to zero because of an “excess withdrawal” see withdrawal base adjustments section below a rider year begins on the rider date the date the rider becomes effective and thereafter on each anniversary of that date the withdrawal percentage that is used to determine your rider withdrawal amount and required allocations will be disclosed in a rate sheet prospectus supplement included with your prospectus which may be amended from time to time by us all rate sheet prospectus supplements are also available on the edgar system at wwwsecgov file  for tlic and  for tflic of course you can always withdraw an amount up to your cash value pursuant to your rights under the policy although withdrawals that are excess withdrawals will reduce your withdrawal base and future glwbs see “appendix – hypothetical adjusted partial surrenders – guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit riders” for examples showing the effect of hypothetical withdrawals in more detail if you elect the transamerica income edge rider a certain percentage of your policy value on the rider date must be allocated to the stable account the select investment options and the flexible investment options as specified in the applicable rate sheet prospectus supplement transfers to and from the stable account are not permitted withdrawals from the stable account are not permitted until all other investment options are depleted of value withdrawals from the flexible investment options and select investment options will be deducted on a prorata basis if you do not wish to maintain the required allocation percentages for the investment options the rider must be terminated subject to the termination restrictions and requirements of the rider prior to making any transfer additional detail regarding the required allocations is provided in the required allocations section below please note     •   you will begin paying the rider charge as of the rider date even if you do not begin taking withdrawals for many years we will not refund the charges you have paid under the rider if you never choose to take withdrawals andor if you never receive any payments under the rider     •   we have designed this rider to allow for withdrawals from your policy value each rider year that are less than or equal to the rider withdrawal amount you should not purchase this rider if you plan to take withdrawals in excess of the rider withdrawal amount because such excess withdrawals may significantly reduce or eliminate the value of the guarantees provided by the rider     •   the longer you wait to start making withdrawals under the benefit the less time you have to benefit from the guarantee because of decreasing life expectancy as you age on the other hand the longer you wait to begin making withdrawals the higher your withdrawal percentage may be and the more opportunities you will have to lock in a higher withdrawal base you should carefully consider when to begin making withdrawals there is a risk that you will not begin making withdrawals at the most financially beneficial time for you     •   because the glwb under this rider is accessed through regular withdrawals that do not exceed the rider withdrawal amount the rider may not be appropriate for you if you do not foresee a need for liquidity and your primary objective is to take maximum advantage of the tax deferral aspect of the policy     •   all policy value must be allocated to the select and flexible investment options and the stable account subject to specified allocation percentages as provided in the rate sheet prospectus supplement you should consult with your financial advisor to assist you in determining whether these investment options and required allocations are suited for your financial needs and risk tolerance     •   any amount of withdrawals in any rider year that are in excess of the rider withdrawal amount are excess withdrawals      •   an excess withdrawal may impact the withdrawal base on a greater than dollarfordollar basis and may eliminate the benefit see “appendix – hypothetical adjusted partial surrenders – guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit riders”     •   upon receiving due proof of death of the annuitant or the death of the surviving spouse if the joint option is elected the transamerica income edge rider terminates and all benefits thereunder cease     •   you may terminate the rider by providing written notice to us requesting termination during the  days following the fifth rider anniversary or every fifth rider anniversary thereafter see termination section below     •   if your policy value reaches zero the company may require satisfactory evidence a person is alive if a payment is based on that person being alive a notarized letter may be provided as satisfactory evidence a person is living like all

life option is elected has attained the minimum benefit age on the first day of the rider year after the annuitant or the annuitant’s spouse if younger and the joint life option is elected has attained the minimum benefit age the rider withdrawal amount is equal to the withdrawal base multiplied by the withdrawal percentage see applicable rate sheet prospectus supplement for additional information surrender charges may apply if your rider withdrawal amount exceeds your surrender charge free amount for qualified policies if the plan participant generally the annuitant is at least  ⁄ years old the rider withdrawal amount for that rider year and each subsequent rider year is equal to the greater of     •   the rider withdrawal amount described above or     •   an amount equal to the minimum required distribution amount if any the minimum required distribution is calculated based on the rules established by the irs the minimum required distribution may only be used if all of

not start prior to the annuitant’s attained age       c the minimum required distributions are based on either the uniform lifetime table or the joint life and last survivor expectancy table     d the minimum required distributions are based on age of the living annuitant the minimum required distributions cannot be based on the age of someone who is deceased     e the minimum required distributions are based only on the policy to which this rider is attached and     f the minimum required distributions are only for the current rider year amounts carried over from past rider years are not considered     g if any of the above are not true then the minimum required distribution is equal to zero and it is not available as a rider withdrawal amount only amounts calculated as set forth above can be used as the rider withdrawal amount if your policy value reaches zero     •   due to a nonexcess withdrawal then you cannot make premium payments and all other policy features benefits and guarantees except those provided by this rider are terminated in addition we will unless instructed otherwise make payments using the current payment instructions on file with us equal to the rider withdrawal amount divided by the frequency of payments if the younger of the annuitant or annuitant’s spouse has attained the minimum benefit age and a systematic payout option is not active at the time the policy value equals zero a monthly payment will begin if the minimum benefit age has not been attained the monthly payment will begin on the rider anniversary following the attainment of the minimum benefit age once the payment amount and frequency are established they cannot be changed and no additional withdrawals will be allowed furthermore any remaining minimum required cash value will be paid on the later of the annuitant’s or annuitant’s spouse’s death      •   due to an excess withdrawal then your policy will terminate resulting in the termination of this rider an excess withdrawal that does not cause your policy value to equal zero will not terminate the rider please note     •   if the rider is added prior to the annuitant or the annuitant’s spouse if younger and the joint life option is elected having attained the minimum benefit age the rider withdrawal amount will be zero until the beginning of the rider year after the annuitant or the annuitant’s spouse if younger and the joint life option is elected has attained the minimum benefit age birthday however you will still be charged a rider fee prior to this time     •   you cannot carry over any portion of your rider withdrawal amount that is not withdrawn during a rider year for withdrawal in a future rider year this means that if you do not take the entire rider withdrawal amount during a rider year you cannot take more than the rider withdrawal amount in the next rider year and maintain the rider’s guarantees     •   excess withdrawals may cause you to lose the benefit of the rider     •   the select and flexible investment options may be changed by us in the future for policy owners that have not yet elected the rider existing policy owners will not be affected transamerica income edge – withdrawal percentage withdrawal percentage we use the withdrawal percentage to calculate the rider withdrawal amount the withdrawal percentage is determined by the annuitant’s age or the annuitant’s spouse’s age if younger and the joint life option is elected and the rider duration at the time of the first withdrawal taken on or after the rider anniversary immediately following the annuitant or the annuitant’s spouse if younger and the joint life option is elected having attained the minimum benefit age the withdrawal percentage is disclosed in the applicable rate sheet prospectus supplement unless the applicable rate sheet prospectus supplement provides otherwise in order for you to receive the withdrawal percentage reflected in a rate sheet prospectus supplement     •   your application must be signed within the time period disclosed in the rate sheet prospectus supplement     •   we must receive your completed application within  calendar days from the date that the rate sheet prospectus supplement is no longer effective and     •   the policy must be funded within  calendar days from the date that the rate sheet prospectus supplement is no longer effective if any of these conditions are not met your application will be considered not in good order for the current rate sheet prospectus supplement if you decide to proceed with the purchase of

effective period that does not include the date you signed your application will not apply to your policy you should not purchase this rider without first obtaining the applicable rate sheet prospectus supplement you can contact us at wwwtransamericacom to receive a rate sheet prospectus supplement applicable to you please note once established the withdrawal percentage will not generally increase even though the annuitant’s age increases except in certain instances involving automatic stepups see automatic stepup section below and applicable rate sheet prospectus supplement all rate sheet prospectus supplements are also available on the edgar system at wwwsecgov file  for tlic and  for tflic transamerica income edge – withdrawal base withdrawal base we use the withdrawal base to calculate the rider withdrawal amount the withdrawal base on the rider date is the policy value during any rider year the withdrawal base is equal to the withdrawal base on the rider date or most recent rider anniversary plus subsequent premium payments less subsequent withdrawal base adjustments due to excess withdrawals please note     •   we determine the withdrawal base solely to calculate the rider withdrawal amount and rider fee     •   your withdrawal base is not a cash value a surrender value or a death benefit it is not available for withdrawal it is not a minimum return for any subaccount and it is not a guarantee of policy value    on each rider anniversary the withdrawal base will equal the greater of     •   the current withdrawal base and     •   the policy value on the current rider anniversary see automatic stepup below see “appendix – hypothetical example of withdrawal base calculation – transamerica income edge rider” which illustrates the hypothetical example of the withdrawal base calculation transamerica income edge – automatic stepup automatic stepup on each rider anniversary the rider will receive an automatic stepup if the withdrawal base is equal to the policy value on the rider anniversary immediately after the withdrawal base reset on the rider anniversary if the policy value is not greater than the current withdrawal base then no automatic stepup will occur the withdrawal percentage as indicated in the rate sheet prospectus supplement will also increase if you have crossed into another age band or rider year duration prior to the automatic stepup please note the increase is part of the automatic stepup and if no automatic stepup occurs then there will be no withdrawal percentage increase on each rider anniversary the rider fee percentage may increase or decrease at the time of any automatic stepup the rider fee percentage will not exceed the maximum rider fee percentage in effect when you purchased the rider automatic stepup opt out each time an automatic stepup results in a rider fee percentage increase you have the option to reject the automatic stepup and reinstate the withdrawal base withdrawal percentage and rider fee percentage to their respective amounts immediately before the automatic stepup provided that you do so within  days after the rider anniversary on which the automatic stepup occurred changes as a result of the automatic stepup feature will be reversed we must receive your rejection each time you elect to opt out in good order at our administrative office within the same  day period after the rider anniversary on which the automatic stepup occurred opting out of one stepup does not operate as an optout of any future stepups transamerica income edge – withdrawal base adjustments withdrawal base adjustments cumulative gross partial withdrawals up to the rider withdrawal amount in any rider year will not reduce the withdrawal base any amount of gross partial withdrawals in excess of the rider withdrawal amount in any rider year “excess withdrawals” will reduce the withdrawal base however by the greater of the dollar amount of the excess withdrawal if the policy value is greater than the withdrawal base or a pro rata amount in proportion to the reduction in the policy value when the policy value is less than the withdrawal base possibly to zero if an excess withdrawal reduces the policy value to zero this rider will terminate withdrawal base adjustments occur immediately following excess withdrawals see “appendix  hypothetical adjusted partial surrenders  guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit riders” for examples showing the effect of hypothetical withdrawals in more detail including an excess withdrawal that reduces the withdrawal base by a pro rata amount the effect of an excess withdrawal is magnified if the policy value is less than the withdrawal base please note you retain all responsibility for monitoring for excess withdrawals if you take regular or scheduled withdrawals please pay particular attention to any excess withdrawal because your regular or scheduled nonexcess withdrawals may thereafter become excess withdrawals that reduce or eliminate your benefit on an accelerated basis example assume you are the owner and annuitant and you make a single premium payment of  when you are  years old further assume that you do not make any withdrawals or subsequent premium payments no automatic stepups occurred but that after six years your policy value has declined to  solely because of negative investment performance you could receive up to  each rider year for the rest of your life based on an assumed withdrawal percentage of  for the single life option multiplied by an assumed withdrawal base of  and assuming that     •   you take your first withdrawal when you are age      •   you do not withdraw more than the rider withdrawal amount in any one year and     •   there are no future automatic stepups example continued

during the  days following the fifth rider anniversary or any fifth rider anniversary thereafter enrollment in dollar cost averaging is not available while this rider is in effect the stable account the stable account is a fixed account option under your policy premium payments allocated and amounts transferred to the stable account become part of our general account interests in the general account have not been registered under the securities act of  the “ act” nor is the general account registered as an investment company under the  act accordingly neither the general account nor any interests therein are generally subject to the provisions of the  or  acts disclosures relating to interests in the general account are however subject to certain generally applicable provisions of

one year in our sole discretion you bear the risk that we will not credit interest greater than the guaranteed minimum withdrawals surrenders or transfers upon termination from the stable account will not be subject to an excess interest adjustment upon termination of the rider all amounts in the stable account will be transferred to the money market subaccount available under your policy and no additional premium payments will be allowed into the stable account owners are permitted to provide instructions as to the allocation of the stable account proceeds contained in the money market subaccount to one or more subaccounts but such instructions will not be effective prior to the market day after rider termination we guarantee that upon full surrender your cash value attributable to

subaccounts designated as flexible investment options and select investment options appears in the “appendix – transamerica income edge  investment options” you will be notified if there are changes made to the investment options within the designated groups requiring that you allocate a certain percentage of your premium payments and policy value to the designated investment options some of which invest in underlying funds that employ strategies that are intended to reduce the risk of loss andor manage volatility may reduce investment returns and may reduce the likelihood that we will be required to use our own assets to pay amounts due under this benefit rebalancing while this rider is effective quarterly rebalancing is required and will take place at the end of each rider quarter on the same date your rider fee is deducted if the day rebalancing takes place is not a market day the value of the accumulation units redeemed or purchased due to rebalancing will be determined as of the next market day we will automatically transfer amounts among subaccounts according to the most recent rebalancing allocation instructions on file that comply with the required allocations for rebalancing on the rider date your rebalancing allocation instructions will be established using a ratio of your current investment allocation instructions for new premium payments because the stable account is not included in the quarterly rebalancing process and whole percentages are required it may be necessary for the company to make adjustments positive or negative to the calculated rebalance allocation percentages to accommodate for rounding to the nearest whole percent adjustments needed will be applied to the select investment options and flexible investment options individually to ensure the requirements for each designated group are met any adjustments will first be made to the select or flexible investment option with the greatest allocation if more than one select or flexible investment option has the greatest percentage allocation the adjustment will be divided equally among those select andor flexible investment options with the greatest allocation if the adjustment cannot be divided equally we will make adjustments in alphabetical order to the select or flexible investment options with the greatest percentage allocation you will be notified in writing of the calculated rebalance allocation percentages prior to the first quarter rebalancing you will be notified in writing at rider issue that the required rebalance has been set up you may request changes to your rebalancing allocation instructions before the prior instructions are implemented while this rider remains effective as long as they comply with the required allocations for rebalancing and we receive notice of your request in good order prior to close of the nyse on the day the rebalancing is processed rebalancing will not cease upon the request of any transfer see “appendix – transamerica income edge – rebalancing examples” which illustrates the initial calculation of rebalancing allocation percentages as well as the rebalancing process please note     •   if you do not wish to maintain the required allocations the rider must be terminated subject to the rider termination restrictions and requirements prior to making any transfer see transamerica income edge rider – termination below     •   we can change the list of designated flexible and select investment groups at any time for policy owners that have not yet elected the rider existing policy owners will not be affected     •   if an underlying fund portfolio informs us that a portfolio will be liquidated or reorganized we can eliminate the corresponding select or flexible investment option if this occurs you will be required to reallocate values in the affected investment option to other flexible and select investment options in order to meet the allocation requirements we will provide notice to you if a select or flexible investment option will be eliminated and reallocation is required if you do not provide us with new instructions in the time specified in our notice we will move your money in the affected option to the ta aegon government money market transamerica income edge – joint life option if you elect the transamerica income edge rider then you can also elect to postpone termination of the rider until the later of the annuitant’s or annuitant’s spouse’s death only if the annuitant’s spouse is eligible to and elects to continue the policy see tax information – tax status of a nonqualified policy – distribution requirements if you elect the joint life option then the withdrawal percentage used to calculate the rider withdrawal amount is lower than under the single life option this option may not be permitted in the case of certain nonnatural owners please note if you elect this option     •   the withdrawal percentage for each “age at the time of first withdrawal” is lower than under the single life option     •   the annuitant’s spouse or in certain instances a nonnatural entity acting for the benefit of the annuitant’s spouse must be either a joint owner along with the annuitant or the sole primary beneficiary and there is no joint owner please see spousal continuation section for more detail regarding annuitant’s spouse      •   a former spouse of the annuitant cannot continue to keep the policy in force if no longer married to the annuitant at the time of the annuitant’s death in that event the rider will terminate and no additional withdrawals under the rider will be permitted     •   the annuitant’s spouse for purposes of this rider cannot be changed to a new spouse     •   the rider withdrawal percentage is based on the age of the younger of the annuitant and annuitant’s spouse transamerica income edge—fees transamerica income edge rider fee the current rider fee percentage is  per annum and the maximum rider fee percentage is  the rider fee is deducted at the end of each successive rider quarter on the same day of the month as the rider date if a day does not exist in a given month the first day of the following month will be used if a rider fee is deducted from a subaccount on a day which is not a market day the value of accumulation units redeemed will be determined as of the next market day the rider fee is calculated and stored at issue and at each subsequent rider quarter for the upcoming quarter the rider fee will be adjusted for any premium additions and excess withdrawals it will be deducted automatically from the flexible investment options and the select investment options on a pro rata basis at the end of each rider quarter after those investment options are depleted of value the rider fee will be deducted from the stable account on an annual basis in general terms the rider fee is the rider fee percentage times the withdrawal base specifically the quarterly rider fee is calculated by multiplying a by b by c where     a is the withdrawal base     b is the rider fee percentage and     c is the number of days in the rider quarter divided by the total number of days in the applicable rider year the following example uses these assumed values initial premium   withdrawal base   rider fee percentage   and  total days in the rider quarter example  calculation at rider issue for first quarter rider fee the rider fee is       we will assess a portion of the rider fee upon full surrender of the policy or other termination of the rider by adjusting the quarterly fee based on the number of days remaining until the end of the next rider quarter for the period beginning on the first day of the most recent rider quarter and ending on the date of termination on each rider anniversary the rider fee percentage may increase at the time of an automatic stepup each time an automatic stepup results in a rider fee percentage increase you will have the option to reject the automatic stepup and reinstate the withdrawal base and rider fee percentage to their respective amounts immediately before the automatic stepup adjusted for any subsequent premium payments or withdrawals provided that you do so within  calendar days after the rider anniversary on which the automatic stepup occurred we must receive your rejection in good order at our administrative office within the  day period after the rider anniversary on which the automatic stepup occurred please note regarding the rider fee     •   because the rider fee is a percentage of the withdrawal base it could be a much higher percentage of your policy value particularly in the event that your policy value decreases significantly     •   because the rider fee is a percentage of the withdrawal base the amount of the rider fee we deduct will increase if the withdrawal base increases although the percentages may remain the same rider fee adjustment for premium payments and excess withdrawals a rider fee adjustment will be calculated for subsequent premium payments and excess withdrawals because these events will change the withdrawal base the rider fee adjustment may be positive or negative and will be added to or subtracted from the rider fee to be collected the following example uses these assumed values all initial values as in example  subsequent premium   and  remaining days in the rider quarter example  calculation for first quarter rider fee adjustment for a subsequent premium the fee adjustment is          total fee assessed at the end of the first rider quarter assuming no further rider fee adjustments       the following two examples used assumed fees and values the assumed rider year is not a leap year example  calculation for second quarter fee at beginning of second
