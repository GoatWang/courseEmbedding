about us products education  training investor relations events   medical information doublepulse workshops seminars published articles cme laser spine therapy provider list  hoyag laser safety information   medical information       the holmiumyag hoyag laser is perhaps the most versatile surgical laser available to todays laser surgeon the unique ability of the hoyag to vaporize ablate and coagulate soft tissues and extremely hard materials such as calculi have made it the laser of choice for orthopedic urologic ent gynecologic gastroenterologic and general surgeons worldwide      a relatively low depth of thermal penetration excellent hemostasis delivery systems that allow access to even the tightest spaces and a wide variety of tissue effects are just a few of the many benefits the hoyag laser can bring to your patients and your practice      holmiumyag laser energy at  nm  microns is rapidly absorbed by the water in tissue and has an ultimate depth of penetration of  mm or less holmium laser energy can ablate hard materials such as calcified urinary tract calculi while also being able to treat the delicate structures encountered in spinal gynecological and ent surgery     trimedynes omnipulse max incorporates several stateoftheart technologies available only on trimedyne laser systems     doublepulse™ a patented waveform allows the treatment of hard materials using one half the energy of the traditional single pulse waveform with similar results  these lower energy settings greatly decrease the chance for residual heat build up in tiny areas like the ureter or tight interdiscal spaces only the omnipulse max offers both traditional single pulse and the doublepulse waveforms in the same laser      all trimedyne holmiumyag lasers have an onboard power meter the power meter allows verification of the integrity of all of our delivery systems to ensure accurate delivery of the selected energy the onboard power meter can also extend the useful life of our reusable devices by allowing operating room staff to test the functionality of the optical fiber before during or after use the readout on the lasers control panel will readily verify that the optical fiber is still delivering adequate energy and is suitable to be sterilized for another procedure     our unique cooling system can generate  duty cycles for our holmiumyag lasers systems at most settings duty cycle refers to the ability of a device to operate at or near full power a  duty cycle means that the omnipulse max can deliver the full programmed power to tissue throughout the procedure with less likelihood that the laser will overheat  many competitive lasers have duty cycles as low as  which can result in the laser shutting down during the middle of a procedure  additionally the heat exchanger systems employed by competitive lasers release a considerable amount of heat into the surgical suite and when coupled with the internal fans required to keep these competitive devices cool may produce more noise than the trimedyne omnipulse max      trimedynes patented fiber connection provides better protection for the delivery system fiber and laser optics  its design eliminates the possibility of the laser beam striking a metallic surface with the resultant rapid degradation of optical surfaces and reduction of energy to tissue  the standard sma  connectors utilized by other holmium laser manufacturers do not provide this capability      versatile efficient quiet and extremely reliable are the words most often used to explain why the trimedyne omnipulse max is the holmiumyag laser of choice for informed surgeons      top of page home  about us  products  education  training  investor relations  events whats new  careers  doublepulse  site

tmedobotc bb ceocfomembers login february   issue the most powerful name in corporate news and information current issue   cover archives    index    contact    financials   services   home page with its new patented side firing laser fiber trimedyne brings exciting news to men suffering from an enlarged prostate or a herniated ruptured disc in the spine company profile trimedyne develops manufactures and markets medical lasers and patented disposable and reusable fiber optic devices for use in minimally invasive procedures as alternatives to surgery trimedynes laser procedures most of which are performed on an outpatient basis have higher success rates than surgery and avoid most of the adverse effects and complications of surgery   trimedynes new vapormaxž side firing laser fiber was recently cleared for sale by the fda for use with trimedynes and other holmium lasers for the treatment of enlarged prostates a condition which affects about  of men over age  typically on an outpatient basis a similar device will be marketed by lumenis ltd through boston scientific corporation nysebsx in the us and japan and by lumenis through its large sales organization elsewhere throughout the world when lumenis and bsx complete their audit of trimedynes manufacturing process and quality system which is expected to take several months  lumenis is a medical laser manufacturer based in israel with sales of about  million   however trimedyne has begun production and will begin marketing its new vapormaxž fiber through its own sales organization in march    trimedynes holmium lasers and fiber optic devices are also used in orthopedics for the treatment of herniated or ruptured discs in the spine and the treatment of damage in joints typically on an outpatient basis and in urology for fragmenting stones in the kidney and bladder and for a variety of other uses which requires a hospital stay of a day or longer   trimedyne also rents lasers with a trained operator to hospitals and surgery centers in the southwest for a per case fee marvin p loeb scd chairman and ceo of trimedyne inc and cardiomedics inc marvin loeb is an experienced entrepreneur in the health care field over a period of thirty years he founded  companies of which he took  public by ipo most of which have been sold to or merged with larger companies  of the privately held companies were sold to larger companies without going through an ipo four failed and two are still privately held he was awarded an honorary doctor of science degree and has been issued  us patents with an additional  patent applications pending   healthcare medical devices tmedobotc bb trimedyne inc  commerce center drive lake forest ca  phone    the interview conducted by walter banks publisher ceocfointerviewscom published  february   ceocfo with us today is dr marvin p loeb the founder and chairman of trimedyne inc a manufacturer of medical lasers and fiberoptic reusable and disposable devices trimedynes symbol is tmedob   ceocfo dr loeb tell us about the new product you are developing dr loeb trimedyne has recently developed a new patented vapormaxž side firing laser fiber for use with our  watt holmium lasers and other highpower holmium lasers for the treatment of enlarged prostates in men technically called benign prostatic hyperplasia or bph developing this new product has caused us to run at a loss for the last two years but the development program has now been completed   our new vapormaxž fiber has been cleared for sale in the us by the fda and we expect it will be approved for sale in the european union in a few weeks we had excellent reports from physicians evaluating this new fiber we are commencing production and expect to begin selling this new fiber in march of this year we expect sales of these fibers will begin to contribute to our revenues in the first calendar quarter of  and we expect to return to profitability in the next quarter or two   our business is growing in the fiscal year ended september   we had revenues of  a  increase over revenues of  in the prior fiscal year in the current fiscal year we had a net loss of  or  cents per share on a weighted average of  shares outstanding a  reduction from our net loss of  or  cents per share in the prior fiscal year   in the quarter ended september   revenues were  an  increase from revenues of  for the same quarter of the prior year   also in the quarter ended september   our net loss was only  or zero per share on a weighted average of  shares outstanding a reduction of  from the net loss of  or  cents per share in the year ago quarter on the same number of shares as you can see we are almost at breakeven   ceocfo tell us about your business and products and their uses and how they fit in the market place dr loeb our business is divided into three segments of about equal size in orthopedics our holmium lasers and side firing laser needles are used to treat herniated or ruptured discs in the spine lumbar thoracic or cervical typically in  to  minute outpatient procedures with published success rates of  to  the patient walks out about an hour after the procedure with a band aid on the needle puncture and can usually return to light activities in a couple of days and to work in about a week  about  people are treated for a herniated or ruptured disc each year in the united states   in conventional disc surgery called fusion surgery the disc is removed the space between the vertebra is filled with cadaver bone to fuse the vertebra together over time and the vertebra are rigidly attached to oneanother with screws and plates the published success rates for fusion surgery are only  to  compared to our published success rates of  to    also in conventional disc surgery the patient is hospitalized for  to  days suffers substantial bleeding and pain has several weeks of recuperation usually has to endure up to six months of rehabilitation and exercise therapy and can be out of work for up to two months or longer   our lasers are also used with specially designed fiberoptic devices to treat damage in joints such as the knee shoulder elbow hip wrist or ankle typically on an outpatient basis a procedure called arthroscopy about  million arthroscopy procedures are performed each year in the united states   another segment of our business is in urology in which our holmium lasers and flexmaxž optical fibers are used to fragment stones in the kidney ureter or bladder our lasers have been shown in a published study to fragment stones faster and into smaller pieces than other lasers making them easier to pass during urination   treating bph with our holmium lasers and our new vapormaxž side firing fiber is a new business for us about  million procedures are performed each year throughout the world to treat bph about  of which are in the us  urologists earn about  of their income from treating bph so this is a large important new market   the third segment of our business is renting lasers to hospitals and surgery centers with a trained operator on a per case basis to do orthopedic urology and other procedures lasers are expensive and operating them takes training   many hospitals dont want to invest  or more in a laser and have one of their people trained who might leave requiring them to send another person for training calling our  number and having the laser delivered with our highly trained technician to operate it makes this very convenient for hospitals and outpatient surgery centers   also hospitals and surgery centers and their doctors want the newest equipment and they dont want to be stuck with an expensive laser if a new laser or other device arises that does a procedure faster or better so renting lasers on a per case business is costeffective   all three of these segments of our business are growing as you can see in our yearoveryear sales growth we expect they will continue to grow as our laser procedures entail less bleeding and fewer infections usually avoid hospitalization and enjoy shorter recuperation times allowing people to return to work earlier which is important in this economy and our laser procedures cost less than conventional surgery   ceocfo would you tell us about the size of these markets and how you are positioned dr loeb an estimated  million people in the us suffer from a herniated ruptured or degenerated disc about  surgical procedures to treat herniated or ruptured discs are performed each year in the united states at an average cost of about  each a total cost of almost  billion per year this is a market our patented lasers and side firing needles address our laser procedures cost insurance companies about  a savings of about  per case compared to the cost of surgery if the patient has to pay a  copay  of  is a lot less than  of    presently our lasers are used in only about  or  percent of these procedures so we have a lot of room to grow in this business   with president obama pushing for a national healthcare plan and with greater attention to technologies that save money we expect this segment of our business will continue to grow    in urology millions of people take drugs to treat an enlarged prostate when the drugs no longer control the prostates growth each year about  million people throughout the world about  in the united states have their enlarged prostate treated in either a procedure using radiofrequency or rf energy or laser energy   the rf procedure takes an hour or more requires a  to  day hospital stay and entails significant bleeding up to  of the patients lose more than a pint of blood and require a blood transfusion nobody wants a blood transfusion because there may be a variety of dangerous viruses and organisms in donor blood which is usually tested only for aids and hepatitis   the rf procedure also entails a substantial infection rate a week or two of recuperation up to  of the men who were potent before the procedure become impotent and up to  become permanently incontinent   our laser procedure to treat an enlarged prostate usually takes  to  minutes is typically performed on an outpatient basis with little or no bleeding or pain and the patient can usually return to light activities in a couple of days on the plus side medicare pays more for the laser procedure than the rf procedure which makes this attractive to hospitals and surgery centers   over the past six or seven years the use of lasers to treat enlarged prostates has grown from very little to about  million per year we hope to gain a sizeable share of this market both in our urology business and in our per case laser rental business   lithotripsy or the fragmentation of stones in the kidney ureter or bladder is also growing as holmium lasers have proven superior to other technologies for this application most large hospitals in the us already use lasers for fragmenting stones now smaller hospitals in the us and large and small hospitals overseas are buying holmium lasers for use in lithotripsy   presently our per case laser rental business covers texas and adjoining areas we plan to expand this business into other metropolitan markets in the future using our holmium lasers and patented vapormaxž side firing fiber for the treatment of enlarged prostates and our patented side firing laser needles to treat ruptured and herniated discs in the spine as a springboard to enter new markets   ceocfo you were in litigation with lumenis ltd and ended up with a partner would you explain how that happened dr loeb a few years ago we sued lumenis for infringement of our patents on side firing laser fibers and for certain antitrust violations lumenis is the worlds largest manufacturer of medical lasers with sales of about  million worldwide and has a large established sales organization   we settled this litigation and lumenis agreed to purchase  of its requirements for side firing laser fibers which emit laser energy at ş to ş and  of their requirements for angled firing fibers which emit energy at less than ş from trimedyne however before we can start shipping lumenis a side firing fiber similar to our vapormaxž side firing fiber which emits laser energy at about ş lumenis must audit our manufacturing process and our quality system to be sure our products meet their quality requirements which will take several months   lumenis presently markets their duotome angled firing fiber for the treatment of enlarged prostates through boston scientific corporation in the us and japan and through lumenis large sales organization elsewhere throughout the world this settlement means that indirectly we will have the benefit of boston scientifics large presence in urology in the us and japan in marketing the side firing fibers we will be selling to lumenis   boston scientifics audit of our manufacturing process and quality system covers essentially the same items lumenis will be auditing  while boston scientific is expected to accept lumenis audit results they may audit some items more extensively so boston scientifics audit could add a month or two to the total audit period    while this audit process will take time when it is completed we will be picking up lumenis existing volume from selling its angled firing fibers to boston scientific and through lumenis own sales organization so we will not be starting from scratch   in the meantime lumenis is paying us a royalty of  on their sales of such fibers   ceocfo tell us about you competition and what sets you apart dr loeb laserscope pioneered the use of lasers and side firing laser fibers for treating enlarged prostates and they are presently the leader in this market in  laserscope sold about  million of lasers and side firing fibers to treat enlarged prostates in late  laserscope was acquired by american medical systems whose nasdaq symbol is ammd the price was  million or  per share up from about  per share in   ammd is our principal competitor   ceocfo going back to you new vapormaxž fiber what countries are the best markets for it dr loeb at about  each these laser fibers are expensive and are discarded after one use only in the us japan the european union and a few other countries is reimbursement sufficient to enable hospitals to pay about  for a disposable laser fiber    outside these countries the patient often has to pay extra for the laser procedure to treat his enlarged prostate which limits the market to middle and upper income men since the rf procedure to treat an enlarged prostate entails hospitalization significant pain the risk of severe bleeding sometimes requiring a blood transfusion and the risks of impotence and incontinence if they can afford it men have a good reason to pay extra for the laser procedure   there are of course affluent people in many other countries such as the middle east canada mexico brazil argentina russia australia china korea and india we expect these countries along with the us japan and the european union will be significant markets for our new vapormaxž fiber   ceocfo when can we expect to see significant sales from your new fiber dr loeb lumenis has been marketing its angledfiring laser fiber for a number of years it is not as fast at vaporizing tissue and it is not as durable as our new fiber while we believe it will be several months until the audits by lumenis and boston scientific are completed and lumenis begins buying our new side firing fiber we will be marketing our vapormaxž fiber through our own sales organization which is much smaller than lumenis and boston scientifics   when lumenis begins purchasing a copy of our vapormaxž fiber from us which they will market under their new duramax trademark we expect to see a sizeable increase in our revenues   of course we will be selling the new side firing fiber to lumenis on an oem basis at a substantial discount so even though our marketing organization is small we will earn a higher percentage of the sales price selling fibers through our own people a modest increase in our revenues from sales by our people due to the larger profit margin will have a disproportionate effect on our bottom line   ceocfo what is the longterm outlook for trimedyne dr loeb if president obama is successful in implementing a national health insurance plan which will expand health coverage to an additional  or  million americans the market for our products will grow substantially if this new healthcare program gives preference to devices which have higher success rates and lowers hospital costs i believe trimedyne could see tremendous growth ahead   we plan to use some of the profits we expect from sales of our new side firing fiber to conduct more training courses for surgeons to expand our spinal disc market increase the size of our sales organization and expand our per case laser rental business into other markets in the united states   ceocfo would you tell us about your management team board of directors and how you work together dr loeb i founded the company in  based on some of my patents ive been issued about  patents for use in the treatment of a variety of medical conditions of which about  were assigned to trimedyne without compensation   glenn d yeik our president and coo is a superb engineer and has been with us for  years he designed our holmium laser and new side firing fiber and he has developed a unique manufacturing process for our new side firing fiber to insure its durability and fast vaporization rate   brian t kenney our vp of sales and marketing has been with trimedyne for  years he is responsible for appointing and training our sales reps and distributors and he is adept at teaching our laser procedures   jeffrey s rudner our chief accounting officer has been with us  years and very ably manages our accounting receivables billing and customer service departments   ceocfo what is the financial position of trimedyne today dr loeb at september   we had about  million in cash and equivalents and current assets of about  million versus payables and accrued expenses of only about  we have no bank debt and no longterm debt   ceocfo how many patents does trimedyne currently have dr loeb trimedyne has  patents and four pending patent applications we are developing a new type of laser which may result in a new patent and we have patents covering other new laser fibers which are in an early stage of development   ceocfo with so many public companies to choose from in the healthcare arena why should potential investors consider trimedyne dr loeb very few medical device companies have a growing business and a new fda cleared device enabling it to enter a new market with a large potential with lumenis as a marketing partner and their distribution capabilities through boston scientific as well as through their own sales organization we believe we are on the verge of substantial growth ceocfo do you focus on reaching the investment community and if so what are you doing dr loeb you may remember several years ago when ceocfo first covered trimedyne we were earning  million a year and we had just gotten into the lawsuit with lumenis the outcome looked promising and it was a good time then the market hit us in  and  which was a problem for everybody however our sales have grown in  and  regardless of the markets decline   im from the old school now that we are at breakeven and hopefully in the next quarter or two we will be in the black ill toot our horn more aggressively when our profits grow rather than talking about things we hope to achieve   ceocfo you mentioned some forwardlooking statements in this interview what would you like to say in closing dr loeb to satisfy our sec attorney i must tell you this interview contains forwardlooking statements as defined by the securities reform act of  which include estimates beliefs plans and expectations the accuracy of which cannot be assured and actual results may differ substantially from those described herein   i hope investors interested in trimedyne will go to our website
