regards to stock market trading and capitalization the advent in the s of political and terrorist movements demanding the independence of quebec from canada cast a pallor of uncertainty over the business community in  the newly elected sovereigntist quebec government passed the charter of the french language known as bill  making the use of french language mandatory for medium and largescale

place overnight transfers and moves occurred on a departmental basis and did not commence until several months after the announcement the transfer of sun lifes head office from montreal to toronto is viewed by many to be the start of an exodus of corporate entities from montreal but sun life was not the first company to leave many companies had left long before sun life did only on a much quieter
