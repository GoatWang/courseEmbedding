exploit oil and natural gas properties in north america our primary business objective is to provide an attractive return to unitholders by focusing on business results maximizing distributions and pursuing accretive growth opportunities through acquisitions from diamondback energy nasdaqfang and from third parties our initial assets consist of mineral interests in oil and natural gas properties in the permian basin in west texas substantially all of which are leased to working interest owners who bear the costs of operation and development we expect our initial focus will concentrate on the permian basin which is one of the oldest and most prolific producing basins in north america the permian basin which consists of approximately  square miles centered around midland texas has been a significant source of oil production since the s the permian basin is known to have a number of zones of oil and natural gas bearing rock throughout however because of the nature of the rock in many of the potentially productive zones historically it was not economic to exploit these zones as a result exploration and development was limited until recently when higher oil prices and more advanced completion techniques including hydraulic fracturing changed the economics of drilling and development of these zones and greatly increased the oil and natural gas industry’s interest in the permian basin oil production in the permian basin has grown from  barrels per day in  to  million barrels per day in  based on public statements made by a number of publicly traded oil and natural gas companies and the successful horizontal well results of the industry we believe that drilling activity in the permian basin is likely to continue to grow at least for several more years latest news

investors vnom nasdaq view investor relations › overview  viper energy partners lp vnom home our strategy overview overview our primary business objective is to provide an attractive return to unitholders by focusing on business results and total distributions and pursuing accretive growth opportunities through acquisitions from diamondback and from third parties we intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies seek to acquire from diamondback from time to time mineral or other interests in producing oil and natural gas properties that meet our acquisition criteria we may have additional opportunities to acquire producing oil and natural gas properties directly from diamondback from time to time in the future we believe diamondback may be incentivized to sell properties to us as doing so may enhance diamondback’s economic returns by monetizing longlived producing properties while potentially retaining a portion of the resulting cash flow through distributions on diamondback’s limited partner interests in us leverage our relationship with diamondback to participate with it in acquisitions of thirdparty producing properties and to increase the size and scope of our potential thirdparty acquisition targets diamondback’s executives have long histories of evaluating pursuing and consummating oil and natural gas property acquisitions in north america through our relationships with diamondback and its affiliates we have access to their significant pool of management talent and industry relationships which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in pursuing potential thirdparty acquisition opportunities capitalize on the development of the properties underlying our mineral interests to grow our distributions we expect the production from our mineral interest will increase as our other operators continue to actively drill our acreage we expect to capitalize on this development costfree to us and believe the

financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies viper defines adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense noncash unitbased compensation expense depletion and impairment adjusted ebitda is not a measure of net income loss as determined by united states’ generally accepted accounting principles or gaap management believes adjusted ebitda is useful because it allows it to more effectively evaluate viper’s operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period without regard to its financing methods or capital structure adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net income as determined in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of viper’s operating performance or liquidity certain items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets none of which are components of adjusted ebitda viper defines cash available for distribution generally as an amount equal to its adjusted ebitda for the applicable quarter less cash needed for debt service and other contractual obligations and fixed charges and reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of viper’s general partner may deem appropriate viper’s computations of adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
