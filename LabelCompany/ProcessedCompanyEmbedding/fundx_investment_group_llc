suite  san francisco ca  employees worldwide  industries investment services  portfolio management company description fundx investment group uses an upgrading approach to overcome market challenges and to identify investment opportunities with the flexibility to exploit the next trend upgrading involves measuring the nearterm performance of mutual funds twelve months and less and comparing them to returns of funds with similar risk the firm ranks hundreds of funds in this manner each month they invest in funds with the best recent returns and monitor their performance when a fund drops in rank they upgrade fundx moves incrementally to the topranked funds by progressively selling the lower ranked funds and reinvesting in the new market leaders funds with the highest returns to rise to the top of the firms rankings regardless of their investment approach the firm groups equity funds into four risk classes with bond funds grouped into a fifth class they dont isolate international funds from domestic or growth funds from value funds instead the firm segregates funds based on portfolio diversification and downside risk website httpwwwfundxinvestmentgroupcom in the news see more

mutual funds how we do it insights you are herehomewho we arehistory history in  native san franciscan stanford university graduate and world war ii pilot burt berry took the bold step of using noload mutual funds instead of individual stocks and bonds to professionally manage assets for clients the concept was virtually unheard of at the time the mutual fund industry was young and most funds carried  loads or sales charges that rewarded a broker just for selling a fund to an investor but loads ate into investors’ returns and they discouraged investors from selling their funds even when their funds weren’t performing well the brokers didn’t mind this arrangement but burt thought investors were getting a raw deal burt focused on noload funds he didn’t need a broker to buy these funds and if these funds didn’t do well he could sell them and move on to something else there were only a few dozen noload funds available at that time and it was almost impossible to obtain useful performance data on them so burt began calculating the performance of noload funds using a spreadsheet and an adding machine he invested in the funds that had strong recent returns it seemed logical to him that the funds that were doing well now were doing something right when a fund began to lag its peers he redeemed the shares and directed the proceeds to a better performing alternative he called this process “upgrading” years later academic research would find that mutual funds that have outperformed in recent months tend to continue to outperform in ensuing months a phenomenon academics called “persistence of performance” burt’s upgrading process took advantage of this phenomenon   fundx investment group all rights reserved
