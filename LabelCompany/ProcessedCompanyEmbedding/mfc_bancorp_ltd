business reduced our total debt by  from  million at december   to  million at march   and allocated resources for the expansion of our merchant banking business inventory reduction in the first quarter of  we reduced our inventories by  million from  million as at december   to  million as at march   this was a result of exiting certain product lines and geographical markets the following table sets forth our inventories as at march  june  september  and december   and march   inventories in thousands march   june   september   december   march   inventories                       debt reduction we strive to match our assets and liabilities so that our longterm assets are financed with longterm debt and equity and our shortterm assets are financed with shortterm debt and equity as we streamlined our operations and rationalized underperforming subsidiaries we have reduced our debt accordingly in the first quarter of  we reduced our total longterm debt to  million from  million

earnings before interest taxes depreciation depletion amortization and impairment operating ebitda is a nonifrs financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures under ifrs management uses operating ebitda as a measure of our operating results and considers it to be a meaningful supplement to net income as a performance measure primarily because we incur depreciation and depletion from time to time for the three months ended march   our operating ebitda was  million compared to  for the same period of  the following is a

properties to continuing operations in  costs of sales and services have been represented for this period  includes net income attributable to noncontrolling interests update on the proposed plan of arrangement on march   we announced our intention to pursue a proposed plan of arrangement the plan under british columbia corporate law pursuant to which among other things we would reduce our  shareholders capital by an amount equal to our retained deficit complete a consolidation followed by a split of our common shares and our existing common shares would be exchanged for the shares of a new parent company incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands new mfc which would become the new publicly traded parent company of our group the plan is subject to among other things finalization and requisite court shareholder and board approvals we currently expect to complete the plan in the late second quarter or early third quarter of  the company believes that the benefits of the plan are among other things flexible corporate structure  the separation of the public parent company from its operating businesses will facilitate future strategic transactions such as spinoffs and corporate reorganizations as well as provide additional options for future financing structures fiscal flexibility  by being located in an international financial center with advantageous tax laws new mfc will have enhanced flexibility with respect to fiscal and tax planning the cayman islands has no corporate income dividends or capital gains taxes and no withholding taxes on distributions to shareholders reduced expenses we have a large number of very small shareholders as such we believe that by eliminating odd lot holders under the plan we will reduce our ongoing administrative costs and allow fractional shareholders to receive cash for their fractional shares without incurring brokerage commissions or expenses enhanced global exposure we are a global company with operations spanning internationally and new mfcs jurisdiction of incorporation of the cayman islands a recognized international financial center is more reflective of the international nature of  our operations  new mfc would also consider a secondary listing of its shares on a second stock exchange after completion of the plan to obtain additional global exposure and liquidity credit lines and facilities we established utilized and maintain various kinds of credit lines and facilities with banks and insurers most of these facilities are shortterm these facilities are used in our daytoday merchant banking business the amounts drawn under such facilities fluctuate with the type and level of transactions being undertaken  as at march   we had credit facilities aggregating  million as follows i we had unsecured revolving credit facilities aggregating  million from banks the banks generally charge an interest rate at interbank rates plus an interest margin ii we also had revolving credit facilities aggregating  million from banks for structured solutions a special trade financing the margin is negotiable when the facility is used iii we had a specially structured nonrecourse factoring arrangement with a bank up to a credit limit of  million for our merchant banking activities we factor certain of our trade receivables upon invoicing at the interbank rate plus a margin and iv we had foreign exchange credit facilities of  million with banks   all of these facilities are either renewable on a yearly basis or usable until further notice many of our credit facilities are denominated in euros and accordingly such amounts may fluctuate when reported in canadian dollars we continue to evaluate the benefits of certain facilities that may not have strategic longterm relevance to our business and priorities going forward and may modify or eliminate additional facilities in the future we do not anticipate that this will have a material impact on our overall liquidity presidents comments michael smith president and ceo of the company commented going forward we intend to expand our merchant banking activities our plan to exit unsatisfactory product lines and geographies significantly reducing our inventories and receivables and reallocating the capital to more profitable business units is proceeding well mr smith concluded we believe these actions and the announcement of the plan will help reduce expenses and ultimately result in an adequate return on our equity stakeholder communications management welcomes any questions you may have
