thereafter on january   holdings entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with two of its then wholly owned subsidiaries energie holdings and alas acquisition company alas the merger agreement effectively merged alas with and into holdings with holdings being the surviving corporation the net effect of the merger agreement was to effectuate a name change from alas aviation

position of holdings as of and for the three months ended september   further information about the historical results of energie may be found in our current report on form ka filed with the sec on

miscellaneous income offset by the expense associated with factoring our accounts receivable which had decreased activity in the nine months ended september   over the same period in  as we move towards collecting our receivables rather than factoring them liquidity and capital resources at september   we had  in cash we have not generated positive cash flows from operations accordingly our sources of liquidity may include potential debt and equity offerings we believe that our principal difficulty in our inability to successfully generate positive cash flows has been the lack of available capital to operate and expand our business we believe we need a minimum of approximately  in additional working capital to be utilized for a development and launching of new products for energie b funding the business development efforts to identify qualify and acquire other led lighting companies and c the balance for working capital and general and administrative expense other than as disclosed below we have no other commitments from any investor or investmentbanking firm to provide us with the necessary funding and there can be no assurances we will obtain such funding in the future failure to obtain this additional financing will have a material negative impact on our ability to generate profits in the future to fund our acquisition plan and fund working capital for our continuing operations we are continuing to seek out and discuss financing with potential partners or lenders while no assurances can be provided we expect that we will be able to obtain financing to implement our plans on july   we entered into an investment agreement and registration rights agreement with dutchess opportunity fund ii lp dutchess pursuant to the investment agreement dutchess committed to purchase subject to certain restrictions and conditions up to  million of our common stock upon issuance by us of a put to dutchess at a price equal to ninetyfour percent  of the lowest daily vwap volume weighted average price of our common stock during the five  consecutive trading days beginning on the put notice date and ending on and including the date that is four  trading days after such put notice date the put amount shall be equal to up to either  two hundred percent  of the average daily volume us market only of the common stock for the three also in the third quarter of  we entered into two securities purchase agreement with kbm worldwide inc kbm wherein we agreed to issue  convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of  the note may be converted into shares of our common stock at any time beginning  days from the date of the note at a price equal to  of the average closing bid price of our common stock during the  trading days immediately preceding the date of conversion in the event we fail to pay the note when it becomes due the balance due under the note incurs interest at the rate of  per annum the note contains additional terms and conditions normally included in instruments of this kind including a right of first refusal wherein we have granted kbm the right to match the terms of any future financing in which we engage on the same terms and contemplated in such future financing table of contents  working capital working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities we had negative working capital of  and  respectively as of september   and december   the increase in negative working capital is due to the assumption of the accounts payable of holdings from the share exchange of approximately  and the growth in accounts payable of approximately  associated with increased operating expenses although we are past due on our required payments under our debt agreements the lenders have not made demand for repayment of the principal and interest due if demand for payment is made by one or multiple vendors we would experience a liquidity issue as we do not currently have the funds available to pay off these debts we intend to enter into extensionforbearance agreements with each of the lenders however there can be no assurances that any of the lenders will be cooperative or that if they are willing to provide extensions or forbearances that the terms under which they may be willing to provide them will be favorable to us this raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern cash flows our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities were as follows nine months ended september    net cash used in provided by operating activities      net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    net cash from operating activities was driven by our net loss offset by an increase in accounts payable and unpaid interest expense we anticipate that overhead costs in current operations will increase in the future if we are successful in raising the capital described herein as a result of our anticipated increased marketing and operating activities net cash used in investing activities related to our continued spending to obtain ul listing qualification for products in development net cash from financing activities related to additional borrowings under existing debt agreements and the convertible debt we entered into in the third quarter of  inflation although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during the ninemonth period ended september   offbalance sheet arrangements we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of september   and december   table of contents  critical accounting estimates our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require

incorporated in the state of delaware on october   under the name “verilink corporation” we have also been known as energie holdings inc and alas aviation corp on december   we entered into a share exchange agreement the “share exchange agreement” with oelc llc a delaware limited liability company and its whollyowned subsidiary energie llc hereinafter referred to as “energie” the share exchange agreement was not effective until july   due to a variety of conditions subsequent that needed to be met which are described below upon effectiveness we issued  “restricted” shares of our common stock representing approximately  of our then issued and outstanding voting securities in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding member interests of energie the accounting is identical to that resulting from a reverse acquisition except that no goodwill or other intangible is recorded   the closing of the share exchange agreement was conditioned upon certain limited customary representation and warranties as well as conditions to close such as the total shares of energie holdings inc issued and outstanding being limited to  and the completion of an audit of energie’s financial statements following the execution of the share exchange agreement but prior to closing an additional  shares were issued and the limitation of  shares was waived allowing for the issuance   thereafter on january   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” with two of our then wholly owned subsidiaries energie holdings inc and alas acquisition company the net effect of the merger agreement was to effectuate a name change from alas aviation corp to energie holdings inc in order to provide a better understanding to investors of our entry into the lightemitting diode “led” lighting industry our management also changed on november   we filed a certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation with the state of delaware to change our name from “energie holdings inc” to “exeled holdings inc”   as a result of these transactions we are now a holding company with energie acting as our operating subsidiary engaged in the business of the import and sale of specialized interior lighting solutions to the architecture and interior design markets in north america our creative lighting products include both conventional fixtures and advanced solidstate technology that can integrate with digital controls and daylighting to create energy efficiencies and a better visual environment our current business objective is to become a leading provider of advanced led lighting solutions by acquiring and growing complementary led based lighting fixture companies we are focused on acquiring specialized lighting companies for the architecture and interior design markets for both commercial and residential applications with the intention to grow innovate and fully capture the rapidly growing lighting market opportunities associated with solid state lighting these objectives are subject to our obtaining additional financing of which there can be no assurance   all references herein to “us” “we” “our” “holdings” or the “company” refer to exeled holdings inc and its subsidiaries and their respective business following the consummation of the merger and share exchange agreements unless the context otherwise requires   description of current business   energie was founded in and is engaged in the import and sale of specialized interior lighting solutions to the architecture and interior design markets in north america our headquarters is located in arvada colorado and we also maintain a production and assembly facility in zeeland michigan   during the years ended december   and  the success we did have was with unique and led products in several market segments in particular we experienced demand in education commercial office space large multiunit luxury residential and health care education was especially strong with activity across the spectrum of k as well as public  private universities we expect this trend to continue throughout      table of contents      we have developed an endtoend production and distribution platform for imported lighting products featuring hid fluorescent and led technologies long term contracts with five european manufacturers and one in taiwan provide us with exclusive north american distribution rights to over  total products in  categories after processing any modifications necessary to meet underwriter’s laboratories™ “ulcul” standards and building code requirements the products are sold to customers through a network of over  independent lighting sales agents in addition to a highly competitive commission structure we provide our sales force with promotional materials product training and technical support   we intend to capitalize on these european lighting companies’ desire to penetrate north american markets by solving many of the problems these producers encounter when approaching these markets these obstacles include designs that do not meet ulcul standards and building codes the need to provide appropriate north american oriented marketing and product information and specifications experience to leverage the lighting industry sales agent network and market based product supply   our business strategy is to enter into exclusive sales agreements with european suppliers that have unique lighting products and to bridge the divide between product desires of north american architects lighting designers electrical engineers and interior designers who wish to access innovative european products and the desires of european manufacturers as these european partners are continually developing new products we collaborate in the fixture design process and have the right to launch such products in north america in many cases our partners will cofund the frontend costs associated with launching new products however we require additional working capital to embark on our growth strategy we estimate that we will need up to  in additional working capital to accomplish our initial business objectives of developing and launching new products for energie but significantly more capital to effectuate the acquisition campaign we have discussed elsewhere herein see “part ii item  management’s discussion – liquidity and capital resources”   we have been and continue to engage in the design development enhancement and marketing of advanced commercial grade illumination products that exclusively use led’s as their light source in the continental united states canada and puerto rico our products include led hanging and recessed ceiling fixtures recessed wall fixtures and wall sconces our branded products have been installed in a wide variety of settings including commercial office space financial trading floors health care facilities museums schools restaurants retail stores and other public locations   the latest analysis “ global lighting market outlook” published on november   by ledinside a division of trendforce finds that the led lighting market was worth us  billion in  and is to rise to us  billion in  meanwhile the penetration rate of led lighting is expected to reach  thanks to regional lighting development led lighting is expected to account for  of total lightings in europe by  which is the highest across the world the second and third highest regions are to be found in north america and china however the asiapacific region is experiencing the fastest growth rate in led lighting   according to a recent freedonia research report the led lighting fixtures segment of the industry is estimated at  billion of architectural specificationgrade lighting fixtures with innovative differentiated lighting products that exemplify   · energy efficiency focused on the disruptive led technology · high performance with respect to quantity and quality of light through superior optic design and · aesthetic design that appeals to the senses while allowing architects and designers to make strong visual statements by accessing european lighting fixture designers   in order to secure such projects we cultivate relationships and build our brand through marketing and sales efforts aimed at decisionmakers responsible for lighting primarily architects lighting designers electrical engineers interior designers space planners and other product designators we maintain a network of over  thirdparty sales agencies across north america to represent our products lighting sales agencies in the commercial lighting market are standalone commissionbased geographically specific companies that represent many different manufacturers and represent only lighting fixtures and lighting control systems we support our agents with sales and marketing resources to help drive “sell through” of our branded products all products are assembled to underwriter’s laboratory requirements in our factory to control quality and meet lead time requirements of our customers     table of contents      our business model and product strategy is based upon collaboration with leading european lighting manufacturing companies including rudolpf zimmermann bamberg gmbh bamberg germany regent beleuchtungskorper ag basel switzerland trilux gmbh  co kg arnsberg germany multiline licht nv lummen belgium luxionatroll canovelles spain and tons lightogy inc new taipei city taiwan except for the agreement with rzb and tons lightogy which were executed in  each of these other agreements have been in place for over ten  years and are renewable for additional  year terms each of the agreements contain standard warranties are either fob manufacturer or cfr destination and title and risk of loss passes to us upon delivery when payment becomes due each also includes a list of products that are manufactured by each respective manufacturer order cancellation is allowed up until  days prior to delivery except for trilux which requires a month written notice thereafter no cancellation is allowed with the exception of multiline licht nv the agreements are exclusive to us throughout north america   the north american architectural and design community has long recognized that european lighting manufacturers have distinctive innovative and technologically advanced product offerings arguably we believe european designs and technology are several years ahead of what is available in north america however designers have historically encountered difficulties working with european manufacturers typical issues include product designs that do not meet ulcul standards and north american building codes poor marketing collateral and product information incompatible specification data long lead times to receive product poor sales support limited customer service and high overall cost and complexity due to exchange rates freight duties and other factors   the european manufacturers have long viewed the north american market for architectural specificationgrade lighting as large and attractive however apart from a few isolated examples attempts to penetrate this market by establishing whollyowned us operations have been costly and unprofitable and as a result many have failed we believe the challenges the european manufacturers encounter include a incomplete understanding of the design and product attributes demanded by north american architects and designers b incomplete understanding of ulcul and building code requirements c inexperience working with indirect sales channels such as agents and distributors european sales strategy is based on company employed direct salespeople and d the overall high cost of “green fielding” and supporting us operations   to address these issues we are seeking external financing and intend to expand our operations through the acquisition of related businesses that will complement our current business should this financing come through  there are many synergistic operations which have expressed an interest in being acquired by us due to our status as a publicly traded company  we believe this makes economic sense because we can eliminate duplication of general and administrative expense provide more centralized information marketing and eliminate overlapping of services offered  we are presently evaluating several such businesses as potential acquisition candidates and have engaged in discussions with other acquisition targets  however as of the date of this report there are no definitive agreements in place relating to our acquiring any such business and there can be no assurances that such agreements will be executed on favorable terms or at all in the future if we are unable to obtain the external financing that we are targeting we will not be able execute this plan and will not have the financial resources to continue operations   up to this point our financing efforts have been unsuccessful and we can provide no assurances that they will be in the future if they are unsuccessful there will be significant challenges to remain in business if we are successful in securing external financing and then in executing on our growth strategy the acquisition of related complimentary businesses is expected to increase revenues and profits by providing a broader range of services in vertical markets which are consolidated under one parent thus reducing overhead costs by streamlining operations and eliminating duplicitous efforts and costs  there are no assurances that we will increase profitability if we are successful in acquiring other synergistic companies   management intends to seek out and evaluate related complimentary businesses for acquisition  the integrity and reputation of any potential acquisition candidate will first be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it meets with management’s standards  once targeted as a potential acquisition candidate we will enter into negotiations with the potential candidate and commence due diligence evaluation of each business including its financial statements cash flow debt location and other material aspects of the candidates’ business  we expect to utilize the issuance of our securities as part of the consideration that we will pay for these proposed acquisitions  if we are successful in our attempts to acquire similar companies utilizing our securities as part or all of the consideration to be paid our current shareholders will incur dilution   we anticipate that we will need additional capital to make these acquisitions we have had various discussions with investment banking firms and others potential investors but as of the date of this report there are no definitive agreements to provide us with this funding and there can be no assurances that we will obtain this funding in the future failure to obtain this funding will have a material negative affect on our ability to implement our business plan and our anticipated results of operations we are continuing to seek out and discuss financing with potential partners and lenders while no assurances can be provided we expect that many lighting fixture companies will be interested in consolidating with us to capitalize on the application of the disruptive led technology     table of contents      our objective is to become a leading provider of advanced led lighting solutions by acquiring and growing complementary led based lighting fixture companies we are focused on acquiring specialized lighting companies for the architecture and interior design markets for both commercial and residential applications our creative lighting products will include both conventional fixtures and advanced solidstate technology that can integrate with digital controls and daylighting to create energy efficiencies and a better visual environment our intent is to grow innovate and fully capture the rapidly growing lighting market opportunities associated with solid state lighting there are no assurances we will be successful   key elements of our business growth strategy include   · led technology leadership as led technology increases in the speed at which it is advancing lighting fixture designs will have to adapt to that rate of change our advisory team intends to provide access to the best resources to apply led technology for our subsidiaries we also intend to provide buying contracts with led component manufacturers to control cost while staying at the leading edge of the technology   · access to investment capital the change from conventional lighting technology to led technology is expensive the capital needed to understand and apply led technology is more than most conventional lighting manufactures have or are willing to risk we intend to provide the appropriate capital to develop and launch led lighting fixtures through our subsidiaries as of the date of this report we do not have sufficient capital to meet this objective and there are no assurances we will obtain this capital in the future   · best practices management services the business processes and staffing required to move to solid state lighting are different than those needed for conventional lighting technology our advisory team intends to provide assistance to our subsidiary teams to help them capitalize on these changes aggressively and cost effectively   · market appropriate education we believe that educating architects designers specifiers and endusers of the benefits of led lighting is key to growing our market share by shifting their preference from more traditional lighting to led lighting there continue to be unique advances in led engineering and while no assurances can be provided we believe the market is rapidly embracing the technology we also believe our employees have the knowledge and ability to educate both our customer base and if successful the personnel in the companies we acquire we expect that this will drive sales by driving the commercial market towards led lighting   · sales and distribution network we maintain a network of over  thirdparty sales agencies across north america to represent our products these agreements provide for exclusive rights to sell our lighting fixtures for a commission in specific counties as described in each agreement if and when we successfully consummate acquisitions each company that we acquire will have their own thirdparty sales agencies and distribution network we are targeting acquisitions that will diversify our product portfolio by carrying a broader selection of led lighting products we anticipate that we will be able to not just expand our existing network of sales agencies but to also become more of a preferred provider of products to select sales agencies   · expanding our led product portfolio  as our goal is to serve our customers and create a quality experience in both product and service we will continue to expand these categories and add necessary fixtures and light sources to increase our offering as an led solution provider   · developing and protecting our intellectual property  securing and defending intellectual property by using the ul listing process related to the design manufacture and application of advanced lighting technology is expected to be a key element of our existing and future business the strength of our intellectual property portfolio is intended to allow us to compete on the basis of our technology which we believe will give us an advantage over many of our larger competitors   · capitalizing on opportunities in our target markets  we believe there is a growing need for unique advanced lighting solutions across our target markets our acquisition strategy is to expand into new production application market segments by focusing on companies with complementary products because we have access to the advanced products from our international partners we expect to continue to introduce innovative advanced lighting products as we believe there exists significant opportunities to grow market share by introducing new products and expanding sales of existing products we believe that we can significantly improve operational efficiency by reducing our cost of materials components and manufacturing expanding our products and increasing our sales will also allow us to gain additional leverage from sales representatives within our distribution network     table of contents      the led lighting industry   the global lighting industry generally is divided between three major market segments commercial industrial and residential within these three market segments exist two broad product categories fixtures and light bulbs referred to as lamps in the lighting industry the fixtures category includes all apparatuses luminaires and powerheatcontrol systems while lamps consist of the devices that emit light conventional lamps typically include incandescent fluorescent and highintensity discharge hid products for commercial applications we believe that the more expensive and long lasting fluorescent and hid lamps and fixtures have had the largest market share for industrial applications metal halide and fluorescent have been the primary light source for residential applications within the general illumination market inexpensive incandescent bulbs and to a lesser extent compact fluorescent cfl lamps have been the common choice   with rapid advancements in the performance efficiency and cost of energyefficient lighting including ledbased solutions conventional light sources such as incandescent lamps are beginning to be replaced by advanced technologies with lower operating costs over their useful lives led’s are semiconductorbased devices that generate light the energyefficient nature of led technology makes it an environmentally friendly light source and the compact size of leds has created new possibilities in lighting fixture and lamp design product selection is influenced by a number of factors including overall cost energy efficiency product life lumen output and other product features as well as regulatory and environmental factors we believe our unique advanced lighting solutions are well positioned to increasingly displace conventional lighting in each of our targeted markets   in north america lighting manufacturers typically sell products through manufacturer’s representatives electrical supply representatives or an internal sales force to electrical wholesale distributors the distributors then market products to electrical contractors and other endusers representatives also have direct contact with lighting designers electrical engineers architects and general contractors that influence buying decisions the manufacturer’s representatives often provide valueadded services such as product promotion or design and implementation assistance the ability of smaller companies to compete against larger moreestablished rivals is heavily rooted in their capacity to leverage their unique product portfolios and customer service to garner maximum productivity from each representative   historically large global competitors focused almost exclusively on the general illumination market because of their advantage in purchasing power manufacturing volume and distribution efficiency while smaller industry participants generally competed in niche markets primarily by offering specialized products and superior customer service to their regions however the evolution of advanced lighting solutions has enabled smaller companies to penetrate and compete in the larger general illumination market one of these notable advanced lighting solutions is led lighting   industry trends   as the cost of led’s decrease and their performance improves we expect that they will continue to compete more effectively in the general illumination market versus traditional lighting highbrightness leds are the core lightproducing components within an led lighting system we believe the led lighting industry is experiencing the following trends    · technological innovations expand led functionality  since the introduction of the first visible led in the s the technology has offered an increasingly wide variety of colored lighting beginning with red and expanding to green yellow and orange initial rudimentary applications included traffic lights automotive brake lights and indicator lights in the mids leds became capable of emitting blue light with the advent of blue leds combined with phosphor technology leds made another technological leap by emitting white light this breakthrough enabled leds to compete with traditional lighting solutions for applications in commercial industrial and residential markets in an effort to lower energy consumption lighting companies are focusing on increasing “lumens per watt” lumens per watt often referred to as “efficacy” is an industry standard that measures the amount of light emitted per watt of electrical power used meaning the more lumens per watt the more energyefficient the product traditional incandescent lighting sources can produce between  and  lumens per watt while fluorescent and hid light sources can produce output exceeding  lumens per watt today’s leds are currently performing well over  lumens per watt at the led level making them comparable to and often better than fluorescent and hid light sources     table of contents      · high energy costs drive led adoption as a result of high energy prices and the expectation that prices will continue to rise businesses and consumers are increasingly adopting new technologies to reduce energy consumption led lighting technology is inherently more energy efficient and can result in more than  power savings over incandescent solutions according to the department of energy  of all energy consumption in the united states is from lighting applications this combined rate represents approximately  of all energy consumption in commercial buildings as compared to approximately  for residential users and  for industrial companies despite safety issues and concerns compact fluorescent cfl lamps are used for lighting energy conservation however recent technological advancements to led lighting have made it more commercially viable in terms of brightness efficiency lamp life safety and colorrendering cri in addition competitive pressures declining led costs and greater manufacturing efficiencies are driving down led lamp prices as a result of these gains and while there can be no assurances we believe led adoption should continue to expand in support of our belief in the  report issued by freedonia led fixtures are expected to account for over half of all lighting fixture sales in  higher value fixtures will account for a dramatically greater share of fixture sales as more fixtures designed specifically for leds advanced fluorescent lamps and other longer lived highly efficient light sources are introduced for instance sales of led lighting fixtures are expected to nearly triple through  to account for over half of total fixture sales up from seven percent in  in many cases led fixtures will replace existing fixtures designed for use with less efficient light sources as lamp stocks dwindle following phase out programs incandescent halogen and fluorescent fixtures will all register declining sales going forward however high intensity discharge hid fixtures which are based on an older but relatively energy efficient technology are expected to grow through    · legislative influences spur market adoption of energy efficient led lighting led lighting has encouraged regulatory agencies to increase the demand for more energy efficiency federal law under the energy efficiency improvement act of  mandates that commercial buildings use less electricity after hvac lighting consumes the second most electricity in buildings so it provides a great opportunity to decrease electricity usage also lighting can be more easily retrofitted than hvac so existing buildings are also a major opportunity   competition   we currently face competition from traditional lighting companies that provide general lighting products including incandescent fluorescent high intensity discharge hid metal halide mh and other traditional light sources we also have competitors from specialized lighting companies that are engaged in providing led lighting fixture products in general we intend to compete with both groups on the basis of design innovation and quality of light maintenance costs safety issues energy consumption price product quality and brightness   in the general illumination market we compete with traditional lighting companies that include acuity brands lighting inc eaton’s cooper lighting business a division of eaton corporation hubbell lighting inc a division of hubbell incorporated juno lighting group a division of schneider electric sa ge lighting and philips lighting a division of koninklijke philips nv our led products should tend to be alternatives to conventional lighting sources for applications within the commercial and residential markets in these markets we compete on the basis of unique designs performance energy savings lamp life and durability   we believe that we will compete favorably in our markets based on the following factors   · breadth and diversity of highquality led product offerings · our expansive distribution network and developed relationships · innovative products at competitive price points · ulcul dlc and energy star certifications · ability to offer multiple levels of products · valueengineered products producing a fast roi and · responsiveness to customers     table of contents      we expect our markets to remain competitive and to reflect rapid technological evolution and continuously evolving customer and regulatory requirements our ability to remain competitive depends in part upon our success in developing new and advanced led lighting solutions and introducing these products at competitive prices on a timely basis   intellectual property   ulcul listings   we have over  ul files which include ul listings for over  products

connection with transactions in penny stocks penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system   as of the date of this report our common stock is defined as a “penny stock” under the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” it is anticipated that our common stock will remain a penny stock for the foreseeable future the classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a brokerdealer to sell the stock into a secondary market which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate hisher investment any brokerdealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in us will be subject to rules g through g of the exchange act rather than creating a need to comply with those rules some brokerdealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock   the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the sec which     table of contents      · contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading · contains a description of the brokers or dealers duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such

operations are influenced by general economic conditions we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during the year ended december     offbalance sheet arrangements   we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december   and    critical accounting policies and estimates   the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions     we define critical accounting policies as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and which may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions  in applying these critical accounting policies our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates  these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty     table of contents      purchase accounting for acquisitions   acquisition of a business requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition  any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill  we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques primarily discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses  these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry and economic factors the profitability of future business strategies discount rates and cash flow  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information we may be exposed to an impairment charge in the future   impairment of longlived assets   we periodically evaluate whether the carrying value of longlived assets has been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable  the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset  if the carrying value is not recoverable the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value   our impairment analyses require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows as well as asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets assessing the probability of different outcomes and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows if the carrying value is not recoverable we assess the fair value of longlived assets using commonly accepted techniques and may use more than one method including but not limited to recent third party comparable sales and discounted cash flow models  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information we may be exposed to an impairment charge in the future     table of contents      contingent liabilities   we accrue a loss for contingencies if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimable when no accrual is made because one or both of these conditions does not exist we disclose the contingency if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred we estimate contingent liabilities based on the best information we have available at the time if we have a range of possible outcomes we accrue the low end of the range   debt with equitylinked features   we issue debt that may have separate conversion features or no equitylinked attributes   when we issue debt with a conversion feature we must first assess whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative  if the conversion feature within convertible debt meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative we estimate the fair value of the convertible debt derivative using blackscholes upon the date of issuance using the stock price on the date of issuance the risk free interest rate associated with the life of the debt and the estimated volatility of our stock  if the conversion feature is not treated as a derivative we assess whether it is a beneficial conversion feature “bcf”  a bcf exists if the conversion price of the convertible debt instrument is less than the stock price on the commitment date  this typically occurs when the conversion price is less than the fair value of the stock on the date the instrument was issued  the value of a bcf is equal to the intrinsic value of the feature the difference between the conversion price and the common stock into which it is convertible   item a

consolidated financial statements   note  – description of business and summary of significant accounting policies   formation of the company   exeled holdings inc was incorporated in the state of delaware on october   under the name “verilink corporation” we have also been known as energie holdings inc and alas aviation corp on december   we entered into a share exchange agreement the “share exchange agreement” with oelc llc a delaware limited liability company and its whollyowned subsidiary energie llc hereinafter referred to as “energie” the share exchange agreement was not effective until july   due to a variety of conditions subsequent that needed to be met which are described below upon effectiveness we issued  “restricted” shares of our common stock representing approximately  of our then issued and outstanding voting securities in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding member interests of energie the accounting is identical to that resulting from a reverse acquisition except that no goodwill or other intangible is recorded   thereafter on january   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” with two of our then wholly owned subsidiaries energie holdings inc and alas acquisition company the net effect of the merger agreement was to effectuate a name change from alas aviation corp to energie holdings inc in order to provide a better understanding to investors of our entry into the led lighting industry our management also changed   all references herein to “us” “we” “our” “holdings” or the “company” refer to exeled holdings inc and its subsidiaries and their respective business following the consummation of the merger and share exchange agreements unless the context otherwise requires   description of business   we are focused on acquiring and growing specialized led lighting companies for the architecture and interior design markets for both commercial and residential applications the lighting products include both conventional fixtures and advanced solidstate technology that can integrate with digital controls and daylighting to create energy efficiencies and a better visual environment our objective is to grow innovate and fully capture the rapidly growing lighting market opportunities associated with solid state lighting   energie was founded in  and is engaged in the import and sale of specialized interior lighting solutions to the architecture and interior design markets in north america our headquarters is located in arvada colorado and we also maintain a production and assembly facility in zeeland michigan   basis of presentation   our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions furthermore when testing assets for impairment in future periods if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur impairment charges may result   going concern   as shown in the accompanying financial statements we had an equity deficit of  and a working capital deficit of  as of december   and have reported net losses of  and  respectively for the years ended december   and   these factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern      table of contents      our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to further implement our business plan attract additional capital and ultimately upon our ability to develop future profitable operations we intend to fund our business development acquisition endeavors and operations through equity and debt financing arrangements however there can be no assurance that these arrangements will be sufficient to fund our ongoing capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern additionally current economic conditions in the united states and globally create significant challenges attaining sufficient funding   some of our debt agreements are due on demand if demand for payment is made by one or multiple vendors we would experience a liquidity issue as we do not currently have the funds available to pay off these debts while we have entered into extensions with several of our lenders there can be no assurances that any of the lenders will be cooperative or that if they are willing to provide extensions or forbearances that the terms under which they may be willing to provide them will be favorable to us   reclassifications   certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation   summary of significant accounting policies   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand deposits with banks and investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase   accounts receivable   we record accounts receivable at net realizable value this value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances and is charged to other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations we calculate this allowance based on our history of writeoffs the level of pastdue accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables and our relationships with and the economic status of our customers   at our discretion we may sell our accounts receivable with recourse in order to accelerate the receipt of cash upon the sale of selected accounts receivable title transfers to the counterparty to the factoring agreement we receive  of the face amount sold and we remove the account receivable from our balance we pay a commission and if the balance is not collected by the counterparty within  days a factoring fee we are responsible for repaying the factoring counterparty for any amounts they are unable to collect the factoring counterparty retains a reserve in the event the amount they ultimately collect is less than the amount paid to us depending on the volume of activity and uncollected accounts therefore we may have a receivable from or a liability to the factoring counterparty   inventory   inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout method “fifo” to determine cost we monitor inventory cost compared to selling price in order to determine if a lower of cost or market reserve is necessary we also estimate and maintain an inventory reserve as needed for such matters as obsolete inventory shrink and scrap   intangible assets   our intangible assets consist of the following   ul listings – energie has over  united laboratories tm “ul” files which include ul listings for over  products for sale in the united states and canada ul is an independent safety testing laboratory a ul listing means that ul has tested representative samples of the product and determined that it meets ul’s requirements these requirements are based primarily on ul’s published and nationally recognized standards for safety ul’s testing certifies the design construction and assembly of the certified products ul listings do not expire as long as the product certified is not materially changed ownership of a ul listing may also be transferred between companies most customers in the lighting industry will only buy ul listed products     table of contents      trademarks – energie is a registered trademark   marketing and design – these consist of engineering and marketing materials covering the majority of our product offerings   intangible assets are recorded at the cost to acquire the intangible net of amortization over their estimated useful lives on a straightline basis we determine the useful lives of our intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset the historical performance of the asset our longterm strategy for using the asset any laws or other local regulations that could impact the useful life of the asset and other economic factors including competition and specific market conditions   property and equipment   property and equipment are stated at cost depreciation is recorded using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our assets which are reviewed periodically   impairment of longlived assets   when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of longlived assets may not be recoverable management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of revenues and the resulting gross profit and cash flows these estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount we recognize an impairment loss the impairment loss recognized if any is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value we may use a variety of methods to determine the fair value of these assets including discounted cash flow models which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use   we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of longlived assets prior to completing the impairment test described above we must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the longlived assets is less than their carrying amount if we conclude that this is the case we must perform the test described above otherwise we do not need to perform any further assessment   as a result of applying the above procedures we fully impaired all longlived assets during the year ended december   since that time we have not acquired any longlived assets   warranty reserve   we provide limited product warranty for one year on our products and accordingly accrue an estimate of the related warranty expense at the time of sale included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets   convertible debt   we first evaluate our convertible debt to determine whether the conversion feature is an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation and derivative treatment based on our analysis we determined derivative treatment was not required we then evaluate whether the conversion feature is a beneficial conversion feature our convertible debt is treated as a liability and permits settlement in cash accordingly in order to determine the value of the conversion feature we compared the estimated fair value of the convertible debt to the fair value of debt that did not have the conversion feature based on this analysis we concluded that the value of the conversion feature was immaterial     table of contents      revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when the four revenue recognition criteria are met as follows   · persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists – our customary practice is to obtain written evidence typically in the form of a sales contract or purchase order · delivery – when custody is transferred to our customers either upon shipment to or receipt at our customers’ locations with no right of return or further obligations such as installation · the price is fixed or determinable – prices are typically fixed at the time the order is placed and no price protections or variables are offered and · collectability is reasonably assured – we typically work with businesses with which we have a long standing relationship as well as monitoring and evaluating customers’ ability to pay     refunds and returns which are minimal are recorded as a reduction of revenue payments received by customers prior to our satisfying the above criteria are recorded as unearned income in the consolidated balance sheets   shipping and handling   payments by customers to us for shipping and handling costs are included in revenue on the consolidated statements of operations while our expense is included in cost of revenues shipping and handling for inventory and materials purchased by us is included as a component of inventory on the consolidated balance sheets and in cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations when the product is sold   research and development costs   internal costs related to research and development efforts on existing or potential products are expensed as incurred external costs incurred for intangible assets such as ul listing costs and attorney fees for patents are capitalized   income taxes   we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting carrying amount of our assets and liabilities we monitor our deferred tax assets and evaluate the need for a valuation allowance based on the estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that we believe do not meet the morelikelythannot recognition criteria we also evaluate whether we have any uncertain tax positions and would record a reserve if we believe it is morelikelythannot our position would not prevail with the applicable tax authorities our assessment of tax positions as of december   and  determined that there were no material uncertain tax positions   concentration of credit risk   financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of accounts receivable and the amount due if any from our factoring counterparty for the year ended december   one customer represented more than  of our total revenues as of december   our accounts receivable balance was not material to the overall consolidated financial statements     table of contents      fair value of financial instruments   our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable accrued liabilities and longterm debt the carrying value of these financial instruments is considered to be representative of their fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments the carrying amount of our longterm debt approximates fair value because the interest rates on these instruments approximate the interest rate on debt with similar terms available to us   fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable as follows   level  – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  – inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities   level  – unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities   reportable segments   we have identified our operating segments our chief operating decision maker “codm” and the discrete financial information reviewed by the codm after evaluating this information we have determined that we have one reportable segment   recently issued accounting pronouncements   in july  the fasb issued asu no  asu   inventory topic  simplifying the measurement of inventory  asu  more closely aligns the measurement of inventory in gaap with the measurement of inventory in international financial reporting standards ifrs as such an entity should measure inventory that is within the scope of this asu at the lower of cost and net realizable value we do not expect the impact of the adoption of asu  to be material to our consolidated financial statements   in september  the fasb issued asu no  asu   business combinations topic  simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments  asu  requires an acquirer to “recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined” further the acquirer must record in the financial statements for the same period “the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects if any as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date” we do not expect the impact of the adoption of asu  to be material to our consolidated financial statements   in november  the fasb issued asu no  asu   balance sheet classification of deferred taxes topic   the guidance in this new standard eliminated the current requirement to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet and now requires entities to classify all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent public companies are required to apply the guidance beginning with the quarter ending march   we do not expect the impact of the adoption of asu  to be material to our consolidated financial statements     table of contents      in february  the fasb issued asu no   leases topic   asu  asu  requires that lessees will be required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than  months asu  also will require disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases these disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information for public companies the standard will take effect for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of asu  on our financial statements   in march  the fasb issued asu no   compensation—stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  asu  which simplifies several aspects of accounting for sharebased payment transactions including income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities classification on the statement of cash flows and accounting for forfeitures asu  is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   we are currently evaluating the impact of asu  on our financial statements   in april  the fasb issued asu no   revenue from contracts with customers topic  identifying performance obligations and licensing  asu  asu  amends the new revenue recognition standard that it issued jointly with the iasb in  the amendments do not change the core principles of the standard but clarify the accounting for licenses of intellectual property as well as the identification of distinct performance obligations in a contract we are currently evaluating the impact of asu  on our financial statements   in may  the fasb issued asu no   revenue recognition topic  and derivatives and hedging topic  rescission of sec guidance because of accounting standards updates  and  pursuant to staff announcements at the march   eitf meeting  asu  asu  rescinds  certain sec

no   statement of cash flows topic  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments  asu  stakeholders indicated that there is a diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows asu  addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice asu  is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted we do not expect the impact of the adoption of asu  to have a significant impact on our statement of cash flows   other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb and the sec did not or management believes will not have a material impact on our present

consulting firm at the time the notes were made as of january   the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of  of the volume weighted average market price of our stock over the  days preceding the notification of conversion we determined that this conversion feature does not meet the requirements to be treated as a derivative however we did determine it was a beneficial conversion feature accordingly we recorded a debt discount of  which was amortized through interest expense over the life of the notes we also owe now cfo  in accounts payable   d  – notes

and conditions normally included in instruments of this kind including a right of first refusal wherein we have granted the holders the right to match the terms of any future financing in which we engage on the same terms and contemplated in such future financing we estimate that the fair value of the conversion feature is minimal so no value has been assigned to the beneficial conversion feature during the year ended december    of principal and  of accrued interest was converted into  shares of common stock we also recorded a loss on conversion of debt of  related to these transactions subsequent to december   we paid off the remaining  of principal on one of the notes leaving one note outstanding as of the date of this report   debt issuance costs of  are being

note  – net loss per share   basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net income by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period diluted net loss per share is computed similarly to basic net loss per share except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities are exercised in a net loss position however potential securities are excluded because they are considered antidilutive since energie the “predecessor company” was an llc it did not have common shares outstanding prior to the share exchange on july   accordingly we have prepared the calculation of net loss per share using the weightedaverage number of common shares of holdings that were outstanding during the years ended december   and      table

accounting and financial disclosure   none   item a controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december   the end of the period covered by this report  based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses discussed below   internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules af and df promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the board management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap and includes those policies and procedures that   · pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures of are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements     table of contents      because of our inherent limitations our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting were as follows a we have limited entitylevel controls because of the time constraints for our management team b we have a lack of segregation of duties due to limited personnel c we have not implemented adequate systembased and manual controls and d we do not have an audit committee   our management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december    in making this assessment

person and no officer or director is acting on behalf of nor will any of them act at the direction of any other person the offices of president chief executive officer treasurer chief financial officer and secretary are appointed by our board of directors with other officer’s positions being filled by appointment from our president and chief executive officer directors are elected by our shareholders vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by majority vote from the remaining members of the board of directors or by a majority vote of our shareholders in each case directors serve until their earlier resignation or their successors are duly elected and qualified   director independence   we are not an issuer whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange or an interdealer quotation system which has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent under nasdaq rule aa a director is not considered to be independent if he or she also is an executive officer or employee of the corporation under such definition harold hansen our sole director would not be considered independent     table of contents      board committees   we presently do not have an audit committee compensation committee or nominating committee or committees performing similar functions as our management believes that until this point it has been premature at the early stage of our management and business development to form committees however our new management plans to form an audit compensation and nominating committee in the near future the implementation of which is likely to be in connection with our next contemplated acquisition we envision that the audit committee will be primarily responsible for reviewing the services performed by our independent auditors and evaluating our accounting policies and system of internal controls we envision that the compensation committee will be primarily responsible for reviewing and approving our salary and benefits policies including stock options and other compensation of our executive officers the nominating committee would be primarily responsible for nominating directors and setting policies and procedures for the nomination of directors the nominating committee would also be responsible for overseeing the creation and implementation of our corporate governance policies and procedures until these committees are established these decisions will continue to be made by our board although our board has not established any minimum qualifications for director candidates when considering potential director candidates our board considers the candidate’s character judgment skills   we do not have a charter governing the nominating process our sole director will initially perform the functions of a nominating committee but is not independent because he is also an officer there has not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors our board does not believe that a defined policy with regard to the consideration of candidates recommended by stockholders is necessary at this time because given the early stages of our development a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations are at a more advanced level   section a beneficial ownership reporting compliance   section a of the exchange act requires our officers and directors and persons owning more than ten percent of the common stock to file initial reports of ownership and changes in

generally limits the corporate income tax deductions to  annually for compensation paid to each of the chief executive officer and our other six highest paid executive officers required to be reported under the proxy disclosure rules   as of the date of this report no shares or options to purchase any shares have been granted we believe that the plan will be an important factor in attracting retaining and motivating our employees consultants agents and directors we believe that we need the flexibility both to have an ongoing reserve of common stock available for future equitybased awards

remaining balance of the notes to equity at a rate equal to the proportion of the remaining balance of the note divided by  enterprise value this note was considered to be in default as of december   therefore the note holder has the right to exercise the conversion option but has not yet elected to do so we evaluated this agreement for derivatives and determined that it does not qualify for derivative treatment for financial reporting purposes because the agreement relates to our own equity and the debt and the equity are not closely related we also determined this does not qualify as a

hear about a lighting company based out of colorado their first inclination is it’s another supplier who plans to target the marijuana sector with their state of the art led products  nothing could be further from the truth for energie holdings inc otcqb eled who’s product line is listed to have been in with some of the top fortune  companies and higher education facilities throughout the us  after any penny stock trader spends the minutes it takes to do some research on the seller and distributor of led energy efficient products seeing why the lights have been turned on for eled stock displays what a bit of time can be worth     energie holdings provides its customers three product lines pendant surface recessed and semirecessed versions  comprised of  led fixtures that were to be introduced to the market during the second quarter of  top line numbers for q should show some further improvement with these awardwinning fixtures that combine handblown glass with modern led technology being a part of their revenue stream from offices restaurants hotels and public buildings visiting the company’s website to see their customer base microsoft british petroleum bp honda and jp morgan are just a couple of the alisters there  although revenues only grew by about  to  for q when compared to the  reported for q  there are some internal items that make eled stock a bright one a year ago on july   the company completed a share exchange agreement with energie which called for the issuance of  “restricted” shares of eled stock at  per share  with just  shares issued and outstanding that  million share float immediately puts this subpenny on the must watch list digging into the debt of energie holdings many will immediately shut the page when they see  due  of which

it  entered into in december  is held by symbiote inc with monthly principal and interest payable through november   symbiote holds the largest ownership percentage in energie holdings is the lessor of their manufacturing facility and the provider of the company’s payroll services what’s more of a bullish reason to be paying close attention to eled stock is that of the  of convertible notes due between may and december of this year portions can be converted at a rate of  of the average closing bid price of eled stock during the  trading days immediately preceding the date of conversion  during the three month period ended march    of principal was converted into  shares which works out to be  per share  using that as a guideline eled stock rightfully has earned it’s shine when it
