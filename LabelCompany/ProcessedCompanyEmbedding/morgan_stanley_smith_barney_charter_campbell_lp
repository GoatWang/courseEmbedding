analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services its assets are the partnerships capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by net realized andor unrealized gains or losses on trading and by expenses interest income and redemptions of units for the nine months ended september   the partnership capital decreased  from  to  this decrease was attributable to redemptions of  limited partners units totaling  and redemptions of  general partner units totaling  coupled with a net loss of  future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for investments in subsequent periods critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the general partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period the general partner believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable actual results could differ from those estimates the partnerships significant accounting policies are described in detail in note  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies of the financial statements the partnership records all investments at fair value in their financial statements with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains losses and net change in unrealized gains losses in the statements of income and expenses the general partner estimates that at any given time approximately  to  of the partnerships contracts are traded overthecounter    table of contents results of operations general the partnerships results depend on the trading advisor and the ability of the trading advisors trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures forward and options markets the trading advisor trades the partnerships assets in accordance with its financial metal  energy large portfolio a proprietary systematic trading program the trading models utilized in the trading advisors trading program are designed to detect and exploit mediumterm to longterm price changes while also applying risk management and portfolio management principles the trading advisor believes that utilizing multiple trading models provides an important level of diversification and is most beneficial when multiple contracts of each market are traded every trading model may not trade every market it is possible that one trading model may signal a long position while another trading model signals a short position in the same market it is the trading advisors intention to offset those signals to reduce unnecessary trading but if the signals are not simultaneous both trades will be taken and since it is unlikely that both positions would prove profitable in retrospect one or both trades will appear to have been unnecessary it is the trading advisors policy to follow trades signaled by each trading model independently of the other models the following presents a summary of the partnerships operations for the three and nine months ended september   and  and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period it is important to note however that the trading advisor trades in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisor or will be profitable in the future consequently the results of operations of the partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the trading advisors trading activities on behalf of the partnership during the period in question past performance is no guarantee of future results the partnerships results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements including the following the contracts the partnership trades are accounted for on a tradedate basis and marked to market on a daily basis the difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the statements of income and expenses as net change in unrealized gains losses on open contracts and recorded as net realized gains losses on closed contracts when open positions are closed out the sum of these amounts constitutes the partnerships trading results the market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day the value of a foreign currency forward contract is based on the spot rate as of approximately  pm et the close of the business day interest income as well as management fees incentive fees general partner fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the partnership are recorded on an accrual basis the general partner believes that based on the nature of the operations of the partnership no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts    table of contents during the

clearing commodity broker in separate futures forward and options trading accounts established for the trading advisor such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the partnerships trading the assets are held either in noninterest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the cftc for investment of customer segregated or secured funds since the partnerships sole purpose is to trade in futures forwards options and us treasury bills it is expected that the partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes the partnerships investment in futures forwards options and us treasury bills may from time to time be illiquid most us futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit if the price for a particular futures or options contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading these market conditions could prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or options contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions there is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies the markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid which may prevent the partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets subjecting it to substantial losses either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions for the periods covered by this report illiquidity has not materially affected the partnerships assets there are no known material trends demands commitments events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the partnerships liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way as of june   approximately  of the partnerships total investment exposure is futures contracts which are exchangetraded while approximately  is forward contracts which are offexchange traded capital resources the partnership does not have nor does it expect to have any capital assets the partnerships only assets are its equity in trading accounts consisting of restricted and unrestricted cash net unrealized income on open contracts and investment in us treasury bills if applicable redemptions of units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in futures forwards options and us treasury bills in subsequent periods it is not possible to estimate the amount and therefore the impact of future outflows of units    table of contents there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable that would affect nor any expected material changes to the partnerships capital resource arrangements at the present time offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the partnership does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments that would affect its liquidity or capital resources results of operations general the partnerships results depend on the trading advisor and the ability of the trading advisors trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures forward and options markets the trading advisor trades the partnerships assets in accordance with its financial metal  energy large portfolio a proprietary systematic trading program the trading models utilized in the trading advisors trading program are designed to detect and exploit mediumterm to longterm price changes while also applying risk management and portfolio management principles the trading advisor believes that utilizing multiple trading models provides an important level of diversification and is most beneficial when multiple contracts of each market are traded every trading model may not trade every market it is possible that one trading model may signal a long position while another trading model signals a short position in the same market it is the trading advisors intention to offset those signals to reduce unnecessary trading but if the signals are not simultaneous both trades will be taken and since it is unlikely that both positions would prove profitable in retrospect one or both trades will appear to have been unnecessary it is the trading advisors policy to follow trades signaled by each trading model independently of the other models the following presents a summary of the partnerships operations for the three and six months ended june   and  and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period it is important to note however that the trading advisor trades in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisor or will be profitable in the future consequently the results of operations of the partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the trading advisors trading activities on behalf of the partnership during the period in question past performance is no guarantee of future results the partnerships results of operations set forth in the financial statements on pages  through  of this report are prepared in accordance with gaap which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements including the following the contracts the partnership trades are accounted for on a tradedate basis and marked to market on a daily basis the difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded on the statements of income and expenses as net change in unrealized trading profit loss on open contracts and recorded as net realized trading profit loss when open positions are closed out the sum of these amounts constitutes the partnerships trading results the market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day the value of a foreign currency forward contract is based on the spot rate as of approximately  pm et the close of the business day interest income as well as management fees incentive fees brokerage fees administrative fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the partnership are recorded on an accrual basis    table of contents the general partner believes that based on the nature of the operations of the partnership no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts for the three and six months ended june   the partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling  and
