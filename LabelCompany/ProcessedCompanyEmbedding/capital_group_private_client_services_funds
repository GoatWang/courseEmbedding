team grew capital group into one of the largest and most respected investment management companies in the business today the organization has more than  associates offices around the globe and more than  trillion in assets under management lovelace was a pioneer in the industry and guided capital group to become one of the first investment firms to embrace the now widely accepted practice of global investing despite capital’s incredible growth over the years people often say they don’t know much about us that’s largely because the firm prefers to keep its eye on doing what’s best for clients — and we tend to avoid the media spotlight as a privately held organization capital group strives to generate superior longterm results not to become famous nevertheless it’s likely that you are familiar with our affiliate american funds which is one of the nation’s largest mutual fund families capital group is well known on wall street and in csuite boardrooms because of our outstanding

others in addition to constructing the trust with a legal professional selecting the right trustee to administer your assets is one of the most important aspects of the estate planning process after all your trustee is charged with carrying out your wishes well into the future it is critical to choose a trustee you can depend on with the experience to get the job done video key considerations when appointing a trustee selecting a trustee choosing the right trustee to administer your assets is one of the most important aspects of estate planning it is essential to appoint someone you can completely trust — ideally with a long track record and experience working with many types of trust vehicles though some people choose friends or relatives for this role appointing a corporate trustee
