making the rate of cancer cases in the area  percent higher than the national average and suggesting a possible correlation to the plant drinking water contaminated with toxic hexavalent chromium found at indian river site a report released by earthjustice and the sierra club in early february  stated that there are many health threats associated with a toxic cancercausing chemical found in coal ash waste called hexavalent chromium the report specifically cited  sites in  states where the contamination was found the information was gathered from existing epa data on coal ash and included locations in alabama arkansas delaware florida illinois indiana minnesota massachusetts north carolina north dakota nevada ohio oklahoma pennsylvania tennessee virgina and wisconsin in delaware the indian river power station in millsboro where chromium was reportedl according to epa data the indian river coal ash site is an unlined landfill that is closed hexavalent chromium crvi was reported at the site above  ppb parts per billion   times the proposed california drinking water goals and  times above the federal drinking water standard as a press release about the report read hexavalent chromium first made headlines after erin brockovich sued pacific gas  electric because of poisoned drinking water from hexavalent chromium now new information indicates that the chemical has readily leaked from coal ash sites across the us this is likely the tip of the iceberg because most coal ash dump sites are not adequately monitored coal ash disposal burton island  burton island was owned by delmarva power and light company “dpl” which used burton island to dispose of coal ash waste from dpl’s coalfired indian river generating station’s “irgs” from  through  in  dpl began disposing the

solid waste until   from  to  dpl sluiced ash from the coal burners onto the eastern  of burton island berms were built from ash and dredge spoils excess water ran into indian river or island creek this resulted in the elevation of the ground surface by about ± feet over roughly  acres of the island and the wholesale conversion of tidal marshes and flats to upland “fly ash was used to construct a perimeter berm system berms were constructed at a height of approximately  feet consisting of approximately a  foot base of soil  feet of fly ash and a  foot cap of bottom ash by the mid ’s the system of berms and access roadways was completed on the eastern end of the island” on july th  dnrec secretary john hughes issued an order approving the “final plan of remedial action for burton
