by chirag kulkarni chirag kulkarni is a serial entrepreneur speaker and adviser chiragkulkarni cofounder and ceo insightfullychiragkulkarni  comments credit getty images disruption is what every entrepreneur hopes for when they start a business this hope doesnt only stem to create a viable business but to make severe impact on their customers and the world around them take a business that disrupted the taxi industry uber they took the concerns with the traditional taxi model empowered people that had cars to become chauffeurs for others and eliminated the entire need of taxis altogether a site that is the definition of disruption is everipedia i spoke to cofounder mahbod moghadam formerly cofounder of rap genius aka genius about how everipedia is disrupting wikipedia and the process he uses to disrupt any industry  find a pain in a system like most industries there is usually one glaring issue and concern that customers or people that work specifically with a business or organization experience for example with wikipedia around a thousand articles get deleted every week and yet even with its relatively small number of pages alexa deems wikipedia the thlargest site in the world so instead with everipedia you can make an article about anything or anyone and the format is simple enough that you can add information from your phone similarly wikipedia has no social element to their pages versus everipedia has implemented social features that allow for example celebrities to share and interact with fans thirdly contributing to wikipedia doesnt attach any goal or purpose versus everipedia takes the iq points for contributing to everipedia and the plan is for iq to someday be interchangeable for equity in the site contributors who put up a lot of collegerelated pages can be appointed campus representatives lastly everipedias philosophical difference from wikipedia of taking citations from anywhere bring a unique feel to the everipedia for moghadam these are the immediate problems and need for a viable solution  get feedback on the pain when moghadam started using wikipedia he learned very quickly that the people that use wikipedia are very peculiar most of the dedicated editors are white single males similarly he began to reach out to other peers that tried using wikipedia to learn more about what success and failures they had with the product to get heavily involved in wikipedia you need to know wiki markup which is kind of like a coding language this results in a lot of consistent often bigoted biases in the content wikipedia deems notable there arent many dedicated contributors to wikipedia so a small group is in control its hard for outsiders to get involved especially because the site is difficult to use another great tip when you are getting iterative feedback on the pain and product is to keep it simple for your consumers one of my all time favorite examples of keeping it simple is whatsapp which was acquired by facebook for  billion dollars a simple concept with the kiss keep it simple stupid concept clear for everipedia the biggest difference between everipedia and wikipedia is similarity to popular products such as facebook  wikipedia was built in  and it hasnt changed much everipedia is new it feels the same way facebook feels this adds an element of stickiness for consumers which allows them to adopt to products quicker  implement the solution and iterate once you have discovered a major pain that people have and received feedback on the pain and the potential solutions the importance is to push a simple product that people can give you feedback on and continue the iterative process for moghadam he quickly launched the site after receiving iterative feedback from his prospective users and to this date is receiving astronomical growth how will you disrupt an industry  the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not those of inccom published on jan   editors  everipedia
