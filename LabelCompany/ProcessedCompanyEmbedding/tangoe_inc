   exhibit index   exhibit no   description          tangoe inc faq distributed on april      exhibit    frequently asked questions   general questions                  where will headquarters be located   this is to be determined we will announce the location when we close the transaction                  what will be the company name tangoe                  who will be the ceo of the merged companies  other executives   jim foy is expected to be the ceo of the combined company tim whitehorn the ceo of asentinel is expected to become the chief product officer of the combined company we will continue to update everyone on the rest of the executive team as we complete the transaction                  is the deal definite   the deal is contingent upon a successful tender of shares and completion of a goshop period of  days during which our investment bankers will seek higher bids for the company                  if the deal happens when will it close we expect the deal to close in late q                  when will integration between the two companies start happening the integration will begin happening immediately after the close                  what are the remaininggating factors for the deal to close see                   is the plan for tangoe to go public again   that is a possibility in the future and depends on many factors the plan is to establish tangoe as the preeminent company in our industry and to provide sustainable growth   customer questions                  what does this mean for customers   this is very positive news for customers assuming the deal closes tangoe will be backed by a wellcapitalized  billion techfocused private equity fund removing the uncertainty that has plagued us since the restatement was announced the merger would bring the best of tangoe and asentinel together these are two great companies that truly believe in delivering excellent customer service by leveraging the best from both companies customers would have access to the most robust technology solutions available on the market and more importantly the best and brightest in the industry                  will i be required to move off my existing platform   we will continue to provide support for all our platforms currently one of our key goals is to develop the best products and services in the industry we plan to combine the intellectual property of both companies to have the most advanced solutions we will     proactively communicate our roadmap as we progress on the closing of the transaction and integration                  what does this mean for tangoe live   tangoe live will continue as communicated prior to the transaction announcement and is a great event which will provide us with a very timely opportunity to share additional details                  will tangoe and asentinel be reducing rd investment going forward   assuming the deal closes the rd teams will be combined in the newly merged tangoe as with any merger of this nature we will continuously review our requirements and ensure we have the correct level of investment for the products and capabilities that our customers need                  will cost cutting after the acquisition and merger reduce my service levels   customer satisfaction is key and critical to the success of our company our mission will be to improve customer service levels and customer satisfaction scores                  will i have the same contacts working on my account after the acquisition and merger   we will review all accounts and how they are managed today we will do everything possible to provide continuity and consistency we fully appreciate how account changes can be disruptive and will do everything possible to ensure maximum customer success                  will existing customer msas and sows remain in full effect   yes the change in tangoes stock ownership and the combination of the two companies would not affect existing agreements                  will the current slas be honored andor improved   current slas will be honored  the change in tangoes stock ownership and the combination of the two companies would not affect existing agreements                  how will customer communications be handled   in the period before closing each respective company will communicate frequently with customers as the transaction progresses if and when the transaction is closed we will continue regular customer communication to ensure we are all well connected with our strategy           does this change the tangoe platform release schedule   the tangoe platform is an incredible product and we are very excited with the response we have had we do want to ensure that we can add the capabilities and automation that asentinel would be able to bring to the combined company therefore we will review if we must make any adjustments to the product andor its release date and communicate that as soon as possible   employee questions                  what does this mean for me   this is a great opportunity for both tangoe and asentinel employees marlin is a well     funded organization that will bring great operational skills and resources to make the combined company the leader in our space                  what about my rsusstock optionsequity that i was told would have been granted to me if the company was able   in the money options would be cashed out as part of the transaction at their net value  minus the exercise price  options that are not in the money the exercise price is more than  would be canceled at closing   shares that should have been issued prior to closing upon rsu vesting dates but that have not been issued because of the restatement would be cashed out at  per share as part of the transaction unless you have an individual agreement that provides for some other outcome unvested rsus would be canceled and replacement equity may be issued in the new company   equity awards that you were told would have been made if the company were able to do so and that would have vested prior to closing including intended stock awards would be cashed out at  per share at closing unless you have an individual agreement that provides for some other outcome portions of these intended equity awards that would have been unvested at closing would be canceled and replacement equity may be issued in the new company we will share details once we are closer to closing the transaction                  will positions be eliminated   with any transaction that combines two great companies there will be some overlap of functions and some headcount adjustments will be inevitable we expect to provide full details when the deal closes position eliminations are never easy but we commit to managing a fair process to ensure everyone is treated with the utmost respect                  should i reach out to my counterpart at asentinel   absolutely not as we are currently two companies we must continue to operate as separate companies until we officially close                  what happens to my benefits   we will be rolling out a consistent benefit program for all employees in the new company details will be communicated as we get closer to closing                  will offices be closing   we will want to maximize the teams working out of offices together in that light we will be reviewing all locations to maximize our relationships with employees and with customers                  does asentinel do everything we do   from a mobile and fixed tem perspective yes                  what should i do if were competing for the same business   in competitive situations you should continue to compete as you have in the past until the deal closes                    what does this mean for open reqs   all open reqs will be reviewed by senior management to determine next steps but critical hiring will continue where necessary           i work remotely  will i still be able to do that   yes           what are the people at marlin like   marlin has significant experience in the tem space and technology broadly speaking in addition marlin has almost  billion of capital under management and has acquired well over  companies in the last  years with their support we expect tangoe to be very well positioned going forward           what should i tell my customers   we will continue to provide the approved messages for you to share with customers please validate with your manager before sharing anything that is not part of the approved communication package           can i share this on social media   you should never share classified or nonpublic information via social media generally employees should use their best judgement when sharing anything on social media our marketing team will absolutely share our communications through the appropriate channels and provide approved messages at the appropriate time           will my managerboss change   there could be changes however nothing will happen until the deal closes our goal is to ensure we have a strong team that comes from the combination of two great companies however we would like to minimize disruption for our employees           what will happen with the new corporate initiatives such as meritocracy and management training   we will absolutely continue to leverage successful corporate initiatives and internal programs tangoe marlin and asentinel all truly believe in a fair performance management based culture           should i start looking for a job   no we truly believe that the new tangoe will be an exciting and dynamic company that everyone will be proud to work for           will we still audit our financials from the restatement period   as a private company we would no longer be held to the same filing and disclosure laws as we were when we were publicly traded we will ensure that our accounting systems are accurate and well maintained we will also ensure that we work with internal teams and outside auditors to always make sure we are complying with all laws and regulations           why should i feel good about this   combining two great companies with a wellfunded well respected private equity firm like marlin creates an excellent future for our employees and customers             did we take this deal because of a difficult financial position andor we didnt want to share our financials   we did this deal in part because marlin recognized the value we bring but ultimately because the board of directors believes that this is the very best outcome for our shareholders and by the way for our employees and customers   product questions                  what does this mean for the tangoe platform   regarding the tangoe platform our investment in the platform will continue moving forward the combined company and its executives will review if we must make any adjustments to the product andor its release date and communicate that as soon as possible                  will both companies multiple platforms still be supported   yes we recognize the critical nature of tangoes products and services we plan to continue and improve support of all platforms for the foreseeable future   shareholder questions                  what does this announcement mean for the tangoe restatement   the restatement requirements would go away at closing as tangoe will be a private company marlin equity would be the sole owner of tangoe if the deal closes                  why did the board of directors vote to be acquired for    the board of directors evaluated all consideration and concluded that this merger was in the best interest of shareholders and is also in the best interest of employees and customers                  why did this process take so long   this has been a complicated process with several significant events along the way the restatement and delisting being the most significant we have received multiple bids and all options needed to be evaluated                  when will i get my check   in general stockholders would receive payment at closing of the transaction subject to standard requirements related to tendering their shares and returning other documentation                  when will the tender offer come out   we expect that tender documents will be filed with the sec and sent out to registered holders and through brokers within onetotwo weeks   important additional information will be filed with the sec   this faq is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of tangoe     at the time the tender offer is commenced marlin will file with the sec and mail to tangoes stockholders a tender offer statement and tangoe will
