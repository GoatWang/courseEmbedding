bad credit business finance options there is no magic bullet that makes your credit look good if it is not don’t be lured into promises that anyone has any strings to pull or a special way to get you financing that you know you can’t get and do not give anyone money upfront without clearly detailed terms of your financing a commitment deposit or documentation fee upon approval of a credit transaction is fine but you should never have to pay just to have your application processed why can we offer the money to you when no one else can all banks lending institutions and brokers have specific programs available to them either you fit in their mold or you don’t coastal capital group maintains strategic alliances with national lenders as well as our own direct lending sister company structured to fit any request we receive if your business is capable of paying back the debt incurred we can match you with a program we identify the attributes of your business and navigate the various methods of securing capital to provide the funds you need we consider many factors to formulate a solution for your business including type of business your use of funds personal credit profile business credit profile business cash flows collateral availability accounts receivable on hand future sales assumptions bad credit equipment leasing the credit markets have been in turmoil since early  lenders have raised their minimum credit scores and require considerable documentation to consider extending credit at the same time the economic downturn has negatively affected the credit of many businesses and often has spilled over into the business owners’ personal credit profile the combination significantly hinders a business’ ability to purchase new equipment they need to operate many businesses are being turned down for financing equipment repeating the same failed method to get the funds you need will only have the same result failure coastal capital analyzes the business situation and navigates you in the direction that can provide the capital you need if the credit score is the problem we simply use a method that does not rely on credit scores while people are most familiar with credit based lending there are alternatives that will serve your purposes that do not take credit scores into consideration click here for more on equipment leasing sale and leaseback coastal capital group can provide working capital for your business using the equity in the equipment you own if your company owns equipment you can get about half of the wholesale value in cash against it  you make monthly payments over a fixed term and at the end you own it free and clear again the equipment value is the key here…not as much weight is placed on your credit the equipment must have individual wholesale value of at least  to qualify  you can use several pieces as long as they each are worth k or more leasebacks have several common uses including businesses with credit issues or poor financials from a traditional banking viewpoint can still get the working capital they need by leveraging their owned assets secure capital without using your bank lines take debt “off balance sheet” strategic tax planning purposes technically we buy the equipment from you and lease it back to you until all payments are made at which time you own it again free and clear it is a paper transaction  we don’t actually take possession of the equipment good for heavy durable equipment with a standardized wholesale market like trucks and other vehicles construction equipment farm equipment cnc machines forklifts not good for items worth less than k computers and high obsolescent equipment restaurant equipmentvery low wholesale values highly specialized equipment items that wouldn’t have a readily available liquidation value simply complete a standard  page equipment lease application and submit with the details on the equipment you intend to leaseback asset based lending many businesses have equity built up in their existing equipment that they are not utilizing the equipment you paid off over the past years can be leveraged to secure the funds you need for new equipment purchases if you need to address the issue of bad credit equipment leasing businesses can use some owned assets as additional collateral to secure a difficult finance request it’s very simple we offset risk with collateral for bad credit business finance that may or may not be associated with an equipment purchase you can use a sale leaseback to cash in the equity in your equipment and use the funds for any purpose you choose we purchase your equipment for cash and lease it back to you when the debt is paid you own it again cash flow based lending if a business has sufficient cash flow to pay back a loan we can identify that and use it as a basis to structure a lending solution credit scores have no consideration in cash flow based lending we would typically look at the bank statements for the past few months if there is sufficient revenue to cover current expenses and the new debt you qualify you can get approved for bad credit equipment leasing because your credit is not what we’re looking for business credit only lending while the vast majority of small businesses need to have a personal guaranty from the principles for the extension of credit there are circumstances when the business may have good credit but the principle has had negative activity in their personal credit while many business owners try to get credit in the company name alone in an attempt to circumvent their credit problems very few qualify for “corp only” financing divorce other business interests health issues and other factors can damage the owner’s credit but not affect the business that needs the capital if the business is well established  years old or more and has very strong financials it may be possible to extend credit based on the business credit only the principle will still sign but the credit decision is not based on his or her credit score click here for more on equipment leasing alternative business finance options other programs that can

credit bureaus our low rate program utilizes a scoring system that only takes into account the last  years of credit history this is extremely helpful to the many business owners who had credit problems in the recent past but are getting back on their feet you are not penalized for older bad credit history your current ability to repay is what we consider many businesses experienced hard times through the economic crash of  and many business owners credit was affected many were even forced into bankruptcy or mortgage modifications the major credit bureaus used by banks count bad accounts in your score for up to  years if those issues occurred over  years ago they will not be held against you lower cost than common alternatives our small business loans are as low as  of the cost of merchant cash advances but with almost the same easy credit requirements an example of our best tier program has a payback on  of just  over  months the average merchant cash advance for  months would be  for the same funds even our lowest tier approval can save our clients up to half the cost of a merchant advance with the same easy credit requirements these are not merchant cash advances while merchant advances are useful for businesses needing fast funding with an easy repayment structure based on credit card volume our small business short term loans offer loans based on your cash flow at a much lower cost the two most important factors in determining how much your small business qualifies for is you average deposits and average balances credit may affect which program you qualify for from our multiple platforms but we always place you on the platform which will look at your credit most favorably whether it is using a standard score from one of the  credit bureaus or a hybrid model which puts more weight on your more recent credit performance many businesses can benefit from coastal capital’s short term small business loans any business that has regular
