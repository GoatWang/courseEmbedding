near toledo and i am a huge detroit tigers fan unfortunately twc for some strange reason does not offer me fox sports detroit even though i am considered to be in the local market this is the sole reason that i am a direct tv subscriber  i realize that the regional home office for twc is in columbus so they assume that everyone in ohio must love the reds so they offer fso but you guys are missing the boat around here you will not find one single reds fan all indians and tigers but you will find a whole lot of dishes if you guys would offer fsd i can guarantee you at least one
