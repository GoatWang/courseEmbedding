ongoing capital recycling program appraisal gains within our property portfolio totalled  billion in  compared to gains of  billion in the prior year most of the current year gains occurred in our

ltd a leading provider of road fuels in the uk expanding our footprint in the european market we further focused our business and simplified our structure providing improved transparency for investors

perpetual capital as well as providing additional investment options and increased transparency for investors brookfield property partners bpy recently made a proposal to brookfield canada office properties box to acquire the remaining equity interest in box not owned by it or its affiliates acquiring full ownership of box will allow bpy to fully integrate its north american office operations and further simplifies our structure finally we have been able to take advantage of the historically low interest rate environment over the last couple of years including raising proceeds from asset sales and refinanced a significant portion of our debt we continued to recycle capital by selling mature assets and redeploying it for higher returns in our opportunistic funds sales have been in sectors and geographies where we felt we could achieve attractive valuations and either redeploy that capital or return it to investors in total we realized proceeds of approximately  billion in the last two years including  billion in  predominately from core office assets where capitalization rates were favourable as well as assets in our retail and hotel utility and renewable power business in

accumulated carried interest in this fund during this time we also completed a significant number of financings throughout our operating businesses and listed entities at attractive rates we completed more than  billion of financings over the last two years including over  billion in  locking in low rates and extending overall term to an average of seven years on a proportionate basis although rates have risen over the past months we continue to view these to be at attractive levels and therefore intend to continue to execute on refinancing opportunities throughout our business as a result of the foregoing as well as our fundraising activities we finished the year with substantial financial resources with which to pursue future transactions dry powder in our private funds at the end of the quarter was  billion in addition to this we have core liquidity of over  billion of which  billion is at the corporate level with the balance within our listed partnerships trisura group for the past  years we have owned a property and casualty insurance business called trisura guarantee insurance company trisura guarantee which has consistently and profitably grown its operations this business is no longer strategic to brookfield as we focus on our asset management operations and we believe trisura guarantee could benefit from being a standalone company with direct access to the capital markets we are planning to combine trisura guarantee with the rest of our small specialty insurance operations and spin them off by way of a special dividend to holders of brookfields class a and b limited voting shares the dividend estimated to be worth us per brookfield share or approximately us million will take the form of common shares of trisura group ltd an ontario corporation and should occur in the first half of  subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals basis of presentation this news release and accompanying financial statements are based on international financial reporting standards ifrs as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb unless otherwise noted we also make reference to funds from operations ffo we define ffo as net income attributable to shareholders prior to fair value changes depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes and include realized disposition gains that are not recorded in net income as determined under ifrs ffo also includes the companys share of equity accounted investments ffo on a fully diluted basis ffo consists of the following components ffo from operating activities represents the companys share of revenues less direct costs and interest expenses excludes realized carried interest and disposition gains fair value changes depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes and includes our proportionate share of ffo from operating activities recorded by equity accounted investments on a fully diluted basis we present this measure as we believe it assists in describing our results and variances within ffo realized carried interest represents our contractual share of investment gains generated within a private fund after considering our clients minimum return requirements realized carried interest is determined on thirdparty capital that is no longer subject to future investment performance realized disposition gains are included in ffo because we consider the purchase and sale of assets to be a normal part of the companys business realized disposition gains include gains and losses recorded in net income and equity in the current period and are adjusted to include fair value changes and revaluation surplus balances recorded in prior periods which were not included in prior period ffo we use ffo to assess our operating results and the value of brookfields business and believe that many shareholders and analysts also find this measure of value to them we note that ffo its components and its per share equivalent are nonifrs measures which do not have any standard meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies we provide additional information on the determination of ffo and reconciliation between ffo and net income attributable to brookfield shareholders in our quarterly supplemental information and filings available at wwwbrookfieldcom additional information the
