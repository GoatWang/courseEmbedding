fund the fund the investment objective of the fund is a fundamental policy and cannot be changed without the approval of a majority of the funds outstanding shares as with any mutual fund there can be no guarantee that the investment objective of the fund will be achieved investment objective  the funds investment objective is to provide investors with capital appreciation principal investment strategies  the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least  of its assets in a diversified portfolio of us common stocks of smallcap companies the adviser considers a company to be a smallcap company when its market capitalization at the time of purchase is within the market capitalization range of companies in the russell r index at reconstitution each june  million to  billion as of june  the adviser will select portfolio securities which the adviser believes exhibit reasonable valuations and favorable growth prospects the adviser utilizes proprietary quantitative analysis of both value and growth characteristics to rank us smallcap companies valuation and growth characteristics are equally weighted for purposes of ranking potential investment securities valuation analysis is used to determine the inherent value of the company and requires the analysis of financial information such as a companys price to book price to sales return on equity and return on assets ratios growth analysis is used to determine a companys potential for longterm dividends and earnings growth as determined by marketoriented factors such as market share the launch of new products or services the strength of its management and market demand from these analyses the adviser ranks the companies that exhibit stable and growing valuation ratios and the most favorable dividends and earnings prospects and lists them on what it refers to as the focus list the adviser selects portfolio securities for investment by the fund by subjecting the common stocks on the focus list to a qualitative analysis of each companys valuation and growth characteristics in order to determine whether these characteristics are sustainable over the long term such analysis includes a more detailed review of each companys competitive position in its particular market sector its business prospects and financial statements the adviser also regularly conducts interviews with company management and wall street analysts who provide research about a companys common stock in the stock market portfolio securities may be sold as a result of adverse changes in the stock markets generally or to a specific issuer that results in poor relative performance portfolio securities may also be sold if the adviser determines that the valuation and growth characteristics that formed the basis for purchasing a stock no longer meet the criteria for portfolio securities of the fund principal risks of investing in the fund  investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose money the principal risks of investing in the fund are listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value the nav total return and value of the fund and your investment ostock market risks stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks and significant fluctuations in value if the stock market declines in value the fund is likely to decline in value and you could lose money on your investment o stock selection risks the portfolio securities selected by the adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general is rising and may fail to meet the funds investment objective o investment in smallcap companies the fund invests principally in companies with small market capitalization or companies that have relatively small revenues limited product lines and a small share of the market for their products or services collectively small companies small companies are also characterized by the following i they may lack depth of management ii they may be unable to internally generate funds necessary for growth or potential development or to generate such funds through external financing on favorable terms and iii they may be developing or marketing new products or services for which markets are not yet established and may never become established due to these and other factors small companies may suffer significant losses as well as realize substantial growth thus securities of small companies present greater risks than securities of larger more established companies if the fund is heavily invested in these securities the nav of the fund will be more susceptible to sudden and significant losses if the value of these securities decline you could lose money on your investment in the fund or the fund may not perform as well as other possible investments the fund does not constitute a balanced or complete investment program and the nav of its shares will fluctuate based on the value of the securities held by the fund who may want to invest in the fund we designed the fund for investors desiring an investment alternative and who seek one or more of the following o a longterm investment horizon o longterm capital appreciation o a stock fund to compliment a portfolio of more conservative investments o a stock fund that uses a balanced approach of value and growth investing andor o a

strategies  the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least  of its assets in a diversified portfolio of us common stocks of smallcap companies the adviser considers a company to be a smallcap company when its market capitalization at the time of purchase is within the market capitalization range of companies in the russell r index at reconstitution each june  million to  billion as of june  the adviser will select portfolio securities which the adviser believes exhibit reasonable valuations and favorable growth prospects under normal market conditions the fund will invest at least  of its assets in equity securities of smallcap companies this is not a fundamental policy and may be changed by the board without a vote of shareholders upon sixty  days prior notice the adviser utilizes proprietary quantitative analysis of both value and growth characteristics to rank us smallcap companies valuation and growth characteristics are equally weighted for purposes of

regularly conducts interviews with company management and wall street analysts who provide research about a companys common stock in the stock market the adviser will constantly monitor the funds investment portfolio positions for adverse changes in the funds investment portfolio portfolio securities may be sold as a result of adverse changes in the stock markets generally or to a specific issuer that results in poor relative performance portfolio securities may also be sold if the adviser determines that the valuation and growth characteristics that formed the basis for purchasing a stock no longer meet the criteria for portfolio securities of the fund temporary defensive strategy  at times the fund may employ temporary defensive strategies in response to unfavorable economic market political or other conditions at such times the fund may increase its cash reserves without limit by holding high quality shortterm debt securities and money market instruments and by entering into repurchase agreements these investments are inconsistent with the funds primary investment strategies as a result during these periods the fund may not achieve its objective portfolio turnover  as stated above the adviser recognizes that investment management is a dynamic process and thus will constantly monitor and reevaluate the funds investments in order to maximize to the extent possible the capital appreciation of the investment portfolio this process allows the adviser to determine whether any of the funds investments have lost value or whether securities not held by the fund seem poised for growth under developing market conditions and to adjust the funds holdings accordingly the adviser does not anticipate this process to result in high portfolio turnover and does not intend to aggressively trade the funds assets the fund expects that its annual portfolio turnover rate will be under normal conditions between  and  if the fund does a lot of trading it may incur additional operating expenses which would reduce performance and could cause shareowners to incur a higher level of taxable income or capital gains risks all mutual funds carry a certain amount of risk which may cause you to lose money on your investment the following describes the primary risks of investing in the fund based on the funds specific investment objective and strategies as all investment securities are subject to inherent market risks and fluctuations in value due to earnings economic and political conditions and other factors the fund cannot give any assurance that its investment objective will be achieved stock market risks  the nav of the fund will fluctuate based on changes in the value of the securities held in the investment portfolio the stock market is generally susceptible to volatile fluctuations in market price market prices of securities in which the fund invests may be adversely affected by an issuer having experienced losses or by the lack of earnings or by the issuers failure to meet the markets expectations with respect to new products or services or even by factors wholly unrelated to the value or condition of the issuer the value of the securities held by the fund is also subject to the risk that a specific segment of the stock market does not perform as well as the overall market under any of these circumstances the value of the funds shares and total return will fluctuate and your investment may be worth more or less than your original cost when you redeem your shares stock selection risks  like all managed funds there is a risk that the advisers strategy for managing the fund may not achieve the desired results the portfolio securities selected by the adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general is rising and may fail to meet the funds investment objective in addition the price of common stock moves up and down in response to corporate earnings and developments economic and market conditions and anticipated events as a result the price of the funds investments may go down and you could lose money on your investment investment in smallcap companies  the fund invests principally in companies with small market capitalization or companies that have relatively small revenues limited product lines and a small share of the market for their products or services collectively small companies small companies are also characterized by the following i they may lack depth of management ii they may be unable to internally generate funds necessary for growth or potential development or to generate such funds through external financing on favorable terms and iii they may be developing or marketing new products or services for which markets are not yet established and may never become established due to these and other factors small companies may suffer significant losses as well as realize substantial growth thus securities of small companies present greater risks than securities of larger more established companies if the fund is heavily invested in these securities the nav of the fund will be more susceptible to sudden and significant losses if the value of these securities decline historically stocks of small companies have been more volatile than stocks of larger companies and are therefore more speculative than investments in larger companies among the reasons for the greater price volatility are the following  the less certain growth prospects of smaller companies  the lower degree of liquidity in the markets for such stocks and  the greater sensitivity of small companies to changing economic conditions besides exhibiting greater volatility small company stocks may to a degree fluctuate independently of larger company stocks small company stocks may decline in price as large company stocks rise or rise in price as large company stocks decline to the extent that securities of small companies are not liquid the fund will limit its investments in such securities to not more than  its of assets you should expect that the value of fund shares may be more volatile than the shares of a mutual fund investing primarily in larger company stocks investment in microcap companies  certain of the funds investments may be considered investments in microcap companies companies with a market capitalization of between  million and  million accordingly the fund may be subject to the additional risks associated with investment in companies with micro capital structures these companies may i have relatively small revenues ii have limited product lines or services iii lack depth of management iv lack the ability to obtain funds necessary for growth and v feature products or services for which a market does not yet exist andor may ever be established the increased risk involved with investing in microcap companies may cause the market prices of their securities to be more volatile than those of larger more established companies further these securities tend to trade at a lower volume than do those of larger more established companies if the fund is heavily invested in these securities and the value of these securities suddenly decline the nav of the fund will be more susceptible to sudden and significant losses temporary defensive positions  when the funds management believes that investments should be deployed in a temporary defensive posture because of economic or market conditions the fund may invest up to  of its assets in us government securities such as bills notes or bonds of the us government and its agencies or other forms of indebtedness such as bonds or certificates of deposits when the fund is in a temporary defensive position it may not achieve its

more information about the fund or your account you may write to the fund at satuit capital small cap fund co commonwealth shareholder services inc  stony point parkway suite  richmond virginia  or you may call toll free at   when and how nav is determined the funds share price called its nav is determined as of the close of trading on the new york stock exchange the nyse generally  pm eastern time on each business day that the nyse is open the valuation time as of the date of this prospectus the trust is informed that the nyse will be closed on the following holidays new years day martin luther king jr day presidents day good friday memorial day independence day labor day thanksgiving day and christmas day nav per share is computed by adding the total value of the funds investments and other assets attributable to the funds shares subtracting any liabilities and then dividing by the total number of shares outstanding shares are bought sold or exchanged at the nav determined after a request has been received in proper form any request received in proper form before the valuation time will be processed the same business day any request received in proper form after the valuation time will be processed the next business day the fund reserves the right to refuse to accept an order in certain circumstances such as but not limited to orders from shortterm investors such as market timers or orders without proper documentation if a security or securities that the fund owns are traded when the nyse is closed for example in an afterhours market the value of the funds assets may be affected on days when the fund is not open for business in addition trading in some of the funds assets may not occur on days when the fund is open for business the funds securities are valued primarily on the basis of market quotations certain shortterm securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost if market quotations are not readily available for a security or if a securitys value has been materially affected by events occurring after the close of the exchange or market on which the security is principally traded then that security may be valued by another method that the board believes accurately reflects fair value a securitys valuation may differ depending on the method used for determining value the fund has a policy that contemplates the use of fair value pricing to determine the nav per share of the fund when market prices are unavailable as well as under special circumstances such as i if the primary market for a portfolio security suspends or limits trading or price movements of the security and ii when an event occurs after the close of the exchange on which a portfolio security is principally traded that is likely to have changed the value of the security since most of the funds investments are in us common stocks traded on us securities exchanges it is anticipated that the use of fair value pricing will be limited when the fund uses fair value pricing to determine the nav per share of the fund securities will not be priced on the basis of quotations from the primary market in which they are traded but rather may be priced by another method that the board believes accurately reflects fair value any method used will be approved by the board and results will be monitored to evaluate accuracy the funds policy is intended to result in a calculation of the funds nav that fairly reflects security values as of the time of pricing however fair values determined pursuant to the funds procedures may not accurately reflect the price that the fund could obtain for a security if it were to dispose of that security as of the time of pricing distributions as a shareholder you are entitled to your share of the funds net income and capital gains on its investments the fund passes substantially all of its earnings along to its investors as distributions when the fund earns dividends from stocks and interest from bonds and other debt securities and distributes these earnings to shareholders it is called a dividend distribution the fund realizes capital gains when it sells securities for a higher price than it paid when net longterm capital gains are distributed to shareholders it is called a capital gain distribution net shortterm capital gains are considered ordinary income and are included in dividend distributions the fund distributes dividends and capital gains if any annually all distributions are reinvested in additional shares unless you elect to receive distributions in cash for federal income tax purposes distributions are treated the same whether they are received in cash or reinvested shares become entitled to receive distributions on the day after the shares are issued if you have elected to receive distributions in cash and the postal or other delivery service returns your check to the fund as undeliverable you will not receive interest on amounts represented by the uncashed checks longterm vs shortterm capital gains o longterm capital gains are realized on securities held by the fund for more than one year and are part of your capital gain distribution o shortterm capital gains are realized on securities held by the fund for less then one year and are part of your dividend distributions frequent purchases and sales of fund shares  frequent purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares may interfere with the efficient management of a funds portfolio by its portfolio manager increase portfolio transaction costs and have a negative effect on a funds long term shareholders for example in order to handle large flows of cash into and out of a fund the portfolio manager may need to allocate more assets to cash or other shortterm investments or sell securities rather than maintaining full investment in securities selected to achieve the funds investment objective frequent trading may cause a fund to sell securities at less favorable prices transaction costs such as brokerage commissions and market spreads can detract from the funds performance in addition the return received by long term shareholders may be reduced when trades by other shareholders are made in an effort to take advantage of certain pricing discrepancies when for example it is believed that the funds share price which is determined at the close of the nyse on each trading day does not accurately reflect the value of the funds portfolio securities funds investing in foreign securities have been particularly susceptible to this form of arbitrage but other funds could also be affected because of the potential harm to the fund and its long term shareholders the board has approved policies and procedures that are intended to discourage and prevent excessive trading and market timing abuses through the use of various surveillance techniques under these policies and procedures the fund may limit additional exchanges or purchases of fund shares by shareholders who are believed by the adviser to be engaged in these abusive trading activities the intent of the policies and procedures is not to inhibit legitimate strategies such as asset allocation dollar cost averaging or similar activities that may nonetheless result in frequent trading of fund shares for this reason the board has not adopted any specific restrictions on purchases and sales of fund shares but the fund reserves the right to reject any exchange or purchase of fund shares with or without prior notice to the account holder in cases where surveillance of a particular account establishes what the adviser identifies as market timing the adviser will seek to block future purchases and exchanges of fund shares by that account where surveillance of a particular account indicates activity that the adviser believes could be either abusive or for legitimate purposes the fund may permit the account holder to justify the activity the policies and procedures will be applied uniformly to all shareholders and the fund will not accommodate market timers the policies apply to any account whether an individual account or accounts with financial intermediaries such as investment advisers broker dealers or retirement plan administrators commonly called omnibus accounts where the intermediary holds fund shares for a number of its customers in one account omnibus account arrangements permit multiple investors to aggregate their respective share ownership positions and purchase redeem and exchange fund shares without the identity of the particular shareholders being known to the fund accordingly the ability of the fund to monitor and detect frequent share trading activity through omnibus accounts is very limited and there is no guarantee that the fund will be able to identify shareholders who may be engaging in frequent trading activity through omnibus accounts or to curtail such trading the funds policies provide for ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of current policies and surveillance tools and the board reserves the right to modify these or adopt additional policies and restrictions in the future shareholders should be aware however that any surveillance techniques currently employed by the fund or other techniques that may be adopted in the future may not be effective particularly where the trading takes place through certain types of omnibus accounts as noted above if the fund is unable to detect and deter trading abuses the funds performance and its long term shareholders may be harmed in addition because the fund has not adopted any specific limitations or restrictions on the trading of fund shares shareholders may be harmed by the extra costs and portfolio management inefficiencies that result from frequent trading of fund shares even when the trading is not for abusive purposes federal tax considerations your investment will have tax consequences that you should consider some of the more common federal income tax consequences are described here but you should consult your tax consultant about your particular situation although it is not an investment objective the adviser will attempt to take into account the tax consequences of its investment decisions however there may be occasions when the advisers investment decisions will result in a negative tax consequence for the funds shareholders for more detailed information regarding tax considerations see the funds sai taxes on distributions  the fund operates in a manner such that it will not be liable for federal income or excise tax distributions whether received in cash or reinvested in additional shares of the fund may be subject to local state and federal taxes distributions of net investment income or shortterm capital gain are taxable to you as ordinary income distributions of longterm capital gain are taxable to you as longterm capital gain regardless of how long you have held your shares under current law certain income distributions paid by the fund to individual taxpayers are taxed at rates equal to those applicable to net longterm capital gains generally  this tax treatment applies only if certain holding period requirements and other requirements are satisfied by the shareholder and the dividends are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the fund itself the fund will mail reports containing information about the funds distributions during the year to you after december st of each year by january st consult your tax advisor about the federal state and local tax consequences in your particular circumstances taxes on sales or redemptions of shares  the sale of fund shares is a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes selling shareholders of the fund will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the shareholders adjusted tax basis in the shares sold and the amount received if the shares are held as a capital asset the gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss buying a dividend  all distributions reduce the nav of the funds shares by the amount of the distribution unless your investment is in a taxdeferred account you may wish to avoid buying shares of the fund shortly before a distribution if you do purchase shares prior to a distribution you will pay the full predistribution price for your shares and then receive part of your investment back as a taxable distribution tax withholding  by law the fund must withhold  of your taxable distribution and proceeds

 the funds principal office is located at  gaston gate mt pleasant sc  the fund commenced operations on march   as a separate portfolio of the world funds inc the predecessor fund the fund was reorganized as a separate series of the satuit capital management trust on november   the fund has the same investment strategy as the predecessor fund however prior to april   the predecessor funds investment strategy was to invest at least  of the funds assets in genomics related issues the adviser was appointed as investment subadviser to the predecessor fund on january   and prior to such date had no affiliation with the predecessor fund accordingly performance information related to the time period prior to april   represents the performance of the predecessor funds former investment strategy and for performance information related to the time period prior to january   the performance of the predecessor funds former investment adviser the fund is a separate investment portfolio or

expenses investment objective principal strategies and restrictions the funds investment objective is to provide investors with capital appreciation the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least  of its assets in a diversified portfolio of us common stocks of small capitalization companies smallcap companies satuit capital management llc the adviser considers a company to be a smallcap company when its market capitalization at the time of purchase is within the market capitalization range of companies in the russell r index at reconstitution each june  million to  billion as of june  the adviser will select portfolio securities which the adviser believes exhibit reasonable valuations and favorable growth prospects under normal market conditions the fund will invest at least  of its assets in equity securities of smallcap companies this is not a fundamental policy and may be changed by the without a vote of shareholders upon sixty  days prior notice the funds investment objective and fundamental investment restrictions may not be changed without approval by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting shares of the fund as defined by the  act unless otherwise noted the policies described in this sai are not fundamental and may be changed by the board without shareholder approval the adviser utilizes proprietary quantitative analysis of both value and growth characteristics to rank us smallcap companies valuation and growth characteristics are equally weighted for purposes of ranking potential investments securities valuation analysis is used to determine the inherent value of the company and requires the analysis of financial information such as a companys price to book price to sales return on equity and return on assets ratios growth analysis is used to determine a companys potential for longterm dividends and earnings growth as determined by marketoriented factors such as market share the launch of new products or services the strength of its management and market demand from these analyses the adviser ranks the companies that exhibit stable and growing valuation ratios and the most favorable dividends and earnings prospects and lists them on what it refers to as the focus list the adviser selects portfolio securities for investment by the fund by subjecting the common stocks on the focus list to a qualitative analysis of each companys valuation and growth characteristics in order to determine whether these characteristics are sustainable over the long term such analysis includes a more detailed review of each companys competitive position in its particular market sector its business prospects and financial statements the adviser also regularly conducts interviews with company management and wall street analysts who provide research about a companys common stock in the stock market the adviser will constantly monitor the funds investment portfolio positions for adverse changes in the funds investment portfolio portfolio securities may be sold as a result of adverse changes in the stock markets generally or to a specific issuer that results in poor relative performance portfolio securities may also be sold if the adviser determines that the valuation and growth characteristics that formed the basis for purchasing a stock no longer meet the criteria for portfolio securities of the fund the adviser may elect to sell a portfolio security when the reasons for its purchase no longer apply when return on assets price to book value or other valuation ratios decline when the adviser believes that the market price per share of a security exceeds the inherent value of the company or when a companys earnings and dividends prospects weaken investing in mutual funds  all mutual funds carry a certain amount of risk you may lose money on your investment in the fund as all investment securities are subject to inherent market risks and fluctuations in value due to earnings economic and political conditions and other factors the fund can give no assurance that its investment objective will be achieved stock market risks  the net asset value of the fund will fluctuate based on changes in the value of the securities held in the investment portfolio the stock market is generally susceptible to volatile fluctuations in market price market prices of securities in which the fund invests may be adversely affected by an issuers having experienced losses or by the lack of earnings or by the issuers failure to meet the markets expectations with respect to new products or services or even by factors wholly unrelated to the value or condition of the issuer the value of the securities held by the fund is also subject to the risk that a specific segment of the stock market does not perform as well as the overall market under any of these circumstances the value of the funds shares and total return will fluctuate and your investment may be worth more or less than your original cost when you redeem your shares stock selection risks  like all managed funds there is a risk that the advisers strategy for managing the fund may not achieve the desired results the portfolio securities selected by the adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general is rising and may fail to meet the funds investment objective in addition the price of common stock moves up and down in response to corporate earnings and developments economic and market conditions and anticipated events as a result the price of the funds investments may go down and you could lose money on your investment investment in smallcap companies  the fund invests principally in companies with small market capitalization or companies that have relatively small revenues limited product lines and a small share of the market for their products or services collectively small companies small companies are also characterized by the following i they may lack depth of management ii they may be unable to internally generate funds necessary for growth or potential development or to generate such funds through external financing on favorable terms and iii they may be developing or marketing new products or services for which markets are not yet established and may never become established due to these and other factors small companies may suffer significant losses as well as realize substantial growth thus securities of small companies present greater risks than securities of larger more established companies if the fund is heavily invested in these securities the nav of the fund will be more susceptible to sudden and significant losses if the value of these securities decline historically stocks of small companies have been more volatile than stocks of larger companies and are therefore more speculative than investments in larger companies among the reasons for the greater price volatility are the following i the less certain growth prospects of smaller companies ii the lower degree of liquidity in the markets for such stocks and iii the greater sensitivity of small companies to changing economic conditions besides exhibiting greater volatility small company stocks may to a degree fluctuate independently of larger company stocks small company stocks may decline in price as large company stocks rise or rise in price as large company stocks decline to the extent that securities of small companies are not liquid the fund will limit its investments in such securities to not more than  its of assets you should expect that the value of fund shares may be more volatile than the shares of a mutual fund investing primarily in larger company stocks investment in microcap companies  certain of the funds investments may be considered investments in microcap companies companies with a market capitalization of between  million and  million accordingly the fund may be subject to the additional risks associated with investment in companies with micro capital structures these companies may i have relatively small revenues ii have limited product lines or services iii lack depth of management iv lack the ability to obtain funds necessary for growth and v feature products or services for which a market does not yet exist andor may ever be established the increased risk involved with investing in microcap companies may cause the market prices of their securities to be more volatile than those of larger more established companies further these securities tend to trade at a lower volume than do those of larger more established companies if the fund is heavily invested in these securities and the value of these securities suddenly decline the nav of the fund will be more susceptible to sudden and significant losses other investment policies and restrictions  the following paragraphs provide a description of other investment policies and restrictions of the fund unless otherwise noted the policies described in this sai are not fundamental and may be changed by the board without shareholder approval initial public offerings  to the extent that ipos are offered to the fund the fund may participate in ipos if the security being offered satisfies the funds investment criteria as determined by the adviser an ipo initial public offering is a companys first sale of stock to the public and are primarily used to raise substantial amounts of new capital to support current operations expansion or new business opportunities and otherwise to implement a companys growth plans securities offered in an ipo are often but not always those of young small companies seeking outside equity capital and a public market for their stock there is no guarantee that the company offering its shares in a public offering will sell a sufficient amount of shares to raise the capital that is needed or that a public market for their shares will ever develop investors purchasing stock in ipos generally must be prepared to accept considerable risks for the possibility of large gains ipos by investment companies closedend funds usually include underwriting fees that represent a load to buyers ipos are considered speculative investments and can be extremely volatile as a result ipos may have a significant impact on the funds performance there is no guarantee that the ipos in which the fund participates will be successful or that the fund will have access to successful ipos in addition as fund assets grow the positive impact of successful ipos on fund performance will decrease cash positions and temporary defensive strategies  at times the fund may employ temporary defensive strategies in response to unfavorable economic market political or other conditions at such times the fund may increase its cash reserves without limit by holding high quality shortterm debt securities and money market instruments and by entering into repurchase agreements these investments are inconsistent with the funds primary investment strategies as a result during these periods the fund may not achieve its objective shortterm investments  the fund may invest in any of the following securities and instruments bank certificates of deposit bankers acceptances and time deposits  the fund may acquire certificates of deposit bankers acceptances and time deposits certificates of deposit are negotiable certificates issued against funds deposited in a commercial bank for a definite period of time and earning a specified return bankers acceptances are negotiable drafts or bills of exchange normally drawn by an importer or exporter to pay for specific merchandise which are accepted by a bank meaning in effect that the bank unconditionally agrees to pay the face value of the instrument on maturity certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances acquired by the fund will be dollardenominated obligations of domestic banks or financial institutions which at the time of purchase have capital surplus and undivided profits in excess of  million including assets of both domestic and foreign branches based on latest published reports or less than  million if the principal amount of such bank obligations are fully insured by the us government banks may be subject to different governmental regulations with respect to the amount and types of loans which may be made and interest rates which may be charged in addition the profitability of the banking industry depends largely upon the availability and cost of funds for the purpose of financing lending operations under prevailing money market conditions general economic conditions as well as exposure to credit losses arising from possible financial difficulties of borrowers play an important part in the operations of the banking industry as a result of federal and state laws and regulations banks are among other things required to maintain specified levels of reserves limited in the amount which they can loan to a single borrower and subject to other regulations designed to promote financial soundness in addition to purchasing certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances to the extent permitted under its investment objective strategies and policies stated above and in its prospectus the fund may make interestbearing time or other interestbearing deposits in commercial or savings banks time deposits are nonnegotiable deposits maintained at a banking institution for a specified period of time at a specified interest rate savings association obligations  the fund may invest in certificates of deposit interestbearing time deposits issued by savings banks or savings and loan associations that have capital surplus and undivided profits in excess of  million based on latest published reports or less than  million if the principal amount of such obligations is fully insured by the us government commercial paper shortterm notes and other corporate obligations  the fund may invest a portion of its assets in commercial paper and shortterm notes commercial paper consists of unsecured promissory notes issued by corporations issues of commercial paper and shortterm notes will normally have maturities of less than nine months and fixed rates of return although such instruments may have maturities of up to one year commercial paper and shortterm notes will consist of issues rated at the time of purchase a or higher by sp prime or prime by moodys or similarly rated by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization or if unrated will be determined by satuit capital management llc the adviser to be of comparable quality corporate obligations include bonds and notes issued by corporations to finance longerterm credit needs that could not be supported by commercial paper while such obligations generally have maturities of ten years or more the fund may purchase corporate obligations which have remaining maturities of one year or less from the date of purchase and which are rated aa or higher by sp or aa or higher by moodys government obligations  the fund may make shortterm investments in us government obligations such obligations include treasury bills certificates of indebtedness notes and bonds and issues of such entities as the government national mortgage association gnma exportimport bank of the united states tennessee valley authority resolution funding corporation farmers home administration federal home loan banks federal intermediate credit banks federal farm credit banks federal land banks federal housing administration federal national mortgage association fnma federal home loan mortgage corporation and the student loan marketing association each of these obligations such as those of the gnma are supported by the full faith and credit of the us treasury others such as those of the exportimport bank of united states are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the treasury others such as those of the fnma are supported by the discretionary authority of the us government to purchase the agencys obligations still others such as those of the student loan marketing association are supported only by the credit of the instrumentality no assurance can be given that the us government would provide financial support to us governmentsponsored instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so by law illiquid securities  the fund may not invest more than  of the value of its net assets in securities that at the time of purchase are illiquid the adviser will monitor the amount of illiquid securities in the funds portfolio under the supervision of the board to ensure compliance with the funds investment restrictions historically illiquid securities have included securities subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale because they have not been registered under the securities act of  the securities act securities which are otherwise not readily marketable and repurchase agreements having a maturity of longer than seven days securities which have not been registered under the securities act are referred to as private placement or restricted securities and are purchased directly from the issuer or in the secondary market mutual funds do not typically hold a significant amount of these restricted or other illiquid securities because of the potential for delays on resale and uncertainty in valuation limitations on resale may have an adverse effect on the marketability of the funds portfolio securities and the fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid securities promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemption requests within seven days the fund might also have to register such restricted securities in order to dispose of them resulting in additional expense and delay adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of securities in recent years however a large institutional market has developed for certain securities that are not registered under the securities act including repurchase agreements commercial paper municipal securities and corporate bonds and notes institutional investors depend on an efficient institutional market in which the unregistered security can be readily resold or on an issuers ability to honor a demand for repayment the fact that there are contractual or legal restrictions on resale to the general public or to certain institutions may not be indicative of the liquidity of such investments if such securities are subject to purchase by institutional buyers in accordance with rule a promulgated by the commission under the securities act the board may determine that such securities are not illiquid securities notwithstanding their legal or contractual restrictions on resale in all other cases however securities subject to restrictions on resale will be deemed illiquid restricted securities  the sec staff currently takes the view that any delegation by the board of the authority to determine that a restricted security is readily marketable as described in the investment restrictions of the fund must be pursuant to written procedures established by the board it is the present intention of the board if the board decides to delegate such determinations to the adviser or another person they would do so pursuant to written procedures consistent with the staffs position should the staff modify its position in the future the board would consider what action would be appropriate in light of the staffs position at that time repurchase agreements  the fund may invest in repurchase agreements a repurchase agreement involves the purchase by the fund of the securities with the condition that after a stated period of time the original seller will buy back the same securities at a predetermined price or yield the funds custodian will hold the securities underlying any repurchase agreement or such securities will be part of the federal reserve book entry system the market value of the collateral underlying the repurchase agreement will be determined on each business day if at any time the market value of the funds collateral falls below the repurchase price of the repurchase agreement including any accrued interest the fund will promptly receive additional collateral so the total collateral is an amount at least equal to the repurchase price plus accrued interest borrowing money  except as specified below the fund may only borrow money for temporary or emergency purposes and then only in an amount not in excess of  of the lower of value or cost of its total assets in which case the fund may pledge mortgage or hypothecate any of its assets as security for such borrowing but not to an extent greater than  of its total assets the fund may borrow up to onethird of its total assets to avoid the untimely disposition of assets to meet redemptions in an amount up to  of the value of its assets provided that the fund maintains asset coverage of  in connection with borrowings and the fund does not make other investments while such borrowings are outstanding borrowing money involves special risk considerations that may not be associated with other funds having similar objectives and policies because substantially all of the funds assets fluctuate in value whereas the interest obligation resulting from a borrowing is generally fixed the net asset value per share of the fund tends to decrease more when its portfolio assets decrease in value than would otherwise occur if the fund did not borrow funds interest costs on borrowings however may fluctuate with changing market rates of interest and may partially offset or exceed the return earned on borrowed funds under adverse market conditions the fund might have to sell portfolio securities to meet interest or principal payments at a time when fundamental investment considerations would not favor such sales investment restrictions  in addition to the principal investment objectives policies and risks set forth in the prospectus and in this sai the fund is subject to certain fundamental and nonfundamental investment restrictions as set forth below fundamental investment restrictions may not be changed without the vote of a majority of the funds outstanding securities as defined in the  act nonfundamental investment restrictions of the fund may be changed by the board fundamental investment restrictions as fundamental investment restrictions the fund will not  invest in companies for the purpose of exercising management or control  invest in securities of other investment companies except by purchase in the open market involving only customary brokers commissions or as part of a merger consolidation or acquisition of assets  purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts  invest in interests in oil gas or other mineral exploration or development programs  purchase securities on margin except for use of shortterm credits as necessary for the clearance of purchase of portfolio securities  issue senior securities except the fund may engage in transactions such as those permitted by sec release ic  act as an underwriter of securities of other issuers except that the fund may invest up to  of the value of its total assets at the time of investment in portfolio securities which the fund might not be free to sell to the public without registration of such securities under the securities act of  as amended the  act or any foreign law restricting distribution of securities in a country of a foreign issuer  participate on a joint or a joint and several basis in any securities trading account  engage in short sales  purchase or sell real estate provided that liquid securities of companies which deal in real estate or interests therein would not be deemed to be an investment in real estate  purchase the securities of any issuer other than obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities if as a result as to  of the funds total assets more than  of its net assets would be invested in the securities of one issuer or the fund would hold more than  of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer  make loans  except as specified below the fund may only borrow money for temporary or emergency purposes and then only in an amount not in excess of  of the lower of value or cost of its total assets in which case the fund may pledge mortgage or hypothecate any of its assets as security for such borrowing but not to an extent greater than  of its total assets the fund may borrow money to avoid the untimely disposition of assets to meet redemptions in an amount up to  of the value of its assets provided that the fund maintains asset coverage of  in connection with borrowings and the fund does not make other investments while such borrowings are outstanding  the fund may not concentrate investments in a particular industry or group of industries as concentration is defined under the  act the rules and regulations thereunder or any exemption therefrom as such statute rules or regulations may be amended or interpreted from time to time in applying its investment policies and restrictions except with respect to the funds investment restriction concerning borrowing

funds assets will not be considered a violation of the restriction nonfundamental investment restrictions the fund is subject to the following restrictions that are not fundamental and may therefore be changed by the board without shareholder approval the fund will not  invest more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities  engage in arbitrage transactions or  purchase or sell options unless

fees brokerage fees and commissions the expenses of reports to shareholders shareholders meetings and proxy solicitations portfolio transactions and allocation of brokerage the funds assets are

is responsible for making all determinations as to the purchase and sale of portfolio securities and for taking all steps necessary to implement securities transactions on behalf of the fund us government securities generally are traded in the overthecounter market through brokerdealers a brokerdealer is a securities firm or bank that makes a market for securities by offering to buy at one price and sell at a slightly higher price the difference between the prices is known as a spread in placing orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the fund the adviser will use its best efforts to obtain the best possible price and execution and will otherwise place orders with brokerdealers subject to and in accordance with any instructions the board may issue from time to time the adviser will select brokerdealers to execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the fund primarily on the basis of best price and execution when consistent with the objectives of prompt execution and favorable net price business may be placed with brokerdealers who furnish investment research or services to the adviser such research or services include advice both directly and in writing as to the value of securities the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities as well as analyses and reports concerning issues industries securities economic factors and trends portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts to the extent portfolio transactions are effected with brokerdealers who furnish research services to the adviser the adviser receives a benefit not capable of evaluation in dollar amounts without providing any direct monetary benefit to the fund from these transactions the adviser believes that most research services obtained by it generally benefit several or all of the investment companies and private accounts that it manages as opposed to solely benefiting one specific managed fund or account transactions on us stock exchanges commodities markets and futures markets and other agency transactions involve the payment by the fund of negotiated brokerage commissions such commissions vary among different brokers a particular broker may charge different commissions according to such factors as the difficulty and size of the transaction there is generally no stated commission in the case of securities traded in the overthecounter markets but the price paid by the fund usually includes an undisclosed dealer commission or markup in underwritten offerings the price paid by the fund includes a disclosed fixed commission or discount retained by the underwriter or dealer it has for many years been a common practice in the investment advisory business for advisers of investment companies and other institutional investors to receive brokerage and research services as defined in the securities exchange act of  as amended the  act from brokerdealers that execute portfolio transactions for the clients of such advisers and from third parties with which such brokerdealers have arrangements consistent with this practice the adviser may receive brokerage and research services and other similar services from many brokerdealers with which the adviser may place the funds portfolio transactions and from third parties with which these brokerdealers have arrangements these services include such matters as general economic and market reviews industry and company reviews evaluations of investments recommendations as to the purchase and sale of investments newspapers magazines pricing services quotation services news services and personal computers utilized by the adviser where the services referred to above are not used exclusively by the adviser for research purposes the adviser based upon its own allocations of expected use bears that portion of the cost of these services which directly relates to their nonresearch use some of these services are of value to the adviser and its affiliates in advising a variety of their clients including the fund although not all of these services are necessarily useful and of value in managing the fund the management fee paid by the fund is not reduced because the adviser and its affiliates receive these services even though the adviser might otherwise be required to purchase some of these services for cash as permitted by section e of the  act the adviser may cause the fund to pay a brokerdealer which provides brokerage and research services as defined in the  act to the adviser an amount of disclosed commission for effecting securities transactions on stock exchanges and other transactions for the fund on an agency basis in excess of the commission which another brokerdealer would have charged for effecting that transaction the advisers authority to cause the fund to pay any such greater commissions is also subject to such policies as the trustees may adopt from time to time the adviser does not currently intend to cause the fund to make such payments it is the position of the staff of the sec that section e does not apply to the payment of such greater commissions in principal transactions accordingly the adviser will use its best effort to obtain the most favorable price and execution available with respect to such transactions as described above the predecessor fund paid brokerage commissions of   and  for the fiscal years ended august    and  and respectively in fiscal year  the adviser negotiated a lower commission rate and reduced portfolio turnover resulting in lower brokerage commissions paid in fiscal year ended august   as compared to prior years portfolio turnover in order to qualify for the beneficial tax treatment afforded regulated investment companies and to be relieved of federal tax liabilities the fund must distribute substantially all of its net income to shareholders generally on an annual basis thus the fund may have to dispose of portfolio securities under disadvantageous circumstances to generate cash or borrow cash in order to satisfy the distribution requirement the fund does not trade in securities for shortterm profits but when circumstances warrant securities may be sold without regard to the length of time they have been held average annual portfolio turnover rate is the ratio of the lesser of sales or purchases to the monthly average value of the portfolio securities owned during the year excluding from both the numerator and the denominator all securities with maturities at the time of acquisition of one year or less a higher portfolio turnover rate involves greater transaction expenses to a fund and may result in the realization of net capital gains which would be taxable to shareholders when distributed the adviser makes purchases and sales for the funds portfolio whenever necessary in the advisers opinion to meet the funds objective the adviser anticipates that the average annual portfolio turnover rate of the fund will be under normal conditions between  and  if the fund does a lot of trading it may incur additional operating expenses which would reduce performance and could cause shareowners to incur a higher level of taxable income or capital gains taxation the following is a summary discussion of certain us federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a shareholder of the fund that acquires holds andor disposes of shares of the fund and reflects provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the irs code existing treasury regulations rulings published by the irs and other applicable authority as of the date of this statement of additional information these authorities are subject to change by legislative or administrative action possibly with retroactive effect the following discussion is only a summary of some of the important tax considerations generally applicable to investments in the fund and the discussion set forth herein does not constitute tax advice there may be other tax considerations applicable to particular investors in addition income earned through an investment in the fund may be subject to state local and foreign taxes the fund intends to qualify each year as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the irs code by so qualifying the fund will not incur federal income taxes on its net investment company taxable income and on net realized capital gains net longterm capital gains in excess of the sum of net shortterm capital losses and capital losses carryovers from the prior  years to the extent distributed in a timely manner to shareholders in the form of dividends or capital gain distributions to qualify as a regulated investment company the fund must among other things a derive in each taxable year at least  of its gross income from i dividends interest payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and ii net income from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships as defined by the irs code b diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year i at least  of the market value of the funds assets is represented by cash us government securities the securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities with such other securities of any one issuer limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than  of the value of the funds total assets and  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not more than  of the value of its total assets is invested in securities other than us government securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies of i any one issuer ii any two or more issuers that the fund controls and that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses or iii any one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships as defined in the irs code and c distribute to its shareholders at least  of its investment company taxable income as defined in the irs code and  of its net exempt interest income each taxable year amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible  excise tax at the fund level to avoid the tax the fund must distribute during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of a at least  of its ordinary income not taking into account any capital gains or losses for the calendar year b at least  of its capital gains in excess of capital losses adjusted for certain ordinary losses for a oneyear period generally ending on october st of the calendar year and c all ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed during such years under the irs code dividends derived from interest and any shortterm capital gains are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income for federal tax purposes regardless of whether such dividends are taken in cash or reinvested in additional shares under current law certain income distributions paid by the fund to individual taxpayers are taxed at rates equal to those applicable to net longterm capital gains generally  this tax treatment applies only if certain holding period requirements and other requirements are satisfied by the shareholder and the dividends are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the fund itself we cannot assure you as to what percentage of the dividends paid on the shares will consist of qualified dividend income or longterm capital gains both of which are taxed at lower rates for individuals than are ordinary income and shortterm capital gains distributions from the fund except in the case of distributions of qualified dividend income as described above or capital gain dividends as described below generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of the funds current and accumulated earnings and profits distributions of net capital gains that is the excess of net gains from the sale of capital assets held more than one year over net losses from the sale of capital assets held for not more than one year properly designated as capital gain dividends will be taxable to shareholders as longterm capital gain regardless of how long a shareholder has held the shares in the fund corporate investors are not eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction with respect to distributions derived from interest on shortor longterm capital gains from the fund but may be entitled to such a deduction in respect to distributions attributable to dividends received by the fund a distribution will be treated as paid on december st of a calendar year if it is declared by the fund in october november or december of the year with a record date in such a month and paid by the fund during january of the following year such distributions will be taxable to shareholders in the calendar year the distributions are declared rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received any redemption or exchange of the funds shares is a taxable event and may result in a capital gain or loss a gain or loss if the shares are capital assets in the shareholders hands will be longterm or shortterm capital gain generally depending upon the shareholders holding period for the shares any loss realized on a disposition will be disallowed by wash sale rules to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after the disposition in such a case the basis of the shares acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss any loss realized by a shareholder on a disposition of shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of any distributions of capital gain dividends received by the shareholder with respect to such shares dividend distributions capital gains distributions and capital gains or losses from redemptions and exchanges may also be subject to state and local taxes ordinarily distributions and redemption proceeds paid to fund shareholders are not subject to withholding of federal income tax however  of the funds distributions and redemption proceeds must be withheld if a fund shareholder fails to supply the fund or its agent with such shareholders taxpayer identification number or if the fund shareholder who is otherwise exempt from withholding fails to properly document such shareholders status as an exempt recipient the foregoing discussion is only a summary of some of the tax considerations generally affecting the fund and its shareholders and does not address the special tax rules applicable to certain classes of investors such as taxexempt entities foreign investors insurance companies and financial institutions shareholders should consult their own tax advisers with respect to special tax rules that may apply in their particular situations as well as the state local and where applicable foreign tax consequences of investing in the fund voting and ownership of shares each share of the fund has one vote in the

of the fund to that of other mutual funds and to relevant indices in advertisements or in reports to shareholders performance will be stated in terms of total return or yield both total return and yield figures are based on the historical performance of a fund show the performance of a hypothetical investment and are not intended to indicate future performance yield information  from time to time the fund may advertise a yield figure a portfolios yield is a way of showing the rate of income the portfolio earns on its investments as a percentage of the portfolios share price under the rules of the sec yield must be calculated according to the following formula  yield  ab   cd where a  dividends and interest earned during the period b  expenses accrued for the period net of reimbursements c  the average daily number of shares outstanding during the period that were entitled to receive dividends d  the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period the funds yield as used in advertising is computed by dividing the funds interest and dividend income for a given day period net of expenses by the average number of shares entitled to receive distributions during the period dividing this figure by the funds nav at the end of the period and annualizing the result assuming compounding of income in order to arrive at an annual percentage rate income is calculated for purposes of yield quotations in accordance with standardized methods applicable to all stock and bond mutual funds dividends from equity investments are treated as if they were accrued on a daily basis solely for the purposes of yield calculations in general interest income is reduced with respect to bonds trading at a premium over their par value by subtracting a portion of the premium from income on a daily basis and is increased with respect to bonds trading at a discount by adding a portion of the discount to daily income capital gains and losses generally are excluded from the calculation income calculated for the purpose of calculating the funds yield differs from income as determined for other accounting purposes because of the different accounting methods used and because of the compounding assumed in yield calculations the yield quoted for the fund may differ from the rate of distributions the fund paid over the same period or the rate of income reported in the funds financial statements total return performance  under the rules of the sec fund advertising performance must include total return quotes t below calculated according to the following formula n pt  erv where p  hypothetical initial payment of  t  average annual total return n  number of years  or  erv  ending redeemable value of a hypothetical  payment made at the

will be based on rolling calendar quarters updated to the last day of the most recent quarter prior to submission of the advertising for publication and will cover prescribed periods when the period since inception is less than one year the total return quoted will be the aggregate return for the period in calculating the ending redeemable value all dividends and distributions by the fund are assumed to have been reinvested at nav as described in the prospectus on the reinvestment dates during the period total return or t in the formula above is computed by finding the average annual

amount of the investment return on a  investment made at the maximum public offering price applicable at the beginning of the period and then calculating the annual compounded rate of return after federal income taxes on distributions but not redemptions which would produce that amount assuming a redemption at the end of the period this calculation assumes a complete redemption of the investment but further assumes that the redemption has no federal income tax consequences this calculation also assumes that all dividends and distributions less the federal income taxes due on such distributions are reinvested at net asset value on the reinvestment dates during the period in calculating the impact of federal income taxes due on distributions the federal income tax rates used correspond to the tax character of each component of the distributions eg ordinary income rate for ordinary income distributions shortterm capital gain rate for shortterm capital gains distributions and longterm capital gain rate for longterm capital gains distributions the highest individual marginal federal income tax rate in effect on the reinvestment date is applied to each component of the distributions on the reinvestment date note that these tax rates may vary over the measurement period the effect of applicable tax credits such as the foreign tax credit is also taken into account in

example affect the fund’s performance during the funds most recent fiscal year the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio principal investment strategies the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least  of its assets in a diversified portfolio of us common stocks of micro cap companies the adviser considers a company to be a micro cap company when its market capitalization at the time of purchase is  million or less the adviser will select portfolio securities which the adviser believes exhibit reasonable valuations and favorable growth prospects the adviser utilizes proprietary quantitative analysis of both value and growth characteristics to rank us micro cap companies valuation and growth characteristics are equally weighted for purposes of ranking potential investment securities valuation analysis is used to determine the inherent value of the company and requires the analysis of financial information such as a companys price to book price to sales return on equity and return on assets ratios growth analysis is used to determine a companys potential for longterm dividends and earnings growth as determined by marketoriented factors such as market share the launch of new products or services the strength of its management and market demand from these analyses the adviser ranks the companies that exhibit stable and growing valuation ratios and the most favorable dividends and earnings prospects and lists them on what it refers to as the focus list the adviser selects portfolio securities for investment by the fund by subjecting the common stocks on the focus list to a qualitative analysis of each companys valuation and growth characteristics in order to determine whether these characteristics are sustainable over the long term such analysis includes a more detailed review of each companys competitive position in its particular market sector its business prospects and financial statements the adviser also regularly conducts interviews with company management and wall street analysts who provide research about a companys common stock in the stock market portfolio securities may be sold as a result of adverse changes in the stock markets generally or to a specific issuer that results in poor relative performance portfolio securities may also be sold if the adviser determines that the valuation and growth characteristics that formed the basis for purchasing a stock no longer meet the criteria for portfolio securities of the fund temporary defensive strategy ― at times the fund may employ temporary defensive strategies in response to unfavorable economic market political or other conditions at such times the fund may increase its cash reserves without limit by holding high quality shortterm debt securities and money market instruments and by entering into repurchase agreements these investments are inconsistent with the funds primary investment strategies as a result during these periods the fund may not achieve its objective principal risks investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose money the principal risks of investing in the fund are listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value the nav total return and value of the fund and your investment stock market risks stock mutual

services iii  lack depth of management iv lack the ability to obtain funds necessary for growth and v feature  products or services for which a market does not yet exist andor may never be

the fund before july   and you redeem those shares less than two years from the date of purchase regardless of such class c shares having been converted to noload shares you will be subject to a  deferred sales charge and not the  redemption fee  the deferred sales charge is computed based on a percentage of the nav at the time the shares were purchased net of reinvested dividends and capital gains distributions  the deferred sales charge would equal  of the offering price and of the net amount invested  in determining whether to charge a deferred sales charge it will be assumed that you have redeemed shares on which there is no deferred sales charge first section   general information dividends distributions and taxes as a shareholder you are entitled to your share of the funds net income and capital gains on its investments the fund passes substantially all of its earnings along to its investors as distributions when the fund earns dividends from stocks and interest from bonds and other debt securities and distributes these earnings to shareholders it is called a dividend distribution the fund realizes capital gains when it sells securities for a higher price than it paid when net longterm capital gains are distributed to shareholders it is called a capital gain distribution net shortterm capital gains are considered ordinary income and are included in dividend distributions the fund distributes dividends and capital gains if any annually  all distributions are reinvested in additional shares unless you elect to receive distributions in cash for federal income tax purposes distributions are treated the same whether they are received in cash or reinvested shares become entitled to receive distributions on the day after the shares are issued if you have elected to receive distributions in cash and the postal or other delivery service returns your check to the fund as undeliverable you will not receive interest on amounts represented by the uncashed checks longterm vs shortterm capital gains  longterm capital gains are realized on securities held by the fund for more than one year and are part of your capital gain distribution  shortterm

some of the more common federal income tax consequences are described here but you should consult your tax consultant about your particular situation although it is not an investment objective the adviser will attempt to take into account the tax consequences of its investment decisions however there may be occasions when the advisers investment decisions will result in a negative tax consequence for the funds shareholders for more detailed information regarding tax considerations see the funds sai taxes on distributions ― the fund operates in a manner such that it will not be liable for federal income or excise tax provided that it distributes the amount required to avoid such taxes distributions whether received in cash or reinvested in additional shares of the fund may be subject to local state and federal taxes distributions of net investment income or shortterm capital gain are taxable to you as ordinary income distributions of longterm capital gain are taxable to you as longterm capital gain regardless of how long you have held your shares under current law certain income distributions paid by the fund to individual taxpayers are taxed at rates equal to those applicable to net longterm capital gains generally  this tax treatment applies only if certain holding period requirements and other requirements are satisfied by the shareholder and the dividends are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the fund itself the fund will mail reports containing information about the funds distributions during the year to you after december st of each year by january st consult your tax advisor about the federal state and local tax consequences in your particular circumstances taxes on sales or redemptions of shares ― the sale of fund shares is a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes selling shareholders of the fund will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the shareholders adjusted tax basis in the shares sold and the amount received if the shares are held as a capital asset the gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss buying a dividend ― all distributions reduce the nav of the funds shares by the amount of the distribution unless your investment is in a taxdeferred account you may wish to avoid buying shares of the fund shortly before a distribution if you do purchase shares prior to a distribution you will pay the full predistribution price for your shares and then receive part of your investment back as a taxable distribution tax withholding ― by law the fund must withhold  of your taxable distribution and proceeds if you  have failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification number tin  are subject to backup withholding by the internal revenue service irs  have failed to provide the fund with the certifications required by the irs to document that you are not subject to backup withholding or  have failed to certify that you are a us person including a us resident alien the foregoing briefly summarizes some of the important federal income tax consequences to shareholders of investing in the funds shares reflects the federal tax law as of the date of this prospectus and does not address special tax rules applicable to certain types of investors such as corporate taxexempt and foreign investors investors should consult their tax advisers regarding other federal state or local tax considerations that may be applicable in their particular circumstances as well as any proposed tax law changes net asset value the funds share price called its nav is determined as of the close of trading on the new york stock exchange the nyse generally  pm eastern time on each business day that the nyse is open the valuation time the nyse is closed on the following holidays new years day martin luther king jr day presidents day good friday memorial day independence day labor day thanksgiving day and christmas day  nav per share is computed by adding the total value of the funds investments and other assets subtracting any liabilities and then dividing by the total number of shares outstanding shares are bought sold or exchanged at the nav determined after a request has been received in proper form any request received in proper form before the valuation time will be processed the same business day any request received in proper form after the valuation time will be processed the next business day the fund reserves the right to refuse to accept an order in certain circumstances such as but not limited to orders from shortterm investors such as market timers or orders without proper documentation   if a security or securities that the fund owns are traded when the nyse is closed for example in an afterhours market the value of the funds assets may be affected on days when the fund is not open for business in addition trading in some of the funds assets may not occur on days when the fund is open for business the funds securities are valued primarily on the basis of market quotations  certain shortterm securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost if market quotations are not readily available for a security or if a securitys value has been materially affected by events occurring after the close of the exchange or market on which the security is principally traded then that security may be valued by another method that the board believes accurately reflects fair value a securitys valuation may differ depending on the method used for determining value the fund has a policy that contemplates the use of fair value pricing to determine the nav per share of the fund when market prices are unavailable as well as under special circumstances such as i if the primary market for a portfolio security suspends or limits trading or price movements of the security and ii when an event occurs after the close of the exchange on which a portfolio security is principally traded that is likely to have changed the value of the security since most of the funds investments are in us common stocks traded on us securities exchanges it is anticipated that the use of fair value pricing will be limited when the fund uses fair value pricing to determine the nav per share of the fund securities will not be priced on the basis of quotations from the primary market in which they are traded but rather may be priced by another method that the board believes accurately reflects fair value any method used will be approved by the board and results will be monitored to evaluate accuracy the funds policy is intended to result in a calculation of the funds nav that fairly reflects security values as of the time of pricing however fair values determined pursuant to the funds procedures may not accurately reflect the price that the fund could obtain for a security if it were to dispose of that security as of the time of pricing frequent trading frequent purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares may interfere with the efficient management of a funds portfolio by its portfolio manager increase portfolio transaction costs and have a negative effect on a funds long term shareholders for example in order to handle large flows of cash into and out of a fund the portfolio manager may need to allocate more assets to cash or other shortterm investments or sell securities rather than maintaining full investment in securities selected to achieve the funds investment objective frequent trading may cause a fund to sell securities at less favorable prices transaction costs such as brokerage commissions and market spreads can detract from the funds performance in addition the return received by long term shareholders may be reduced when trades by other shareholders are made in an effort to take advantage of certain pricing discrepancies when for example it is believed that the funds share price which is determined at the close of the nyse on each trading day does not accurately reflect the value of the funds portfolio securities funds investing in foreign securities have been particularly susceptible to this form of arbitrage but other funds could also be affected because of the potential harm to the fund and its long term shareholders the board has approved policies and procedures that are intended to discourage and prevent excessive trading and market timing abuses through the use of various surveillance techniques under these policies and procedures the fund may limit additional exchanges or purchases of fund shares by shareholders who are believed by the adviser to be engaged in these abusive trading activities the intent of the policies and procedures is not to inhibit legitimate strategies such as asset allocation dollar cost averaging or similar activities that may nonetheless result in frequent trading of fund shares for this reason the board has not adopted any specific restrictions on purchases and sales of fund shares but the fund reserves the right to reject any exchange or purchase of fund shares with or without prior notice to the account holder in cases where surveillance of a particular account establishes what the adviser identifies as market timing the adviser will seek to block future purchases and exchanges of fund shares by that account where surveillance of a particular account indicates activity that the adviser believes could be either abusive or for legitimate purposes the fund may permit the account holder to justify the activity the policies and procedures will be applied uniformly to all shareholders and the fund will not accommodate market timers the policies apply to any account whether an individual account or accounts with financial intermediaries such as investment advisers broker dealers or retirement plan administrators commonly called omnibus accounts where the intermediary holds fund shares for a number of its customers in one account  omnibus account arrangements permit multiple investors to aggregate their respective share ownership positions and purchase redeem and exchange fund shares without the identity of the particular shareholders being known to the fund accordingly the ability of the fund to monitor and detect frequent share trading activity through omnibus accounts is very limited and there is no guarantee that the fund will be able to identify shareholders who may be engaging in frequent trading activity through omnibus accounts or to curtail such trading   the funds policies provide for ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of current policies and surveillance tools and the board reserves the right to modify these or adopt additional policies and restrictions in the future  shareholders should be aware however that any surveillance techniques currently employed by the fund or other techniques that may be adopted in the future may not be effective particularly where the trading takes place through certain types of omnibus accounts as noted above if the fund is unable to detect and deter trading abuses the funds performance and its long term shareholders may be harmed in addition because the fund has not adopted any specific limitations or restrictions on the trading of fund shares shareholders may be harmed by the extra costs and portfolio management inefficiencies that result from frequent trading of fund shares even when the trading is not for abusive purposes fund service providers custodian ― us bank  walnut street th floor cincinnati ohio  serves as custodian for the funds cash and securities the custodian does not
