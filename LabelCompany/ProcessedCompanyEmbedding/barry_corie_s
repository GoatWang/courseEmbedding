in one of the top jobs at best buy that began to change in the fall of  when she met her new boss at the nations largest electronics chain barry was a vice president at the time waiting to meet the companys next chief financial officer and fully expecting a man in a suit instead she did a double take when the petite sharon mccollam breezed in wearing an impeccable dress and designer shoes along with an air of confidence and friendliness i literally thought i might run up and hug her said barry  in a recent interview over sushi at the companys richfield headquarters i felt like my whole life had changed in many ways it did mccollam who became a key figure in best buys storied turnaround immediately saw potential in barry and began grooming barry to be her successor last year when mccollam retired barry replaced her as the cfo of the  billion company soon after barry was stunned to discover she was one of only about  female cfos in the fortune  or less than  percent it was a stark reminder of how much of a glass ceiling remains in the executive suites and boardrooms of corporate america while growing in number there are still only about  female ceos among the nations largest  companies best buy cfo corie barry poses for a portrait in the corporate office  courtney pedroza • courtneypedrozastartribunecom july   best buy corporate office richfield best buy cfo corie barry it really blew my mind when i first looked up the stats barry said at a recent women in business event in minneapolis but its been a different story at best buy in recent years barry is part of a major sea change in the retailers csuite where women now hold nearly half the positions — and at times have outnumbered men and  percent of best buys board members are women compared with the nationwide average of  percent in addition to matching online prices and partnering with some of the tech industrys biggest brands company executives and industry analysts say a key ingredient of best buys turnaround has been building a diverse and highcaliber leadership team its no accident that it had a good number of women on it best buy ceo hubert joly said for us its part of our secret weapon its a significant change for a company long dominated by men as well as a stark contrast to the headlines coming out of silicon valley these days where recent sexual harassment scandals at places like uber have given the tech industry a reputation for hostility to women new visibility in her role as cfo barry has found herself in high demand as a speaker with a lean intype spirit she has been encouraging women to have more confidence in themselves and be more courageous in articulating their ambitions ladies theres a big difference between being a braggart and advocating for yourself she told graduates when delivering the commencement address at her alma mater the college of st benedict in st joseph minn whose board she recently joined and she speaks passionately about the importance of having not just mentors but sponsors who will lift you up and challenge you at the same time as mccollam did for her sharon was equal parts advocate and critic in all of the best possible ways because she was from day one hellbent on trying to help me advance my career barry said but she knew that in order to do that theres going to need to be some tough conversations and hard feedback along the way the feedback was often immediate and sometimes painful to hear such as being told not to play with her hair in meetings or pushed to sometimes be the one with a more controversial point of view in the room once i got my head around it it was so incredibly useful barry said i think she always had bigger dreams for me than maybe i even had for myself for her part mccollam said she knew she was only going to be at best buy for three to four years barry was the obvious choice to replace her she said because of her deep understanding of the business ability to see the big picture beyond the numbers willingness to keep learning integrity and love of people and she proved herself to be a star performer mccollam said in an email mccollam said she learned firsthand how important it is to have advocates in advancing her own career though in her case they were never other women there was no greater privilege in my career than to do everything in my power to see that such an extraordinary executive and compassionate person achieve their professional dream she said of barry corie barry cfo best buy • previous roles include chief strategic growth officer interim president of geek squad • bachelor’s degree from college of st benedict • married with a yearold son and a yearold daughter mccollam wasnt the only one pushing barry in  joly asked barry to step in as the interim president of the geek squad she hesitated given that most of her experience was in finance i said why me  barry said he looked at me and said well why wouldnt you for me that was … boy am i holding myself to a high enough standard around what else it is im capable of  changing culture when joly arrived as ceo in september  there were only two women in best buys csuite the company was in the midst of a crisis not only as it grappled with the amazon factor but also as it recovered from the departure of the companys previous ceo brian dunn who stepped down after it was revealed he had an inappropriate relationship with a female employee joly immediately set a new tone from the top he was as out loud as ive ever heard any leader be about the importance of diversity on a leadership team said barry noting that he quickly backed it up by picking mccollam as one of his first key hires while emphasizing that its broader than just gender joly says hes always seen diversity as an essential element of corporate success in bringing different skills and styles to the table part of his view was informed by his background at mckinsey  co which has done many studies showing multiple benefits from having a diverse leadership team and at minnetonkabased hotel company carlson where he worked with prominent female leaders such as marilyn nelson today other top female executives at best buy include shari ballard president of multichannel retail kamy scarlett who was recently promoted to human resources chief and trish walker head of services barry admits it was daunting to replace mccollam who was considered a rock star by wall street so much so that when the company announced her departure and barrys promotion last year the stock tumbled  percent barry took a screenshot of the stock drop that day and keeps it in her office its a good humility reminder she said these days best buys stock has been trading near record highs despite the tough retail environment a sign that investors are gaining even more confidence in best buys team and strategy in the end wall street respects results said david schick lead retail analyst with consumer edge research he added that barry has done a great job transitioning into the cfo role noting that she had a big hand in the companys turnaround too mentoring others now barry is trying to pay it forward she is executive sponsor of best buys womens employee network an internal group that sets up mentoring circles and holds an annual summit the company still has a ways to go she said especially in recruiting more women to don blue shirts in its stores where the workforce tends to be maledominated allison peterson president of ecommerce at best buy said barry has already become a role model for many young people within the company not only do people respect her because shes smart and has risen through the ranks but shes approachable and genuine she said she inspires a ton of people peterson said every time they hear her speak they leave in awe after growing up in the small town of cambridge minn barry sometimes marvels at her journey her father sometimes does too she recalled at a recent talk how her father an artist once remarked that she now works for the man no she quipped back dad i am the man the audience full of early to midcareer women erupted into cheers

csb august   by mike killeen corie barry 9 photo tommy olaughlin  not long after corie barry was named chief financial officer cfo at best buy company she decided to do a quick audit of the top  companies in america the 99 college of saint benedict graduate was curious how many of those companies had female cfos i didnt want to be a female cfo to prove a point barry said it was more like an afterthought that i looked at it because i felt like i had such a foundation that was built at csb and i continue to bring that passion with me around what women can do in both the working world and obviously lots of other areas too but i think i wouldnt discount — and never will — having that as my starting point barry said i think that brought me a level of intestinal fortitude that was very different there was something really important for me going to an allwomens school and having it juxtaposed with so many of my classes being coed in nature barry added i got this amazing ability to really focus on womens leadership and womens issues but at the same time i had this balance with discussions on an average day that included both men and women it jolted me and it gave me a great deal of confidence and passion around this idea that you really as a woman can do anything the new cfo barry assumed her new post on june  after working with the company in various financial roles since 999 as cfo she oversees audits and closing the books among other duties and replaced sharon mccollam who retired from the position my personal belief — and i learned this from sharon — i think the best cfos are very operational in nature barry said there are cfos who try to deeply understand the business and then can translate that into financial outcomes so i actually spend a great deal of my time learning about and understanding how the business works and then try to think about how we could construct the business differently and deliver the best financial outcome for the shareholders sharon said that to me early in my career and now i can feel that weight the shareholder is constantly on my shoulder every decision that we make as a leadership team im trying to think about that constituency above all others its my job to be the constant voice of how to think about the shareholder and ultimately our employees and all of our own engagement in the financial returns of the company barry said surprisingly not long ago she would never have dreamt about the financial returns of a company when barry came to csb in the fall of 99 she wanted to be a chemical engineering major and complete the honors program i loved the subject matter and i did well at it barry said i loved my professors obviously like everybody does but it wasnt clicking for me you get a feel pretty quickly for the majority of your life is going to be focused in a way that doesnt feel like it fits which was really hard for me being a high achiever it was hard to think about giving up on this thing check out business related majors at csbsju  not sure what way to go she turned to her firstyear symposium teacher ernie diedrich professor emeritus of economics at csb and sju i can say that ernie was lifechanging for me barry said i just sat down with him and said oh my goodness am i a failure where do i go from here he did a nice job of just kind of coaxing out of me what is it you actually like to do in your first year what resonated with you i just realized that the things i liked were very mathbased very linear very  they had an answer i was really drawn to that world and he said you may want to try an accounting class whats the worst thing that could happen it is a skill set and one of the things a liberal arts education opens up for you is pursuing things you might not otherwise do that really freed me up think differently about how i was going to pursue my education i thought well i will take an accounting class and see what i think and sure enough i loved it a switch to accounting her first accounting class was with lucy larson professor emerita of accounting at csb and sju just a cool laidback accounting professor barry said there were four people that were really instrumental in my life and my life at best buy and lucy was absolutely one of them following her graduation with degrees in accounting and business administration barry spent two years as a public accountant at deloitte and touche one of the big four accounting firms the truth is i didnt come to best buy because i loved retail or i loved cds i interviewed with a woman named anne loughrey i wanted to go work for anne i thought in my mind coming from saint bens heres a woman whos finding her way in a pretty typically maledominated industry shes in a pretty high position in the company and she seems interested in helping me advance my career and do things in my career that was incredibly appealing and then the company was cool too  barry said that the liberal arts has helped her in two ways you spend a disproportionate amount of time learning how to speak softly crisply and then how to write in a way that takes a myriad of complex things and starts to make them simple
