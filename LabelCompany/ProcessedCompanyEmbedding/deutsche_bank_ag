foreign business the object of the company is to transact banking business of all kinds in particular to promote and facilitate trade relations between germany other european countries and overseas markets three of the founders were georg siemens whose fathers cousin had founded siemens and halske adelbert delbrück and l bamberger previous to the founding of deutsche bank german importers and exporters were dependent upon english and french banking institutions in the world markets—a serious handicap in that german bills were almost unknown in international commerce generally disliked and

first domestic branches inaugurated in  and  were opened in bremen and hamburg its first foray overseas came shortly afterwards in shanghai  and london  followed sometime by south america – the branch opening in london after one failure and another partially successful attempt was a prime necessity for the establishment of credit for the german trade in what was then the worlds money centre major projects in the early years of the bank included the northern pacific railroad in the us and the baghdad railway  in germany the bank was instrumental in the financing of bond offerings of steel company krupp  and introduced the chemical company bayer to the berlin stock market the second half of the s saw the beginning of a new period of expansion at deutsche bank the bank formed alliances

of the film production company ufa and the merger of daimler and benz the bank merged with other local banks in  to create deutsche bank und discontogesellschaft at that point the biggest ever merger in german banking history increasing costs were one reason for the merger another was the trend towards concentration throughout the industry in the s the merger came at just the right time to help counteract the emerging world economic and banking crisis in  the company name changed back to deutsche bank the crisis was in terms of its political impact the most disastrous economic event of the century the shortage of liquidity that paralyzed the banks was fuelled by a combination of shortterm foreign debt and borrowers no longer able to pay their debts while the inflexibility of the state exacerbated the situation for german banks the crisis in the industry was a watershed a return to circumstances that might in some ways have been considered reminiscent of the golden age before world war i was ruled out for many years –edit after adolf hitler came to power instituting the third reich deutsche bank dismissed its three jewish board members in  in subsequent years deutsche bank took

markets three of the founders were georg siemens whose fathers cousin had founded siemens and halske adelbert delbrück and l bamberger previous to the founding of deutsche bank german importers and

first domestic branches inaugurated in  and  were opened in bremen and hamburg its first foray overseas came shortly afterwards in shanghai  and london  followed sometime by south america – the branch opening in london after one failure and another partially successful attempt was a prime necessity for the establishment of credit for the german trade in what was then the worlds money centre major projects in the early years of the bank included the northern pacific railroad in the us and the baghdad railway  in germany the bank was instrumental in the financing of bond offerings of steel company krupp  and introduced the chemical company bayer to the berlin stock market the second half of the s saw the beginning of a new period of expansion at deutsche bank the bank formed alliances

of the film production company ufa and the merger of daimler and benz the bank merged with other local banks in  to create deutsche bank und discontogesellschaft at that point the biggest ever merger in german banking history increasing costs were one reason for the merger another was the trend towards concentration throughout the industry in the s the merger came at just the right time to help counteract the emerging world economic and banking crisis in  the company name changed back to deutsche bank the crisis was in terms of its political impact the most disastrous economic event of the century the shortage of liquidity that paralyzed the banks was fuelled by a combination of shortterm foreign debt and borrowers no longer able to pay their debts while the inflexibility of the state exacerbated the situation for german banks the crisis in the industry was a watershed a return to circumstances that might in some ways have been considered reminiscent of the golden age before world war i was ruled out for many years –edit after adolf hitler came to power instituting the third reich deutsche bank dismissed its three jewish board members in  in subsequent years deutsche bank took

markets three of the founders were georg siemens whose fathers cousin had founded siemens and halske adelbert delbrück and l bamberger previous to the founding of deutsche bank german importers and

first domestic branches inaugurated in  and  were opened in bremen and hamburg its first foray overseas came shortly afterwards in shanghai  and london  followed sometime by south america – the branch

company krupp  and introduced the chemical company bayer to the berlin stock market the second half of the s saw the beginning of a new period of expansion at deutsche bank the bank formed alliances

counteract the emerging world economic and banking crisis in  the company name changed back to deutsche bank the crisis was in terms of its political impact the most disastrous economic event of the century the shortage of liquidity that paralyzed the banks was fuelled by a combination of shortterm foreign debt and borrowers no longer able to pay their debts while the inflexibility of the state

become the biggest operator in this market which were a form of credit derivative designed to behave like the most senior tranche of a cdo deutsche bought insurance against default by bluechip companies from investors mostly canadian pension funds who received a stream of insurance premiums as income in return for posting a small amount of collateral the bank then sold protection to us investors via the cdx credit index the spread between the two was tiny but was worth m over the  years of the trade it was considered very unlikely that many blue chips would have problems at the same time so deutsche required collateral of just  of the contract value the risk of deutsche taking large losses if the collateral was wiped out in a crisis was called the gap option benartzi claims that after modelling came up with economically unfeasible results deutsche accounted for the gap option first with a simple  haircut on the trades described as inadequate by another employee in  and then in  by a –bn reserve for the credit correlation desk designed to cover all risks not just the gap option in october  they stopped modelling the gap option and just bought sp put options to guard against further market disruption but one of the whistleblowers has described this as an inappropriate hedge a model from benartzis previous job at goldman sachs suggested that the gap option was

in berlin in  as a specialist bank for foreign trade the banks statute was adopted on  january  and on  march  the prussian government granted it a banking licence the statute laid great stress on foreign business the object of the company is to transact banking business of all kinds in particular to promote and facilitate trade relations between germany other european countries and overseas markets three of the founders were georg siemens whose fathers cousin had founded siemens and halske adelbert delbrück and l bamberger previous to the founding of deutsche bank german importers and exporters were dependent upon english and french banking institutions in the world markets—a serious handicap in that german bills were almost unknown in international commerce generally disliked and subject to a higher rate of discount than english or french bills founding membersedit hermann zwicker bankhaus gebr schickler berlin anton adelssen bankhaus adelssen  co berlin adelbert delbrück

first domestic branches inaugurated in  and  were opened in bremen and hamburg its first foray overseas came shortly afterwards in shanghai  and london  followed sometime by south america – the branch opening in london after one failure and another partially successful attempt was a prime necessity for the establishment of credit for the german trade in what was then the worlds money centre major projects in the early years of the bank included the northern pacific railroad in the us and the baghdad railway  in germany the bank was instrumental in the financing of bond offerings of steel company krupp  and introduced the chemical company bayer to the berlin stock market the second half of the s saw the beginning of a new period of expansion at deutsche bank the bank formed alliances with large regional banks giving itself an entrée into germanys main industrial regions joint ventures were symptomatic of the concentration then under way in the german banking industry for deutsche bank domestic branches of its own were still something of a rarity at the time the frankfurt branch dated from  and the munich branch from  while further branches were established in dresden and leipzig in  in addition the bank rapidly perceived the value of specialist institutions for the promotion of foreign business gentle pressure from the foreign ministry played a part in the establishment of deutsche ueberseeische bank in  and the stake taken in the newly established deutschasiatische bank three years later but the success of those companies in showed that their existence made sound commercial sense –edit the immediate postwar period was a time of liquidations having already lost most of its foreign assets deutsche bank was obliged to sell other holdings a great deal of energy went into shoring up what had been achieved but there was new business too some of which was to have an impact for a long time to come the bank played a significant role in the establishment of the film production company ufa and the merger of daimler and benz the bank merged with other local banks in  to create deutsche bank und discontogesellschaft at that point the biggest ever merger in german banking history increasing costs were one reason for the merger another was the trend towards concentration throughout the industry in the s the merger came at just the right time to help counteract the emerging world economic and banking crisis in  the company name changed back to deutsche bank the crisis was in terms of its political impact the most disastrous economic event of the century the shortage of liquidity that paralyzed the banks was fuelled by a combination of shortterm foreign debt and borrowers no longer able to pay their debts while the inflexibility of the state exacerbated the situation for german banks the crisis in the industry was a watershed a return to circumstances that might in some ways have been considered reminiscent of the golden age before world war i was ruled out for many years –edit after adolf hitler came to power instituting the third reich deutsche bank dismissed its three jewish board members in  in subsequent years deutsche bank took

 billion worth the  us senate permanent select committee on investigations report on wall street and the financial crisis analyzed deutsche bank as a case study of investment banking involvement in the mortgage bubble cdo market credit crunch and recession it concluded that even as the market was collapsing in  and its top global cdo trader was deriding the cdo market and betting against some of the mortgage bonds in its cdos deutsche bank continued to churn out bad cdo products to investors the report focused on one cdo gemstone vii made largely of mortgages from long beach fremont and new century all notorious subprime lenders deutsche bank put risky assets into the cdo like ace he m which its own traders thought was a bad bond it also put in some mortgage bonds that its own mortgage department had created but couldnt sell from the dbalt  series the cdo was then aggressively marketed as a good product with most of it being described as having a level ratings by  the entire cdo was almost worthless and the investors including deutsche bank itself had lost most of their money greg lippmann head of global cdo trading was betting against the cdo market with approval of management even as deutsche was continuing to churn out product he was a large character in michael lewis book the big short which detailed his efforts to find shorts to buy credit default swaps for the construction of synthetic cdos he was one of the first traders to foresee the bubble in the cdo market as well as the tremendous potential that cds offered in this as portrayed in the big short lipmann in the middle of the cdo and mbs frenzy was orchestrating presentations to investors demonstrating his bearish view of the market offering them the idea to start buying cds especially to aig in order to profit from the forthcoming collapse as regards the gemstone vii deal even as deutsche was creating and selling it to investors lippman emailed colleagues that it blew and he called parts of it crap and pigs and advised some of his clients to bet against the mortgage securities it was made of lippman called the cdo market a ponzi scheme but also tried to conceal some of his views from certain other parties because the bank was trying to sell the products he was calling crap lippmans group made money off of these bets even as deutsche overall lost money on the cdo market deutsche was also involved with magnetar capital in creating its first orion cdo deutsche had its own group of bad cdos called start it worked with elliot advisers on one of them elliot bet against the cdo

securities to fannie mae and freddie mac leveraged supersenior tradesedit former employees including eric benartzi and matthew simpson have claimed that during the crisis deutsche failed to recognise up to bn of paper losses on their bn portfolio of leveraged super senior trades although the bank rejects the claims a company document of may  described the trades as the largest risk in the trading book and the whistleblowers allege that had the bank accounted properly for its positions its capital would have fallen to the extent that it might have needed a government bailout one of them claims that if lehman brothers didnt have to mark its books for six months it might still be in business and if deutsche had marked its books it might have been in the same position as lehman deutsche had become the biggest operator in this market which were a form of credit derivative designed to behave like the most senior tranche of a cdo deutsche bought insurance against default by bluechip companies from investors mostly canadian pension funds who received a stream of insurance premiums as income in return for posting a small amount of collateral the bank then sold protection to us investors via the cdx credit index the spread between the two was tiny but was worth m over the  years of the trade it was considered very unlikely that many blue chips would have problems at the same time so deutsche required collateral of just  of the contract value the risk of deutsche taking large losses if the collateral was wiped out in a crisis was called the gap option benartzi claims that after modelling came up with economically unfeasible results deutsche accounted for the gap option first with a simple  haircut on the trades described as inadequate by another employee in  and then in  by a –bn reserve for the credit correlation desk designed to cover all risks not just the gap option in october  they stopped modelling the gap option and just bought sp put options to guard against further market disruption but one of the whistleblowers has described this as an inappropriate hedge a model from benartzis previous job at goldman sachs suggested that the gap option was worth about  of the value of the trades worth bn simpson claims that traders were not simply understating the gap option but actively mismarking the value of their trades european financial crisisedit

companies from investors mostly canadian pension funds who received a stream of insurance premiums as income in return for posting a small amount of collateral the bank then sold protection to us investors via the cdx credit index the spread between the two was tiny but was worth m over the  years of the trade it was considered very unlikely that many blue chips would have problems at the same time so deutsche required collateral of just  of the contract value the risk of deutsche taking large losses if the collateral was wiped out in a crisis was called the gap option benartzi claims that after modelling came up with economically unfeasible results deutsche accounted for the gap option first with a simple  haircut on the trades described as inadequate by another employee in  and then in  by a –bn reserve for the credit correlation desk designed to cover all risks not just the gap option in october  they stopped modelling the gap option and just bought sp put options to guard against further market disruption but one of the whistleblowers has described this as an inappropriate hedge a model from benartzis previous job at goldman sachs suggested that the gap option was

in berlin in  as a specialist bank for foreign trade the banks statute was adopted on  january  and on  march  the prussian government granted it a banking licence the statute laid great stress on foreign business the object of the company is to transact banking business of all kinds in particular to promote and facilitate trade relations between germany other european countries and overseas markets three of the founders were georg siemens whose fathers cousin had founded siemens and halske adelbert delbrück and l bamberger previous to the founding of deutsche bank german importers and exporters were dependent upon english and french banking institutions in the world markets—a serious handicap in that german bills were almost unknown in international commerce generally disliked and subject to a higher rate of discount than english or french bills founding membersedit hermann zwicker bankhaus gebr schickler berlin anton adelssen bankhaus adelssen  co berlin adelbert delbrück

first domestic branches inaugurated in  and  were opened in bremen and hamburg its first foray overseas came shortly afterwards in shanghai  and london  followed sometime by south america – the branch opening in london after one failure and another partially successful attempt was a prime necessity for the establishment of credit for the german trade in what was then the worlds money centre major projects in the early years of the bank included the northern pacific railroad in the us and the baghdad railway  in germany the bank was instrumental in the financing of bond offerings of steel company krupp  and introduced the chemical company bayer to the berlin stock market the second half of the s saw the beginning of a new period of expansion at deutsche bank the bank formed alliances with large regional banks giving itself an entrée into germanys main industrial regions joint ventures were symptomatic of the concentration then under way in the german banking industry for deutsche bank domestic branches of its own were still something of a rarity at the time the frankfurt branch dated from  and the munich branch from  while further branches were established in dresden and leipzig in  in addition the bank rapidly perceived the value of specialist institutions for the promotion of foreign business gentle pressure from the foreign ministry played a part in the establishment of deutsche ueberseeische bank in  and the stake taken in the newly established deutschasiatische bank three years later but the success of those companies in showed that their existence made sound commercial sense –edit the immediate postwar period was a time of liquidations having already lost most of its foreign assets deutsche bank was obliged to sell other holdings a great deal of energy went into shoring up what had been achieved but there was new business too some of which was to have an impact for a long time to come the bank played a significant role in the establishment of the film production company ufa and the merger of daimler and benz the bank merged with other local banks in  to create deutsche bank und discontogesellschaft at that point the biggest ever merger in german banking history increasing costs were one reason for the merger another was the trend towards concentration throughout the industry in the s the merger came at just the right time to help counteract the emerging world economic and banking crisis in  the company name changed back to deutsche bank the crisis was in terms of its political impact the most disastrous economic event of the century the shortage of liquidity that paralyzed the banks was fuelled by a combination of shortterm foreign debt and borrowers no longer able to pay their debts while the inflexibility of the state exacerbated the situation for german banks the crisis in the industry was a watershed a return to circumstances that might in some ways have been considered reminiscent of the golden age before world war i was ruled out for many years –edit after adolf hitler came to power instituting the third reich deutsche bank dismissed its three jewish board members in  in subsequent years deutsche bank took

 billion worth the  us senate permanent select committee on investigations report on wall street and the financial crisis analyzed deutsche bank as a case study of investment banking involvement in the mortgage bubble cdo market credit crunch and recession it concluded that even as the market was collapsing in  and its top global cdo trader was deriding the cdo market and betting against some of the mortgage bonds in its cdos deutsche bank continued to churn out bad cdo products to investors the report focused on one cdo gemstone vii made largely of mortgages from long beach fremont and new century all notorious subprime lenders deutsche bank put risky assets into the cdo like ace he m which its own traders thought was a bad bond it also put in some mortgage bonds that its own mortgage department had created but couldnt sell from the dbalt  series the cdo was then aggressively marketed as a good product with most of it being described as having a level ratings by  the entire cdo was almost worthless and the investors including deutsche bank itself had lost most of their money greg lippmann head of global cdo trading was betting against the cdo market with approval of management even as deutsche was continuing to churn out product he was a large character in michael lewis book the big short which detailed his efforts to find shorts to buy credit default swaps for the construction of synthetic cdos he was one of the first traders to foresee the bubble in the cdo market as well as the tremendous potential that cds offered in this as portrayed in the big short lipmann in the middle of the cdo and mbs frenzy was orchestrating presentations to investors demonstrating his bearish view of the market offering them the idea to start buying cds especially to aig in order to profit from the forthcoming collapse as regards the gemstone vii deal even as deutsche was creating and selling it to investors lippman emailed colleagues that it blew and he called parts of it crap and pigs and advised some of his clients to bet against the mortgage securities it was made of lippman called the cdo market a ponzi scheme but also tried to conceal some of his views from certain other parties because the bank was trying to sell the products he was calling crap lippmans group made money off of these bets even as deutsche overall lost money on the cdo market deutsche was also involved with magnetar capital in creating its first orion cdo deutsche had its own group of bad cdos called start it worked with elliot advisers on one of them elliot bet against the cdo

securities to fannie mae and freddie mac leveraged supersenior tradesedit former employees including eric benartzi and matthew simpson have claimed that during the crisis deutsche failed to recognise up to bn of paper losses on their bn portfolio of leveraged super senior trades although the bank rejects the claims a company document of may  described the trades as the largest risk in the trading book and the whistleblowers allege that had the bank accounted properly for its positions its capital would have fallen to the extent that it might have needed a government bailout one of them claims that if lehman brothers didnt have to mark its books for six months it might still be in business and if deutsche had marked its books it might have been in the same position as lehman deutsche had become the biggest operator in this market which were a form of credit derivative designed to behave like the most senior tranche of a cdo deutsche bought insurance against default by bluechip companies from investors mostly canadian pension funds who received a stream of insurance premiums as income in return for posting a small amount of collateral the bank then sold protection to us investors via the cdx credit index the spread between the two was tiny but was worth m over the  years of the trade it was considered very unlikely that many blue chips would have problems at the same time so deutsche required collateral of just  of the contract value the risk of deutsche taking large losses if the collateral was wiped out in a crisis was called the gap option benartzi claims that after modelling came up with economically unfeasible results deutsche accounted for the gap option first with a simple  haircut on the trades described as inadequate by another employee in  and then in  by a –bn reserve for the credit correlation desk designed to cover all risks not just the gap option in october  they stopped modelling the gap option and just bought sp put options to guard against further market disruption but one of the whistleblowers has described this as an inappropriate hedge a model from benartzis previous job at goldman sachs suggested that the gap option was worth about  of the value of the trades worth bn simpson claims that traders were not simply understating the gap option but actively mismarking the value of their trades european financial crisisedit

companies from investors mostly canadian pension funds who received a stream of insurance premiums as income in return for posting a small amount of collateral the bank then sold protection to us investors via the cdx credit index the spread between the two was tiny but was worth m over the  years of the trade it was considered very unlikely that many blue chips would have problems at the same time so deutsche required collateral of just  of the contract value the risk of deutsche taking large losses if the collateral was wiped out in a crisis was called the gap option benartzi claims that after modelling came up with economically unfeasible results deutsche accounted for the gap option first with a simple  haircut on the trades described as inadequate by another employee in  and then in  by a –bn reserve for the credit correlation desk designed to cover all risks not just the gap option in october  they stopped modelling the gap option and just bought sp put options to guard against further market disruption but one of the whistleblowers has described this as an inappropriate hedge a model from benartzis previous job at goldman sachs suggested that the gap option was

adopted on  january  and on  march  the prussian government granted it a banking licence the statute laid great stress on foreign business the object of the company is to transact banking business of all kinds in particular to promote and facilitate trade relations between germany other european countries and overseas markets three of the founders were georg siemens whose fathers cousin had founded siemens and halske adelbert delbrück and l bamberger previous to the founding of deutsche bank german importers and exporters were dependent upon english and french banking institutions in the world markets—a serious handicap in that german bills were almost unknown in international commerce generally disliked and subject to a higher rate of discount than english or french bills founding

württembergische vereinsbank stuttgart first directorsedit wilhelm platenius georg siemens and hermann wallich the banks first domestic branches inaugurated in  and  were opened in bremen and hamburg its first foray overseas came shortly afterwards in shanghai  and london  followed sometime by south america – the branch opening in london after one failure and another partially successful attempt was a prime necessity for the establishment of credit for the german trade in what was then the worlds money centre major projects in the early years of the bank included the northern pacific railroad in the us and the baghdad railway  in germany the bank was instrumental in the financing of bond offerings of steel company krupp  and introduced the chemical company bayer to the berlin stock market the second half of the s saw the beginning of a new period of expansion at deutsche bank the bank formed alliances with large regional banks giving itself an entrée into germanys main industrial regions joint ventures were symptomatic of the concentration then under way in the german banking industry for deutsche bank domestic branches of its own were still something of a rarity at the time the frankfurt branch dated from  and the munich branch from  while further branches were established in dresden and leipzig in  in addition the bank rapidly perceived the value of specialist institutions for the promotion of foreign business gentle pressure from the foreign ministry played a part in the establishment of deutsche ueberseeische bank in  and the stake taken in the newly established deutschasiatische bank three years later but the success of those companies in showed that their existence made sound commercial sense –edit the immediate postwar period was a time of liquidations having already lost most of its foreign assets deutsche bank was obliged to sell other holdings a great deal of energy went into shoring up what had been achieved but there was new business too some of which was to have an impact for a long time to come the bank played a significant role in the establishment of the film production company ufa and the merger of daimler and benz the bank merged with other local banks in  to create deutsche bank und discontogesellschaft at that point the biggest ever merger in german banking history increasing costs were one reason for the merger another was the trend towards concentration throughout the industry in the s the merger came at just the right time to help counteract the emerging world economic and banking crisis in  the company name changed back to deutsche bank the crisis was in terms of its political impact the most disastrous economic event of the century the shortage of liquidity that paralyzed the banks was fuelled by a combination of shortterm foreign debt and borrowers no longer able to pay their debts while the inflexibility of the state exacerbated the situation for german banks the crisis in the industry was a watershed a return to circumstances that might in some ways have been considered reminiscent of the golden age before world war i was ruled out for many years –edit after adolf hitler came to power instituting the third reich deutsche bank dismissed its three jewish board members in  in subsequent years deutsche bank took part in the aryanization of jewishowned businesses according to its own historians the bank was involved in  such confiscations by november  during the war deutsche bank incorporated other banks that fell into german hands during the occupation of eastern

describing deutsche cdo traders view of the bubble deutsche bank was one of the major drivers of the collateralized debt obligation cdo market during the housing credit bubble from  to  creating about  billion worth the  us senate permanent select committee on investigations report on wall street and the financial crisis analyzed deutsche bank as a case study of investment banking involvement in the mortgage bubble cdo market credit crunch and recession it concluded that even as the market was collapsing in  and its top global cdo trader was deriding the cdo market and betting against some of the mortgage bonds in its cdos deutsche bank continued to churn out bad cdo products to investors the report focused on one cdo gemstone vii made largely of mortgages from long beach fremont and new century all notorious subprime lenders deutsche bank put risky assets into the cdo like ace he m which its own traders thought was a bad bond it also put in some mortgage bonds that its own mortgage department had created but couldnt sell from the dbalt  series the cdo was then aggressively marketed as a good product with most of it being described as having a level ratings by  the entire cdo was almost worthless and the investors including deutsche bank itself had lost most of their money greg lippmann head of global cdo trading was betting against the cdo market with approval of management even as deutsche was continuing to churn out product he was a large character in michael lewis book the big short which detailed his efforts to find shorts to buy credit default swaps for the construction of synthetic cdos he was one of the first traders to foresee the bubble in the cdo market as well as the tremendous potential that cds offered in this as portrayed in the big short lipmann in the middle of the cdo and mbs frenzy was orchestrating presentations to investors demonstrating his bearish view of the market offering them the idea to start buying cds especially to aig in order to profit from the forthcoming collapse as regards the gemstone vii deal even as deutsche was creating and selling it to investors lippman emailed colleagues that it blew and he called parts of it crap and pigs and advised some of his clients to bet against the mortgage securities it was made of lippman called the cdo market a ponzi scheme but also tried to conceal some of his views from certain other parties because the bank was trying to sell the products he was calling crap lippmans group made money off of these bets even as deutsche overall lost money on the cdo market deutsche was also involved with magnetar capital in creating its first orion cdo deutsche had its own group of bad cdos called start it worked with elliot advisers on one of them elliot bet against the cdo even as deutsche sold parts of the cdo to investors as good investments deutsche also worked with john paulson of the goldman sachs abacus cdo controversy to create some start cdos deutsche lost money

securities to fannie mae and freddie mac leveraged supersenior tradesedit former employees including eric benartzi and matthew simpson have claimed that during the crisis deutsche failed to recognise up to bn of paper losses on their bn portfolio of leveraged super senior trades although the bank rejects the claims a company document of may  described the trades as the largest risk in the trading book and the whistleblowers allege that had the bank accounted properly for its positions its capital would have fallen to the extent that it might have needed a government bailout one of them claims that if lehman brothers didnt have to mark its books for six months it might still be in business and if deutsche had marked its books it might have been in the same position as lehman deutsche had become the biggest operator in this market which were a form of credit derivative designed to behave like the most senior tranche of a cdo deutsche bought insurance against default by bluechip companies from investors mostly canadian pension funds who received a stream of insurance premiums as income in return for posting a small amount of collateral the bank then sold protection to us investors via the cdx credit index the spread between the two was tiny but was worth m over the  years of the trade it was considered very unlikely that many blue chips would have problems at the same time so deutsche required collateral of just  of the contract value the risk of deutsche taking large losses if the collateral was wiped out in a crisis was called the gap option benartzi claims that after modelling came up with economically unfeasible results deutsche accounted for the gap option first with a simple  haircut on the trades described as inadequate by another employee in  and then in  by a –bn reserve for the credit correlation desk designed to cover all risks not just the gap option in october  they stopped modelling the gap option and just bought sp put options to guard against further market disruption but one of the whistleblowers has described this as an inappropriate hedge a model from benartzis previous job at goldman sachs suggested that the gap option was worth about  of the value of the trades worth bn simpson claims that traders were not simply understating the gap option but actively mismarking the value of their trades european financial crisisedit

investors via the cdx credit index the spread between the two was tiny but was worth m over the  years of the trade it was considered very unlikely that many blue chips would have problems at the same time so deutsche required collateral of just  of the contract value the risk of deutsche taking large losses if the collateral was wiped out in a crisis was called the gap option benartzi claims that

in  by a –bn reserve for the credit correlation desk designed to cover all risks not just the gap option in october  they stopped modelling the gap option and just bought sp put options to guard against further market disruption but one of the whistleblowers has described this as an inappropriate hedge a model from benartzis previous job at goldman sachs suggested that the gap option was
