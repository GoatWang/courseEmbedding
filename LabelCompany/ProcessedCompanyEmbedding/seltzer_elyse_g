app warehouse shopping without the annual fee  cnet boxed wholesale app warehouse shopping without the annual fee love to buy in bulk boxed brings bigbox club shopping to your phone or tablet but are the savings really there mobile apps by rick broida february    am pst cheapskateblog screenshot by rick broidacnet wholesale clubs promise to save you money on popular household goods provided youre willing to pay an annual membership fee buy items in often comically large bulk sizes and devote half your saturday to crowded aisles and slowmoving linesboxed wholesale brings bulk shopping to your mobile device  its available for android and ios  the idea being to give you the same savings as a bigbox store but without the membership fee or the long drive or the exhausting saturday afternoon also not included free food samples which considering my impulsive nature is maybe a good thinga quick perusal of the boxed app reveals many of the same things i find at my local costco a twopack of multigrain cheerios  a count box of keurig starbucks house blend kcups  milkbone flavor snacks  pounds  and so onthese are all dry goods of course  theres no produce in the mix nor anywhere near the selection of a costco or even your local grocery but boxed does have a growing selection of organic products and most orders ship free the first one does anyway though theres a minimum purchase on subsequent orders if you want to bag free shipping the amount of that minimum varies by state according to boxeds faq the app lets you browse various categories household grocery kids and diapers and so on or search for specific items theres also a stuff on sale section where you can hunt the deepest price cuts i will note that its a little tough to comparisonshop unless youre actually strolling through say a costco while looking at boxed i do know that the aforementioned box of kcups for example sells for  at costco and in fact was on sale for  just this past weekend but boxed sells a  square foot roll of reynolds wrap tinfoil for  a twopack of the same from amazon would run you close to in other words there are savings to be had even if not every item is available at the absolute lowest price ultimately youre getting the convenience of bulk shopping from the comfort of a handheld app im not saying youll want to give up your costco membership merely that boxed can save you a
