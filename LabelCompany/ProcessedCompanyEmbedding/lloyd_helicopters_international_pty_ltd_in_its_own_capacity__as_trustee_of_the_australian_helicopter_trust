opinion on the foregoing basis and subject to the qualifications set out below we are of the opinion that     a each guarantor is incorporated and validly existing under the laws of australia and is capable of suing and being sued in its corporate name     b each guarantor has     i the corporate power to enter into the relevant power of attorney and each document to which it is a party and to observe its obligations under them and     ii taken all corporate action required on its part to authorise the execution delivery and observance of them     c if a guarantor enters into any document in the capacity of a trustee of any trust it has     i the power in its capacity as trustee to enter into the document and to observe its obligations under it and     ii taken all action required on

under them and observe obligations under them has been obtained and     f no guarantor enjoys any immunity from suit in the relevant jurisdictions nor are their assets exempt from executions   page  chc helicopter sa      march       qualifications this opinion is subject to the following qualifications     a the nature and enforcement of obligations may be affected by lapse of time failure to take action or laws including without limitation laws relating to bankruptcy insolvency liquidation receivership administration reorganisation reconstruction fraudulent transfer or moratoria certain equitable remedies and defences generally affecting creditors rights     b a creditors rights may be affected by a specific court order obtained under laws and defences generally affecting creditors rights     c the rights of a party to a document other than the guarantors to enforce its rights under the documents may be limited or affected by     i breaches by that party of its obligations under the document or misrepresentations made by it in or in connection with the document or     ii conduct of that party in relation to the document which is unlawful including without limitation the failure to hold an australian financial services licence if required to do so or the failure to comply with obligations in connection with that licence     iii conduct of that party in relation to the document which gives rise to an estoppel or claim against that party by the party against whom it is seeking to enforce its rights under the document     d an unsecured creditors right of recourse to trust assets to satisfy a trustees liability depends on the availability of the trustees right of indemnity out of those assets and each creditors right of subrogation to the trustees right of indemnity the trustees right of indemnity may be not available to the extent that the liability was not properly incurred or the trustee is or has been in breach of trust including an existing or future breach which is not related to the transactions contemplated by the documents     e the beneficiaries of a trust who have full legal capacity and whose interests have vested may terminate the trust and require the trustee to transfer the trust property to them or as they direct despite any provision to the contrary in the documents creating or evidencing the trust or any other document however a trustee has a right to be indemnified out of and an equitable lien over trust assets in respect of debts and liabilities properly incurred by it as trustee and those rights normally have priority over the claims of the beneficiaries this priority benefits the creditors in respect of those debts and liabilities if and to the extent they are entitled to be subrogated to that right of indemnity and lien these outcomes assume no disentitling conduct on the part of the trustee or a relevant creditor     f the availability of certain equitable remedies including without limitation injunctions and specific performance is at the discretion of a court in the relevant jurisdictions   page  chc helicopter sa      march        g an obligation to pay an amount may be unenforceable if the amount is held to constitute a penalty     h a provision that a statement opinion determination or other matter is final and conclusive will not necessarily prevent judicial enquiry into the merits of a claim by an aggrieved party     i the laws of the relevant jurisdictions may require that     i parties act reasonably and in good faith in their dealings with each other     ii discretions are exercised reasonably and     iii opinions are based on good faith     j the question whether a provision of a document which is invalid or unenforceable may be severed from other provisions is determined at the discretion of a court in the relevant jurisdictions     k an indemnity for legal costs may be unenforceable     l we express no opinion as to     i provisions precluding oral amendments or waivers     ii the revenue consequences of the exchange notes being transferred between participants in the secondary market in australia as this will depend among other things on the identity of the transferor and the transferee or     iii australian tax law     iv whether a judgment for a monetary amount would be given in a currency other than australian dollars although recent decisions of english courts allowing judgments in a foreign currency have been followed in the courts of new south wales or     v the date on which a conversion from foreign currency would be made for the purpose of enforcing a judgment     vi whether the assets of a trust are sufficient to satisfy the trustees right to be fully indemnified out of those assets in respect of obligations incurred by it under the documents to which it is a party and all other obligations in respect of which the trustee has a right to be indemnified out of those assets   page  chc helicopter sa      march        vii whether a court would determine that the exercise by the trustee of powers set out in the documents creating or evidencing that trust was a valid exercise of those powers for the benefit of the beneficiaries of that trust whilst the consent of all the beneficiaries of those trusts was obtained the consent of various potential beneficiaries was not     viii the accuracy completeness or suitability of any formula set out in any document if any formula is inaccurate incomplete or unsuitable for the purpose of determining the amounts or matters for which it has been included then a court may find that the relevant formula is void for uncertainty     m we express no opinion in relation to     i any proposal to introduce or change a law or any pending change in law     ii any law which has been enacted and has not commenced or if it has commenced has not started to apply including without limitation the personal property securities act  and the personal property securities consequential amendments act  of australia     iii any pending judgment or the possibility of an appeal from a judgment of any court or     iv the implications of any of them     n regulations in australia restrict or prohibit payments transactions and dealings with assets having a prescribed connection with certain countries or named individuals or entities subject to international sanctions or associated with terrorism     o a party entering into a document may in doing so be acting or later be held to have acted in the capacity of a trustee under an undocumented or partially documented constructive implied or resulting trust which may have arisen as a consequence of that partys conduct     p interest withholding tax at the rate of  may be payable in respect of payments of interest on overdue amounts and payments of interest or amounts in the nature of interest by a guarantor it is not clear whether payments by a guarantor under its guarantee constitute payments of interest or amounts in the nature of interest but the better view is that such payments are not payments of interest or amounts in the nature of interest and as such no interest withholding tax should be payable in respect of such payments     q court proceedings may be stayed if the subject of the proceedings is concurrently before a court   page  chc helicopter sa      march        r the enforceability of a guarantee may be affected by amendments to the guaranteed obligations if the guaranteed obligations do not remain within the general scope of the guarantee     s a court will not give effect to a currency indemnity a choice of laws to govern the documents or a submission to the jurisdiction of certain courts if to do so would be contrary to public policy in the relevant jurisdictions however we express no opinion as to whether     i a court will give effect to a choice of laws to govern the documents to the extent that the choice of laws applies to noncontractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the documents including without limitation noncontractual obligations within the meaning of regulation no  of the european parliament and of the council of  july  on the law applicable to noncontractual obligations known as rome ii or     ii a foreign judgment in relation to a noncontractual obligation would be enforced in the relevant jurisdictions     t a document may not be admissible in court proceedings unless applicable stamp duty has been paid     u a payment made under mistake may be liable to restitution and     v in order to enforce a foreign judgment in the relevant jurisdictions it may be necessary to establish that the judgment if it is a nonmoney judgment qualifies as one of the relevant kinds of nonmoney judgment under the foreign judgments act  cwlth it may be necessary to establish also that the judgment is for a fixed and certain sum of money and is not in the nature of a penalty or revenue debt and if raised by the judgment debtor it may be necessary to establish that     i the judgment debtor or its duly appointed agent received actual notice of the proceedings in sufficient time to contest the proceedings     ii the judgment was not obtained by fraud or duress or in a manner contrary to natural justice or public policy in new south wales and     iii the subject matter of the proceedings giving rise to the judgment was not immovable property situated outside new york and     w we express no opinion on whether goods and services tax is payable in connection with the transactions

against whom it is seeking to enforce its rights under the document     d an unsecured creditors right of recourse to trust assets to satisfy a trustees liability depends on the availability of the trustees right of indemnity out of those assets and each creditors right of subrogation to the trustees right of indemnity the trustees right of indemnity may be not available to the extent that the liability was not properly incurred or the trustee is or has been in breach of trust including an existing or future breach which is not related to the transactions contemplated by the documents     e the beneficiaries of a trust who have full legal capacity and whose interests have vested may terminate the trust and require the trustee to transfer the trust property to them or as they direct despite any provision to the contrary in the documents creating or evidencing the trust or any other document however a trustee has a right to be indemnified out of and an equitable lien over trust assets in respect of debts and liabilities properly incurred by it as trustee and those rights normally have priority over the claims of the beneficiaries this priority benefits the creditors in respect of those debts and liabilities if and to the extent they are entitled to be subrogated to that right of indemnity and lien these outcomes assume no disentitling conduct on the part of the trustee or a relevant creditor     f the availability of certain equitable remedies including without limitation injunctions and specific performance is at the discretion of a court in the relevant

jurisdictions may require that     i parties act reasonably and in good faith in their dealings with each other     ii discretions are exercised reasonably and     iii opinions are based on good faith     j the question whether a provision of a document which is invalid or unenforceable may be severed from other provisions is determined at the discretion of a court in the relevant jurisdictions     k an indemnity for legal costs may be unenforceable     l we express no opinion as to     i provisions precluding oral amendments or waivers     ii the revenue consequences of the exchange notes being transferred between participants in the secondary market in australia as this will depend among other things on the identity of the transferor and the transferee or     iii australian tax law     iv whether a judgment for a monetary amount would be given in a currency other than australian dollars although recent decisions of english courts allowing judgments in a foreign currency have been followed in the courts of new south wales or     v the date on which a conversion from foreign currency would be made for the purpose of enforcing a judgment     vi whether the assets of a trust are sufficient to satisfy the trustees right to be fully indemnified out of those assets in respect of obligations incurred by it under the documents to which it is a party and all other obligations in respect of which the trustee has a right to be indemnified out of those assets   page  chc helicopter sa      january        vii whether a court would determine that the exercise by the trustee of powers set out in the documents creating or evidencing that trust was a valid exercise of those powers for the benefit of the beneficiaries of that trust whilst the consent of all the beneficiaries of those trusts was obtained the consent of various potential beneficiaries was not     viii the accuracy completeness or suitability of any formula set out in any document if any formula is inaccurate incomplete or unsuitable for the purpose of determining the amounts or matters for which it has been included then a court may find that the relevant formula is void for uncertainty     m we express no opinion in relation to     i any proposal to introduce or change a law or any pending change in law     ii any law which has been enacted and has not commenced or if it has commenced has not started to apply including without limitation the personal property securities act  and the personal property securities consequential amendments act  of australia     iii any pending judgment or the

doing so be acting or later be held to have acted in the capacity of a trustee under an undocumented or partially documented constructive implied or resulting trust which may have arisen as a consequence of that partys conduct     p interest withholding tax at the rate of  may be payable in respect of payments of interest on overdue amounts and payments of interest or amounts in the nature of interest by a guarantor it is not clear whether payments by a guarantor under its guarantee constitute payments of interest or amounts in the nature of interest but the better view is that such payments are not payments of interest or amounts in the nature of interest and as such no interest withholding tax should be payable in respect of such payments     q court proceedings may be stayed if the subject of the proceedings is concurrently before a court   page  chc helicopter sa      january        r the enforceability of a guarantee may be affected by amendments to the guaranteed obligations if the guaranteed obligations do not remain within the general scope of the guarantee     s a court will not give effect to a currency indemnity a choice of laws to govern the documents or a submission to the jurisdiction of certain courts if to do so would be contrary to public policy in the relevant jurisdictions however we express no opinion as to whether     i a court
