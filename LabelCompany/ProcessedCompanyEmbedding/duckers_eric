mechanism of action that these adult stem cells have on ischemic lack of blood flow heart tissue the result of the plaque deposits in the coronary arteries the stem cells derived from a person’s adipose fat tissue create new blood vessels a process known as angiogenesis these cells facilitate blood flow in the heart and intake and use of oxygen as measured by a rigorous clinical trial known

decker was a ‘product of peyton manning’ june  by rachel wold written by rachel wold ouch brandon marshall did not have much faith in his teammate eric decker last year when he first signed on with the new york jets this is decker’s recollection of a conversation between he and marshall after marshall was traded to his team “today he told me ‘i honestly thought you were a product of peyton manning like i didn’t believe you were good’” decker said per kimberley a martin of newsday marshall didn’t deny decker’s remark “i did” marshall said “i used to think ‘man it’s not fair they have peyton” decker was quite successful during his last two seasons playing with manning when he tallied a total of  yards and  touchdowns during the  seasons and his production notably dropped off during his first year as a jet with geno smith and michael vick under center that said decker undeniably returned to his “peyton” form last year when working alongside marshall catching passes from ryan fitzpatrick in fact the pair broke a previous record held by cris carter and randy moss when they both scored in nine games in  overall the duo put  touchdowns on the scoreboard last year marshall now heaps his praises on decker “he’s probably one of the better route runners in our league and i don’t think people really understand it — i didn’t even really    and then probably during the indy game in week two i was like ‘wow this dude is pretty good” obviously both receivers thrived when working with fitzpatrick with the jets and fitz currently sitting in a contentious stalemate concerning a new deal for the free agent more on that here it is looking more like decker and marshall will have to work with smith marshall and decker combined for whopping  total catches and  yards in  whether their success is directly tied to fitz will be seen soon enough however the story plays out fans can be assured both receivers will be diligently practicing and prepared to play with either

manning brandon marshall thought eric decker was a product of peyton manning after deckers season catching passes from ryan fitzpatrick he wont be doubted again by sean wagnermcgough seanjwagner jun   •  min read at this point in his career brandon marshalls played with plenty of quarterbacks there was jay cutler  on two different teams kyle orton once earned the title of marshalls top quarterback according to marshall and lets not forget about chad henne and josh mccown heres the full list as of last summer which jared dubin compiled jake plummer jay cutler twice patrick ramsey kyle orton chris simms chad henne tyler thigpen chad pennington matt moore jp losman jason campbell josh mccown and jimmy clausennow we can add ryan fitzpatrick and geno smith to that list so in all of his years  and in all of his stops  marshall has never caught passes from an undisputed top quarterback still since entering the league marshalls racked up the thirdmost yards among all receivers so when marshall joined the jets ahead of last season he was a bit skeptical of eric decker who made his name in denver catching passes from someone named peyton manning in fact marshall even told decker that he thought he was only good because of manning via newsdays kimberley a martin today he told me i honestly thought you were a product of peyton manning like i didnt believe you were good  decker says marshall lets out a giggle demonstrating his guilt i did he says smiling i used to think man its not fair they have peyton reinforcing the idea that the success of denvers receivers are a product of peyton now marshall thinks of decker a bit differently per martin hes probably one of the better route runners in our league marshall says of his buddy and i dont think people really understand it  i didnt even really    and then probably during the indy game in week  i was like wow this dude is pretty good  decker caught eight passes for  yards in the jets  win and that makes sense largely due to the fact that marshall and decker combined for  yards and  touchdowns last year they also did that with ryan fitzpatrick and geno smith occasionally as their quarterbacks if anything both marshall and decker are to blame for the jets contract tiff with fitzpatrick whose stats were inflated due to their ability to win contested passes and rescue inaccurate passes which has fitzpatrick feeling like he deserves more money than the jets have offered brandon marshall has come to appreciate eric deckers talent while playing in new york usatsi the best part about this story both marshall and decker are seemingly desperate for fitzpatrick to return to them for some strange reason neither of them have realized that fitzpatrick is simply a product of marshall and decker sean wagnermcgough cbs
