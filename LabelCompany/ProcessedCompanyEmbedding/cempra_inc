antibioticresistant bacterial pathogens have been a rising threat to human health for several years effectiveness of many antibacterial agents has declined worldwide limiting physicians options to treat serious infections antibiotic drug resistance has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality and contributes heavily to healthcare system costs worldwide the world health organization has stated that antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest healthcare challenges for the future cempra is focused on developing differentiated antibiotics to confront the rising threat of antibioticresistant pathogens two products are in clinical development solithromycin is a novel orally and intravenouslyactive broadspectrum fluoroketolide it recently completed a phase  clinical trial in patients with moderate to moderatelysevere coummunity acquired bacterial pneumonia and met both primary and secondary objectives a phase  trial for the intravenous formulation is ongoing a phase  trial for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea infection is currently underway taksta™ cem sodium fusidate is an innovative dosing regimen of a product with a long history of safety and efficacy outside the us against grampositive organisms including mrsa we have completed a phase  trial in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and a phase  clinical trial in patients

contact about preclinical programs publications investor relations solithromycin cem takstatm cem pipeline review publications medical affairs solithromycin solithromycin is a nextgeneration oral and intravenous fluoroketolide now in phase  clinical development for the treatment of moderate to moderatelysevere community acquired bacterial pneumonia cabp and urethritis a phase  clinical trial of solithromycin oral capsules met its primary and secondary objectives in the treatment of cabp macrolides  infectious disease macrolides are antimicrobial drugs that are active against aerobic and anaerobic grampositive cocci and are prescribed for the treatment of respiratory tract and soft tissue infections macrolides belong to the polyketide class of natural products the macrolide ring  a large lactone ring to which one or more deoxy sugars usually cladinose and desosamine are attached  is responsible for the antimicrobial properties of this class by reversibly binding to the s subunit of the bacterial ribosome these drugs block protein synthesis preventing bacterial growth and reproduction this action is primarily bacteriostatic however at higher concentrations macrolides can be bactericidal some of the most commonly prescribed macrolides include erythromycin azithromycin zithromax® and clarithromycin biaxin® ketolides belong to the macrolide class that is used to treat respiratory tract infections these drugs are effective against macrolideresistant bacteria because of their ability to bind to two sites on the bacterial ribosome examples include telithromycin ketek® and cethromycin the spectrum of activity of macrolides includes streptococci as well as atypical bacteria such as mycoplasma and legionella and intracellular bacteria such as chlamydia acquired bacterial resistance to macrolides occurs primarily through posttranscriptional methylation of the s bacterial ribosomal rna this results in crossresistance to macrolides lincosamides and streptogramins although rare acquired resistance can also result from the production of druginactivating enzymes such as esterases or kinases as well as the production of active atpdependent efflux proteins that transport macrolides out of the cell as more than  of pneumococci are resistant to currently available antibiotics a new macrolide is greatly needed to address this need cempra pharmaceuticals is developing solithromycin   profile of solithromycin solithromycin is a highly potent nextgeneration macrolide the first fluoroketolide which has potent activity against most macrolideresistant strains in vitro and in vivo studies have shown potent activity against s pneumoniae as well as an extended spectrum of activity against camrsa enterococci mycobacterium avium and in animal models of malaria it is also active against atypical bacteria such as legionella chlamydophila chlamydia mycoplasma and ureaplasma and against gonococci and other organisms that cause genitourinary tract infections it is  times more potent than azithromycin and is active against azithromycinresistant strains its activity against resistant strains is driven by its ability to bind to three sites on the bacterial ribosome compared to one or two for current macrolides the binding to three ribosomal sites is expected to limit resistance development solithromycin does not contain a pyridine in the side chain of the molecule as does telithromycin or ketek® that appears to interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and could be associated with serious adverse events such as visual disturbances and exacerbations of myasthenia gravis that have been observed with telithromycin phase  doseescalation studies in healthy subjects showed that solithromycin was safe and well tolerated and pkpd results support oncedaily administration of oral solithromycin phase  data demonstrated that oral solithromycin ws well tolerated with efficacy comparable with levofloxacin in patients with cabp phase  data from solitaireoral showed positive topline results with the study meeting its primary and secondary objectives a phase  oraltointravenous clinical trial in patients with cabp is ongoing we also conducted a small phase ii clinical trial of oral solithromycin in patients with uncomplicated gonococcal infections in this clinical trial a single dose of oral solithromycin cleared infection in all  evaluable patients a phase  clinical trial is currently underway publications manuscripts the links for the articles go to subscriptionbased sites and may require a fee to

results and provides corporate update management to host webcast and conference call today at  am et chapel hill nc  april    cempra inc nasdaq cemp a clinicalstage pharmaceutical company focused on developing antibiotics to meet critical medical needs in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases today reported financial results for the quarter ended march   and provided an update on recent corporate developments the company will host a webcast and conference call today at  am et with our sizable cash resources and the significant cost reduction actions we took in the first quarter along with advancing the regulatory process for solithromycin and fusidic acid and the robust process we have underway to evaluate potential strategic business opportunities we believe we are wellpositioned to deliver value to patients and shareholders said david zaccardelli pharmd acting chief executive officer of cempra first quarter  and recent corporate highlights fusidic acid        in february  cempra announced positive topline results from a phase  study of oral fusidic acid in patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections absssi fusidic acid was well tolerated in the study and achieved the primary endpoint demonstrating noninferiority ni  ni margin of oral fusidic acid compared to oral linezolid for early clinical response in the intent to treat patient population        based on the results of this study cempra plans to meet with the us food and drug administration fda in the second quarter to discuss the next steps required to bring fusidic acid to patients in the united states solithromycin        following a meeting with the fda in february  cempra has recently submitted a protocol to the fda which proposes including fewer than  patients at the time the company responds to the complete response letter it received in december         the company plans to discuss the protocol with the fda to determine if it could support an initial approval in patients with communityacquired bacterial pneumonia cabp while the company continues to accumulate a larger postapproval safety database if the company and fda agree on a protocol cempra plans to seek nondilutive funding to support the execution of the study        in march  cempra announced the company had withdrawn its marketing authorization application seeking european medicines agency ema approval of oral capsule and intravenous formulations of solithromycin for the treatment of communityacquired pneumonia in adults this action enabled the company to conserve considerable financial resources and to align its strategy to provide additional data to both the ema and fda to support potential approval corporate activities        in february  the company initiated cost and personnel reductions resulting in an approximately  percent reduction in the companys workforce and significant reductions in external spending related to commercial preparedness and nonessential activities the principal objective of the reductions was to enable the company to conserve its financial resources as it evaluates the best path forward with its existing late stage clinical pipeline and potential business development opportunities        as a result of the restructuring the company expects research and corporate expenses to trend significantly downward beginning in the second quarter of this year and expects to reduce second half  expenses by more than  percent compared to the second half of  these operating expense assumptions do not contemplate the costs associated with a commercial launch of solithromycin or any additional clinical trials with any of the companys product candidates future discussions with regulatory authorities and agreement on further clinical development requirements may lead to additional expense and the company would expect to provide more granular expense guidance at that time        in march  the company announced it had retained morgan stanley  co llc as financial advisor to the company and to lead a process to review strategic business options the goal of this process is for cempra to determine the best use of its significant cash resources and clinical programs to deliver value to patients and shareholders through internal andor potential external opportunities financial results
