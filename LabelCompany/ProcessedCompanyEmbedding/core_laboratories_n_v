suspends officer over rape allegations may terminate another with hitandrun charges close ap core laboratories nv the bear case from a bull newsfeedbackfoolcom matthew dilallo jul   core laboratories nyse clb is unabashedly bullish on its prospects after a challenging past couple of years the company expects a reversal of fortunes in the oil market this year going so far as to predict that a vshaped recovery would start taking hold that would drive its financial results higher as well fueling that forecast was cores belief that the oil supplies were falling at such a rapid rate due to underinvestment that the market would soon become vastly undersupplied that gap between supply and demand should push prices higher which would drive a rebound in drilling activitiesthat said while core labs makes a compelling case there is one thing that could derail its recovery an unexpectedly fierce rebound in us shale production heres a look at how that might cause cores recovery to fizzle out image source getty images drilling into the datain cores firstquarter report the company gave its regular update on the oil market it noted that from july to december of last year that worldwide oil inventories fell by an average of  barrels per day due to underinvestment in new supplies by oil companies furthermore it pointed out that starting in january opec and cooperating nonmembers would cut their supplies by more than  million barrels per day add it up and core anticipated that the markets undersupply could be more than  million barrels per day this year as a result core expected that the continued undersupply of crude oil should lead to extended worldwide inventory declines and a continuing rally in energy prices throughout however more recent data from the international energy administration iea showed quite the opposite occurring in its june report the iea said that oil stockpiles ballooned by  million barrels which pushed them  million barrels above the fiveyear average and higher than they were when opec announced its output cut fueling the oversupply was the fact that demand growth has been slower than expected at just  barrels per day which is below the forecast of  million barrels per day meanwhile supplies were up  million barrels per day in may which was the highest annualized increase since february  that surge in output was due to rising us shale production as well as higher output from opec as a result of surging production from libya and nigeria which are exempt from the opec output cuts these factors have the potential to keep an oil market recovery at bay especially if shale drilling continues to outpace expectations  image source getty imagescoming back with a vengeanceshale producers have already unleashed an unexpectedly massive gusher of new oil production this year according to the us energy information administration eia americas oil production averaged  million barrels per day at the end of june up  barrels a day from the yearago period more production growth is on the way according to the eias latest shortterm forecast that the us oil output will average  million barrels a day next year which in its view could drive global oil inventories higher over the next yearone of the drivers of this growth is the fact that shale drillers are producing more oil for less money for example permian basinfocused driller parsley energy nyse pe expected to increase output by  this year to a range of  barrels of oil equivalent per day boed due to a combination of several acquisitions last year and organic drilling in  however thanks to betterthanexpected well results in the first quarter parsley energy increased its fullyear production guidance by roughly  boed or nearly  at the midpoint without increasing its budget leading shale driller devon energy nyse dvn likewise delivered expectationbeating firstquarter output in fact devon energys oil production exceeded the top end of its guidance range by  barrels per day thanks to betterthanexpected well results that kept devon on track to deliver on its plan to boost output  to  by yearendbecause shale drillers are producing more oil per well its putting downward pressure on oil prices those lower prices could cause drillers especially those with weaker balance sheets to complete fewer wells this year that situation could cause the industry to hit the brakes on drilling activities which could impact the vshaped recovery that core labs envisions for its financial resultsinvestor takeawaycore labs firmly believes that the downturn in the oil industry and its financial performance are in the rearview mirror due to its perception that robust demand growth when combined with falling supplies will leave the industry undersupplied this year while i believe its view is the right one it isnt a slam dunk because shale drillers are producing more oil than anticipated due to a significant improvement in well productivity if that trend keeps up its possible that cores recovery could turn into a w instead of the v that bullish investors like me had hoped   stocks we like better than core laboratorieswhen investing geniuses

foreign exchange exitems would yield an eps of  operating income exitems was  yielding operating margins of almost  during the quarter core generated  of free cash flow fcf defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures the company continues to benefit from increasing activity in the us as cores land revenue in its production enhancement segment increased  on a sequential quarterly basis which outpaced the sequential increases in us well completions and rig count which were up  and  respectively this indicates increasing market penetration by cores newly introduced heroperfrac technology and proprietary completions diagnostic services demonstrating production enhancements strength as a technological leader in the north american upcycle as reported in previous quarters the board of supervisory directors board of core laboratories nv has established an internal performance metric of achieving a relative performance return on invested capital roic among the service companies listed as cores peers by bloomberg financial comp group based on bloombergs calculations for the latest comparable data available cores roic is the highest of comparably sized companies in its oilfield service comp group segment highlights core laboratories has realigned its operations and will begin reporting results under two segments reservoir description and production enhancement the financial statements that follow show the companys results for the first quarters of  and  and fourth quarter of  for comparison of sequential quarterly and yearoveryear quarterly results reservoir description reservoir description operations which focus primarily on producing fields in international and offshore markets and an increasing number of reservoir fluid phasebehavior and crude oil characterization projects reported first quarter  revenue of  similar to prior quarter levels operating income on a gaap basis was  with  margins while exitems it was  yielding operating margins of  the company continues to increase the number of major enhanced oil recovery eor projects for unconventional reservoirs underway in various stages several formations and different basins are under study with multiple clients core has determined that the eor techniques most effective in unconventional reservoirs will differ greatly from eor methods used in conventional reservoirs worldwide the injection of miscible gases and the application of gasadsorption techniques developed in cores laboratories at insitu reservoir pressures and temperatures have proved far superior to the pressurized physical movement of hydrocarbons using flood fronts that are typically employed in conventional fields cycling of insitu light hydrocarbon gases and the adsorption and capture of longerchained hydrocarbons in unconventional reservoirs are leading to significant improvements in oilrecovery factors in company laboratory tests on average unconventional reservoirs currently yield a recovery factor of approximately  light hydrocarbon gas injections cycling and adsorption efficiencies have yielded recoveries of up to  under laboratorybased reservoircondition testing parameters increased recovery factors applied to unconventional tightoil reservoirs significantly raise client roic fcf and the net present value of their producing assets crude oil characterization distillation and fractionation studies increased during the first quarter of  as oil company clients continued to investigate ways to maximize yields through the refining process and the company continues to invest in technologies to improve yields and product blends for its clients most recently through direct client access to realtime data from mobile devices during the quarter the company received sufficient support and industry commitments to initiate the deepwater gulf of mexico ii gom ii joint industry project jip the study will characterize lower tertiary reservoirs in the alaminos canyon keathley canyon and walker ridge areas of the deepwater gom among other areas in the study the company will utilize recently developed expertguided machine learning technology to describe thousands of feet of core that will form the basis of the project as has been the case for cores jips over the past decade the company will reduce massive petrophysical mineralogical geochemical and geomechanical data sets big data via data analytics to quantify reservoir quality throughout the study area production enhancement production enhancement operations largely focused on unconventional reservoirs benefited from increased us land activity levels and posted significantly higher first quarter  revenue operating income operating margins and incremental margins compared with the fourth quarter of  production enhancement posted first quarter  revenue of  up almost  sequentially operating margins that increased  basis points to  more than doubling the prior quarter which created sequential quarterly incremental margins of more than  with us landbased revenue for this segment up  on a sequential quarterly basis cores incremental growth outpaced the corresponding increased number of well completions and rig additions during the quarter the increase in sequential incremental margins provides evidence of production enhancements technological advantage and leverage to the north american upcycle while the company continues to maintain strict cost control core labs clients are using the companys more technologically advanced products and services to further enhance their completion programs key examples are heroperfrac and flowprofilertm completion diagnostics the companys recently released heroperfrac perforating system provides consistent hole sizes throughout the perforating cluster thereby maximizing frac efficiency and increasing stimulated reservoir volume srv this system equalizes the perforating friction and allows all perforations to contribute to the fracing operation also tortuosity is reduced enhancing proppant deployment at lower hydraulic pumping pressures the heroperfrac system is specifically designed to provide  contribution of perforating clusters require minimal hydraulic horsepower to efficiently place fracture treatments maximize srv and increase ultimate recovery from the reservoir the heroperfrac system is proving to be far superior to conventional perforating systems decades old sandjet perforating techniques and sliding sleeves which have limited applications to some tightoil reservoirs cores heroperfrac is the companys best perforating technology introduction for unconventional natural gas and tight oil reservoirs since cores launch of its industry leading herohr perforating product line to further support cores clients who are increasingly focused on enhancing their stimulation programs the company is expanding its industrywide consortia to evaluate the use of multiple proppants and proppant sizes to improve the effectiveness of hydraulic fracing programs cores proppant consortia is composed of more than  technologically sophisticated clients including anadarko apache aramco bhp bp conoco phillips devon eog newfield energy oxy pioneer natural resources shell and ypf amongst others oilfield service companies in the consortia include baker hughes halliburton and schlumberger amongst others core will increase its evaluation of mesh sand and will add  and mesh sand micro proppants to its dynamic flow models and conductivity testing finer mesh sands are thought to prop secondary and tertiary fracture networks significantly expanding srv and therefore increasing hydrocarbon flow rates and estimated ultimate recovery from tightoil reservoirs cores proppant consortia also have been asked to investigate the effectiveness of higher density proppant loading pumped at higher flow rates via larger wellbore tubulars free cash flow and dividends during the first quarter of  cores operations generated  in cash from operating activities and had capital expenditures of  yielding  of fcf representing  of net income and  of revenue cores fcf has exceeded net income in  of the last  years on  january  the board announced a quarterly cash dividend of  per share of common stock which was paid on  february  to shareholders of record on  january  dutch withholding tax was deducted from the dividend at a rate of  on  april  the board announced a quarterly cash dividend of  per share of common stock payable in the second quarter of  the quarterly cash dividend will be payable  may  to shareholders of record on  april  dutch withholding tax will be deducted from the dividend at a rate of  return on invested capital as reported in previous quarters the companys board has established an internal performance metric of achieving a relative roic performance compared with the oilfield service companies listed as cores comp group by bloomberg financial the company and its board believe that roic is a leading longterm performance metric used by shareholders to determine the relative investment value of publicly traded companies further the company and its board believe that shareholders will benefit if core consistently performs at high levels of roic among its comp group according to the latest financial information from bloomberg cores roic is the highest of any comparably sized oilfield service company in its comp group comp group companies listed by bloomberg include halliburton schlumberger baker hughes oceaneering national oilwell varco and oil states international amongst others a total of  of the  companies listed in the comp group failed to post roic that exceeded their weighted average cost of capital wacc cores ratio of roic to wacc is the highest of any comparably sized company in the comp group second quarter  revenue and eps guidance as has been the case for past recoveries core expects its revenue growth to ultimately outperform the increase in industry activity rates by  to  basis points core expects to generate incremental operating income margins of up to approximately  early in the activity recovery phase followed by historical incremental operating income margins of approximately  to  well into the recovery phase cores north america revenue is correlated with completion and stimulation events and largescale reservoir rock and reservoir fluid characterization studies rather than with immediate increases in rig count wells need to be drilled and subsequently completed stimulated and cored  or have reservoir fluid samples collected  before core can realize a revenue event core is benefiting from increased us onshore activity and expects revenue and operating income to increase further in  as international and offshore markets improve with additional major capital project announcements core expects its deepwater revenues which are currently  of the total company revenue to bottom in the second half of  activities relating to new project announcements that should drive cores revenue higher in consecutive quarters throughout  further expanding incremental operating margins as core projected the companys third quarter  results established the bottom of the expected vshaped recovery that the company expects to continue in  core believes that the global crude oil market is currently undersupplied this is indicated by recent international energy agency data showing that worldwide crude oil inventory has declined over six of the last seven months from july to december  worldwide crude inventories fell by an average of approximately  bopd in addition considering the january  opec cuts of approximately  bopd plus cuts from cooperating nonopec producers including russia the world market could be undersupplied by more than  bopd the continued undersupply of crude oil should lead to extended worldwide inventory declines and a continuing rally in energy prices throughout  for the second quarter of  core projects its business to improve further primarily from increasing activity levels in the us and stabletoup international offshore and deepwater markets offsetting lower canadian activities due to spring breakup international rig counts increased  in the first quarter a second consecutive quarterly increase after eight consecutive quarters of decline and in the us offshore new well permits in the gom increased  over yearago march levels core projects second quarter  revenue of approximately  to  and eps of  to  operating income is expected to range between  and  yielding operating margins of approximately  and companywide sequential quarterly incremental margins to increase sequentially to approximately  second quarter  fcf once again is expected to exceed net income and core anticipates reactivating its share repurchase program during the quarter core expects the effective tax rate for the second quarter to be approximately  earnings

httprdffreebasecomnsmeasurementunitdatedpercentage  if youre writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
