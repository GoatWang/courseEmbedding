lime application for the management of munitions constituents following blowinplace operations by jared l johnson book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide blowinplace operations provide a proven method of handling unexploded ordnance but they also deliver significant amounts of munitions constituents residues to the environment these residues may persist and affect environmental sustainability on training ranges alkaline hydrolysis is a wellestablished method for the destruction of explosives compounds the objective of this study was to measure the efficacy of onsite treatment of munitions constituents with hydrated lime following blowinplace operations samples taken immediately following topical application of hydrated lime demonstrate that lime does have an immediate effect on rdx concentration however munitions constituents residues unaffected by lime treatment remained at the end of the study probably because of poor contact between munitions constituents residues and hydrated lime this study highlighted three challenges to consider as technology development moves forward on alkaline treatment of munitions constituents first inconsistent rdx concentrations obscured the results of the field study second the application method will make an important impact on the success of the treatment finally application rates will need to be tailored to individual applications so that enough alkaline material is delivered to effect complete destruction of the munitions constituent residues of concern progress report on concrete experimental test sections in brazos county texas by jeffrey l davis book  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide potential for biodegradation of the alkaline hydrolysis end products of tnt and rdx  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide energetic compounds such as trinitrotoluene tnt hexahydrotrinitrotriazine rdx and their degradation products can act as a source of contamination for soil on department of defense testing and training ranges basecatalyzed hydrolysis degrades nitroaromatics and nitramines and the potential effectiveness of this reaction in soil has been demonstrated at both bench and pilot scales this report evaluates the potential for soil bacteria to degrade the transformation products from the alkaline hydrolysis of munitions residues the media were obtained from the hydrolytic destruction of tnt and rdx at ph   and  duplicate reactors were amended with clabeled explosive compounds benchscale microcosms incubated aerobically and anaerobically using grenade range soil as the inoculum and reaction mixtures quenched and neutralized as the media showed that there is a potential for biodegradation nutrient analysis confirmed the presence of increased levels of nitrite and formate following both aerobic and anaerobic incubation tnt end products from alkaline hydrolysis were aerobically mineralized with  clabel recovered as co rdx reaction end products demonstrated much greater mineralization than tnt roughly threefold the use of alkaline material on training ranges has the potential to treat sourcezone energetics contamination topical lime treatment for containment of source zone energetics contamination  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide energetic compounds such as trinitrotoluene tnt and hexahydrotrinitrotriazine rdx and their degradation products can act as a source of contamination for soil on department of defense testing and training ranges base hydrolysis degrades nitroaromatics and nitramines and the potential effectiveness of lime to induce this reaction has been demonstrated at the laboratory scale the objective of this research was to further examine both basic and applied aspects of alkaline application as an inexpensive and effective means of reducing sourcezone contamination on military ranges benchscale microcosms were used to examine basic conditions that could affect the alkaline hydrolysis reaction such as soil organic matter content lime concentration soil type and contamination type results from experiments using soil from a variety of ammunition production facilities and training ranges in general support the use of explosive contaminant treatment by alkaline material in wellmixed systems rdx in crystalline form was more resistant to treatment possibly due to limitations associated with the dissolution of the rdx from the crystal to the aqueous phase largerscale experiments conducted in vessels packed with approximately  kg of soil were used to investigate topical versus wellmixed applications of three alkaline materials hydrated lime quicklime and class c fly ash tnt rdx and hmx in the mixed system were removed quickly from both the leachate and soil however results from experiments with topical applications of alkali material indicated that the aqueous transport of hydroxide ion was not sufficient to overcome the buffering capacity of the soil consequently the soil ph was not raised to the extent necessary for alkaline treatment of explosive compounds this result is fundamentally related to the cec properties of the soil and is consequently considered a soil specific and therefore site

trinitrotoluene tnt in aqueous solutions book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide electrolytic reactive barriers ebarriers consist of closely spaced permeable electrodes installed across a groundwater contaminant plume in a permeable reactive barrier format application of sufficient potential to the electrodes results in sequential oxidation and reduction of the target contaminant the objective of this study was to quantify the mass distribution of compounds produced during sequential electrolytic oxidation and reduction of ordinance related compounds orcs in a laboratory analog to an ebarrier in this study a series of column tests were conducted using rdx hexahydro trinitrofriazine and tnt trinitrotoluene as representative orcs the experimental setup consisted of a plexiglass column packed with quartfeldspar sand to simulate aquifer conditions a single set of porous electrodes consisting of expanded titaniummixed metal oxide mesh was placed at the midpoint of the soil column as a onedimensional analog to an ebarrier constant current of  ma variable voltage was applied to the electrode set initial studies involved quantification of reaction products using unlabeled rdx and tnt approximately  percent of the influent concentration was transformed in one pass through sequential oxidationreduction for both

tetrachloroethylene in clay book  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide engineering considerations for hydroxide treatment of training ranges  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide the use of hydrated lime has the potential to be an effective in situ technology for the destruction and containment of explosives contamination this was proven with the results from the serdp project cu where it was shown to rapidly degrade rdx and tnt however prior to field deployment of this technology additional experimental work was required to address concerns regarding the mechanism of the alkaline hydrolysis reaction the character of the final products of the reaction the potential for biodegradation of the reaction products and the amount of lime required for alkaline hydrolysis in different soils the results can be summarized as follows first spectroscopic studies of the tnt alkaline hydrolysis reaction identified two wellresolved and spectrally distinct reaction intermediates a single radical species was formed during the tnt hydroxide reaction that correlated with the second reaction intermediate second tnt and rdx degraded rapidly through alkaline hydrolysis at ph  the end products of the reaction were low watersoluble molecular weight compounds that included nitrate and format no polymer formation was observed under these reaction conditions third anaerobic and aerobic incubation of neutralized hydrolysis reaction mixtures with range soil showed that there is a high potential for biodegradation this was evidenced by mineralization of reaction end products production of clabeled carbon dioxide and a decrease in nitrite and nitrate concentrations fourth a simple method to predict the lime required by different soils under different environmental and contamination conditions was developed based on current astm methods for raising soil ph a guidance document was prepared to provide site managers a means to easily and inexpensively determine the lime dosage required to raise ph to levels required for munitions and metals remediation analysis of rdx and rdx breakdown products in environmental samples  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the identification and quantification of explosives and their degradation products in soil and natural waters is helpful in the design of remediation technologies mobility investigations and performing risk assessments the objective of this study was to develop a method for the determination of the degradation of nitramine compounds specifically hexahydrotrinitrotriazine rdx the analytical methods developed in this study were based on reversedphase high performance liquid chromatography hplc using both c and cn bonded silica columns to eliminate common interferences contaminant identification was further confirmed by performing spectral analysis of the compounds upon elution the proposed method yields good separation of rdx from its degradation products and from other common energetic compounds method detection limits for the proposed method ranged from  to  mgl this method satisfies the need for analytical techniques to monitor the formation and subsequent degradation products of toxic and carcinogenic nitrosyl substituted nitramines alkaline hydrolysis

needs here are some of the more common dentists people seek out to improve their oral healthgeneral dentist these dentists generally serve as the primary provider of dental care if you need your teeth cleaned crowns and bridges placed or any number of cosmetic procedures book an appointment with a general dentist though not as common these dentists will also provide more specialized services including some forms of oral surgery  chief among them root canals and restorative care  fitting patients with a mouthguard and counseling people on how to stop smoking and what constitutes proper nutritionendodontist to become an endodontist means undergoing an additional two years of training beyond dental school as a result these specialized dentists perform more specific procedures beyond general teeth cleaning and repair work while a dentist may perform a handful of root canal treatments in a week an endodontist may end up working on  or more in the same timespan your average endodontist also repairs teeth damaged by trauma and performs endodontic retreatments which is repeat root canal procedure their added training also means that the endodontist is much more adept at utilizing complex dental equipment  especially ultrasonic instruments or microscopes most of that equipment is used to improve the health of teeth that are affected by disease and even congenital deformitiespediatric dentist proper oral care starts when youre young and thats why pediatric dentists are so important these dentists treat people under the age of  though there are exceptions based on a childs unique dental background pediatric dentists face unique challenges because they must treat newly teething babies and children losing their primary teeththough cleanings are an integral part of their job pediatric dentists are mostly concerned with planning ahead that means working to ensure the child has straight teeth and correcting an improper bite however they also help address more childspecific conditions of thumb sucking and an overreliance on pacifiers as a result pediatric dentists usually require an additional twoyear residency working with infants and childrenoral pathologist pathology refers to the study of disease specifically as it presents in tissue oral pathologists then are responsible for studying the diseases that affect the tissue of the mouth and other surrounding muscle groups these experts are considered to be true specialists having focused their work on very niche areas of both dentistry and pathology though oral pathology is rather specialized its a vital component of the oral health industry by analyzing tissue taken from biopsies oral pathologists can help diagnose and eventually treat a number of oral diseases including leukoplakia cementoma and squamous cell carcinoma among othersperiodontist similar to the endodontist periodontists receive several additional years of training beyond dental school however whereas endodontists study advanced treatments periodontists generally have a very specific field of interest your average periodontist focuses less on cleanings and more on diagnosing and treating gingivitis periodontitis which is an untreated form of the aforementioned ailment and other periodontal diseases periodontists treat patients with more complicated oral care backgrounds those people who require root planing  where dentists clean any infected surfaces  and root debridement or the removal of dead tissue periodontists are especially concerned with proper gum health including painful recession and teeth alignmentcosmetic dentist most of the aforementioned dentists are concerned with the health and wellbeing of a patients teeth while that is important to cosmetic dentists they specialize in a number of different treatments meant to enhance the look or aesthetic of your teeth to begin the average appointment cosmetic dentists will examine your teeth for any imperfections or irregularities and then suggest ways to make your teeth more white or properly aligned the most popular such treatments are bleaching  where special chemicals are used to whiten your teeth  placing veneers or caps to alter the appearance of teeth and bonding where dentists fill unappealing gaps with structural replacement materialorthodontist orthodontists are responsible for treating most dental irregularities which includes everything from misaligned jaws  like an under or overbite  to overcrowding teeth and even certain cosmetic issues following dental school the wouldbe orthodontist then has another three years of schooling most of which is clinical experience in an orthodontic residency program to properly diagnose and treat most dentofacial issues the orthodontist relies on a collection of corrective gear that includes braces retainers and various facemask configurations though orthodontists work with people of all ages the bulk of patients are young children and teensprosthodontist similar to the field of orthodontics the average prosthodontist receives an additional three years of training following dental school and though prosthodontics is something of a cosmetic field like orthodontics its primarily concerned with replacing missing teeth prosthodontists have a number of teethreplacing procedures to implement including filling veneers onlays and inlays bridges crowns and complete or partial dentures beyond their work in implant dentistry these experts treat a number of other mouthrelated ailments namely snoring postcancer jaw reconstruction traumatic injuries and pain related to lock jaw and other temporomandibular joint disordersoral and maxillofacial radiologist similar to endodontists these specialists  one of nine such unique fields recognized by the american dental association  utilize machinery to treat and diagnose patients specifically these dentists make use of radiographic imaging to treat those diseases and ailments that impact the teeth mouth and the maxillofacial region which consists of the face and jaw while xrays are a popular option omrs also rely on plain and computed tomography mris ultrasounds and other forms of digital imaging omrs are among the first adaptors of new technology using innovations in the field of imaging to find increasingly effective ways at understanding the impact of oral disease and what that means to patientsoral and maxillofacial surgeon your primary dentist may refer you to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon if you experience facial pain or if he or she suspects you have some variety of oral cancer omss are also your primary source when planning most oral surgeries like tooth extractions cyst repairs and removals and dental implants however an oms can also treat a number of other ailments and diseases related to the maxillofacial region for instance malformations in your facial bones can cause sleep apnea and an oms can perform corrective surgery that removes or shapes bone many of these experts are also involved with more cosmetic procedures performing or assisting with facial implants and rhinoplasty in which the nose bone is modifieddental public health clinics these clinics are available in most cities across the us and theyre meant to offer affordable health care to many lowincome families and individuals though it differs depending on the specific clinic the average clinic offers only the most essential oral care services including xrays teeth cleaning basic root canals and repairs and tooth extractions the fees an individual pays depend on a number of different factors and most clinics have a slidingfee that is determined equally by income and family sizemost common oral care issuesthere are several different kinds of dentists each one with his or her own specialty however there are a core group of ailments all dentists treat conditions includetooth decay when your teeth fall out or begin to disintegrate in your mouth improper brushing is often to blame certain infections also cause tooth loss or decay one of the most affective ways to prevent tooth decay is with regular brushing and flossing right at homebad breath as your teeth fall out or you dont brush properly your gums and teeth begin to break down and cause foul odors other causes of bad breath include gum disease and oral infections as with tooth decay brushing and flossing are vital as is regular tongue scraping and the use of mouthwashteeth sensitivity some people are born with teeth that are naturally sensitive to cold a lack of brushing can also comprise your teeths natural protection the best method to help protect otherwise sensitive teeth is to use specialized toothpaste geared toward people with worn or damaged teethdry mouth certain medications will cause your salivary glands to stop producing spit this in turn can harm the structure of your teeth and gums there are several athome measures you can take to combat dry mouth these include regular hydration chewing sugarfree gum which also hydrates your mouth and avoiding mouthwash with alcohol in it which dries out your entire mouthteeth grinding for many people grinding their teeth  also known as bruxism  is a subconscious behavior usually the result of stress it can eventually damage your teeth the only way to treat your grinding habit is to meet with an endodontist who will fit you with with a bite plate to mitigate the damage to your teethmouth sores also called canker sores these painful bumps are the result of irritation to the soft tissue of your mouth these sores can make brushing almost impossible there are a number of different causes for sores including anemia or a vitamin b deficiency as a result your primary physician will have to examine the bump find its root cause and then help develop a specific treatment plan including the use of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation or antimicrobial mouthwashdiscoloration yellow teeth are the result of a number of bad habits mainly smoking drinking too much coffee and improper nutrition proper brushing can usually prevent discolored teeth before they happen however if your teeth become worse many dentists will treat with a whitening procedurea guide for dental care basicsproper oral care begins at home the following are a few preventative measures you can take to keep your teeth and gums healthy they just may reduce your time spent in your dentists chairremember your angles when brushing your teeth always place the brush at a degree angle that way youre able to hit every surface of each toothdont forget the tongue within your mouth your tongue is the largest source of bacteria be sure to brush it front to back and dont forget the sidesfloss everyday brushing alone isnt enough to keep your mouth healthy and thats why flossing is so important each time you floss be sure to have at least  inches of floss available which is what you should go through if you use proper technique for optimal control hold the floss between your thumbs and forefingerswatch what you eat sugar alcohol and coffee all contain phosphorus while some can prove beneficial too much of this chemical can eat away at your teeth and gumskeep in mind the mouthwash though not a requirement mouthwash can be helpful if used to supplement proper brushing and flossing most mouthwash brands contain chlorine dioxide a chemical that targets the majority of oral bacterial strains however dont overuse mouthwash as it can cause a number of ailmentshow to choose the right dentistproper oral care is an integral component of your greater wellbeing which highlights why having the right dentist is of the utmost importance consider the following as you make an effort to find a dentist who will fit your unique medical historyfind a recommendation its important to use a dentist whom you feel comfortable with because thats difficult to achieve by simply choosing names out of a phone book you should always seek out a recommendation whether its a friend family member or coworker this individual can offer intimate details about a dentists demeanor operating style and approach to patient care be sure to always ask plenty of questionsvet your dentist once you get a recommendation from a friend dont simply book your first cleaning right away instead meet with any prospective dentists to conduct a series of pretreatment interview during this session you can ask them about what treatments they perform most often procedures theyre not as familiar with what accreditation they have or any organizations they belong to and how their offices handles insurance and payments just be aware that booking this time can be difficult based on a dentists scheduleconsider accessibility and other factors perhaps youve met a dentist with whom you feel comfortable not only that but this dentists payment options are suitable for your finances however dont be so quick to make a final decision as other factors may influence your choice is the dentists office nearby or do you have to drive out of your way is the office open at a time that will fit the rest of your schedule how much flexibility will the dentists staff offer in booking appointments though seemingly trivial these factors are nonetheless importantcheck with your state board one of the last things you should do before coming to a decision is to check with your states dental board dentists must abide by different rules and regulations depending on where they practice and the state board can outline what requirements your candidate must meet these organizations can also offer information about any discrepancies in the dentists background and if he or she has faced any disciplinary actionspicking the right dental insuranceas with other forms of health care insurance is a great way to both reduce associated costs and ensure you and your dependents receive the best care possible however you dont want to simply buy the first such plan you see here are some factors to consider when shopping for dental insurancepick your plan there is no such thing as a onesizefitsall dental insurance plan instead most people purchase three main varieties usually through their employers an indemnity or feeforservice plan is just as it sounds and means youll have to pay for annual deductibles and coinsurance payments out of pocket a preferred provider organization is less costly and you choose from a network of dentists however ppos have some limitations and accompanying deductibles similarly a dental health maintenance organization plan limits you to just a few choices of dentists and one doctor handles all of your oral care needs however these hmo are usually much less costlyexamine the networks as noted ppo plans and dental hmos work with only a select number of doctors while that usually means fewer costs compared to other insurance plans or payment options it also means you dont have quite as much say in the dentist who can treat you that doesnt necessarily have to be a bad thing especially if you know who is in the network before purchasing the plan youll receive a list of dentists in each network do research on each doctor  just as you would when picking a dentist otherwise from there you can then pick a plan with doctors who meet your standards and requirementsconsider your coverage sometimes its not just the doctor that you want to consider for many people even the plans with the best doctors are deemed a bad choice the reason the coverage is lessthanstellar when picking a plan you need to look at just how much youll pay for each and every service for instance some plans wont cover your fillings or xrays while others may charge more or less for a crown or tooth extraction knowing just what youll be responsible for is important as you dont want to be caught offguard by unforeseen charges depending on your employer a human resources specialist can walk you through specific coverage optionsmake your plan work for you its a sad fact that the dentist you want most might not be covered by the plan youve purchased however that doesnt mean that you have to look for dental services elsewhere if youre truly comfortable with a dentist and you feel he or she can be an ally in your ongoing oral care regimen then consider signing a plan to just keep that dentist available that means potentially deal with costs and other insurancerelated factors that you might have wanted to if need be you might be able to work with the dentists office to address some of the planspecific concerns we just
