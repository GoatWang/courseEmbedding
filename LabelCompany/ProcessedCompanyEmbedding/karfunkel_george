are poor jewish kids in mids hungary unlike so many you managed to avoid the holocaust only to be swept up in a bitter revolt against the cruel soviet occupation government the revolt fails and like tens of thousands of your countrymen you leave your homeland and its bloodshed and manage to make your way to new york and a new future your name is michael karfunkel your younger brother is george and fast forwarding nearly  years your future is something even horatio alger wouldn’t have thought possible quiet careers in business at the periphery of wall street new york real estate and the insurance industry with an aversion to publicity that is rarely seen have made both men billionaires according to forbes magazine like so many rich people the karfunkels opened nonprofit foundations to share their good fortune through the donation of large blocks of amtrust financial services shares — an insurance concern they built in the s — their foundations have amassed considerable size as the share price rose by the end of  michael karfunkel’s hod foundation had assets of  million his brother george’s chesed foundation of america had assets of  million their foundations give almost exclusively to yeshivas and synagogues connected to haredi judaism many of which are affiliated with the belz hasidic sect and this is where the story would normally end a miraculously successful pair of brothers who in their later years — michael is now  and george is  — have the rare privilege of seeing their fortunes put to good use except that taking a hard look at how these foundations operate leaves a lot more questions than answers for three months the southern investigative reporting foundation analyzed the foundations’ publicly available documents primarily though citizenauditorg an online repository of nonprofit foundation annual reports what we found was that all good intentions aside hod means “prayerful submission” in hebrew and chesed translates to “loving kindness” regulatory filings indicate that the foundations while generously supportive of the belz hasidic community have become key instruments in furthering the karfunkels’ business interests unfortunately for them based on sirf’s analysis it appears that their management of the foundations may expose them to regulatory scrutiny and possibly force them to sell a large amount of their foundation’s amtrust shares creating a material concern for company shareholders what follows below is how lax regulation and imprudent management turned the capstone of the american dream into what may be the first act of an american nightmare —————————– the karfunkel brothers nonprofit foundations reflect their unusual tolerance for risk george and michael karfunkel’s first attempt at making their way on wall street is illustrative employees at a mutual fund boiler room called economic planning corp their bid to diversify the firm into the capital markets ended with them in the center of a wideranging pump and dump scam that collapsed in  never disclosed in their amtrust filings the securities and exchange commission injunction and suspensions they received hardly set them back in response to a question about the lack of disclosure surrounding their sec sanctions the karfunkels’ spokesman kekst and company’s robert siegfried said the brothers have nothing to disclose having sought and obtained a dissolution of the sec injunction in january  the karfunkels’ spokesman declined to provide sirf with the motions arguing for dismissal stating that they are a matter of public record a search of pacer the online legal database however did not yield any results their next venture american stock transfer  trust a share registry that tracked changes in holders of record in the stock and options of publiclytraded corporations was a spectacular success and was sold to an australian company for  billion in may  while managing american stock transfer the brothers began cobbling together seemingly disparate insurance units in  calling the collection amtrust financial services the company listed shares in  with barry zyskind michael karfunkel’s soninlaw installed as chief executive unlike other mediumsized commercial insurers like wr berkeley who focus on standard retail and commercial policy business amtrust is a publiclytraded portfolio of  insurance risks like italian medical malpractice manufacturer warranties and california workers’ compensation from enough distance there’s wisdom aplenty in seeking out niche markets as less competition in insurance can offer high returns but those profits come with ample risk there is an established pattern of insurance companies that grow quickly misjudging the breadth of risk in their portfolio and facing cruel reckonings when claims begin to mount and reserves prove inadequate amtrust however has had no reckoning despite a mounting chorus of critics who have voiced their concerns over the quality of its disclosures and accounting  the company’s response to the skeptics was bolstered by the company’s strong recent earnings report the hod and chesed foundation’s employ risk in a fashion rarely seen in other private foundations this is an interesting orientation for a foundation given that the irs the federal regulator for private foundations has a blunt view of the role of risk in managing foundation’s operations and assets — namely to avoid it but in case a foundation executive didn’t get the message the irs released guidelines designed to prevent “a lack of reasonable business care and prudence” in the foundation’s management called “jeopardizing investments” the irs document promises additional scrutiny of a foundation if it starts to do things like use options employ leverage or started making swingforthefences trades where the riskreward ration was clearly skewed towards risk spending time in the hod and chesed filings reveals that the irs memorandum didn’t make much of an impression on the karfunkels because much of what the irs warned about is how their foundations have regularly done business for instance they used their foundations to make aggressive directional market bets on controversial stocks to that end consider michael karfunkel’s waltz with fannie mae put options in mid according to the hod foundation filings starting in june  and ending a year later michael karfunkel began selling put options on fannie mae stock a strategy that limited his profit to the option premium or price on the put options he sold but in mid fannie mae the grand central terminal of mortgage risk was the proverbial house on fire a once highflying company en route to a collapse into  conservatorship the highstakes wager on fannie mae’s survival cost the foundation a total of  million the rationale for the trade aside it is a fine example of the skewed riskreward ratio the irs warned about — hod’s profits were capped at  million chesed also paid dearly for george karfunkel’s adventures with citigroup options trading in  when he sold nearly  put option contracts making him effectively long the stock as the bank began to totter towards its midseptember bailout like his brothers bet on fannie mae he was effectively betting that an institution laden with dubious mortgagerelated securities would emerge essentially unscathed from the then raging crisis as it stands it was a spectacularly bad bet with the trade costing chesed over  with potential profits capped at about  similar bets on aig a loss of nearly  and lehman brothers a loss of almost  also proved costly another remarkable aspect of these trades is their timing with the lehman brothers and aig option positions being opened on friday sept with both once iconic companies promptly collapsing that weekend the historical price action for both lehman and aig in the weeks leading up to that friday is testament to the depth of investor panic shorting the puts of these companies wasn’t so much speculation as an attempt to catch a falling knife contrary to the karfunkel’s assertions below losses from their option trading adventures — in combination with the collapse in the equity markets — had a disastrous effect on the fair market value of the foundation’s portfolios with declines of  percent for hod and  percent for chesed through their spokesman the karfunkel’s responded that the use of options — common among veteran market participants such as themselves — did not lead to a material decline in the size of the foundation portfolios especially given the intensity of the  market collapse a chart they provided sirf of both foundations portrayed their book value growth as favorable to a peer group of similarlysized family foundations this is the full karfunkel reply the more you dig into how hod and chesed conduct their affairs the idea of the foundations as complex economic vehicles begins to emerge for instance both foundations use margin — money borrowed from a bank or broker — to presumably amplify investment returns the  chesed filing lists a  million margin account hod’s  margin account filing shows just under  million of margin owed moreover both foundations regularly extend loans like hod’s unnamed  million receivable from  this is a potential red flag according to regulations foundations are allowed to receive zero interest loans but they are prohibited from making loans or extending credit especially to what the irs refers to as “disqualified persons” a term meaning the founder their spouse and immediate family members as well as substantial donors to the fund these issues come to the fore when the relationships between hod and chesed and a complex entity called the michael karfunkel  grantor annuity trust are explored known in financial planning circles as a grat these structures are a popular way for the ultrawealthy to pass down part of their estate taxfree grat’s allow a grantor like michael karfunkel to transfer assets into a trust for a specified period in return the trust pays the grantor an annuity over a set period of time at the end of the term what assets remain can be distributed taxfree among beneficiaries distilled to its essence a grat is a bet that the assets in the trust will increase in value this bloomberg news article argues that for the grantor the bet often pays off spectacularly filings disclose that hod was owed money by the michael karfunkel  grantor annuity trust  in  and  and chesed started disclosing a receivable in  with a  loan after  hod’s filings no longer mention a receivable to the grat but chesed does with the beneficiaries of the trust disclosed as michael karfunkel’s wife leah and their children including his daughter esther the wife of amtrust ceo barry zyskind the concept of the grat owing money is troubling given the selfdealing prohibitions described above more than just being at the center of a series of eyebrowraising transactions however the michael karfunkel  grat is also the owner of acp re holdings ltd a bermudabased reinsurer that is attempting to purchase troubled insurer tower group international ltd one of the fundamental questions sirf had about michael karfunkel’s grat was about a july   sec filing disclosing that he had “gifted”  worth over  million at the then share price amtrust shares to the grat two things are noteworthy about the filing the first is that it was made four months late with the transaction occurring on march  the second is that making a contribution of additional shares to a grat is flat out forbidden in reply to sirf’s questions the karfunkel’s said that no loans were extended to or from the grat but rather the receivable balance was due to the transfer agent getting behind on bookentries which led to the grat receiving dividends otherwise owed to hod a problem soon discovered and corrected the issue of the additional contribution to the grat was according to the spokesman part of the transfer agent lag time issue referenced above their response in full is here the karfunkel response is quite frankly odd start with the fact that irs and sec filings have no record of or reference to any stock transfer whatsoever between hod and the grat an elaboration on these points from the karfunkels’ spokesman is linked at the bottom reconciling the balance of their reply with the documentary record didn’t get any easier for example the grat by definition is prohibited from distributing assets — like their purported  gift of amtrust shares to hod — to anyone including beneficiaries until the annuity with michael karfunkel the grantor is executed whatever the attributes or drawbacks to the grat as a financial instrument it is designed as a simple contract there is an annuitant karfunkel the beneficiaries his family and the rest is math based on interviews with wall street operations department veterans it appears unusual that a transfer agent would be unable to discern who the grantor was nor would a “donation” from a grat — imagining that it was even legally feasible — be a rational exercise if a donor wanted to make a donation to a charity why would they take assets from the taxadvantaged grat structure and defeat the purpose of passing on taxfree gains to beneficiaries for an independent view sirf called richard b covey the yearold carter ledyard  milburn llp partner who developed the grat in  and without using their name described the karfunkel grat transactions as laid out in the sec and irs filings transactions contacted at his spring lake nj home in early august mr covey was blunt in his response to the scenario we posed “that’s an absurd question no one rational would seek to add assets after the annuity is struck it would violate the agreement under most every understanding of a grat” said covey “they would be better off just opening a second grat” when asked to elaborate on this covey said the construct of a grat is cut and dry its fundamental component is the annuity which at bottom is a contract that takes an asset and pays out a specified amount at some agreed upon date in the future adding assets after the contract is struck changes the contract’s entire equation covey said nor for the record did he understand why a grat could make a donation covey when asked if there was some longburied exception to these grat rules said that without resorting to broad brush condemnations he still wouldn’t want to be a lawyer pressing the argument in front of a hypothetical judge but perhaps “there is a one in one thousand scenario where they could convince a judge an exception was warranted” —————————– the karfunkel brothers foundations grew to their current size after an earlier family charitable vehicle the karfunkel family foundation distributed most of its assets to hod and chesed between  and  — almost  million or  percent of its then  million was given to the foundations — and their asset base continued to grow sharply afterwards from large grants of amtrust and other stocks that’s all standard enough what’s really interesting is buried towards the back of the filings where the donations are disclosed where some arithmetic reveals that the large blocks of stock donated were valued at prices sharply higher than the market price on the day of the grant there’s only one beneficiary from inflating an asset value and it’s the donor who gets a receipt allowing them to claim an out sized — and inappropriate — deduction for its part a foundation is saddled with an overpriced asset that locks in a loss if they sell in the near term and which exaggerates their asset base the donation of overvalued shares was not a onetime event for the karfunkel brothers but was done at least six times between  and  of the nearly  million in shares chesed received from george karfunkel sirf estimates that almost  million of this came from valuations above the thenmarket prices for his part michael karfunkel’s donation on dec   of fannie mae maiden holdings and amtrust stock that he valued at  to hod appear to have been  million overvalued to prevent something like this from happening the irs implemented an accounting policy fair market value to serve as a template for gifts of publicly listed securities whether its berkshire hathaway or a mercurial biotech startup all stock gifts are put on the books at the average of the high and lowtrades on the day the donation is made so how could rich sophisticated donors like the karfunkels stumble over this methodology sirf asked ronnie mclure a dallas texas accountant and university professor whose practice has frequently provided accounting services to private foundations if there is room for interpretation in the statutes “there isn’t really a way around using fair market value for public securities” mclure said “the federal regulations make that one easy and with liquid stocks the accountant can’t avoid it” regardless the karfunkels seem to prefer a more freewheeling approach consider the nov   donation of  shares of mru holdings to chesed valued at  in the annual filing this implies a price of  a share the closing price on that date however was  making chesed’s valuation — and his deduction — over  greater than if he had donated it at market price other instances would emerge on jul   george karfunkel gave chesed one million shares of plano texasbased energy concern cubic energy and  million shares of amtrust worth the filing asserted  million chesed’s claimed value was well above the market value of the securities according to yahoofinance the average of the high and low prices for cubic and amtrust on jul   were respectively  and  versus chesed’s implied values of  and  per share sirf used yahoofinance for historical prices and used the unadjusted stock price to reflect the price of the security on that date so that subsequent dividends and stock splits would not distort comparisons using the average of the high and low stock prices on jul   the gift should have been worth  million on jul   chesed received  shares of citigroup from karfunkel that it claimed were worth  million or  per share citigroup’s average share price on the date the donation was recorded was  making the value of the entire block of stock just over  million a difference of  million and it gets weirder recall that chesed’s tax year is from jul  to jun  the  form  has a filing date of jun   so when citigroup announced a  reverse split on may   the share prices were readjusted upwards by a factor of  what chesed did is claim a value for the jul   donation that was not in effect until over  months later incredibly even after the reverse split chesed’s implied value of  or  was still above the  average jul   price in  george karfunkel made another two grants to chesed  shares of organovo on november  and  million shares of biotime on jul  valued at  million or  and  a share respectively the claimed values were again higher than organovo’s thenaverage market prices of  and biotime’s  the market was closed jul   so sirf used prices from jun   the fair value of the gift comes in just under  million  million under what chesed stated   company  symbol  shares granted value of grant implied px fmv difference mru holdings      cubic energy cbnr      amtrust  afsi      citigroup c      biotime btx      organovo onvo        how did a pair of billionaires end up donating over  million dollars of stock at prices that were not fully reflective of the then market conditions the answer isn’t clear but the karfunkels as the sole signatories and directors of their foundations sure can’t claim ignorance in response to sirf questions the karfunkels replied that the issue was a time lag between the date of the donation and the foundation’s receipt of the shares see their full response here with regard to the grant of citigroup shares discussed above the issue was apparently more complex “the lag time between date of the grant by george karfunkel and date of receipt of the shares by chesed spanned approximately  years the reason for the long lag time was that the certificates for citicorp shares donated by george karfunkel bore a legend and could not be transferred physically at the time he made the donation” like the reply to sirf’s grat questions above the karfunkel’s answer frames an unusual scenario that is difficult to square with current market practices the concept of the physical delivery or transfer of shares between a buyer and seller — or a donor and foundation — is something that over the past  years has become increasingly rare in the us capital markets to be fair there are hobbyists who collect stock certificates and rarer still investors who insist on having their shares in physical form to prevent them from being lent out to shortsellers but beyond that share transfers in the us capital markets are entirely digital it bears recalling that the karfunkel brothers founded and ran a successful technologically advanced stock transfer operation and would as a matter of daily business understand fully what is necessary to transfer stock to another entity as such the central role repeated transfer agency mistakes play in their explanation for both the grat above and the valuation question is notable the concept of a legend posing a significant hurdle for the transfer of the shares is also difficult to wrap your arms around a legend is a restriction on the sale or transfer of stock usually because the shares were purchased during a private placement of shares a sale of stock to highernet worth investors or institutions that requires an agreed upon holding period or alternately legends are often attached to shares issued as payment in a transaction to remove a legend requires two things george karfunkel had ample access to a legal opinion stating that the conditions of the restriction had been fulfilled and a transfer agent to process the removal poking around sec filings however brought the explanation in aug  michael and george karfunkel sold a unit of american stock transfer  trust then called ast stockplan inc to citigroup for an undisclosed sum an sec filing a registration statement called an s notes that as of dec   each brother held  shares of the bank a previous registration referenced a filing the karfunkel brothers made on sept   and which was approved by the sec on oct   granting registration and transferability for the majority of their citigroup holdings additionally there is the quality of the foundation’s disclosures if as the karfunkels warrant there was a substantial difference between the date of every stock donation the brothers made to hod and chesed and the receipt of the shares then the irs filings should reflect that the date the foundation received those shares is the formal date of donation the irs rules on the issue leave little to the imagination in late july sirf attempted to contact henry reinhold the brooklyn accountant who is paid around  annually to prepare the karfunkel foundation annual filings he also prepares the filings for barry zyskind’s teferes foundation and served as an officer of american stock transfer  trust and an amtrust subsidiary samuel reinhold henry’s son declined comment on his behalf —————————– per alexander pope if mighty contests really do rise from trivial things then the karfunkels may someday wish they had given a different answer to question a on page  part viib on the hod and chesed annual filing the question “did the foundation hold more than a  percent direct or indirect interest in any business enterprise at any time during the year” was checked off in the negative but its own filings say otherwise the karfunkel brothers foundations are chock full of amtrust shares hod and chesed respectively hold  percent and  percent of the shares outstanding in case there is any doubt according to the most recent proxy agreement the karfunkel family controls  percent or  million of amtrust’s  million shares outstanding the hod foundation controls just over  million of these shares and chesed has  million keeping their economic good fortune closely wrapped in a series of family trusts and foundations was an understandable strategy by the karfunkel brothers amtrust is literally a family business — apart from barry zyskind several of michael and george’s children hold important positions in its subsidiaries — and their massive stake in the company makes it immune to takeover or raids from activist investors moreover wall street’s analysts and money managers often find attractive a company whose founders have maintained a large equity stake once they have publicly listed the stock so it is an irony of cosmic proportions that their moves to insure the effective karfunkel family control of amtrust may well lead to that iron grip being forcibly shattered the problem in a nutshell isn’t so much that the annual filings don’t reflect the truth so much as it is that the us government has some unmistakable rules in place to prevent private foundations from holding that much stock in an enterprise a quick history lesson in the s officials from the department of the treasury began to cast a skeptical eye on the use of private foundations to warehouse large corporate ownership positions company on the view that it was a distortion of both freemarket and nonprofit principles the rule that emerged to combat this is irs section  and it is primarily concerned with the idea of excess business holdings or the amount of stock a private foundation can own — here is an accessible primer on key aspects of the rule — when socalled disqualified persons the founder directors their family members and key donors have significant holdings too traditionally the irs mandates a bit of arithmetic to get to the foundations “permitted holdings” figure — the formula being  percent of the shares outstanding less the percentage of stock held by disqualified persons in this case the karfunkel family and their controlled entities own about  percent making the point moot under a provision of rule  there is a second approach known as the “de minimus rule” with each foundation permitted to hold  percent of the shares outstanding meaning that hod and chesed could hold slightly more than  million each it is difficult to interpret the irs rules as meaning anything other than a lot of amtrust stock needs to be sold or donated away — about  million shares for chesed and  million shares for hod nearly  percent of the shares outstanding there is a catch and as catches go it is a significant one the amtrust stock that hod and chesed need to sell cannot be sold to those same disqualified persons meaning that neither the brothers nor their families can bid for any shares the others foundation is forced to sell a second option is for the shares to be donated to an unaffiliated public charity like the red cross who would almost certainly begin selling the shares upon delivery that’s news no amtrust investor even with the stock price on a tear likely wants to hear for the karfunkels and seemingly amtrust investors this headache has been a long time brewing hod and chesed began to build up there massive position in amtrust stock at the end of  when an otherwise unmemorable sec filing disclosed a transfer of amtrust shares on dec   from new gulf holdings a holding company the brothers jointly owned to hod and chesed an additional transfer took place on aug   when the dust settled the foundations owned more than  percent of the then nearly  million shares outstanding and had crossed the  percent de minimus threshold the irs had laid down         hod         chesed         shares outstanding          shares hod          chesed         an outside observer aware of the karfunkels’ business successes can be forgiven for struggling to understand how basic guardrails of nonprofit law like the irs’ permitted holdings rule were blown through they certainly had enough time to comply since the irs gives foundations a fiveyear window to dispose of gifted shares so in chesed’s case after receiving  million amtrust shares from george karfunkel on jul   the foundation had until this jul  to whittle down the stake to the requisite  percent of the shares outstanding hod having received its amtrust stock from michael karfunkel on dec   has until dec  to meet the requirements being tax law of course no rule would be complete without footnotes and buried exceptions and irs rule  emphasis added is no different providing foundations an additional fiveyear window to sell down excess business holdings but even this has a proviso to be hurdled the foundations can only qualify if they demonstrate that “diligent efforts to dispose of such holdings have been made within the initial year period” this is going to be a tough sell since the past five years saw the brothers actively adding amtrust shares into their foundations to put some teeth into the rules the irs taxes those foundations not in compliance  percent on the excess holdings of shares lest that message not be received the irs levies an additional  percent tax penalty for any excess holdings not disposed of by the end of the foundation’s tax year in this case that’s jun   and the size of a prospective fine even with a back of the envelope calculation rapidly crosses into  million territory if the irs isn’t satisfied in a reply to sirfs request for comment regarding the foundation’s amtrust holdings  the karfunkel’s spokesman wrote “the karfunkels are highlysophisticated successful investors they are the founders of amtrust its largest shareholders and extremely confident about the company’s longterm potential they are confident as well in the profile of their respective foundations’ investment portfolios” —————————– sirf approached the karfunkels through their spokesman robert siegfried of kekst on jul  and because of the brothers religious observances subsequent vacation travel and related business obligations was unable to begin a formal dialogue with a representative of theirs until an aug  phone call on that call and through a series of emails sirf provided the karfunkel’s spokesman questions we sought answers to source documents central to our investigation and any necessary context surrounding the questions on aug  the karfunkels replied seeking additional clarification sirf asked followup questions the karfunkel response to those questions is here with respect to the amount of amtrust stock held in hod and chesed seemingly in the face of irs regulations sirf found the karfunkel’s response puzzling and asked their spokesmen if they stood by their statement in a follow up email aug  they did with the added remark that they did not know what “irs rules and regulations” sirf was referencing see their full reply here editors note sirf in phone calls and email–including an hour plus conversation with the karfunkels longtime attorney–repeatedly mentioned “excess business holdings” and the foundations holdings of amtrust

against several airlines in the aftermath httpnewsgooglecomnewspapersniddatidczraaaaaibajsjidbumaaaaibajpg reply ↓ great reporting roddy we need more of this reply ↓ the brothers have a terrible reputation in the community they are mean spirited nasty  dishonest and uncharitable they use religion to serve them at their convenience we don’t need jews like this reply ↓ does this have any implications for afsi reply ↓ david’s comment is pure loshon horah i know the karfunkel brothers for over  years having work for them at ast the are well like honest and very charitable reply ↓ so you’re saying his statements are true reply ↓ i just love judgemental idits that make an ampty statement about  great people that have done so much for the community in general and for individuals no you are dead wrong we are proud of the karfunkel brothers and wish them all the best from there future endeavors reply ↓ mountains of assumptions just to get publicity at some great people’s expense the world needs more people like the karfunkels may they continue to exemplify the meaning of chesed with health and happiness reply ↓ great reporting playing fast and loose with rules as a form of regulatory arbitrage seems to be their core strategy reply ↓ my dad worked for the brothers for over  years they are rolemodels to me in many ways their integrity work ethic desire to help others positivity in the face of hardship pious  giving character traits are just a few of their admirable traits may they continue your great work reply ↓ our firm had dealings with the karfunkel’s some years ago and found them to be upright and hard working business people when they owned american stock transfer it was not beneath their station to get directly involved in soliciting new business their model for success has been hard work coupled with judicious risk taking reply ↓ what the karfunkel brothers does with thier business and no one else business amtrust is penneys for them because they own around  skyscrappers all over the country and beside that they own around  shopping centers which was build from honesty  wisdom i know the brothers very well and remember thier heliga father yisroel yehida zichrono livracha which was a tremendous talmid chochom layush karfunkel used to give a shir in florida everyday for around  people for many years and the sons follows in the father footsteps you people have nothing to do with your time but to dig in to other peoples business which is wrong yes michael karfunkel and his brother built themself up from nothing they used to work with thier father in a fish store in the ’s  ’s and the respect they gave thier parents we can learn from the reason they were so sucessful is beacause they were erliche people and abishter pays back  times over they live very low key they don’t drive masarti or bentlys they want thier privacy and no one has the right to be busy with them instead of being busy with themspend your time building youselves up remember what is written in pirkei avos  jealousy destroys a person  reply ↓ have there been any updates to your research in light of mm share transfer from hod to teferes foundation an entity controlled by a disqualified person your analysis suggests that this type of maneuver would be in violation of irs rules yet there does not appear to be increased scrutiny or actions from any government entities reply ↓ great report this must have been a ton of work i am simply amazed by some of the comments here anyone who’s been around for a few years remembers cases of ohso loveable charitable guys who donated millions and at the same time stole billions from unsuspecting investors is that lesson forgotten already and i am not saying that the karfunkels are that type although i’ll sure stay way from afsi now – but the one thing everyone should have grasped by now is that giving the impression of a nice person even for decades by no means excludes the possibility there’s a fraud at the bottom of it reply ↓ for your information yisroel karfunkel was a teacher in a cheder of  children sons of holocaust refugees in the midlate s in baltimore maryland these children ages  were taught in yiddish and were mercilessly and severely beaten daily their crime not knowing an answer to a bible question not keeping their little fingers on the words not repeating by rote the bible translation into yiddish and daydreaming many of these little souls were affected for life and some later left the religious fold when they were able i was one of these children and will never forgive this monster he was finally fired left baltimore and opened a deli in boro park ny the rest is history or should i say the made up myths of his sons reply ↓ has there been an update on this obvious fraud wouldnt be surprised if the irs did nothing due to their inability to do real work such as what was put in for this fantastic article reply ↓ this guy has no idea how to use apostrophes
