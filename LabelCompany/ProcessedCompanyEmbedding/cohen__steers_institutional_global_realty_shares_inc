morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high below average this funds expenses are rated as below average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk

other equity securities issued by real estate companies it may invest up to  of its total assets in securities of foreign issuers including emerging market issuers which meet the same criteria for investment as domestic companies including investments in such companies in the form of american depositary receipts adrs global depositary receipts gdrs and european depositary receipts edrs the fund is nondiversified risk real estate is a cyclical industry that is sensitive to interest rates economic conditions both nationally and locally property tax rates and other factors changes in real estate values or economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the real estate industry stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer political regulatory market economic or other developments these risks may be magnified in foreign markets sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry in general the bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other

net assets this commitment will remain in place for the life of the fund example this example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds the example assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year and that the funds operating expenses remain the same pursuant to its agreement with the advisor although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be    year    years    years    years             portfolio turnover the fund pays transactions costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance during the most recent fiscal year the funds portfolio turnover rate was       of the average value of its portfolio principal investment strategies under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  and normally substantially all of its total assets in a portfolio of equity securities issued by us and nonus real estate companies real estate equity securities include common stocks preferred stocks and other equity securities issued by real estate companies including real estate investment trusts reits and similar reitlike entities reits are companies that own interests in real estate or in real estate related loans or other interests and revenue primarily consists of rent derived from owned income producing real estate properties and capital gains from the sale of such properties a reit in the us is generally not taxed on income distributed to shareholders so long as it meets certain tax related requirements including the requirement that it distribute substantially all of its taxable income to such shareholders reitlike entities are organized outside of the us and have operations and receive tax treatment similar to that of us reits the fund retains the ability to invest in real estate companies of any market capitalization under normal market conditions the fund invests significantly at least unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by the advisor in which case the fund invests at least  in real estate companies organized or located outside the us or doing a substantial amount of business outside the us the fund allocates its assets among various regions and countries including the united states but in no less than three different countries    principal risks      investment risk  an investment in the fund is subject to investment risk including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest      stock market risk  your investment in fund shares represents an indirect investment in the reit shares and other real estate securities owned by the fund the value of these equity securities like other stock market investments may move up or down sometimes rapidly and unpredictably your fund shares at any point in time may be worth less than what you invested even after taking into account the reinvestment of fund dividends and distributions      real estate market risk  since the fund concentrates its assets in the real estate industry your investment in the fund will be closely linked to the performance of the real estate markets property values may fall due to increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from unanticipated economic legal cultural or technological developments real estate company prices also may drop because of the failure of borrowers to pay their loans and poor management      reit risk  reits are dependent upon management skills and generally may not be diversified reits are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers and selfliquidation in addition reits could possibly fail to qualify for passthrough of income under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code other factors may also adversely affect a borrowers or a lessees ability to meet its obligations to the reit in the event of a default by a borrower or lessee the reit may experience delays in enforcing its rights as a mortgagee or lessor and may incur substantial costs associated with protecting its investments      foreign nonus securities risk  risks of investing in foreign securities include currency risks future political and economic developments and possible imposition of foreign withholding taxes on income payable on the securities in addition there may be less publicly available information about a foreign issuer than about a domestic issuer and foreign issuers may not be subject to the same accounting auditing and financial recordkeeping standards and requirements as domestic issuers      foreign currency risk  the funds net asset value nav could decline as a result of changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar certain foreign countries may impose restrictions on the ability of issuers of foreign securities to make payment of principal and interest to investors located outside the country due to blockage of foreign currency exchanges or otherwise      emerging markets risk  securities of companies in emerging markets may be more volatile than those of companies in more developed markets emerging market countries generally have less developed markets and economies and in some countries less mature governments and governmental institutions investing in securities of companies in emerging markets may entail special risks relating to potential economic political or social instability and the risks of expropriation nationalization confiscation or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investment the lack of hedging instruments and on repatriation of capital invested a small number of companies representing a limited number of industries may account for a significant percentage of an emerging market countrys overall market and trading volume emerging market economies may be overdependent on exports especially with respect to primary commodities making these economies vulnerable to changes in commodity prices emerging market countries may have overburdened infrastructure and obsolete or unseasoned financial systems environmental problems less developed legal systems and less reliable custodial services and settlement practices      smaller companies risk  even the larger real estate companies in the industry tend to be small to mediumsized companies in relation to the equity markets as a whole there may be less trading in a smaller companys stock which means that buy and sell transactions in that stock could have a larger impact on the stocks price than is the case with larger company stocks smaller companies also may have fewer lines of business so that changes in any one line of business may have a greater impact on a smaller companys stock price than is the case for a larger company further smaller company stocks may perform in different cycles than larger company stocks accordingly real estate company shares can be more volatile thanand at times will perform differently fromlarge company stocks such as those found in the dow jones industrial average      interest rate risk  interest rate risk is the risk that preferred securities and to a lesser extent dividendpaying common stocks will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates when market interest rates rise the market value of such securities generally will fall      nondiversification  as a nondiversified investment company the fund can invest in fewer individual companies than a diversified investment company because a nondiversified portfolio is more likely

industry     principal investment strategies in managing the funds portfolio the advisor and cohen  steers asia limited cns asia cohen  steers uk limited cns uk and cohen  steers europe sa cns europe the funds subinvestment advisors the subadvisors adhere to an integrated bottomup relative value investment process a proprietary valuation model ranks global real estate securities on pricetonav which the advisor and subadvisors believe is the primary determinant of real estate security valuation and guides a bottomup portfolio construction process analysts incorporate both quantitative and qualitative analysis in their nav estimates the company research process includes an evaluation of management strategy property quality financial strength and corporate structure in addition to the nav model portfolio managers may use secondary valuation tools including cash flow multiplegrowth or discounted cash flow models judgments with respect to risk control diversification liquidity and other factors overlay the models output and drive the portfolio managers investment decisions the following are the funds principal investment strategies a more detailed description of the funds investment policies and restrictions and more detailed information about the funds investments are contained in the funds statement of additional information sai real estate companies for purposes of the funds investment policies a real estate company is one that      derives at least  of its revenues from the ownership construction financing management or sale of commercial industrial or residential real estate or      has at least  of its assets in such real estate        under normal market conditions the fund will invest significantly at least unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by the advisor in which case the fund would invest at least  in real estate companies including reit and reitlike entities organized or located outside the us or doing a substantial amount of business outside the us the fund will allocate its assets among various regions and countries including the united states but in no less than three different countries the fund considers a company that derives at least  of its revenue from business outside the us or has at least  of its assets outside the us as doing a substantial amount of business outside the us for temporary defensive purposes the fund may invest as described below under additional investment informationdefensive position the fund is not limited in the extent to which it may invest in real estate equity securities of companies domiciled in emerging market countries the equity securities in which the fund invests can consist of      common stocks      rights or warrants to purchase common stocks      securities convertible into common stocks where the conversion feature represents in the view of the advisor or a subadvisor a significant element of the securities value and      preferred stocks real estate investment trusts reits reits are companies that own interests in real estate or in real estate related loans or other interests and revenue primarily consists of rent derived from owned income producing real estate properties and capital gains from the sale of such properties a reit is generally not taxed on income distributed to shareholders so long as it meets certain tax related requirements including the requirement that it distribute substantially all of its taxable income to such shareholders other than net capital gain for each taxable year as a result reits tend to pay relatively higher dividends than other types of companies reits can generally be classified as equity reits mortgage reits and hybrid reits equity reits which invest the majority of their assets directly in real property derive their income primarily from rents equity reits can also realize capital gains by selling properties that have appreciated in value mortgage reits which invest the majority of their assets in real estate mortgages derive their income primarily from interest payments hybrid reits combine the characteristics of both equity reits and mortgage reits the fund invests primarily in equity reits foreign nonus real estate securities the fund invests in nonus real estate companies these companies may have characteristics that are similar to a reit a reit is a type of us real estate company that is dedicated to owning and usually operating income producing real estate or to financing real estate reits are not subject to us corporate income tax provided they comply with a number of tax requirements including the annual distribution to shareholders of at least  of their net income a number of countries around the world have adopted or are considering adopting similar reitlike structures pursuant to which these companies are not subject to corporate income tax in their home countries provided they distribute a significant percentage of their net income each year to shareholders and meet certain other requirements the fund may invest a significant percentage of its portfolio in foreigndomiciled reitlike entities however the fund may also invest a significant percentage of its portfolio in other real estate companies        depositary receipts the fund may also invest in securities of foreign companies in the form of american depositary receipts adrs global depositary receipts gdrs and european depositary receipts edrs generally adrs in registered form are dollar denominated securities designed for use in the us securities markets which represent and may be converted into an underlying foreign security gdrs in bearer form are designated for use outside the united states edrs in bearer form are designed for use in the european securities markets     additional investment information in addition to the principal investment strategies described above the fund has other investment practices that are described here and in the sai illiquid securities the fund will not invest more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities a security is illiquid if for legal or market reasons it cannot be promptly sold  ie within seven days at a price which approximates its fair value other investments the fund may engage in foreign currency transactions including foreign currency forward contracts options swaps and other similar strategic transactions in connection with its investments in securities of nonus companies defensive position when the advisor believes that market or general economic conditions justify a temporary defensive position the fund may deviate from its investment objective and invest all or any portion of its assets in shortterm debt instruments government securities cash or cash equivalents when and to the extent the fund assumes a temporary defensive position it may not pursue or achieve its investment objective portfolio holdings a description of the funds policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of the funds portfolio securities is available in the funds sai the fund also files its complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the securities and exchange commission sec on form nq as of the end of its first and third fiscal quarters the funds full portfolio holdings are published semiannually in reports sent to shareholders and filed with the sec on form ncsr and such reports are made available at cohenandsteerscom in the our funds section generally within  days after the end of        each semiannual period the fund also posts an uncertified list of portfolio holdings on the web site no earlier than  days after the end of each calendar quarter the holdings information remains available until the fund files a report on form nq or form ncsr for the period that includes the date as of which the information is current in addition to information on portfolio holdings other fund statistical information may be found on the cohen  steers funds web site or by calling      principal risks of investing in the fund in addition to the risks previously discussed in the summary section the following are also risks of investing in the fund because prices of equity securities fluctuate from day to day the value of the funds portfolio and the price per share will vary based upon general market conditions and the value of the securities held in the funds portfolio general risks of securities linked to the real estate market the fund will not invest in real estate directly but only in securities issued by real estate companies however because of its policy of concentration in the securities of companies in the real estate industry the fund is also subject to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate these risks include      declines in the value of real estate      risks related to general and local economic conditions      possible lack of availability of mortgage funds      overbuilding      extended vacancies of properties      increased competition      increases in property taxes and operating expenses      changes in zoning laws      losses due to costs resulting from the cleanup of environmental problems      liability to third parties for damages resulting from environmental problems      casualty or condemnation losses      limitations on rents      changes in neighborhood values and the appeal of properties to tenants and      changes in interest rates thus the value of the funds shares may change at different rates compared to the value of shares of a mutual fund with investments in a mix of different industries risks of investing in reits in addition to risks of securities linked to the real estate industry equity reits may be affected by changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trusts while mortgage reits may be affected by the quality of any credit extended further reits are dependent upon management skills and generally may not be diversified reits are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers and selfliquidation in addition reits could possibly fail to qualify for passthrough of income under the code or to        maintain their exemptions from registration under the investment company act of  as amended  act the above factors may also adversely affect a borrowers or a lessees ability to meet its obligations to the reit in the event of a default by a borrower or lessee the reit may experience delays in enforcing its rights as a mortgagee or lessor and may incur substantial costs associated with protecting its investments general risks of foreign nonus securities the fund may without limit in foreign nonus securities under normal market conditions the fund intends to invest at least  of its total assets in nonus real estate equity securities investing in these foreign securities involves certain risks not involved in domestic investments including but not limited to      future foreign economic financial political and social developments      different legal systems      the possible imposition of exchange controls or other foreign governmental laws or restrictions      less governmental supervision      regulation changes      changes in currency exchange rates      less publicly available information about companies due to less rigorous disclosure or accounting standards or regulatory practices      high and volatile rates of inflation      fluctuating interest rates      different accounting auditing and financial recordkeeping standards and requirements and      dividend income the fund receives from these foreign securities may not be eligible for the special tax treatment applicable to qualified income investments in foreign securities especially in emerging market countries will expose the fund to the direct or indirect consequences of political social or economic changes in the countries that issue the securities or in which the issuers are located certain countries in which the fund may invest especially emerging market countries have historically experienced and may continue to experience high rates of inflation high interest rates exchange rate fluctuations large amounts of external debt balance of payments and trade difficulties and extreme poverty and unemployment many of these countries are also characterized by political uncertainty and instability the cost of servicing external debt will generally be adversely affected by rising international interest rates because many external debt obligations bear interest at rates that are adjusted based upon international interest rates in addition with respect to certain foreign countries there is a risk of      the possibility of expropriation of assets      confiscatory taxation      difficulty in obtaining or enforcing a court judgment      economic political or social instability and      diplomatic developments that could affect investments in those countries        in addition individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as      growth of gross domestic product      rates of inflation      capital reinvestment      resources      selfsufficiency and      balance of payments position to the extent the funds investments are concentrated in a geographic region or country the fund will be subject to a greater extent than if the funds assets were less concentrated to the risks of adverse changes in that region or country emerging markets risk the fund is not limited in the extent to which it may invest in securities of companies domiciled in socalled emerging markets or lesser developed countries and investments in such securities are particularly speculative emerging securities markets are substantially smaller less developed less liquid and more volatile than the major securities markets the limited size of emerging securities markets and limited trading value compared to the volume of trading in us securities could cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the quality of the securities for example limited market size may cause prices to be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions adverse publicity and investors perceptions whether or not based on fundamental analysis may decrease the value and liquidity of portfolio securities especially in these markets many emerging market countries have experienced substantial and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation for many years inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates and corresponding currency devaluations have had and may continue to have negative effects on the economies and securities markets of certain emerging market countries as a result of these potential risks the advisor or a subadvisor may determine that notwithstanding otherwise favorable investment criteria it may not be practicable or appropriate to invest in a particular country the fund may invest in countries in which foreign investors including the advisor or a subadvisor have had no or limited prior experience foreign currency risk and currency hedging risk although the fund will report its nav and pay dividends in us dollars foreign securities often are purchased with and make interest payments in foreign currencies therefore when the fund invests in foreign securities it will be subject to foreign currency risk which means that the funds nav could decline as a result of changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar certain foreign countries may impose restrictions on the ability of issuers of foreign securities to make payment of principal and interest to investors located outside the country due to blockage of foreign currency exchanges or otherwise        the fund may engage in various investments that are designed to hedge the funds foreign currency risks while these transactions will be entered into to seek to manage these risks these investments may not prove to be successful or may have the effect of limiting the gains from favorable market movements

exactly as registered on the account signature guarantees if necessary any supporting legal documentation that may be required and any outstanding certificates representing shares to be redeemed we calculate our nav per share as of the close of regular trading on the nyse generally  pm eastern time on each day the nyse is open for trading thus purchase and redemption orders must be received in proper form by the close of regular trading on the nyse in order to receive that days nav orders received after the close of regular trading on the nyse will receive the nav next determined the fund has authorized one or more brokers to accept on its behalf purchase and redemption orders and these brokers are authorized to designate other intermediaries on the funds behalf the fund will be deemed to have received a purchase or redemption order when an authorized broker or that brokers designee accepts the order and that order will be priced at the next computed nav after this acceptance we determine nav per share by adding the market value of all securities and other assets in the funds portfolio subtracting the funds liabilities and dividing by the total number of outstanding shares of the fund investments in securities that are listed on the nyse are valued except as indicated below at the last sale price reflected at the close of the nyse on the business day as of which such value is being determined if there has been no sale on such day the securities are valued at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices for the day or if no asked price is available at the bid price securities not listed on the nyse but listed on other domestic or foreign securities exchanges are valued in a similar manner securities traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of which such value is being determined as reflected on the tape at the close of the exchange representing the principal market for such securities if after the close of a foreign market but prior to the close of business on the day the securities are being valued market conditions change significantly certain foreign securities may be fair valued pursuant to procedures established by the board of directors readily marketable securities traded in the overthecounter market including listed securities whose primary market is believed by the advisor to be overthecounter are valued at the official closing prices as reported by sources as the board of directors deem appropriate to reflect their fair market value if there has been no sale on such day the securities are valued at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices for the day or if no asked price is available at the bid price however certain fixedincome securities may be valued on the basis of prices provided by a pricing service when such prices are believed by the board of directors to reflect the fair market value of such securities        securities for which market prices are unavailable or securities for which the advisor determines that bid andor asked price does not reflect market value will be valued at fair value pursuant to procedures approved by the funds board of directors circumstances in which market prices may be unavailable include but are not limited to when trading in a security is suspended the exchange on which the security is traded is subject to an unscheduled close or disruption or material events occur after the close of the exchange on which the security is principally traded in these circumstances the fund determines fair value in a manner that fairly reflects the market value of the security on the valuation date based on consideration of any information or factors it deems appropriate these may include recent transactions in comparable securities information relating to the specific security and developments in the markets the funds use of fair value pricing may cause the nav of fund shares to differ from the nav that would be calculated using market quotations fair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security may be materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of that security shortterm debt securities which have a maturity date of  days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates value because

liquidate your account     frequent purchases and redemptions of fund shares the fund is designed for longterm investors with investment horizons of at least two months excessive trading shortterm market timing or other abusive trading practices may disrupt portfolio management strategies and harm portfolio performance for example in order to handle large flows of        cash into and out of a fund a portfolio manager may need to allocate more assets to cash or other shortterm investments or sell securities transaction costs such as brokerage commissions and market spreads can detract from the funds performance additionally market timing is a concern for the fund because the funds portfolio will have foreign securities and therefore could be subject to timezone arbitrage because of potential harm to the fund and its longterm investors the board of directors of the fund has adopted policies and procedures to discourage and prevent excessive trading and shortterm market timing as part of these policies and procedures the advisor monitors purchase exchange and redemption activity in fund shares the intent is not to inhibit legitimate strategies such as asset allocation dollar cost averaging or similar activities that may nonetheless result in frequent trading of the funds shares therefore there are no specific restrictions on the volume or number of purchases exchanges or redemptions of fund shares a shareholder may make although the fund reserves the right to reject or refuse any purchase request including those that are part of exchange activity that could adversely affect the fund or its operations if based on these procedures the advisor believes that a shareholder is engaged in or has engaged in market timing or excessive trading we may place a temporary or permanent block on all further purchases or exchanges of fund shares the following transactions are excluded when determining whether trading activity is excessive i transfers associated with systematic purchases or redemptions ii transactions through firmsponsored discretionary asset allocation or wrap programs and iii transactions subject to the trading policy of an intermediary that the fund deems materially similar to the funds policy multiple accounts under common ownership or control may be considered one account for the purpose of determining a pattern of excessive trading shortterm market timing or other abusive trading practices the fund will also utilize fair value pricing in an effort to reduce arbitrage opportunities available to shortterm traders due to the complexity and subjectivity involved in identifying excessive trading and market timing activity there can be no guarantee that the fund will be able to identify and restrict such activity in all cases additionally it is more difficult for the fund to monitor the trading activity of beneficial owners of the fund shares who hold those shares through thirdparty k and other group retirement plans and other omnibus arrangements maintained by brokerdealers and other intermediaries omnibus account arrangements permit multiple investors to aggregate their respective share ownership positions and purchase redeem and exchange fund shares in a single account in certain circumstances the fund may accept frequent trading restrictions of intermediaries that differ from the funds policies since such intermediaries execute or administer transactions with many fund families it may be impractical for them to enforce a particular funds frequent trading or exchange policy these alternate trading restrictions would be authorized only if the fund believes that the alternate restrictions would provide reasonable protection to the fund and its shareholders     additional information     networking and subtransfer agency fees the fund may also enter into agreements with financial intermediaries pursuant to which the fund will pay financial intermediaries for services such as networking or subtransfer agency payments made pursuant to such agreements are generally based on either  a percentage of the average daily net assets of fund shareholders serviced by such financial intermediaries or  the number of fund shareholders serviced by such financial intermediaries from time to time the advisor may pay a portion of the fees for networking or subtransfer agency services at its own expense and out of its own profits     other compensation the advisor and the distributor may make payments from their own resources to dealers and other financial intermediaries for distribution administrative or other services for further information please consult the sai            dividends and distributions the fund intends to declare and pay dividends from its investment

offers only a brief outline of the federal income tax consequences of investing in the fund and is based on the federal tax laws in effect on the date hereof such tax laws are subject to change by legislative judicial or administrative action possibly with retroactive effect in the sai we have provided more detailed information regarding the tax consequences of investing in the fund dividends paid to you out of the funds investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the code determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid will be taxable to you as ordinary

received deduction drd in addition for taxable years beginning on or before december   distributions of investment company taxable income designated by the fund as derived from qualified dividend income qdi will be taxed in the hands of individuals at the rates applicable to longterm capital gain provided holding period and other requirements are met by both you and the fund dividend income that the fund receives from reits will generally not be treated as qdi there can be no assurance that favorable tax treatment of qdi will continue following december   a foreign corporation is a qualified foreign corporation if it is  incorporated in a possession of the united states or is eligible for benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the united states that the united states treasury department determines is satisfactory for this purpose and that includes an exchange of information program or  any other foreign corporation with respect to any dividend paid by such corporation if the stock with respect to which such dividend is paid is readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states a qualified foreign corporation does not include any foreign corporation which for the taxable year of the corporation in which the dividend was paid or the preceding taxable year is a passive foreign investment company because of the factspecific nature of the inquiry the fund cannot predict at this time what portion if any of the dividends it will receive from foreign corporations will be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation applicable to qdi distributions of net capital gain the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss if any designated as capital gain dividends are taxable to you as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have held your fund shares a distribution of an amount in        excess of the funds current and accumulated earnings and profits is treated as a nontaxable return of capital that reduces your tax basis in your fund shares any such distributions in excess of your tax basis are treated as gain from a sale of your shares the tax treatment of your dividends and distributions will be the same regardless of whether they were paid to you in cash or reinvested in additional fund shares if you buy shares of the fund when the fund has realized but not yet distributed income or capital gains you will be buying a dividend by paying the full price for the shares and then receiving a portion back in the form of a taxable distribution a distribution will be treated as paid to you on december  of the current calendar year if it is declared by the fund in october november or december with a record date in such a month and paid during january of the following year each year we will notify you of the tax status of dividends and other distributions if you sell or redeem your fund shares or exchange them for shares of another cohen  steers openend

the fund distributes less than an amount equal to the sum of  of its ordinary income for the calendar year and  of its capital gain net income for the oneyear period ending on october  unless the fund elects to use a calendar year plus any ordinary income and capital gain net income from previous years that was not distributed then the fund will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax on the undistributed amounts the fund intends to make sufficient distributions of its income to satisfy the distribution requirement and prevent application of the excise tax if in any taxable year the fund

investment objective strategies and investment policies are not fundamental and may be changed by the board of directors of a fund without the approval of the shareholders however a fund will not change its investment objective or policies without written notice to shareholders in addition shareholders will be provided with at least  days prior written notice of any change to a funds  investment policy as described in that funds prospectus eg realty income funds policy of investing at least  of its total assets in incomeproducing common stocks and other equity securities issued by real estate companies such as real estate investment trusts  real estate investment trusts each fund may invest in real estate investment trusts reits reits are sometimes informally characterized as equity reits mortgage reits and hybrid reits an equity reit invests primarily in the fee ownership or leasehold ownership of land and buildings and derives its income primarily from rental income an equity reit may also realize capital gains or losses by selling real estate properties in its portfolio that have appreciated or depreciated in value a mortgage reit invests primarily in mortgages on real estate which may secure construction development or longterm loans a mortgage reit generally derives its income primarily from interest payments on the credit it has extended a hybrid reit combines the characteristics of equity reits and mortgage reits generally by holding both ownership interests and mortgage interests in real estate it is anticipated although not required that under normal circumstances a majority of a funds investments in reits will consist of securities issued by equity reits    cash reserves the cash reserves for each of global infrastructure fund global realty shares international realty fund and realty income fund in each case held to provide sufficient flexibility to take advantage of new opportunities for investments and for other cash needs will be invested in money market instruments and generally will not exceed  of total assets if cohen  steers capital management inc the advisor has difficulty finding an adequate number of undervalued equity securities all or any portion of a funds assets may also be invested temporarily in money market instruments cash reserves in excess of  of total assets will be maintained for defensive purposes only money market instruments in which a fund may invest its cash reserves will generally consist of obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities and such obligations which are subject to repurchase agreements a repurchase agreement is an instrument under which an investor such as the fund purchases a us government security from a counterparty with an agreement by the counterparty to repurchase the security at the same price plus interest at a specified rate in such a case the security is held by the fund in effect as collateral for the repurchase obligation repurchase agreements may be entered into with member banks of the federal reserve system or primary dealers as designated by the federal reserve bank of new york in us government securities other acceptable money market instruments include commercial paper rated by any nationally recognized rating agency such as moodys investors service inc moodys or standard  poors ratings services sp certificates of deposit bankers acceptances issued by domestic banks having total assets in excess of one billion dollars and money market mutual funds in entering into any repurchase agreement for the fund cohen  steers capital management inc the funds investment advisor the advisor will evaluate and monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparty in the event that a counterparty should default on its repurchase obligation the fund might suffer a loss to the extent that the proceeds from the sale of the collateral were less than the repurchase price if the counterparty becomes bankrupt the fund might be delayed or may incur costs or possible losses of principal or income in selling the collateral securities lending each fund may lend portfolio securities to brokerdealers or other institutions the borrower must maintain with a fund cash or equivalent collateral equal to at least  of the market value of the securities loaned during the time portfolio securities are on loan the borrower pays the lending fund any dividends or interest paid on the securities a fund may invest the collateral and earn additional income or receive an agreed upon amount of interest income from the borrower loans are subject to termination at the option of a fund or the borrower a fund may pay reasonable administrative and custodial fees in connection with a loan a fund does not have the right to vote securities on loan but would terminate the loan and regain the right to vote if that were considered important with respect to the investment a fund may lose money if a borrower defaults on its obligation to return securities and the value of the collateral held by that fund is insufficient to replace the loaned securities in addition a fund is responsible for any loss that might result from its investment of the borrowers collateral illiquid securities a fund will not invest in illiquid securities if immediately after such investment more than  of that funds net assets taken at market value would be invested in such securities for this purpose illiquid securities include among others securities that are illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily available market or legal or contractual restrictions on resale securities that have legal or contractual restrictions on resale but have a readily available market are not deemed illiquid for purposes of this limitation historically illiquid securities have included securities subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale because they have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended the securities act and securities which are otherwise not readily marketable securities which have not been registered under the securities act are referred to as private placements or restricted securities and are purchased directly from the issuer or in the secondary market the funds do not typically hold a significant amount of these restricted or other illiquid securities because of the potential for delays on resale and uncertainty in valuation limitations on resale may have an adverse effect on the marketability of portfolio securities and a fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid securities promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within seven days a fund might also have to register such restricted securities in order to dispose of them resulting in additional expense and delay adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of securities in recent years however a large institutional market has developed for certain securities that are not registered under the securities act including repurchase agreements commercial paper foreign securities municipal securities and corporate bonds and notes institutional investors depend on an efficient institutional market in which the unregistered security can be readily resold or on an issuers ability to honor a demand for repayment the fact that there are contractual or legal restrictions on resale to the general public or to certain institutions may not be indicative of the liquidity of such investments rule a under the securities act allows a broader institutional trading market for securities otherwise subject to restriction on resale to the general public rule a establishes a safe harbor from the registration requirements of the securities act of resales of certain securities to qualified institutional buyers which generally creates a more liquid market for securities eligible for resale under rule a than other types of restricted securities the advisor will monitor the liquidity of restricted securities in a funds portfolio under the supervision of the board of directors in reaching liquidity decisions the advisor will consider among other things the following factors  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security     the number of dealers wishing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security and  the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades eg the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of the transfer convertible securities global infrastructure fund may invest in convertible securities convertible securities are preferred stocks or debt obligations that are convertible into common stock they generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than nonconvertible securities of similar quality convertible securities have both equity and fixedincome risk characteristics like all fixedincome securities the value of convertible securities is susceptible to the risk of market losses attributable to changes in interest rates generally the market value of convertible securities tends to decline as interest rates increase and conversely to increase as interest rates decline however when the market price of the common stock underlying a convertible security approaches or exceeds the conversion price of the convertible security the convertible security tends to reflect the market price of the underlying common stock as the market price of the underlying common stock declines the convertible security like a fixedincome security tends to trade increasingly on a yield basis and thus may not decline in price to the same extent as the underlying common stock the markets for convertible securities may be less liquid than markets for common stocks or bonds debt securities global infrastructure fund may invest in debt securities such as bonds debentures government obligations commercial paper and passthrough instruments the value of debt securities may fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and the issuers financial condition when interest rates rise or the issuers financial condition worsens or is perceived by the market to be at greater risk the value of debt securities tends to decline master limited partnerships global infrastructure fund may invest in equity securities of master limited partnerships mlps and their affiliates an mlp generally has two classes of partners the general partner and the limited partners the general partner normally controls the mlp through an equity interest plus units that are subordinated to the common publicly traded units for an initial period and then only converting to common if certain financial tests are met as a motivation for the general partner to successfully manage the mlp and increase cash flows the terms of most mlps typically provide that the general partner receives a larger portion of the net income as distributions reach higher target levels as cash flow grows the general partner receives a greater interest in the incremental income compared to the interest of limited partners the general partners incentive compensation typically increases to up to  of incremental income nevertheless the aggregate amount distributed to limited partners will increase as mlp distributions reach higher target levels given this incentive structure the general partner has an incentive to streamline operations and undertake acquisitions and growth projects in order to increase distributions to all partners mlp common units represent an equity ownership interest in a partnership providing limited voting rights and entitling the holder to a share of the companys success through distributions andor capital appreciation unlike shareholders of a corporation common unit holders do not elect directors annually and generally have the right to vote only on certain significant events such as mergers a sale of substantially all of the assets removal of the general partner or material amendments to the partnership agreement mlps are required by their partnership agreements to distribute a large percentage of their current operating earnings common unit holders generally have first right to a minimum quarterly distribution prior to distributions to the convertible subordinated unit holders or the general partner including incentive distributions common unit holders typically have arrearage rights if the minimum quarterly distribution is not met in the event of liquidation mlp common unit holders have first right to the partnerships remaining assets after bondholders other debt holders and preferred unit holders have been paid in full mlp common units trade on a national securities exchange or overthecounter some limited liability companies llcs may be treated as mlps for federal income tax purposes similar to mlps llcs typically do not pay federal income tax at the entity level and are required by their operating agreements to distribute a large percentage of their current operating earnings in contrast to mlps llcs have no general partner and there are no incentives that entitle management or other unit holders to increased percentages of cash distributions as distributions reach higher target levels in addition llc common unit holders typically have voting rights with respect to the llc whereas mlp common units have limited voting rights mlp common units and other equity securities can be affected by macro economic and other factors affecting the stock market in general expectations of interest rates investor sentiment towards mlps or a mlps business sector changes in a particular issuers financial condition or unfavorable or unanticipated poor performance of a particular issuer in the case of mlps generally measured in terms of distributable cash flow prices of common units of individual mlps and other equity securities can also be affected by fundamentals unique to the partnership or company including earnings power and coverage ratios mlp convertible subordinated units are typically issued by mlps to founders corporate general partners of mlps entities that sell assets to the mlp and institutional investors and may be purchased in direct placements from such persons the purpose of the convertible subordinated units is to increase the likelihood that during the subordination period there will be available cash to be distributed to common unit holders convertible subordinated units generally are not entitled to distributions until holders of common units have received specified minimum quarterly distributions plus any arrearages and may receive less in distributions upon liquidation convertible subordinated unit holders generally are entitled to a minimum quarterly distribution prior to the payment of incentive distributions to the general partner but are not entitled to arrearage rights therefore they generally entail greater risk than mlp common units they are generally convertible automatically into the senior common units of the same issuer at a onetoone ratio upon the passage of time or the satisfaction of certain financial tests these units do not trade on a national exchange or overthecounter and there is no active market for convertible subordinated units the value of a convertible security is a function of its worth if converted into the underlying common units convertible subordinated units generally have similar voting rights to mlp common units because convertible subordinated units generally convert to common units on a onetoone ratio the price that the fund could be expected to pay upon purchase or to realize upon resale is generally tied to the common unit price less a discount the size of the discount varies depending on a variety of factors including the likelihood of conversion and the length of time remaining to conversion and the size of the block purchased    mlp ishares represent an indirect investment in mlp iunits iunits are equity securities issued to affiliates of mlps typically a limited liability company that own an interest in and manage the mlp the issuer has management rights but is not entitled to incentive distributions the ishare issuers assets consist exclusively of mlp iunits distributions by mlps to iunit holders are made in the form of additional iunits generally equal in amount to the cash received by common unit holders of mlps distributions to ishare holders are made in the form of additional ishares generally equal in amount to the iunits received by the ishare issuer the issuer of the ishare is taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes however the mlp does not allocate income or loss to the ishare issuer accordingly investors receive a form  are not allocated their proportionate share of income of the mlps and are not subject to state income tax filing obligations the price of ishares and their volatility tend to be correlated to the price of common units although the price correlation is not precise canadian royalty trusts global infrastructure fund may invest in canadian royalty trusts a canadian royalty trust is a trust whose securities are listed on a canadian stock exchange and which controls an underlying company whose business is the acquisition exploitation production and sale of oil and natural gas these trusts generally pay out to unitholders the majority of the cash flow that they receive from the production and sale of underlying oil and natural gas reserves the amount of distributions paid on a canadian royalty trusts units will vary from time to time based on production levels commodity prices royalty rates and certain expenses deductions and costs as well as on the distribution payout ratio policy adopted as a result of distributing the bulk of their cash flow to unitholders the ability of a canadian royalty trust to finance internal growth through exploration is limited therefore canadian royalty trusts typically grow through acquisition of additional oil and gas properties or producing companies with proven reserves of oil and gas funded through the issuance of additional equity or where the trust is able additional debt foreign nonus securities realty shares institutional realty shares and realty income fund may each invest up to  of their total assets in securities of foreign issuers which meet the same criteria for investment as domestic companies or sponsored and unsponsored depositary receipts for such securities global infrastructure fund global realty shares institutional global realty shares and international realty fund may invest without limit in equity securities of foreign nonus real estate companies or sponsored and unsponsored depositary receipts for such securities a fund may be subject to additional investment risks for foreign securities that are different in some respects than those incurred by investments in securities of domestic issuers such risks include currency risks future political and economic developments the possible imposition of foreign withholding taxes on income payable on the securities the possible establishment of exchange controls the possible seizure or nationalization of foreign deposits or the adoption of other foreign governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payments on such securities there can be no assurance that such laws will not become applicable to certain of a funds investments in addition there may be less publicly available information about a foreign issuer than about a domestic issuer brokerage commissions custodial services and other costs relating to investment in foreign securities markets generally are more expensive than in the us foreign securities markets may have substantially less volume than us securities markets making many foreign issuers less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers and foreign issuers may not be subject to the same accounting auditing and financial recordkeeping standards and requirements as domestic issuers dividend income a fund receives from foreign securities may not be eligible for the special tax treatment reserved for qualified dividend income see taxation each fund may invest in sponsored and unsponsored american depositary receipts adrs global depositary receipts gdrs and similar depositary receipts adrs typically issued by a financial institution a depositary evidence ownership interests in a security or a pool of securities issued by a foreign company and deposited with the depositary prices of adrs are quoted in us dollars and adrs are traded in the united states gdrs are receipts issued outside the united states typically by nonunited states banks and trust companies that evidence ownership of either foreign or domestic securities generally gdrs in bearer form are designated for use outside the united states ownership of adrs and gdrs entails similar investment risks to direct ownership of foreign securities traded outside the us including increased market liquidity currency political information and other risks preferred stock warrants and rights each fund may invest in preferred stock warrants and rights preferred stocks are securities that represent an ownership interest providing the holder with claims on the issuers earnings and assets before common shareholders but after bond holders and other creditors unlike debt securities the obligations of an issuer of preferred stock including dividend and other payment obligations may not typically be accelerated by the holders of such preferred stock on the occurrence of an event of default or other noncompliance by the issuer of the preferred stock investments in preferred stock present market and liquidity risks the value of a preferred stock may be highly sensitive to the economic condition of the issuer and markets for preferred stock may be less liquid than the market for the issuers common stock warrants are options to buy a stated number of shares of common stock at a specified price at any time during the life of the warrant rights represent a privilege offered to holders of record of issued securities to subscribe usually on a pro rata basis for additional securities of the same class of a different class or of a different issuer the holders of warrants and rights have no voting rights receive no dividends and have no rights with respect to the assets of the issuer the value of a warrant or right may not necessarily change with the value of the underlying securities warrants and rights cease to have value if they are not exercised prior to their expiration date investments in warrants and rights are thus speculative and may result in a total loss of any money invested in their acquisition    preferred securities in addition to preferred stock global infrastructure fund may also invest in hybrid preferred securities issued by utility companies and other types of companies hybridpreferred securities are usually issued by a trust or limited partnership and often represent preferred interests in subordinated debt instruments issued by a corporation for whose benefit the trust or partnership was established preferred securities pay fixed or floating dividends to investors and have preference over common stock in the payment of dividends and the liquidation of a companys assets this means that a company must pay dividends on preferred stock before paying dividends on its common stock preferred shareholders usually have no right to vote for corporate directors or on other matters the hybrid preferred securities in which global infrastructure fund intends to invest do not qualify for the dividends received deduction drd under section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and are not expected to provide significant benefits under the rules relating to qualified dividend income the drd generally allows corporations to deduct from their income  of dividends received pursuant to recently enacted legislation individuals will generally be taxed at longterm capital gain rates on qualified dividend income distributions received from the fund attributable to traditional preferred securities would qualify for the drd as to any corporate shareholder and would qualify to be taxed at longterm capital gains rates as to any individual shareholder however any corporate shareholder who otherwise would qualify for the drd and any individual shareholder who otherwise would qualify to be taxed at longterm capital gain rates on qualified dividend income should assume that none of the distributions the shareholder receives from the fund attributable to hybridpreferred securities will qualify for the drd or provide significant benefits under the rules relating to qualified dividend income distributions received from the fund attributable to traditional preferred securities such as the preferred securities of utility companies generally would qualify to be taxed at longterm capital gains rates as to any individual shareholder repurchase agreements institutional global realty shares institutional realty shares and realty shares may enter into repurchase agreements a repurchase agreement is an instrument under which an investor such as a fund purchases a us government security from a vendor with an agreement by the vendor to repurchase the security at the same price plus interest at a specified rate in such a case the security is held by that fund in effect as collateral for the repurchase obligation repurchase agreements may be entered into with member banks of the federal reserve system or primary dealers as designated by the federal reserve bank of new york in us government securities repurchase agreements usually have a short duration often less than one week in entering into the repurchase agreement for a fund the advisor will evaluate and monitor the creditworthiness of the vendor in the event that a vendor should default on its repurchase obligation a fund might suffer a loss to the extent that the proceeds from the sale of the collateral were less than the repurchase price if the vendor becomes bankrupt a fund might be delayed or may incur costs or possible losses of principal and income in selling the collateral borrowing for investment purposes global realty shares may borrow up to  of the value of its total assets to increase its holdings of portfolio securities the fund is required to maintain continuous asset coverage of  with respect to such borrowings and to sell within three days sufficient portfolio holdings to restore such coverage if it should decline to less than  due to market fluctuations or otherwise even if such liquidations of the funds portfolio are disadvantageous from an investment standpoint leveraging by means of borrowing which is deemed to be a speculative technique may exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the portfolio securities or the funds net asset value nav money borrowed also will be subject to interest and other costs which may include commitment fees andor the cost of maintaining minimum average balances which may or may not exceed the income received from the securities purchased with borrowed funds futures contracts each fund may purchase and sell financial futures contracts and options on such contracts a financial futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specific security or financial instrument at a particular price on a stipulated future date although some financial futures contracts call for making or taking delivery of the underlying securities or instruments in most cases these obligations are closed out before the settlement date the closing of a contractual obligation may be accomplished by purchasing or selling an identical offsetting futures contract other financial futures contracts by their terms call for cash settlements each fund may also buy and sell index futures contracts with respect to any stock or bond index traded on a recognized stock exchange or board of trade an index futures contract is a contract to buy or sell units of an index on a specified future date at a price agreed upon when the contract is made the stock index futures contract specifies that no delivery of the actual stocks making up the index will take place instead settlement in cash must occur upon the termination of the contract with the settlement being the difference between the contract price and the actual level of the stock index at the expiration of the contract in addition a fund may enter into foreign currency futures contracts as described below under foreign currency contracts and currency hedging transactions    at the time a fund purchases a futures contract an amount of cash or liquid portfolio securities generally equal to the settlement price less any margin deposit market value of the futures contract will be designated as segregated at that funds custodian when writing a futures contract a fund will maintain with its custodian similar liquid assets that when added to the amounts deposited with a futures commission merchant or broker as margin are equal to the market value of the instruments underlying the contract alternatively a fund may cover its position by owning the instruments underlying the contract or in the case of an index futures contract a portfolio with a volatility substantially similar to that of the index on which the futures contract is based or holding a call option permitting a fund to purchase the same futures contract at a price no higher than the price of the contract written by a fund or at a higher price if the difference is maintained in liquid assets with the funds custodian each fund will be authorized to use financial futures contracts and related options for hedging and nonhedging purposes for example to enhance total return or provide market exposure pending the investment of cash balances a fund may lose the expected benefit of the transactions if currency exchange rates or securities prices change in an unanticipated manner such unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or securities prices may also result in poorer overall performance than if a fund had not entered into any futures transactions options on securities and stock indexes each fund may write covered call and put options and purchase call and put options on securities or stock indices that are traded on us exchanges an option on a security is a contract that gives the purchaser of the option in return for the premium paid the right to buy a specified security in the case of a call option or to sell a specified security in the case of a put option from or to the writer of the option at a designated price during the term of the option an option on a securities index gives the purchaser of the option in return for the premium paid the right to receive from the seller cash equal to the difference between the closing price of the index and the exercise price of the option a fund may write a call or put option only if the option is covered a call option on a security written by a fund is covered if that fund owns the underlying security covered by the call or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire that security without additional cash consideration or for additional cash consideration held in a segregated account by its custodian upon conversion or exchange of other securities held in its portfolio a call option on a security is also covered if a fund owns a call option on the same security and in the same principal amount as the call option written where the exercise price of the call option held a is equal to or less than the exercise price of the call option written or b is greater than the exercise price of the call option written if the difference is maintained by that fund in cash or liquid portfolio securities in a segregated account with its custodian a put option on a security written by a fund is covered if that fund maintains similar liquid assets with a value equal to the exercise price designated as segregated at its custodian or else owns a put option on the same security and in the same principal amount as the put option written where the exercise price of the put option held is equal to or greater than the exercise price of the put option written the value of the underlying securities on which options may be written at any one time will not exceed  of the total assets of the fund a fund will not purchase put or call options if the aggregate premium paid for such options would exceed  of its total assets at the time of purchase a fund will cover call options on stock indices by owning securities whose price changes in the opinion of the advisor are expected to be similar to those of the index or in such other manner as may be in accordance with the rules of the exchange on which the option is traded and applicable laws and regulations nevertheless where a fund covers a call option on a stock index through ownership of securities such securities may not match the composition of the index in that event that fund will not be fully covered and could be subject to risk of loss in the event of adverse changes in the value of the index a fund will cover put options on stock indices by segregating assets equal to the options exercise price or in such other manner as may be in accordance with the rules of the exchange on which the option is traded and applicable laws and regulations a fund will receive a premium for writing a put or call option which will increase the funds gross income in the event the option expires unexercised or is closed out at a profit if the value of a security or an index on which a fund has written a call option falls or remains the same that fund will realize a profit in the form of the premium received less transaction costs that could offset all or a portion of any decline in the value of the portfolio securities being hedged a rise in the value of the underlying security or index however exposes that fund to possible loss or loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the value of the underlying index or security by writing a put option a fund assumes the risk of a decline in the underlying security or index to the extent that the price changes of the portfolio securities being hedged correlate with changes in the value of the underlying security or index writing covered put options on securities or indices will increase a funds losses in the event of a market decline although such losses will be offset in part by the premium received for writing the option a fund may also purchase put options to hedge its investments against a decline in value by purchasing a put option a fund will seek to offset a decline in the value of the portfolio securities being hedged through appreciation of the put option if the value of a funds investments does not decline as anticipated that funds loss will be limited to the premium paid for the option plus related transaction costs the success of this strategy will depend in part on the accuracy of the correlation between the changes in value of the underlying security or index and the changes in value of that funds security holdings being hedged a fund may purchase call options on individual securities to hedge against an increase in the price of securities that the fund anticipates purchasing in the future similarly a fund may purchase call options to attempt to reduce the risk of missing a broad market advance or an advance in an industry or market segment at a time when that fund holds uninvested cash or shortterm debt securities awaiting investment when purchasing call options a fund will bear the risk of losing all or a portion of the premium paid if the value of the underlying security or index does not rise there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when a fund seeks to close out an option position trading could be interrupted for example because of supply and demand imbalances arising from a lack of either buyers or sellers or the options exchange could suspend trading after the price has risen or fallen more than the maximum specified by the exchange although a fund may be able to offset to some extent any adverse effects of being unable to liquidate an option position that fund may experience losses in some cases as a result of such inability    foreign currency contracts and currency hedging transactions in order to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risks each fund may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts forward contracts and foreign currency futures contracts foreign currency futures as well as purchase put or call options on foreign currencies as described below each fund may also conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market a fund may enter into forward contracts to attempt to minimize the risk to that fund from adverse changes in the relationship between the us dollar and foreign currencies a forward contract is an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency for an agreed price on a future date which is individually negotiated and privately traded by currency traders and their customers a fund may enter into a forward contract for example when it enters into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a foreign currency or expects to receive a dividend or interest payment on a portfolio holding in order to lock in the us dollar value of the security or payment in addition for example when a fund believes that a foreign currency may experience a substantial movement against another currency it may enter into a forward contract to sell an amount of the former foreign currency or another currency which acts as a proxy for that currency approximating the value of some or all of that funds portfolio securities denominated in such foreign currency this second investment practice is generally referred to as crosshedging because in connection with a funds foreign currency forward transactions an amount of that funds assets equal to the amount of that funds current commitment under the forward contract will be segregated to be used to pay for the commitment the fund will always have cash or other liquid assets available that are sufficient to cover any commitments under these contracts or to limit any potential risk the segregated assets will be markedtomarket on a daily basis in addition a fund will not enter into such forward contracts if as a result that fund will have more than  of the value of its total assets committed to such contracts to the extent such contracts would be deemed to be illiquid they will be included in the maximum limitation of  of net assets invested in restricted or illiquid securities forward contracts may limit potential gain from a positive change in the relationship between the us dollar and foreign currencies unanticipated changes in currency prices may result in poorer overall performance for a fund than if it had not engaged in such contracts a fund may enter into exchangetraded foreign currency futures for the purchase or sale for future delivery of foreign currencies us exchangetraded futures are regulated by the commodity futures trading commission this investment technique will be used only to hedge against anticipated future changes in exchange rates which otherwise might adversely affect the value of a funds portfolio securities or adversely affect the prices of securities that a fund intends to purchase at a later date a fund may purchase and write put and call options on foreign currencies for the purpose of protecting against declines in the dollar value of foreign portfolio securities and against increases in the us dollar cost of foreign securities to be acquired as is the case with other kinds of options however the writing of an option on foreign currency will constitute only a partial hedge up to the amount of the premium received and that fund could be required to purchase or sell foreign currencies at disadvantageous exchange rates thereby incurring losses the purchase of an option on foreign currency may constitute an effective hedge against fluctuation in exchange rates although in the event of rate movements adverse to that funds position the fund may forfeit the entire amount of the premium plus related transaction costs the successful use of forward contracts and foreign currency futures will usually depend on the advisors ability to forecast currency exchange rate movements correctly should exchange rates move in an unexpected manner a fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits of forward contracts foreign currency futures or may realize losses risks of options futures and forward contracts options futures and forward contracts are forms of derivatives the use of options futures and forward contracts as hedging techniques may not succeed where the price movements of the securities underlying the options futures and forward contracts do not follow the price movements of the portfolio securities subject to the hedge gains on investments in options futures and forward contracts depend on the advisors ability to predict correctly the direction of stock prices interest rates currencies and other economic factors and unanticipated changes may cause poorer overall performance for a fund than if it had not engaged in such transactions where a liquid secondary market for options futures or forward contracts does not exist a fund may not be able to close its position and in such an event would be unable to control its losses the loss from investing in certain options futures and forward contracts is potentially unlimited the use of forward foreign currency contracts may limit gains from a positive change in the relationship between the us dollar and foreign currencies a funds futures transactions will ordinarily be entered into for traditional hedging purposes there is however no limit on the amount of a funds assets that can be put at risk through the use of futures contracts and the value of a funds futures contracts and options thereon may equal or exceed  of that funds total assets each fund has claimed an exclusion from the

earned a master of business administration degree from harvard university and currently serves as a trustee of a private university the boards believe that the significance of each directors experience qualifications attributes or skills is an individual matter meaning that experience that is important for one director may not have the same value for another and that these factors are best evaluated at the board level with no single director or particular factor being indicative of board effectiveness however the boards believe that directors need to have the ability to critically review evaluate question and discuss information provided to them and to interact effectively with fund management service providers and counsel in order to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties the boards believe that their members satisfy this standard experience relevant to having this ability may be achieved through a directors educational background business professional training or practice  eg  accountancy or law public service or academic positions experience from service as a board member including the boards of the funds or as an executive of investment funds public companies or significant private or notforprofit entities or other organizations andor other life experiences the charter for the boards nominating committee contains certain other specific requirements and factors considered by the committee in identifying and selecting director candidates please see below    to assist them in evaluating matters under federal and state law the directors are counseled by their own independent legal counsel who participates in board meetings and interacts with the advisor and also may benefit from information provided by the funds and the advisors counsel both board and fund counsel have significant experience advising funds and fund board members each board and its committees have the ability to engage other experts as appropriate each board evaluates its performance on an annual basis board composition and leadership structure the  act requires that at least  of a funds directors not be interested persons as defined in the  act of the fund and as such are not affiliated with the advisor independent directors to rely on certain exemptive rules under the  act a majority of a funds directors must be independent directors and for certain important matters such as the approval of investment advisory agreements or transactions with affiliates the act or the rules thereunder require the approval of a majority of the independent directors currently over  of the funds directors are independent directors the chairmen of the boards are interested persons of the funds and the independent directors have designated a lead independent director who chairs meetings or executive sessions of the independent directors reviews and comments on board meeting agendas represents the views of the independent directors to management and facilitates communication among the independent directors and their counsel the board has determined that its leadership structure in which the independent directors have designated a lead independent director to function as described above is appropriate in light of the services that the advisor and its affiliates provide to the funds and potential conflicts of

the investments of other accounts or vehicles for which the portfolio managers are responsible on the other for example a portfolio manager may have conflicts of interest in allocating management time resources and investment opportunities among a fund and the other accounts or vehicles he advises in addition due to differences in the investment strategies or restrictions among a fund and the other accounts a portfolio manager may take action with respect to another account that differs from the action taken with respect to the fund in some cases another account managed by a portfolio manager may provide more revenue to the advisor while this may appear to create additional conflicts of interest for the portfolio manager in the allocation of management time resources and investment opportunities the advisor strives to ensure that portfolio managers endeavor to exercise their discretion in a manner that is equitable to all interested persons in this regard in the absence of specific accountrelated impediments such as clientimposed restrictions or lack of available cash it is the policy of the advisor to allocate investment ideas pro rata to all accounts with the same primary investment objective in addition certain of the portfolio managers may from time to time manage one or more accounts on behalf of the advisor and its affiliated companies the cns accounts certain securities held and traded in the cns accounts also may be held and traded in one or more client accounts it is the policy of the advisor however not to put the interests of the cns accounts ahead of the interests of client accounts the advisor may aggregate orders of client accounts with those of the cns accounts however under no circumstances will preferential treatment be given to the cns accounts for all orders involving the cns accounts purchases or sales will be allocated prior to trade placement and orders that are only partially filled will be allocated across all accounts in proportion to the shares each account including the cns accounts was designated to receive prior to trading as a result it is expected that the cns accounts will receive the same average price as other accounts included in the aggregated order shares will not be allocated or reallocated to the cns accounts after trade execution or after the average price is known in the event so few shares of an order are executed that a prorata allocation is not practical a rotational system of allocation may be used however the cns accounts will never be part of that rotation or receive shares of a partially filled order other than on a prorata basis because certain cns accounts are managed with a cash management objective it is possible that a security will be sold out of the cns accounts but continue to be held for one or more client accounts in situations when this occurs such security will remain in a client account only if the portfolio manager acting in its reasonable judgment and consistent with its fiduciary duties believes this is appropriate for and consistent with the objectives and profile of the client account advisor compensation structure compensation of the advisors portfolio managers and other investment professionals has three primary components  a base salary  an annual cash bonus and  annual stockbased compensation consisting generally of restricted stock

disbursing agency services to each fund neither state street nor the transfer agent has any part in deciding a funds investment policies or which securities are to be purchased or sold for a funds portfolio code of ethics the funds the advisor the subadvisors and the distributor have adopted codes of ethics pursuant to rule j under the  act and with respect to the advisor and subadvisors rule a under the investment advisers acts of  as amended that is designed to ensure that the interests of fund shareholders come before the interests of those involved in managing the funds the code of

subadvisors the responsibility for voting proxies on behalf of each fund and has determined that the advisor and as applicable the subadvisor will vote proxies with respect to those portfolio securities for which they have investment responsibility the following is a summary of the advisors and subadvisors proxy voting policies and procedures voting rights are an important component of corporate governance the advisor and the subadvisors have three overall objectives in exercising voting rights a responsibility the advisor and the subadvisors shall seek to ensure that there is an effective means in place to hold companies accountable for their actions while management must be accountable to its board the board must be accountable to a companys shareholders although accountability can be promoted in a variety of ways protecting shareholder voting rights may be among our most important tools    b rationalizing management and shareholder concerns the advisor and the subadvisors seek to ensure that the interests of a companys management and board are aligned with those of the companys shareholders in this respect compensation must be structured to reward the creation of shareholder value c shareholder communication since companies are owned by their shareholders the advisor and the subadvisors seek to ensure that management effectively communicates with its owners about the companys business operations and financial performance it is only with effective communication that shareholders will be able to assess the performance of management and to make informed decisions on when to buy sell or hold a companys securities in exercising voting rights the advisor and the subadvisors follow the general principles set forth below      the ability to exercise a voting right with respect to a security is a valuable right and therefore must be viewed as part of the asset itself      in exercising voting rights the advisor and the subadvisors shall engage in a careful evaluation of issues that may materially affect the rights of shareholders and the value of the security      consistent with general fiduciary principles the exercise of voting rights shall always be conducted with reasonable care prudence and diligence      in exercising voting rights on behalf of clients the advisor and the subadvisors shall conduct itself in the same manner as if the advisor and the subadvisors were the constructive owners of the securities      to the extent reasonably possible the advisor and the subadvisors shall participate in each shareholder voting opportunity      voting rights shall not automatically be exercised in favor of managementsupported proposals      the advisor and the subadvisors and their respective officers and employees shall never accept any item of value in consideration of a favorable proxy voting decision set forth below are general guidelines followed by the advisor and the subadvisors in exercising proxy voting rights prudence  in making a proxy voting decision the advisor and the subadvisors shall give appropriate consideration to all relevant facts and circumstances including the value of the securities to be voted and the likely effect any vote may have on that value since voting rights must be exercised on the basis of an informed judgment investigation shall be a critical initial step third party views  while the advisor and the subadvisors may consider the views of third parties the advisor and the subadvisors shall never base a proxy voting decision solely on the opinion of a third party rather decisions shall be based on a reasonable and good faith determination as to how best to maximize shareholder value shareholder value just as the decision whether to purchase or sell a security is a matter of judgment determining whether a specific proxy resolution will increase the market value of a security is a matter of judgment as to which informed parties may differ in determining how a proxy vote may affect the economic value of a security the advisor and the subadvisors shall consider both shortterm and longterm views about a companys business and prospects especially in light of its projected holding period on the stock eg the advisor may discount longterm views on a shortterm holding set forth below are guidelines as to how specific proxy voting issues shall be analyzed and assessed by the advisor and the subadvisors while these guidelines will provide a framework for the advisors and the subadvisors decision making process the mechanical application of these guidelines can never address all proxy voting decisions when new issues arise or old issues present nuances not encountered before the advisor and the subadvisors must be guided by their reasonable judgment to vote in a manner that the advisor deems to be in the best interests of a fund and its shareholders in addition because the regulatory framework and the business cultures and practices vary from region to region the below general guidelines may be inconsistent in certain circumstances for proxies of issuers of securities in europe and asia uncontested director elections votes on director nominees should be made on a casebycase basis using a mosaic approach where all factors are considered in director elections and where no single issue is deemed to be determinative for example a nominees experience and business judgment may be critical to the longterm success of the portfolio company notwithstanding the fact that he or she may serve on the board of more than four public companies in evaluating nominees advisor and the subadvisors consider the following factors      whether the nominee attended less than  percent of the board and committee meetings without a valid excuse for the absences      whether the nominee is an inside or affiliated outside director and sits on the audit compensation or nominating committees      whether the nominee ignored a significant shareholder proposal that was approved by a i majority of the shares outstanding or ii majority of the votes cast for two consecutive years      whether the nominee without shareholder approval to the advisors and subadvisors knowledge instituted a new poison pill plan extended an existing plan or adopted a new plan upon the expiration of an existing plan during the past year      whether the nominee is an inside or affiliated outside director and the full board serves as the audit compensation or nominating committee or the company does not have one of these committees      whether the nominee is an insider or affiliated outsider on boards that are not at least majority independent      whether the nominee is the ceo of a publiclytraded company who serves on more than two public boards      whether the nominee serves on more than four public company boards      whether the nominee serves on the audit committee where there is evidence such as audit reports or reports mandated under the sarbanesoxley act that there exists material weaknesses in the companys internal controls       whether the nominee serves on the compensation committee if that director was present at the time of the grant of backdated options or options the pricing or the timing of which advisor and the subadvisors believe may have been manipulated to provide additional benefits to executives      whether the nominee is believed by the advisor and the subadvisors to have a material conflict of interest with the portfolio company and      whether the nominee or the overall board in the advisors and subadvisors view has a record of making poor corporate or strategic decisions or has demonstrated an overall lack of good business judgment the advisor and the subadvisors vote on a casebycase basis for shareholder proposals requesting companies to amend their bylaws in order to create access to the proxy so as to nominate candidates for directors the advisor and the subadvisors recognize the importance of shareholder access to the ballot process as a means to ensure that boards do not become selfperpetuating and selfserving however the advisor and the subadvisors are also aware that some proposals may promote certain interest groups and could be disruptive to the nomination process special attention will be paid to companies that display a chronic lack of shareholder accountability proxy contests director nominees in a contested election  by definition this type of board candidate or slate runs for the purpose of seeking a significant change in corporate policy or control therefore the economic impact of the vote in favor of or in opposition to that director or slate must be analyzed using a higher standard such as is normally applied to changes in control criteria for evaluating director nominees as a group or individually should also include the underlying reason why the new slate or individual director is being proposed performance compensation corporate governance provisions and takeover activity criminal activity attendance at meetings investment in the company interlocking directorships inside outside and independent directors number of other board seats and other experience it is impossible to have a general policy regarding director nominees in a contested election reimbursement of proxy solicitation expenses decisions to provide full reimbursement for dissidents waging a proxy contest should be made on a casebycase basis ratification of auditors the advisor and the subadvisors vote for proposals to ratify auditors unless an auditor has a financial interest in or association with the company and are therefore not independent or there is reason to believe that the independent auditor has rendered an opinion that is neither accurate nor indicative of the companys financial position generally the advisor and the subadvisors vote against auditor ratification and withhold votes from audit committee members if nonaudit fees exceed audit fees the advisor and the subadvisors vote on a casebycase basis on auditor rotation proposals criteria for evaluating the rotation proposal include but are not limited to tenure of the audit firm establishment and disclosure of a renewal process whereby the auditor is regularly evaluated for both audit quality and competitive price length of the rotation period advocated in the proposal and any significant audit related issues generally the advisor and the subadvisors vote against auditor indemnification and limitation of liability however the advisor and the subadvisors recognize there may be situations where indemnification and limitations on liability may be appropriate takeover defenses while the advisor and the subadvisors recognize that a takeover attempt can be a significant distraction for the board and management to deal with the simple fact is that the possibility of a corporate takeover keeps management focused on maximizing shareholder value as a result the advisor and the subadvisors oppose measures that are designed to prevent or obstruct corporate takeovers because they can entrench current management the following are our guidelines on change of control issues shareholder rights plans  the advisor and the subadvisors acknowledge that there are arguments for and against shareholder rights plans also known as poison pills companies should put their case for rights plans to shareholders the advisor and the subadvisors review on a casebycase basis management proposals to ratify a poison pill the advisor and the subadvisors generally look for shareholder friendly features including a two to threeyear sunset provision a permitted bid provision and a  percent or higher flipin provision greenmail  the advisor and the subadvisors vote for proposals to adopt antigreenmail charter or bylaw amendments or otherwise restricts a companys ability to make greenmail payments unequal voting rights  generally the advisor and the subadvisors vote against dualclass recapitalizations as they offer an effective way for a firm to thwart hostile takeovers by concentrating voting power in the hands of management or other insiders classified boards  the advisor and the subadvisors generally vote in favor of shareholder proposals to declassify a board of directors although the advisor and the subadvisors acknowledge that a classified board may be in the longterm best interests of a company in certain situations in voting on shareholder proposals to declassify a board of directors the advisor and the subadvisors evaluate all facts and circumstances surrounding such proposal including whether the shareholder proposing the declassification has an agenda in making such proposal that may be at odds with the longterm best interests of the company or whether it would be in the best interests of the company to thwart a shareholders attempt to control the board of directors cumulative voting  having the ability to cumulate votes for the election of directorsthat is cast more than one vote for a director about whom they feel stronglygenerally increases shareholders rights to effect change in the management of a corporation the advisor and the subadvisors generally support therefore proposals to adopt cumulative voting    shareholder ability to call special meeting  the advisor and the subadvisors vote on a casebycase basis for shareholder proposals requesting companies to amend their governance documents bylaws andor charter in order to allow shareholders to call special meetings the advisor and the subadvisors recognize the importance of shareholder ability to call a special meeting however the advisor and the subadvisors are also aware that some proposals are put forth in order to promote the agendas of certain special interest groups and could be disruptive to the management of the company shareholder ability to act by written consent  the advisor and the subadvisors generally vote against proposals to allow or facilitate shareholder action by written consent the requirement that all shareholders be given notice of a shareholders meeting and matters to be discussed therein seems to provide a reasonable protection of minority shareholder rights shareholder ability to alter the size of the board  the advisor and the subadvisors generally vote for proposals that seek to fix the size of the board and vote against proposals that give management the ability to alter the size of the board without shareholder approval while the advisor and the subadvisors recognize the importance of such proposals the advisor and the subadvisors are however also aware that these proposals are sometimes put forth in order to promote the agendas of certain special interest groups and could be disruptive to the management of the company miscellaneous board provisions board committees  boards should delegate key oversight functions such as responsibility for audit nominating and compensation issues to independent committees the chairman and members of any committee should be clearly identified in the annual report any committee should have the authority to engage independent advisors where appropriate at the companys expense audit nominating and compensation committees should consist solely of nonemployee directors who are independent of management separate chairman and ceo positions  the advisor will generally vote for proposals looking to separate the ceo and chairman roles the advisor and the subadvisors do acknowledge however that under certain circumstances it may be reasonable for the ceo and chairman roles to be held by a single person lead directors and executive sessions  in cases where the ceo and chairman roles are combined the advisor and the subadvisors will vote for the appointment of a lead noninsider director and for regular executive sessions board meetings taking place without the ceochairman present majority of independent directors  the advisor and the subadvisors vote for proposals that call for the board to be composed of a majority of independent directors the advisor and the subadvisors believe that a majority of independent directors can be an important factor in facilitating objective decision making and enhancing accountability to shareholders independent committees  the advisor and the subadvisors vote for shareholder proposals requesting that the boards audit compensation and nominating committees consist exclusively of independent directors stock ownership requirements  the advisor and the subadvisors support measures requiring senior executives to hold a minimum amount of stock in a company often expressed as a percentage of annual compensation requiring stock acquired through option exercise to be held for a certain minimum amount of time and issuing restricted stock awards instead of options term of office  the advisor and the subadvisors vote against shareholder proposals to limit the tenure of outside directors term limits pose artificial and arbitrary impositions on the board and could harm shareholder interests by forcing experienced and knowledgeable directors off the board director and officer indemnification and liability protection  proposals concerning director and officer indemnification and liability protection should be evaluated on a casebycase basis board size the advisor and the subadvisors generally vote for proposals to limit the size of the board to  members or less majority vote standard the advisor and the subadvisors generally vote for proposals asking for the board to initiate the appropriate process to amend the companys governance documents charter or bylaws to provide that director nominees shall be elected by the affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast at an annual meeting of shareholders the advisor and the subadvisors would generally review on a casebycase basis proposals that address alternative approaches to a majority vote requirement confidential voting the advisor and the subadvisors vote for shareholder proposals requesting that companies adopt confidential voting use independent tabulators and use independent inspectors of election as long as the proposals include clauses for proxy contests as follows in the case of a contested election management should be permitted to request that the dissident group honor its confidential voting policy if the dissidents agree the policy remains in place if the dissidents do not agree the confidential voting policy is waived the advisor and the subadvisors also vote for management proposals to adopt confidential voting bundled proposals the advisor and the subadvisors review on a casebycase basis bundled or conditioned proxy proposals in the case of items that are conditioned upon each other the advisor and the subadvisors examine the benefits and costs of the packaged items in instances where the joint effect of the conditioned items is not in shareholders best interests the advisor and the subadvisors vote against the proposals if the combined effect is positive the advisor and the subadvisors support such proposals datelocation of meeting the advisor and the subadvisors vote against shareholder proposals to change the date or location of the shareholders meeting no one site will meet the needs of all shareholders adjourn meeting if votes are insufficient openended requests for adjournment of a shareholder meeting generally will not be supported however where management specifically states the reason for requesting an adjournment and the requested adjournment is necessary to permit a proposal that would otherwise be supported under this policy to be carried out the adjournment request will be supported disclosure of shareholder proponents the advisor and the subadvisors vote for shareholder proposals requesting that companies disclose the names of shareholder proponents shareholders may wish to contact the proponents of a shareholder proposal for additional information    capital structure increase additional common stock the advisor and the subadvisors generally vote for increases in authorized shares provided that the increase is not greater than three times the number of shares outstanding and reserved for issuance including shares reserved for stockrelated plans and securities convertible into common stock but not shares reserved for any poison pill plan votes generally are cast in favor of proposals to authorize additional shares of stock except where the proposal      creates a blank check preferred stock or      establishes classes of stock with superior voting rights blank check preferred stock votes generally are cast in opposition to management proposals authorizing the creation of new classes of preferred stock with unspecific voting conversion distribution and other rights and management proposals to increase the number of authorized blank check preferred shares the advisor and the subadvisors may vote in favor of this type of proposal when they receive assurances to its reasonable satisfaction that i the preferred stock was authorized by the board for the use of legitimate capital formation purposes and not for antitakeover purposes and ii no preferred stock will be issued with voting power that is disproportionate to the economic interests of the preferred stock these representations should be made either in the proxy statement or in a separate letter from the company to the advisor and as applicable the subadvisors preemptive rights votes regarding shareholder proposals seeking preemptive rights are determined on a casebycase basis after evaluating      the size of the company      the shareholder base and      the liquidity of the stock for example it would be difficult to support a shareholder proposal that would require an sp  company with over  billion in equity held by thousands of shareholders with no single shareholder owning a significant percentage of outstanding shares to implement preemptive rights each time it conducted a new offering such a requirement would be impractical and extremely costly moreover at companies with that large of a shareholder base and the ease with which shareholders could preserve their relative interest through purchases of shares on the open market the cost of implementing preemptive rights does not seem justifiable in relation to the benefits dual class capitalizations because classes of common stock with unequal voting rights limit the rights of certain shareholders the advisor and the subadvisors vote against adoption of a dual or multiple class capitalization structure restructuringsrecapitalizations  the advisor and the subadvisors review proposals to increase common andor preferred shares and to issue shares as part of a debt restructuring plan on a casebycase basis in voting the advisor and the subadvisors consider the following issues      dilutionhow much will ownership interest of existing shareholders be reduced and how extreme will dilution to any future earnings be      change in controlwill the transaction result in a change in control of the company      bankruptcygenerally approve proposals that facilitate debt restructurings unless there are clear signs of selfdealing or other abuses share repurchase programs  boards may institute share repurchase or stock buyback programs for a number of reasons the advisor and the subadvisors will generally vote in favor of such programs where the repurchase would be in the longterm best interests of shareholders and where the company is not thought to be able to use the cash in a more useful way the advisor and the subadvisors will vote against such programs when shareholders interests could be better served by deployment of the cash for alternative uses or where the repurchase is a defensive maneuver or an attempt to entrench management targeted share placements  these shareholder proposals ask companies to seek shareholder approval before placing  or more of their voting stock with a single investor the proposals are typically in reaction to the placement by various companies of a large block of their voting stock in an esop parent capital fund or with a single friendly investor with the aim of protecting themselves against a hostile tender offer these proposals are voted on a casebycase basis after reviewing the individual situation of the company receiving the proposal executive and director compensation stockbased incentive plans  votes with respect to compensation plans should be determined on a casebycase basis the analysis of compensation plans focuses primarily on the transfer of shareholder wealth the dollar cost of pay plans to shareholders other matters included in our analysis are the amount of the companys outstanding stock to be reserved for the award of stock options or restricted stock whether the exercise price of an option is less than the stocks fair market value at the date of the grant of the options and whether the plan provides for the exchange of outstanding options for new ones at lower exercise prices every award type is valued an estimated dollar cost for the proposed plan and all continuing plans is derived this cost dilution to shareholders equity will also be expressed as a percentage figure for the transfer of shareholder wealth and will be considered along with dilution to voting power once the cost of the plan is estimated it is compared to an allowable industryspecific and market capbased dilution cap if the proposed plan cost is above the allowable cap an against vote is indicated if the proposed cost is below the allowable cap a vote for the plan is indicated unless the plan violates the repricing guidelines if the company has a history of repricing options or has the express ability to reprice underwater stock options without first securing shareholder approval under the proposed plan the plan receives an against voteeven in cases where the plan cost is considered acceptable based on the quantitative analysis the advisor and the subadvisors vote against equity plans that have high average three year burn rates unless the company has publicly committed to reduce the burn rate to a rate that is comparable to its peer group as determined by the advisor    approval of cash or cashandstock bonus plans  the advisor and the subadvisors vote for cash or cashandstock bonus plans to exempt the compensation from limits on deductibility under the provisions of section m of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code executive compensation  executive compensation should be tied to the performance of the executive and the company as well as relevant market conditions the advisor and the subadvisors feel that the performance criteria and specific amounts and types of executive compensation are best decided by a companys board of directors andor its compensation committee and fully disclosed to shareholders the advisor will however vote for shareholder proposals that call for shareholders to vote in a nonbinding manner on executive pay since such vote is nonbinding and is merely informative for the board of directors andor compensation committee further the advisor and the subadvisors generally vote for shareholder proposals that seek additional disclosure of executive and director pay information reloadevergreen features  the advisor and the subadvisors will generally vote against plans that enable the issuance of reload options and that provide an automatic share replenishment evergreen feature golden parachutes the advisor and the subadvisors oppose the use of accelerated employment contracts that result in cash grants of greater than three times annual compensation salary and bonus in the event of termination of employment following a change in control of a company in general the guidelines call for voting against golden parachute plans because they impede potential takeovers that shareholders should be free to consider the advisor and the subadvisors generally withhold their votes at the next shareholder meeting for directors whom to its knowledge approved golden parachutes k employee benefit plans  the advisor and the subadvisors vote for proposals to implement a k savings plan for employees employee stock purchase plans  the advisor and the subadvisors support employee stock purchase plans although the advisor and the subadvisors generally believe the discounted purchase price should be at least  of the current market price option expensing  the advisor and the subadvisors vote for shareholder proposals to expense fixedprice options vesting  the advisor and the subadvisors believe that restricted stock awards normally should vest over at least a twoyear period option repricing  the advisor and the subadvisors believe that stock options generally should not be repriced and never should be repriced without shareholder approval in addition companies should not issue new options with a lower strike price to make up for previously issued options that are substantially underwater the advisor will vote against the election of any slate of directors that to its knowledge has authorized a company to reprice or replace underwater options during the most recent year without shareholder approval stock holding periods  the advisor and the subadvisors generally vote against all proposals requiring executives to hold the stock received upon option exercise for a specific period of time transferable stock options  the advisor and the subadvisors review on a casebycase basis proposals to grant transferable stock options or otherwise permit the transfer of outstanding stock options including cost of proposal and alignment with shareholder interests recoup bonuses  the advisor and the subadvisors vote on a casebycase on shareholder proposals to recoup unearned incentive bonuses or other incentive payments made to senior executives if it is later determined that fraud misconduct or negligence significantly contributed to a restatement of financial results that led to the awarding of unearned incentive compensation incorporation reincorporation outside of the united states  generally the advisor and the subadvisors will vote against companies looking to reincorporate outside of the us voting on state takeover statutes  the advisor and the subadvisors review on a casebycase basis proposals to opt in or out of state takeover statutes including control share acquisition statutes control share cashout statutes freeze out provisions fair price provisions stakeholder laws poison pill endorsements severance pay and labor contract provisions anti greenmail provisions and disgorgement provisions in voting on these shareholder proposals the advisor and the subadvisors evaluate all facts and circumstances surrounding such proposal including whether the shareholder proposing such measure has an agenda in making such proposal that may be at odds with the longterm best interests of the company or whether it would be in the best interests of the company to thwart a shareholders attempt to control the board of directors voting on reincorporation proposals  proposals to change a companys state of incorporation are examined on a casebycase basis in making its decision the advisor and the subadvisors review managements rationale for the proposal changes to the charterbylaws and differences in the state laws governing the companies mergers and corporate restructurings mergers and acquisitions  votes on mergers and acquisitions should be considered on a casebycase basis taking into account factors including the following anticipated financial and operating benefits offer price cost vs premium prospects of the combined companies how the deal was negotiated and changes in corporate governance and their impact on shareholder rights the advisor and the subadvisors vote against proposals that require a supermajority of shareholders to approve a merger or other significant business combination the advisor and the subadvisors support proposals that seek to lower supermajority voting requirements nonfinancial effects of a merger or acquisition  some companies have proposed a charter provision which specifies that the board of directors may examine the nonfinancial effect of a merger or acquisition on the company this provision would allow the board to evaluate the impact a proposed change in control would have on employees host communities suppliers andor others the advisor and the subadvisors generally vote against proposals to adopt such charter provisions the advisor and the subadvisors feel it is the directors fiduciary duty to base decisions solely on the financial interests of the shareholders corporate restructuring  votes on corporate restructuring proposals including minority squeeze outs leveraged buyouts going private proposals spinoffs liquidations and asset sales should be considered on a casebycase basis    spinoffs  votes on spinoffs should be considered on a casebycase basis depending on the tax and regulatory advantages planned use of sale proceeds market focus and managerial incentives asset sales  votes on asset sales should be made on a casebycase basis after considering the impact on the balance sheetworking capital value received for the asset and potential elimination of diseconomies liquidations  votes on liquidations should be made on a casebycase basis after reviewing managements efforts to pursue other alternatives appraisal value of assets and the compensation plan for executives managing the liquidation appraisal rights  the advisor and the subadvisors vote for proposals to restore or provide shareholders with rights of appraisal rights of appraisal provide shareholders who are not satisfied with the terms of certain corporate transactions the right to demand a judicial review in order to determine a fair value for their shares changing corporate name  the advisor and the subadvisors vote for changing the corporate name social issues the advisor and the subadvisors believe that it is the responsibility of the board and management to run a company on a daily basis with this in mind in the absence of unusual circumstances the advisor and the subadvisors do not believe that shareholders should be involved in determining how a company should address broad social and policy issues as a result the advisor generally votes against these types of proposals which are generally initiated by shareholders unless the advisor and the subadvisors believes the proposal has significant economic implications each fund is required to file form npx with its complete proxy voting record for the

portfolio transactions and brokerage subject to the supervision of the board of directors decisions to buy and sell securities for a fund and negotiation of its brokerage commission rates are made by the advisor and as applicable the subadvisors transactions on us and as applicable nonus stock exchanges involve the payment by a fund of negotiated brokerage commissions there is generally no stated commission in the case of securities traded in the overthecounter market but the price paid by a fund usually includes an undisclosed dealer commission or markup in certain instances a fund may make purchases of underwritten or agency placed issues at prices that reflect underwriting or placement fees in accordance with procedures approved by the board and subject to its supervision a fund may purchase securities in offerings for which an affiliate of the advisor receives a fee for serving as placement agent to the issuer the advisor and as applicable the subadvisors will only cause a fund to engage in these transactions if the advisor and subadvisors deem such participation to be in the best interests of the fund in certain circumstances regulatory restrictions may prevent a fund from purchasing securities in an offering in which an affiliate serves as placement agent of the issuer and that funds inability to participate could be deemed to be to the detriment of the fund in selecting a broker to execute each particular transaction the advisor and as applicable each subadvisor will take the following into consideration the best net price available the reliability integrity and financial condition of the broker the size and difficulty in executing the order and the value of the expected contribution of the broker to the investment performance of each fund on a continuing basis accordingly the cost of the brokerage commissions to a fund in any transaction may be greater than that available from other brokers if the difference is reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services offered in addition the advisor and each subadvisor may receive research services from a broker in connection with initiating portfolio transactions for the fund research services include pricing and market data services the advisor and each subadvisors shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty solely by reason of its having caused a fund to pay a broker an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker would have charged solely for execution services for that transaction if the advisor and if applicable each subadvisor determine in good faith that the commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the research service provided research and investment information is provided by these and other brokers at no cost to the advisor and the subadvisors and is available for the benefit of other accounts advised by the advisor or subadvisors and their affiliates and not all of the information will be used in connection with a fund while this information may be useful in varying degrees and may tend to reduce the advisors or subadvisors expenses it is not possible to estimate its value and in the opinion of the advisor and the subadvisors it does not reduce their respective expenses in a determinable amount the extent to which the advisor or subadvisors make use of statistical research and other services furnished by brokers is considered by the advisor or subadvisors in the allocation of brokerage business but there is no formula by which such business is allocated the advisor or subadvisors do so in accordance with its judgment of the best interests of a fund and its shareholders the advisor or subadvisors may also take into account payments made by brokers effecting transactions for a fund to other persons on behalf of a fund for services provided to it for which it would be obligated to

applicable to longterm capital gains and the maximum individual tax rate on longterm capital gains will increase to  unless congress enacts legislation providing otherwise because of the factspecific nature of the inquiry a fund cannot predict at this time what portion if any of the dividends it will receive from foreign corporations will be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation applicable to qualified dividend income nor can there be any assurance as to what portion if any of that funds distributions will be entitled to the lower tax rates that apply to qualified dividend income

in excess of a funds current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated by a shareholder as a return of capital which is applied against and reduces the shareholders basis in his or her shares to the extent that the amount of any such distribution exceeds the shareholders basis in his or her shares the excess will be treated by the shareholder as gain from a sale or exchange of the shares dividends designated by a fund and received by corporate shareholders of that fund will qualify for the dividends received deduction the drd to the extent of the amount of qualifying dividends received by that fund from domestic corporations other than reits for the taxable year a dividend received by a fund will not be treated as a qualifying dividend i if the stock on which the

iii to the extent that a fund is under an obligation pursuant to a short sale or otherwise to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property moreover the

thereof for investment and be taxed at corporate rates on the amount retained in such case it may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who will be treated as if each received a distribution of his or her pro rata share of such gain with the result that each shareholder will i be required to report his or her pro rata share of such gain on his

fund shares exchanged may not be added to the tax basis in determining gain or loss for federal income tax purposes to the extent an otherwise applicable sales charge on the purchase of the

disposition of fund shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of any distributions of net capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such shares if a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to shares of  million or more for an individual shareholder or  million or more for a corporate shareholder the shareholder must file with the internal revenue service irs a disclosure statement on form  direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement but under current guidance shareholders of a regulated investment company are not excepted future guidance may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to shareholders of most or all regulated investment companies the fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayers treatment of the loss is proper shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances nature of funds investments certain of a funds investment practices are subject to special and complex federal income tax provisions that may among other things i disallow suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions ii convert lower taxed longterm capital gain into higher taxed shortterm capital gain or ordinary income iii convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss the deductibility of which is more limited iv cause a fund to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash v adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur vi adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and vii produce income that will not qualify as good income under the  annual gross income test described above each fund will monitor its transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the effect of these provisions    original issue discount securities investments by a fund in zero coupon or other discount securities will result in income to that fund equal to a portion of the excess of the face value of the securities over their issue price the original issue discount each year that the securities are held even though the fund receives no cash interest payments this income is included in determining the amount of income which a fund must distribute to maintain its status as a regulated investment company and to avoid the payment of federal income tax and the  excise tax in addition if a fund invests in certain high yield original issue discount securities issued by corporations a portion of the original issue discount accruing on any such obligation may be eligible for the deduction for dividends received by corporations in such event dividends of investment company taxable income received from that fund by its corporate shareholders to the extent attributable to such portion of accrued original issue discount may be eligible for this deduction for dividends received by corporations if so designated by the fund in a written notice to shareholders because such income may not be matched by a corresponding cash distribution to that fund the fund may be required to borrow money or dispose of other securities to be able to make distributions to its shareholders market discount bonds gains derived by a fund from the disposition of any market discount bonds ie bonds purchased other than at original issue where the face value of the bonds exceeds their purchase price held by that fund will be taxed as ordinary income to the extent of the accrued market discount of the bonds unless the fund elects to include the market discount in income as it accrues options and hedging transactions the taxation of equity options and overthe counter options on debt securities is governed by section  of the code pursuant to section  of the code the premium received by a fund for selling a put or call option is not included in income at the time of receipt if the option expires the premium is shortterm capital gain to that fund if a fund enters into a closing transaction the difference between the premium received and the amount paid to close out its position is shortterm capital gain or loss if a call option written by a fund is exercised thereby requiring that fund to sell the underlying security the premium will increase the amount realized upon the sale of such security and any resulting gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be longterm or shortterm depending upon the holding period of the security with respect to a put or call option that is purchased by a fund if the option is sold any resulting gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss and will be longterm or shortterm depending upon the holding period of the option if the option expires the resulting loss is a capital loss and is long term or shortterm depending upon the holding period of the option if the option is exercised the cost of the option in the case of a call option is added to the basis of the purchased security and in the case of a put option reduces the amount realized on the underlying security in determining gain or loss certain options futures contracts and forward contracts in which a fund may invest are section  contracts governed by section  of the code gains or losses on section  contracts generally are considered  longterm and  shortterm capital gains or losses however foreign currency gains or losses as discussed below arising from certain section  contracts may be treated as ordinary income or loss also section  contracts held by a fund at the end of each taxable year and generally for purposes of the  excise tax on december  as elected by that fund are markedto market that is treated as sold at fair market value resulting in unrealized gains or losses being treated as though they were realized generally the hedging transactions undertaken by a fund may result in straddles for us federal income tax purposes the straddle rules may affect the character of gains or losses realized by a fund in addition losses realized by a fund on positions that are part of a straddle may be deferred under the straddle rules rather than being taken into account in calculating the taxable income for the taxable year in which the losses are realized because only a few regulations implementing the straddle rules have been promulgated the tax consequences to a fund of engaging in hedging transactions are not entirely clear hedging transactions may increase the amount of shortterm capital gain realized by a fund which is taxed as ordinary income when distributed to shareholders a fund may make one or more of the elections available under the code which are applicable to straddles if a fund makes any of the elections the amount character and timing of the recognition of gains or losses from the affected straddle positions will be determined under rules that vary according to the elections made the rules applicable under certain of the elections may operate to accelerate the recognition of gains or losses from the affected straddle positions because the straddle rules may affect the character of gains or losses defer losses andor accelerate the recognition of gains or losses from the affected straddle positions the amount which may be distributed to shareholders and which will be taxed to them as ordinary income or longterm capital gain may be increased or decreased as compared to a fund that did not engage in such hedging transactions notwithstanding any of the foregoing a fund may recognize gain but not loss from a constructive sale of certain appreciated financial positions if that fund enters into a short sale offsetting notional principal contract or futures or forward contract transaction with respect to the appreciated position or substantially identical property appreciated financial positions subject to this constructive sale treatment are interests including options futures and forward contracts and short sales in stock partnership interests certain actively traded trust instruments and certain debt instruments constructive sale treatment does not apply to certain transactions closed prior to the end of the  th day after the close of the taxable year if certain conditions are met    investments in securities of uncertain tax character a fund may invest in preferred securities or other securities the us federal income tax treatment of which may not be clear or may be subject to recharacterization by the irs to the extent the tax treatment of such securities or the income from such securities differs from the tax treatment expected by a fund it could affect the timing or character of income recognized by that fund requiring the fund to purchase or sell securities or otherwise change its portfolio in order to comply with the tax rules applicable to regulated investment companies under the code investment in nonus securities investment income that may be received by a fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to foreign taxes withheld at the source the united states has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries which entitle a fund to a reduced rate of or exemption from taxes on such income if more than  of the value of a funds total assets at the close of the taxable year consists of stock or securities of foreign corporations that fund may elect to pass through to its shareholders the amount of foreign taxes paid by that fund if a fund so elects each shareholder would be required to include in gross income even though not actually received his or her pro rata share of the foreign taxes paid by that fund but would be treated as having paid his or her pro rata share of such foreign taxes and would therefore be allowed to either deduct such amount in computing taxable income or use such amount subject to various code limitations as a foreign tax credit against federal income tax but not both for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation rules of the code each shareholder would treat as foreign source income his or her pro rata share of such foreign taxes plus the portion of dividends received from that fund representing income derived from foreign sources no deduction for foreign taxes could be claimed by an individual shareholder who does not itemize deductions in certain circumstances a shareholder that i has held shares of a fund for less than a specified minimum period during which it is not protected from risk of loss or ii is obligated to make payments related to the dividends will not be allowed a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes deemed imposed on dividends paid on such shares additionally a fund must also meet this holding period requirement with respect to its foreign stocks and securities in order for creditable taxes to flowthrough each shareholder should consult his or her own tax adviser regarding the potential application of foreign tax credits foreign currency transactions under section  of the code gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time that fund actually collects such income or receivables or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or loss similarly gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts and the disposition of debt securities denominated in a foreign currency to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates are also treated as ordinary income or loss investments in real estate investment trusts a fund may invest in us reits that hold residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits remics or which are or have certain whollyowned subsidiaries that are taxable mortgage pools under a notice issued by the irs the code and treasury regulations to be issued a portion of a funds income from a us reit that is attributable to the reits residual interest in a remic or possibly equity interests in a taxable mortgage pool referred to in the code as an excess inclusion will be subject to federal income tax in all events these regulations are also expected to provide that excess inclusion income of a regulated investment company such as a fund will be allocated to shareholders of the regulated investment company in proportion to the dividends received by such shareholders with the same consequences as if the shareholders held the related remic residual interest or if applicable taxable mortgage pool directly in general excess inclusion income allocated to shareholders i cannot be offset by net operating losses subject to a limited exception for certain thrift institutions ii will constitute unrelated business taxable income to entities including a qualified pension plan an individual retirement account a k plan a keogh plan or other taxexempt entity subject to tax on unrelated business income thereby potentially requiring such an entity that is allocated excess inclusion income and otherwise might not be required to file a tax return to file a tax return and pay tax on such income and iii in the case of a foreign shareholder will not qualify for any reduction in us federal withholding tax in addition if at any time during any taxable year a disqualified organization as defined in the code is a record holder of a share in a regulated investment company then the regulated investment company will be subject to a tax equal to that portion of its excess inclusion income for the taxable year that is allocable to the disqualified organization multiplied by the highest federal income tax rate imposed on corporations the notice imposes certain reporting requirements upon regulated investment companies that have excess inclusion income the advisor does not intend to invest a substantial portion of any funds assets in us reits which generate excess inclusion income passive foreign investment companies a fund may invest in shares of foreign corporations that may be classified under the code as passive foreign investment companies pfics in general a foreign corporation is classified as a pfic if at least onehalf of the average value of its assets held during the taxable year constitute investmenttype assets or  or more of its gross income is investmenttype income if a fund receives a socalled excess distribution with respect to pfic stock that fund itself may be subject to a tax on a portion of the excess distribution whether or not the corresponding income is distributed by the fund to shareholders in general under the pfic rules an excess distribution is treated as having been realized ratably over the period during which a fund held the pfic shares a fund will itself be subject to tax on the portion if any of an excess distribution that is so allocated to prior fund taxable years and an interest factor will be added to the tax as if the tax had been payable in such prior taxable years certain distributions from a pfic as well as gain from the sale of pfic shares are treated as excess distributions excess distributions are characterized as ordinary income even though absent application of the pfic rules certain excess distributions might have been classified as capital gain    a fund may be eligible to elect alternative tax treatment with respect to pfic shares under an election that currently is available in some circumstances a fund would be required to include in its gross income its share of the earnings of a pfic on a current basis regardless of whether distributions were received from the pfic in a given year if this election were made the special rules discussed above relating to the taxation of excess distributions would not apply in addition another election would involve marking to market a funds pfic shares at the end of each taxable year with the result that unrealized gains would be treated as though they were realized and reported as ordinary income any markedtomarket losses and any loss from an actual disposition of pfic shares would be deductible as ordinary losses to the extent of any net markedtomarket gains included in income in prior years under either election a fund might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be included in determining the amount of income which the fund must distribute to maintain its status as a regulated investment company and to avoid the payment of federal income tax and the  excise tax dividends from a pfic and certain other foreign corporations are not eligible for treatment as qualified dividend income see distributions above for a discussion regarding the taxation of qualified dividend income certain other antideferral rules could apply to the extent a fund owes  or more of the voting powers of the voting stock of a controlled foreign corporation backup withholding a fund may be required to withhold us federal income tax on all taxable distributions payable to shareholders who fail to provide that fund with their correct taxpayer identification number or to make required certifications or who have been notified by the irs that they are subject to backup withholding corporate shareholders and certain other shareholders specified in the code generally are exempt from such backup withholding backup withholding is not an additional tax any amounts withheld may be credited against the shareholders us federal income tax liability foreign shareholders us taxation of income from a fund to a shareholder who as to the united states is a nonresident alien individual a foreign trust or estate a foreign corporation or foreign partnership foreign shareholder depends on whether the income of that fund is effectively connected with a us trade or business carried on by the shareholder income not effectively connected  if the income from a fund is not effectively connected with a us trade or business carried on by the foreign shareholder distributions of investment company taxable income will generally be subject to a us tax of  or lower treaty rate except in the case of any excess inclusion income allocated to the shareholder see taxationinvestments in real estate investment trusts above which tax is generally withheld from such distributions capital gain dividends and any amounts retained by a fund which are designated as undistributed capital gains will not be subject to us tax at the rate of  or lower treaty rate unless the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual and is physically present in the united states for more than  days during the taxable year and meets certain other requirements however this  tax on capital gains of nonresident alien individuals who are physically present in the united states for more than the day period only applies in exceptional cases because any individual present in the united states for more than  days during the taxable year is generally treated as a resident for us income tax purposes in that case he or she would be subject to us income tax on his or her worldwide income at the graduated rates applicable to us citizens rather than the  us withholding tax in the case of a foreign shareholder who is a nonresident alien individual a fund may be required to withhold us income tax on distributions of net capital gains unless the foreign shareholder certifies his or her nonus status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption generally by providing an internal revenue service form wben if a fund is a us real property holding corporation or would be but for the operation of certain exclusions distributions by the fund attributable to gains from us real property interests realized on account of certain capital gain dividends from us reits will generally cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing such gain as income effectively connected to a trade or business within the united states subject to the rules described below for effectively connected income generally a fund is required to withhold at a  rate on a distribution to a foreign shareholder attributable to such gains from us real property interests and such a distribution may subject a foreign shareholder to a us tax filing obligation and may create a branch profits tax liability for foreign corporate shareholders under a de minimis exception to the rule described above if a foreign shareholder has not held more than  of a funds shares at any time during the oneyear period ending on the date of the distribution the foreign shareholder is not treated as receiving a distribution attributable to gains from us real property interests but is instead treated as receiving an ordinary distribution subject to us tax at the rate of  or lower treaty rate    any gain that a foreign shareholder realizes upon the sale or exchange of such shareholders shares of a fund will ordinarily be exempt from us tax unless i in the case of a shareholder that is a nonresident alien individual the gain is us source income and such shareholder is physically present in the united states for more than  days during the taxable year and meets certain other requirements or ii at any time during the shorter of the period during which the foreign shareholder held shares of the fund and the fiveyear period ending on the date of the disposition of those shares the fund was a us real property holding corporation and the foreign shareholder actually or constructively held more than  of the shares of the fund in which event described in ii at any time during the shorter of the period during which the foreign shareholder held such shares of the fund and the fiveyear period ending on the date of the disposition of those shares the fund was a us real property holding corporation and the foreign shareholder actually or constructively held more than  of the funds shares in the latter event the gain would be taxed in the same manner as for a us shareholder as discussed above a corporation is a us real property holding corporation if the fair market value of its us real property interests equals or exceeds  of the fair market value of such interests plus its interests in real property located outside the united states plus any other assets used or held for use in a business in the case of a fund us real property interests include interests in stock in us real property holding corporations other than stock of a reit controlled by us persons and holdings of  or less in the stock of publicly traded us real property holding corporations and certain participating debt securities foreign shareholders that engage in certain wash sale andor substitute dividend payment transactions the effect of which is to avoid the receipt of distributions from the fund that would be treated as gain effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be treated as having received such distributions all shareholders of a fund should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rule income effectively connected  if the income from a fund is effectively connected with a us trade or business carried on by a foreign shareholder then distributions of investment company taxable income and capital gain dividends any amounts retained by the fund which are designated as undistributed capital gains and any gains realized upon the sale or exchange of shares of the fund will be subject to us income tax at the graduated rates applicable to us citizens residents and domestic corporations foreign corporate shareholders may also be subject to the branch profits tax imposed by the code the tax consequences to a foreign shareholder entitled to claim the benefits of an applicable tax treaty may differ from those described herein foreign shareholders are advised to consult
