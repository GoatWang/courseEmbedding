management at its best northwestern mutual life insurance company is one of the biggest scammers out there today i was a student attending the university of dubuque when i started looking for an internship northwestern mutual was supposedly a highly rated company that had a highly rated internship program my interview consisted of interigating me on every person i knew and they basically wanted me to come in and set up appointments with my friends and family so they could harrass them to buy more insurance i then did further research after my interview and talked to a couple classmates who had participated in their internship program  by the way was amazing how many people this company interviewed with everybody every and i mean every person i talked to said their trainer went in and pushed their friends and family and did hard sales with their horrible insurance programs i was even more shocked when i found out their savings programs inside their insurance policies were even a bigger scam then their so called internship program did you know that when their clients die northwestern mutual keeps their savings account tell me how a savings account at all benefits a client that when they die their family loses it rip off rip off rip off they had no interest in training me and simply wanted to use my name when they called individuals that i knew to sell them garbage at that i advise you stay as far away from this company as you can this report was posted on ripoff report on   am and is a permanent record located here

when my husband was diagnosed with cancer and we knew he was terminal one of the things on his bucket list was to take the grandkids to disney world  we had not met them before and this would have been the first time we saw them because my son had moved to colorado from florida  we didnt have the funds for this type of trip so i cashed in my life insurance policy for what it was worth  they did not ask me a thousand questions the rep said it was my money to with what i wanted  we got my sons family to disney and were on our way from key west to orlando to meet them and have a great vacationfamily reunion  my husband didnt make it  half way up he went into crisis and was gone  days later  my husband passed away from kidney cancer caused by cigarette smoking  i was bedside when he passed and was a complete absolute mess  when i called nwm to report his passing the live person i spoke with not a computer was nothing but compassionate patient and knowledgable  they took their time with me and helped me file the final claim  i continue to have a ploicy for my mother and i took out a new policy on myself i know when the time comes this company will not play games with our benificiaries   respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  update exemployee responds just to set some myths aside author justtryingtohelp   submitted thursday july   posted thursday july    i had to jump in because of so many misinterprutations  i have worked in financial for years and years and years  interned with nwm and they do a great job of informing their employees on all the benefits of using their products and how great they are  the problem is they never talk about the other options that are out there and what is best for the client  right away they teach you that a whole life policy is the best thing ever and that they have the best one  half true  i think they do have one of the best out there but they only make sense for a small chunk of people  problem is they recommend it to everyone  the interest is not fixed and is based off of the performance of the company  in that aspect all your doing in a while life policy is buying nwm stock and collecting the everchanging dividend without growth of the asset itself  then you take insurance fees out which they will never discuss but are necessary  so at the end of the day take out maybe  if your young and  if your old from your cash value every year so your really earning some fraction of that dividend  now take your loan out from the cash and pay an interest rate on the loan taken from the remaining cash value  again depleting your savings from what i have seen you would have been better off buying a tax free bond or bond fund or just investing regularly if the goal is to save money  use insurance companies for insurance banks for banking accountants for taxes and investment firms for investments  use common sense  would you let an oncologist do neurosurgery or your kidney specialist repair your spine  no  respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  general comment growup author timmy   submitted friday february   posted friday february   are you serious you know nothing about insurance so youre throwing northwestern under the bus in all sales situations its about who do you know sale at an insurance company and this one is northwestern start with family and friends see if there is a need if none move onto the next one you failed at northwestern many people do youre not cutout for sales take a salaried postion earn yr and struggle to pay your bills for the rest of your life or grow up and learn how to sell something  respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  update exemployee responds i was in the intern program too it was great author tim s   submitted saturday january   posted saturday january   i read this report simply because in the late s i was in nmls college agent program the ignorance of this claim against nml was so vast as to be exhausting it is a saturday night and i would much rather be relaxing instead there is this monumentally sad attempt to harm a good company doing a little reading between the lines here i can make a few guesses one i doubt you listened to the training if you did you did not understand it nor care for the discipline involved in being a saver or an agent two you probably found it difficult to make money even if the commissions are what they were then you probably did not make money the tone of the complaint makes it hard for me to imagine that you had the ear of too many people on matters as important as how to save money long term provide needed death benefits or even why savings and investments are completely different animals i have not worked for northwestern mutual for decades but the business lessons and experiences i gained as an intern are invaluable to me even today at this late date i know of five companies i would trust to put my permanent life insurance needs and northwestern mutual and its practices are designed to protect policy holders within the paramenters of providing maximum benefits with maximum dividend performance that is a complex set of responsibilities northwest mutual has my continued respect as do their training programs that i went through tim s respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment northwester mutual response author sjweiss   submitted thursday november   posted thursday november   i read you scathing review about nm and thought to myself what a snivily nosed putz  nms internship program is one of the best of its kind  of the best reps in the company  were college interns that went on to success as a financial advisor with nm  truly huge opportunity  calling on friends and family is a place to start any sales position  depending on the manager that is mentoring the intern would depend on the approach style and subsequently the pressure to buy  regarding the products it is quite obvious that the person i am replying to has no real concept or understanding of how the products actually work  just an education provided by an anti whole life stock broker who will always bash any cash value product as being bad  this is just not true especially in the case of nm  their cash values are  better than the next closest competitor over the pats  years  i am sure the individual who wrote this report went on to a salaried position earning less than  per year with very little growth potential no wonder he is bitter  respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment northwest read the fine print redux author curmudgeon   submitted friday october   posted friday october   after filing my initial report i discovered that i had misinterpreted the northwest mutual statement saying that they had deducted  from my account  in reality the statement which is unclear says that the account that replaced my moneymarket account has a penalty for early withdrawal that decreases with time  the k figure is for early withdrawal and is wholly theoretical i dont intend to withdraw from the account early  my apologies for the confusion for the most part i am very satisfied with my experience with northwest mutual respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment nwm read all the fine print author curmudgeon   submitted tuesday october   posted tuesday october   my wife and i went to northwest mutual several years ago to look into longterm care insurance  long story short the representative discovered that we werent satisfied with the performance of our retirement investments and over several months talked us into several things that i now regret  whenever i brought in statements with questions this person insisted that i should simply throw out the statements and leave everything to him  he did a great job of explaining things with powerpoint slides and complex summaries that showed how well our account was doing  but doubts always rose their ugly heads a night or two after a consultation one k investment at nwm turned out to be a moneymarket account that was earning minus per year after all of the fees were deducted  when i challenged the wisdom of this account i was told that as retirees we needed to have conservative investments especially in trying financial times  after insisting that the moneymarket account be closed we were told that nwm would out of the goodness of their heart make a onetime exception to their rules and at my request reinvest the funds in a more risky account something our nwm advisor told us was almost unheard of  since the money was going from one nwm account into another i assumed the change would be free or that any charges would be nominal  our next statement however showed a withdrawal charge of more than   we were neither informed orally nor in writing that such a charge would occur  im sure a withdrawal charge is stated somewhere in the mountains of fine print we received from the company but i havent found it yet  my wife and i dont claim to be well prepared to understand the complexities of modern financial products  however we do expect that our money will be skillfully invested by the professionals of a major financial institution  northwest mutual claims to be a financial services and wealth management company its on their letterhead  i assumed we could trust them to look out for our interests while making a fair return on the money they invest  but this example and others that are too complex to explain here suggest otherwise  if youre in the same boat be sure you ask lots of questions and read everything before signing on the dotted line  im very serious about thatdont sign anything until you fully understand it and have asked lots of questions  if you dont understand it then you should find another company to handle your money respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment ripoffsurvivor author exripoffsurvivor   submitted sunday september   posted sunday september   hello friends i must add my own perspective regarding whole term life insurance there are many empassioned responses defending the honesty and sanctity of whole term life policies and how great northwest mutual is well to this i say rubbish here is why in some aspects whole term life insurance may be a reasonable investment if you truly understand what you are getting into and realized when your net cash value will break even etc however certain representatives eg christopher hahn a bloated clown who was voted best financial rep for  such jilted self serving awards made by vultures for vultures for instance prey upon the financially ignorant  and use very aggressive  even bullshit scare tactics to get their victim to sign up so in essence they are financial predators case closed believe me  this is only my experience some  yrs ago and actually when i woke up was lucky enough to cancel the policy at not such a significant loss i could go on and on about unscrupulous procedural techniques eg isolating the victim not talking to anyone else but you  so as to avoid more experienced questions saying that a decision had to be made within  day as this was a special offer etc etcbut ultimately i would just tell the newbies out there eg just out of academia greener than green when it comes to whole life be aware how much they are asking you to invest really look at the ridiculous premiums paid out compared to term insurance realize opportunity cost of this vs immediate tax advantages of a k and lastly realize how long they will have you put money into a hole hoping some day it will pay out with actually only guaranteeing not even a  return  if that  perhaps just your principal minus fees essentially be prepared that this is a long term investment eg dont expect to even break even until  years or more if you do the math for a yr  policy you will be horrified at the money you put into it vs what you get out lastly while again in less aggressive ways this could make sense in terms of a small policy however i know for a fact that these st suckers aggressively target individuals who are just out of shool or new to the area with little or no experience lastly however it is upto you to be strong because ultimately there is nobody to truly blame but yourself for being talked into something without complete understanding  years later i am so much better off for it that in certain regards i should thank assholes like this for burning me because my knowledge savy and wisdom took off exponentially and now i can retire if i wanted to burn me once great it is how you dust yourself off and learn from mistakes and become all the better good luck people  nobody and everybody who just tries to make their way respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  general comment northwest mutual is drunk on their own koolaid author denverstrings   submitted monday april   posted monday april   i have about  years of experience in the insurancesecurities industry and i truly feel sorry for anyone who does business with northwest mutual their products are horribly priced and generally outdated  dividends sounds great until you realize youre paying literally x as much in premium as you would be in a modern iul plus their sales force are a bunch of sharks and ive had multiple clients tell me about being offered rebates from nw agents if they sign up meaning the agents offered to pay the premiums of the policy for  months which is unethical and illegal their financial ratings are sound largely because they are robbing you on the premiums they charge inevitably this will provoke nw agents to start posting responses about the dividend payouts but the bottom line is when you do the math their whole life policies are screwing you you can get the same taxdeferred growth and even more competitive returns through axa equitables vul or national life group or north americans iul products for  of the premium contribution plus all of the above named companies offer long term care provisions that allow clients to access death benefits in a life policy for ltc purposes trust me if a nw mutual agent offers to buy you lunch so he can introduce you to what he does politely decline their products are a joke and they love to dangle the dividends in front of you but theyre only telling a very small part of the whole story which is that theyll rob you in the process and sell you an outdated product northwest mutual whole life is like buying a nokia brick cell phone in  respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment clarification author anonymous  united states of america submitted tuesday december   posted tuesday december   savings accounts  are you talking about whole life insurance cash value  normally theres a selection in the application process whereby the client can select whether or not heshe wants the death benefit plus the cash value for an extra cost in premium  the insurance company figures that you want the greater of the death benefit or the cash value  the death benefit is usually greater  instead of paying the insurance company why not buy term and some perm for the insurance need  term remember pays a claim only  of all policies in force  therefore the perm is useful to pay expenses as its permanent and will be there when your client dies  respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment excellent experience with northwestern mutual author bqgetm  united states of america submitted tuesday may   posted tuesday may   im an advertising sales professional  truly appreciate everything that northwestern mutual has done for me with respect to planning my retirement its been incredibly difficult to weed through all of the options that are out there when it comes to retirement my northwestern rep started out in the same internship program youve mentioned in your report but had a very different experience im not sure what sort of a career you plan to go into but if you intend to go into any type of selling job youll need to know how to work your friends  family to your advantage i feel that my whole life policy from northwestern is a great fallback investment in addition to my k roth ira which i can no longer contribute to social security and cash savings i understand that without an extensive knowledge of finances it would be difficult for an intern to see the value of a longterm guaranteed investment such as a whole life insurance policy there are several advantages to it  a whole life policy grows at a guaranteed  interest rate over the term of my policy i will pay in roughly  however at my paidup date it will be worth k  i can withdraw against a whole life policy when im older without paying income tax that makes it better than a savings account and generally speaking better than a k taxfree when you contribute but taxed at normal rates upon withdrawal but slightly worse than a roth ira which is taxed precontribution but taxfree at withdrawal the downside to a roth ira is that you can only contribute up to k annually until you earn a salary of k or greater once you earn that large of a salary your contributions are limited even further and ultimately eliminated at an income of k leaving your only true taxfree at distribution retirement option to be a whole life insurance policy is your post suggesting that northwestern doesnt deserve to earn a profit for helping millions of americans retire comfortably theyre currently one of the highest rated financial services firms in the country and they do it all without public relations  branding advertising youve surely heard of companies like charles schwab td ameritrade bank of americamerrill lynch scottrade etrade ing direct etc  the bottom line is this you should really be investing in nearly every type of retirement investment you possibly can youll almost always be better off just imagine if the millions of folks who were deeply invested in their companys k had been a bit more diversified in  when their retirement plans lost  of their value in the stock market crash if they had even  of their investments secured in whole life insurance policies they wouldnt have been hurt nearly as badly a small very small portion of the job crunch has also been caused by the lack of retirement thats happening in the workplace as a result of these losses see this report from before the recession hit which shows that fewer than half of all americans expect to be able to retire comfortably  this was  months before the market crashed ror redacted and this from more recently november  which points out that employers will have a tough time facilitating the promotion of younger employees who want to get ahead

submitted saturday february   posted saturday february   i bought a whole life policy from northwestern mutual when i was in college  years ago since then i have purchased an additional whole life policy and a northwestern annuity as well in addition to the stocks bonds and collectibles i own i consider my nwm policies to be very valuable assets if you dont think nwm whole life polices are terrific investments then it would appear to me that you dont fully understand life insurance i have found nwm representives my personal agents and customer service to be highly trained professional and very service oriented respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment quick rebuttal of unfair and inaccurate report author bigdancehawk  united states of america submitted friday november   posted friday november   i have owned four northwestern mutual life insurance policies for many years and my experience with the company has been entirely positive when i bought these insurance policies i did extensive research and ran the numbers this company along with new york life and mass mutual came out on top they pay great dividends and have been doing so for a very long time theyve been in business for over  years they will be paying out  billion in dividends next year the second highest amount in company history and more than the next two highest paying companies combined they are one of only a handful companies with a a rating from am best does that sound like a rip off company selling a garbage product i have had dealings with two of their reps and they have never pushed me to buy anything or given me a hard sell the original reports comments about the savings program being a scam are simply ridiculous and show a basic lack of understanding about how life insurance works respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  update exemployee responds northwestern mutual author don  united states of america submitted friday january   posted friday january   to the person who is talking bad about nwm they are so incorrect  every insurance company does this but i have to say that i have friend who work for nwm and they do not push their clients at all  he says their training is great and will always be able to use it if they do not suceed  what i find funny is that everyone really does need life insurance especially if you have a family  its not expensive and well worth it for sure   the savings account is used if they need to borrow from it that is all  it is not a bank  this money is put aside at a low interest rate if they need to borrow it while they are alive  all insurance companies have that program  if you purchase that type of insurance wholie lifepermn life that is how it is with all companies  i worked for allstate and our insurance products are the same  respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  update employee would say that nml is the greatest company on the market today author marty  united states of america submitted tuesday december   posted tuesday december   i have been in the insurance business for over  years from running my own company and to selling to a larger corporation been on the independent side general agent side and now part of nml the first statement is this company in every regards puts the client first you will find out they have their policy holders every year do their own audit of the company and their practices name another company allowing this today to my knowledge their is no top  company doing it next take their conservative stance to underwriting and you will see in their large dividend pay outs to policy holders a large portion comes from great underwriting now as a representative this can be frustrating when you have a president or key employee you want to insure and the company will not insure them due to medical issues but it is in the policy holders best interest to only take risk in their best interest  the policy holderowners of the company do come first yes owners a mutual company is owned by the policy holders they do not have to show the big profits to share holders but only to the ownerspolicy holders the company will also not tolerate representatives that due not follow their strict guide lines of professional representation i have seen them fire a large producer for not following the rules as defined by them their are no exceptions to these rules in other companies i have seen the old saying of production hides the sins not here if you do not keep records of your sales in a compliant manner and do what is best for the client you will be looking for a job    as a old time representative it was hard for me to do all their required education and record keeping but now after a short time it has paid off if a client questions something i can go into our system and show them my dictations of the meeting and most of the time back it up with letters or emails explaining what we did an why so you can teach an old dog new trick     our system is set up like a doctors would operate when we see a client we find their needs and desires for their future and their families goals  dreams we explore the what ifs that are so hard for most people to talk about unless someone like myself comes to them as an advocate for their kids or spouse in a role as the advocate we are the voice for the ones with out one we are the ones that help a person provide for their family for the unexpected things in life no one expects to die early or become disabled when it does happen they are always blessed when they did the responsible thing and took care of their family for those issues yes i said responsible because it is our job to provide for our family in those times of need when we have a child and do not take out disability or life insurance on our life it is a disservice as a parent almost child abuse at times would you want your child in foster care because you did not have life insurance when you and your spouse died before your time i know with my family and friends it would be hard to see their family suffer because i did not do my job and ask the hard questions you insure your house so why would you not insure your families most important asset you    in closing i will say that if you do not care for your family and friends then stay the path of not doing the responsible thing and sharing the need of life insurance and disability insurance with them this is a selfless act to provide for your families needs at a premature death or disability in looking at companies you will not find a better company financially or ethically this is coming from a guy that has been around for many years in this business also from my personal life and seeing it pay off when a family member died a early death the money was their for the funeral and other cost needed it was there because i asked the hard question and showed the need and provided the solution these risk based products are a need for almost every individual but like other things in this country today we do not always do the responsible things to many people live for today and let others worry when their dead i have never had a widow say would you give me my savings part of the death benefits and you can keep the balance some people may pay a few hundred dollars in the so called savings part of their life insurance contract but receive millions back in the death benefit portion in some cases the savings part is completed with the disability waiver added to the policy so my question to you is are you going to be responsible and take care of your family and purchase the needed death and disability benefits or will you allow the state or government to provide for your family if you die or become a disabled if something happens to my family and friends i do not want to tell their children i did not do my job no i want to be able to say your parents loved you enough to do the right thing an protect you even if they were not here to do so them selves    if you need information on companies strength review the rating agencies of insurance companies if you need to make the correct financial decisions find a reputable insurance professional you can do back ground checks with most department of insurances and finra for securities checks do your home work and work with a professional you can always find the closest nml office and talk to them thanks for this chance to tell another side of the story from a insurance agent that is glad to help people with needs and responsibilities to take care of please be responsible when it comes to these matters from the ones with out a voice marty a northwestern mutual policy holder and representative  respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment rebuttal to northwestern mutual scam claimers author bigfoost  united states of america submitted wednesday december   posted wednesday december   first and foremost northwestern mutual does interview a lot of candidates especially for their internship program  i was part of that process when i started as an intern in january   lets look at this point first  northwestern has the reputation as the quiet company meaning that they dont spend a lot of their money on advertising in mass media  while this is changing now it is a great point for policy holders because the company is not spending its reserve funds on needless advertising  with that point in mind how many college students do you think have heard of northwestern mutual by actively seeking out insurance and investment advice or by seeing their commercials on tv  ill go out on a limb and say not a whole lot so for northwestern to bring new blood into the company they have to actively recruit competent talent  where to find these individuals with work ethic smarts and a drive to succeed thats right on college campuses  so yes they have to go out see people and find those with a passion to serve othersnumber two the hard sale of insurance products  the company culture of northwestern is not to sell anyone  it is to identify a need and make recommendations for that need  during the process of helping individuals build financial security there are many aspects a financial representative needs to cover  these areas include saving investing debt reduction and protecting a family with insurance products  out of these areas which do you think a college student could be competent enough to explain investment products or insurance coverage  in my opinion it is far easier to learn the basics of insurance than investment strategies risks and returns for savvy investors  not to mention that it would take much to long and no student would even try to obtain securities licenses for an internship  so we are left with interns getting a license for life insurance which is still part of a comprehensive financial plan and much easier to put into place than investmentsthe third point of northwestern keeping the cash value of a policy holder that dies is easy to rebut  yes they keep the cash value  thats right i said that they do indeed keep the cash value  but thats because the surviving family receives the death benefit  so now its time for an example  say john bought a  whole life permanent insurance policy  years ago  hypothetically the cash in the policy is  and the face value death benefit has gone up to  anyone with working knowledge of permanent insurance knows that cash value increases as well as the death benefit barring any tweeks made by the policy owner that would keep these at a level amount  john has lived a long life and passes leaving the  death benefit to his family  northwestern keeps the  in cash value and premiums paid in  if you could explain how getting k is better than getting the cash of k is better please go ahead  now some would say why dont they get both  i would say to that how in the world would a company stay in business if it paid the death claim and all cash in the policy  there would be no way to sustain the company if the only payment they ever got was premium  last no one who uses the policy exclusively for the death benefit is concerned with the savings aspect  younger people will like the savings aspect and can use the cash throughout their lifetime and should do so based on their specific goals  if the savings is a rip off please show me another asset that draws a  return current northwestern dividend on a tax deferred basis with no early withdrawal penalty  it cant be found  but to get interesting lets try  savings account  hahahaha if youre lucky a  return  congratulations you lost out to inflation  cds  again  return taxed  still losing to inflation  bond portfolio  in this day in age still at  with junk bonds taxed so that the real return is below  and if it is inside iras there are early withdrawal penalties  iras and k  great place for long term saving  they will get you the best returns with the right asset allocation but if you want that money before you are  you will pay taxes and penalties  so you tell me what asset gives you great return defers taxes and has many options to use the money tax free and is accessible to you at any time you got itlife insurance through northwestern mutualnow as far as them contacting family and friends who else would you know to contact and have such an important conversation with  yes thats right you would have rather called on executives partners in law firms engineers etc because they would have certainly taken a college student seriously  you have to start in your natural market let them see the value you bring and then be referred out to other individuals  there shouldnt be a problem talking with your family and in fact those should be the most important conversations you have  consider your family not having the right amount of life coverage or none at all  most likely a premature death would devastate the family be it a parent child or primary wage earner  i can say from experience that  of the people i have talked with dont have adequate coverage based on what they would want to have covered if they passed prematurely  if you didnt talk with them about life insurance no one probably ever would which would be a sad tragedy  talk with a few financial reps financial advisors or even friends and family members and see if you cant come up with some stories of families or individuals devastated by a lack of life coverage  it is just as important if not more than the investing part  if you can come up with someone who has never heard of or known a person affected by losing a loved one too soon then you can bash life insurance all you like  but i will venture that you cant find someone like thatin closing life insurance is vital no matter who you get it through  but if you are going to purchase something so important why not go through the best company  by best i am pointing to northwestern mutual who has the strongest financial ratings across the board with a positive future outlook  they are in fact the only insurance company with those ratings and one of only a handful of any type of company in the world with those ratings  so it makes sense why they are so beloved even when there is misunderstood slander put out by people on sites like these  for those that would like to rebut the ratings feel free to look at the four large ratings firms and see where northwestern ranks  new york life will claim the strongest ratings also but they have a negative outlook which indicates they will soon be downgraded leaving northwestern alone at the top respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either

you work hard to provide a good life for your family and youd do anything to protect them but what would happen to them financially if you died tomorrow if the answer troubles you then you need life insurance life insurance provides a safety net tomorrow for the loved ones who depend on you today but where should you start there are two main types of coverage are available term life and permanent life insurance the first step is to decide which of these suits you best term vs permanent life insurance term life insurance covers you for a certain period such as   or  years buyers typically choose a policy that covers them until their mortgages and other debts are paid off or the kids have graduated from college and are living independently term life is fairly straightforward compared to permanent life and its less expensive than a permanent life policy the average cost of a year  term life policy for a healthy yearold is about  a year roughly the cost of one latte per week according to limra and the life foundation a term life policy pays out if you die during the term while the coverage is in effect then your beneficiary collects the proceeds called the death benefit you cant cash in the policy while youre still alive with term life you risk buying something that your family might never end up using but in return you gain the peace of mind of knowing theyd be ok if you died unexpectedly permanent life insurance such as whole life or universal life covers you for the rest of your life the policy pays the death benefit to your beneficiary whether you die tomorrow or in  years permanent life insurance also includes an investment component known as cash value the cash value of the policy starts off small and then gradually grows taxfree if you hold onto the policy for many years the cash account becomes a nest egg you can borrow from the cash value  the policy stays in effect as long as you repay the money plus interest  or surrender the policy for the cash because of its cash value and lifelong coverage permanent life insurance is pricier and more complex than term life some policies even provide longterm care benefits which type of life insurance should you buy choose term life insurance if you need coverage only until a certain age say the age when your youngest child graduates college have no dependents who will need financial help for the rest of their lives dont own a family business or have a large estate to protect want the most affordable type of coverage available choose permanent life insurance if you want to provide for lifelong dependents such as a child with special needs need to protect a large estate or family business from estate taxes want to leave a legacy want to provide loved ones with money for your final expenses such as medical bills and funeral costs no matter when you die how much life insurance should you buy beware of easy formulas such as multiplying your annual income by a certain number instead do a thorough needs analysis determine how much your family would need to pay your final expenses such as funeral costs and how much your loved ones would need over the long haul to maintain their quality of life consider big expenses such as paying off the mortgage and other debts and funding your childrens college educations both parents should be insured  not just the primary breadwinner to determine the amount of insurance for a stayathome parent consider how much it would cost to replace the services that parent provides such as day care and other household tasks dont assume your group life insurance through work will provide all the coverage you need most group life policies are small and the coverage ends when your job ends roughly four in  insured married people depend solely on group life policies according to limra life insurance rates life insurance premiums vary according to the type of policy amount of coverage and the insurer as well as your age and health thats why its important to buy coverage sooner rather than later the longer you wait the higher the premiums will be and the greater the risk that you could develop a health condition that will disqualify you from coverage besides comparing policies evaluate insurance companies insurecoms best life insurance companies tool can help you sort through leading companies based on their customers’ reviews unsure

a comprehensive discussion of these risks in the attached mutual fund prospectuses   policy for longterm protection your policy is designed to serve your need for longterm life insurance protection it is not a suitable vehicle for shortterm goals we have not designed the policy for frequent trading   policy lapse your policy will lapse if you do not pay sufficient premium to keep it in force favorable investment experience may reduce the required premium but we do not guarantee investment experience policy loans or withdrawals may increase the premium required to keep the policy in force

years we permit withdrawals only if the excess amount is sufficient the minimum amount for a withdrawal is  a maximum of four withdrawals is permitted per policy year a partial surrender or withdrawal will reduce the death benefit   adverse tax consequences our understanding of the principal tax considerations for the policy under current tax law is set forth in this prospectus there are areas of some uncertainty under current law and we do not address the likelihood of future changes in the law or interpretations thereof among other risks your policy may become a modified endowment contract if the total amount of premiums you have paid exceeds a defined limit surrenders withdrawals and loans under the policy will then be taxable as ordinary income to the extent there are earnings in the policy and a  penalty will apply to these distributions moreover if excessive    policy loans cause a policy to terminate or if the policy otherwise lapses out of force before the insured dies a tax liability may arise as a result with little if any value in the policy with which to pay the liability see tax treatment of policy benefits   fee and expense tables   the following tables describe

additional protection in an integrated policy design the minimum guaranteed death benefit represents permanent life insurance guaranteed for the lifetime of the insured if premiums are paid when due and no policy debt is outstanding the additional protection is guaranteed for a period of years which depends on the sex and risk classification and age of the insured when the policy is issued and the relative proportions of minimum guaranteed death benefit and additional protection for an insured aged less than  the guaranteed period is not less than ten years the guaranteed period is stated in the policy it is generally longer for younger insureds and shorter for insureds who are older but will not be less than six years or more than  years   we place net premiums in the account divisions you select the net premiums increase the policy value the policy value is the cumulative amount invested adjusted for investment results reduced any charges including the cost of insurance which is based on the net amount at risk this is the amount of insurance in force less the policy value the cost of insurance also reflects the attained age of the insured each year if you pay premiums when they are due and investment experience is favorable the policy value will increase year by year   we have designed the policy so that the increase in policy value over time should reduce the net amount at risk the reduction in the net amount at risk offsets the rising cost of the mortality risk as the age of the insured increases reducing the total cost of insurance which we subtract from the policy value each year this scenario depends however on the investment experience of your investments which is a principal factor in determining policy value investment experience is not guaranteed if investment experience does not produce a sufficient rate of return the amount of additional protection will be reduced in later policy years or you will need to pay additional premium to keep the additional protection from falling   for a typical policy the average annual net investment rate of return required to maintain the initial amount of additional protection without additional premium should be between  and  based on the current charges and dividend scale you may request a sales illustration to show the impact on the additional protection of a particular average annual net investment rate of return see illustrations any excess policy value excess amount is simply added to the death benefit and the cash value dollar for dollar unless a greater increase in the death benefit is required to meet tax requirements for life insurance see excess amount and tax treatment of policy benefits   the policy also allows you to pay additional premiums to purchase variable paidup additional insurance we calculate the values for the additional insurance separately from those which support the initial amount of insurance the values for the variable paidup additional insurance do not affect the policy value we allow unscheduled additional premiums to purchase variable paidup additional insurance subject to insurability of the insured when we accept the premiums you may also pay additional premiums to increase the policy value   requirements for insurance   the minimum amount we require for the minimum guaranteed death benefit is  reduced to  if the insured is below age  or over age  if the initial premium is at least   for ages below  the required minimum for the minimum guaranteed death benefit is  a lower minimum also may apply in some other circumstances and will apply if the policy is    purchased for an employersponsored benefit plan see special policy for employers in all cases the minimum guaranteed death benefit must be at least    before issuing a policy we will require satisfactory evidence of insurability nonsmokers who meet underwriting requirements for the best three classifications are considered premier nt preferred nt and standard plus nt respectively the best two classes of smokers are considered premier t and preferred t respectively the premium depends in part on the risk classification we charge a higher premium for insureds who qualify as substandard risks ie for insureds who do not qualify for the risk classifications mentioned above the amount of extra premium depends in part on the risk classification in which we place the insured   for contracts issued prior to january   we used a different risk classification system risks which would be considered premier nt or preferred nt under the current system were called standard plus risks which would be considered premier t or preferred t under the current system were called standard   premiums   the policy provides for a level scheduled premium to be paid annually at the beginning of each policy year premiums are payable at our home office we accept premium payment by various means including check and electronic funds transfer eft   by administrative practice we accept premiums on a monthly quarterly or semiannual schedule and we permit premium payment under an authorized payment plan by electronic funds transfer from your bank if you pay premiums more frequently than annually we place the scheduled net annual premium in the account on each policy anniversary we advance this amount on this date and we are reimbursed as we receive your premium payments you have no obligation to repay the amount that we have advanced but failure to pay the premiums when due will cause a premium payments to be suspended subject to the conditions described later in this section b the policy to continue in force as a reduced amount of paidup insurance or c the policy to terminate if you do not pay premiums when they are due we will reduce the account assets supporting the policy to reflect the premiums due later in the policy year   premiums you pay other than on an annual basis are increased to  reflect the time value of money based on an  per annum interest rate and  cover the administrative costs to process the additional premium payments a monthly premium is currently equal to the annual premium times  plus  cents you may pay monthly premiums only through an automatic payment plan arranged with your bank a quarterly premium is currently equal to the annual premium times  plus  a semiannual premium is equal to the annual premium times  plus  for any frequency other than annual the annual percentage rate apr will depend on the amount of the annual premium and the premium payment frequency for monthly premiums the apr will be between  and  for quarterly premiums the apr will be between  and  for semiannual premiums the apr will be between  and  you may obtain information about apr calculations for premiums paid other than annually from your northwestern mutual financial representative the apr calculation is also available through wwwnmfncom the following table shows examples of

minimum guaranteed death benefit and the premium for any additional protection the amount of the premium depends on the amount of the minimum guaranteed death benefit and the amount of additional protection as well as the insureds age and risk classification the amount of the premium also reflects the sex of the insured except where state or federal law requires that premiums and other charges and values be determined without regard to sex we send a notice to you not less than two weeks before each premium is due    you may select the proportions of minimum guaranteed death benefit and additional protection subject to the required minimum amount for the minimum guaranteed death benefit see requirements for insurance policies that include additional protection are subject to a minimum premium that is equal to  of the premium for a policy that consists solely of minimum guaranteed death benefit the premium for the additional protection consists of two times the cost of term insurance for the insureds age when the policy was issued as long as this amount in combination with the premium for the minimum guaranteed death benefit meets the  requirement if this combination does not meet the  requirement the premium for additional protection is increased to bring the total up to the  level we apply the amount by which the premium is increased after deductions to increase the policy value in most cases we will also guarantee the additional protection for a longer period the premium rates for term insurance are set forth in the policy in addition to the premium required for the minimum guaranteed death benefit and any additional protection the scheduled premium may include additional premium to purchase paidup additional insurance or to increase the policy value the scheduled premium will also include the premium required for any additional benefit included as part of the policy   after the policy is issued we will reduce the additional premium included in the scheduled premium at any time upon your request you may increase the additional premium included in the scheduled premium or you may pay optional unscheduled additional premiums at any time before the policy anniversary nearest to the insureds th birthday subject to our insurability requirements and issue limits   if the policy includes additional protection we may require an increased premium after the guaranteed period to prevent a reduction of the amount of additional protection we determine the increased premium if required each year as of the date  days before the policy anniversary you are entitled to pay the increased premium required to keep the additional protection from falling until the insured reaches age  but this right terminates as of the first policy anniversary on which you do not pay the increased premium when it is due   you may suspend payment of scheduled premiums at your option if as of  days prior to the policy anniversary on or before the due date of the premium  the excess amount exceeds one years minimum premium and  the policy value exceeds the sum of the net single premium for the amount of insurance then in force plus the present value of future charges for expenses additional benefits and any extra mortality see excess amount the minimum premium is the sum of the premiums for the minimum guaranteed death benefit the additional protection and any additional benefit included in the policy we will calculate the net single premium and the present value of future charges using the mortality basis for the cost of insurance charges with  interest see charges against the policy value while payment of premiums is suspended certain charges ordinarily deducted from premiums will reduce the policy value instead these charges are set forth in your policy in the table of charges under premium suspension you may resume payment of scheduled premiums as of any policy anniversary you must resume payment of scheduled premiums as of the next policy anniversary if the excess amount as of  days prior to the policy anniversary is determined to be less than one years minimum premium you may pay unscheduled additional premiums while suspension of scheduled premiums is in effect subject to our insurability requirements and issue limits   the policy provides for a grace period of  days for any premium that is not paid when due the policy remains in force during this period if you pay a premium during the grace period the values for the policy will be the same as if you had paid the premium when it was due if you do not pay the premium within the grace period and the policy does not qualify for premium suspension the policy will terminate as of the date when the premium was due and will no longer be in force unless it is continued as paidup insurance see paidup insurance if you surrender a policy its cash value will be paid see cash value the following table shows representative annual premiums for a policy with

includes the minimum guaranteed death benefit any additional protection in effect any excess amount and any paidup additional insurance it is reduced by the amount of any policy debt outstanding and if premiums are not paid on an annual basis an adjustment for premiums used to purchase paidup additional insurance that are due later in the policy year   the minimum guaranteed death benefit you select when the policy is issued will neither increase nor decrease regardless of the investment experience of the account divisions where assets for the policy are held so long as you pay scheduled premiums when they are due and no policy debt is outstanding in setting the premium rates for the minimum guaranteed death benefit we have assumed that the account assets will grow at a net annual rate of  after the account charges and the expenses of the portfolios in which you invest see charges against the account assets we bear the risk that the rate of growth will be less a higher rate of growth results in an increase in the policy value   the additional protection included in a policy when it is issued will not increase by reason of investment experience more favorable than the assumed  net annual rate of growth it will not decrease regardless of investment experience until expiration of the guaranteed period so long as you pay scheduled premiums when they are due and no policy debt is outstanding a condition for this guarantee is that you must use any dividends paid on the policy to increase policy value unless the policy has an excess amount see excess amount after the guaranteed period the additional protection may be reduced unless the policy value exceeds the amount defined by the formula in the policy we calculate the amount of policy value and the amount of increased premium required to prevent a reduction in the additional protection  days before each policy anniversary you may pay any increased premium required to prevent a reduction in the additional protection each year until the policy anniversary nearest the insureds th birthday but this right terminates the first time you do not pay any required increased premium when it is due   the policy value represents the cumulative net premiums for the minimum guaranteed death benefit and the additional protection including any additional net premiums or policy dividends which have been used to increase the policy value adjusted for investment experience less the cost of insurance which we deduct from the policy value on each policy anniversary and any other charges the policy value may exceed the amount required to support the minimum guaranteed death benefit and the additional protection this may result from favorable investment experience or from additional premium or policy dividends used to increase the policy value the amount by which the policy value exceeds the amount needed to support the minimum guaranteed death benefit and the additional protection under a specified set of assumptions is called the excess amount see excess amount any excess amount will increase the death benefit for the policy dollarfordollar except as described in the next paragraph the policy value and any excess amount change daily   we have designed the policy to meet the definitional requirements for life insurance in section  of the internal revenue code see tax treatment of policy benefits these rules require that the death benefit will never be less than the policy value divided by the net single premium per dollar of death benefit the required difference between the death benefit and the policy value is higher at younger ages than at older ages the policy provides for an increase in the death benefit to the extent required to meet this test after the death benefit has been increased to meet this requirement an increase in the policy value will cause a greater than dollarfordollar increase in the death benefit and a decrease in the policy value will cause a greater than dollarfordollar decrease in the death benefit   the death benefit is increased by the amount of any paidup additional insurance purchased with additional premium or policy dividends the amount and value of the paidup additional insurance vary daily to reflect investment experience and are not guaranteed the amount of any paidup additional insurance is its value used as a net single premium at the attained age of the insured   death benefits will be paid under the payment plan that takes effect on the date of death of the insured available payment plans include an interest income plan installment income plans and life income plans the interest income plan will be in effect if no payment plan has been elected the policy owner may elect the payment plan while the insured is living or if the insured is not the policy owner during the first  days after the insureds date of death if the policy owner fails to elect a payment plan a beneficiary may elect a payment plan for death benefits payable to that beneficiary a payment plan that is elected by the policy owner will take effect on the date of death of the insured if it is received in our home office while the insured is living in all other cases it will take effect on the date of receipt or a later date if requested   policy value and paidup additional insurance   we determine the policy value and the value of any paidup additional insurance daily by separate calculations an increase or decrease in the policy value has no effect on the value of any paidup additional insurance and an increase or decrease in the value of any paidup additional insurance has no effect on the policy value you may increase or decrease the amount of scheduled additional premium which you are paying to increase the policy value or to increase the amount of paidup additional insurance and you may    change the allocation for applying this additional premium you must make changes in the scheduled additional premium and its allocation by written request we may require evidence of insurability if you increase the scheduled additional premium we do not permit increases in the scheduled additional premium after the policy anniversary nearest the insureds th birthday   you may transfer the value of paidup additional insurance to increase the policy value by written request this will generally result in a decrease in the total death benefit you may not transfer policy value to the value of paidup additional insurance   allocations to the account   we place the first net annual premium for the policy including any net scheduled additional premium in the account as of the policy date we place the net scheduled annual premium in the account on each policy anniversary thereafter even if you are paying premiums other than on an annual frequency we will place net unscheduled premiums in the account on the date they are received at our home office provided the request is received in good order prior to the close of trading on the new york stock exchange net premiums are premiums less the deductions from premiums see deductions from premiums   we invest premiums placed in the account prior to the initial allocation date in the money market division of the account the initial allocation date is identified in the policy and is the latest of the policy date  days after the date of the completed application or  days after we approve the application if you do not pay the initial premium with the application the initial allocation date is the latest of  days after the date of the completed application  days after we approve the application or  days after the policy date on the initial allocation date the amount in the money market division is invested in the account divisions as you have directed in the application for the policy you may change the allocation for future net premiums at any time by written request and the change will be effective for premiums placed in the account thereafter eligible owners may also submit allocation requests via northwestern mutual express  or via our website at nmfncom if you allocate any portion of a premium to a division the division must receive at least  of that premium   you may apportion the account assets supporting your policy among as many as ten divisions of the account at any one time we count the money market division as one of the ten available divisions if you are using it for any purpose including the initial allocation date procedure described above or dollar cost averaging   you may transfer accumulated amounts from one division of the account to another we will make the transfer based upon the next valuation of account assets in the affected divisions that we make after we receive the written request at our home office provided it is in good order if eligible owners may make a transfer request via northwestern mutual express  or via our website at nmfncom although no fee is presently charged we reserve the right to charge a fee of up to  to cover administrative costs of transfers   short term and excessive trading short term and excessive trading sometimes referred to as market timing may present risks to a portfolios longterm investors because it can among other things disrupt portfolio investment strategies increase portfolio transaction and administrative costs require higher than normal levels of cash reserves to fund unusually large or unexpected redemptions and adversely affect investment performance these risks may be greater for portfolios that invest in securities that may be more vulnerable to arbitrage trading including foreign securities and thinly traded securities such as small cap stocks and noninvestment grade bonds these types of trading activities also may dilute the value of longterm investors interests in a portfolio if it calculates its net asset value using closing prices that are no longer accurate accordingly we discourage market timing activities   to deter short term and excessive trading we have adopted and implemented policies and procedures which are designed to control abusive trading practices we seek to apply these policies and procedures uniformly to all policy owners except to the extent we are prevented from doing so under applicable state or federal law or regulation any exceptions must be either expressly permitted by our policies and procedures or subject to an approval process described in them because exceptions are permitted it is possible that investors may be treated differently and as a result some may be allowed to engage in trading activity that might be viewed as market timing   among the steps we have taken to reduce the frequency and effect of these practices are monitoring trading activity and imposing trading restrictions including the prohibition of more than twelve transfers among divisions under a single policy during a policy year further an investor who is identified as having made a transfer in and out of the same division round trip transfer in an amount in excess of  within fourteen calendar days will be restricted from making additional transfers after the third such round trip transfer until the next policy anniversary date and sent a letter informing him of the restriction thereafter the same investor will be similarly restricted after the second such round trip transfer an investor who is identified as having made one or more round trip transfers within thirty calendar days aggregating more than one percent  of the total assets of the portfolio underlying a division will be sent a warning letter after the first such round trip transfer and will be restricted from making additional transfers until the next policy anniversary date after the second such round trip transfer thereafter the same investor will be similarly restricted after the first such round trip transfer these limitations do not apply to automatic asset transfers scheduled or systematic transactions involving portfolio rebalancing dollar cost averaging interest sweeps or initial allocations or changes in allocations    these policies and procedures may change from time to time in our sole discretion without notice provided however policy owners would be given advance written notice if the policies and procedures were revised to accommodate market timing additionally the funds may have their own policies and procedures described in their prospectuses that are designed to limit or restrict frequent trading   if we believe your trading activity is in violation of or inconsistent with our policies and procedures or otherwise is potentially disruptive to the interests of other investors you may be asked to stop such activities and future investments allocations or transfers by you may be rejected without notice because we retain discretion to determine what action is appropriate in a given situation investors may be treated differently and some may be allowed to engage in activities that might be viewed as market timing   we intend to monitor events and the effectiveness of our policies and procedures in order to identify whether instances of potentially abusive trading practices are occurring however we may not be able to identify all instances of abusive trading practices nor completely eliminate the possibility of such activities and there may be technological limitations on our ability to impose restrictions on the trading practices of policy owners   deductions and charges   deductions from premiums we deduct a charge from each premium for state and federal taxes attributable to premiums the total amount of this deduction is  of the premium we may change the charge for taxes to reflect any changes in the law but will not charge more than the maximum amount allowed under the policy   we deduct a charge or sales load of  for sales costs from each premium we expect to recover our expenses of selling and advertising distribution expenses from this amount over the period while the policies are in force and from the surrender charges described below the amounts we deduct for costs in a policy year are not specifically related to distribution expenses incurred that year to the extent that distribution expenses exceed the amounts deducted we will pay the expenses from our other assets these assets may include among other things any gain realized from the charge against the assets of the account for the mortality and expense risks we have assumed see charges against the account assets to the extent that the amounts deducted for distribution expenses exceed the amounts needed we will realize a gain   we deduct an annual charge of  from premiums each year for administrative costs to maintain the policy these expenses include costs of premium billing and collection processing claims keeping records and communicating with policy owners we retain the right to increase this charge after  years but it is guaranteed not to exceed  plus  per  of both the minimum guaranteed death benefit and the additional protection we do not expect to profit from this charge   we deduct an annual charge from premiums each of the first  years to compensate us for expenses other than distribution expenses incurred in issuing the policy these expenses include the costs of processing applications medical examinations determining insurability and establishing records the annual amount of this charge is  plus   per  of minimum guaranteed death benefit and additional protection if you surrender the policy before these charges have been deducted for  years the remaining charges will be reflected in the administrative surrender charge see surrender charges   we deduct an annual charge of   per  of minimum guaranteed death benefit from premiums each year to compensate us for the risk we have assumed by guaranteeing the minimum guaranteed death benefit as long as you pay all premiums when they are due no matter how unfavorable investment performance may be   to determine the net annual premium we will also deduct any extra amounts we charge for insureds who qualify as substandard risks plus the cost of any additional benefits purchased with the policy to determine the net annual premium   charges against the policy value we deduct a cost of insurance charge from the policy value on each policy anniversary we determine the amount by multiplying the net amount at risk by the cost of insurance rate the net amount at risk is the projected insurance amount discounted at a net annual rate of  less the policy value the projected insurance amount is the amount of insurance at the end of the policy year assuming that the policy value increases by the  net annual growth rate assumed in constructing the policy the cost of insurance rate reflects the attained age of the insured for premier nt and preferred nt risks the cost of insurance rate is based on the commissioners  standard ordinary nonsmoker mortality tables for premier t and preferred t risks the cost of insurance rate is based on the commissioners  standard ordinary smoker mortality tables for other risks the cost of insurance rate is based on the commissioners  standard ordinary mortality tables the cost of insurance rates are included in the policy we also deduct a cost of insurance charge from the cash value of any paidup additional insurance on each policy anniversary if we receive an unscheduled premium on a day other than a policy anniversary and the net amount at risk increases as a result we will deduct a cost of insurance charge on that day reflecting the increase in the net amount at risk and the portion of the policy year remaining   while payment of premiums is suspended a portion of the annual charges which we would ordinarily deduct from premiums will be deducted from the policy value instead we will also make this deduction on the policy anniversary each year    we will also reduce the policy value by any surrender charges administrative charges or decrease in policy debt that may result from a withdrawal a decrease in the face amount of insurance or a change to variable benefit paidup insurance   charges against the account assets there is a daily charge to the account for the mortality and expense risks that we have assumed the current charge is at the annual rate of  of the assets of the account not to exceed a maximum annual rate of  the mortality risk is that insureds may not live as long as we estimated the expense risk is that expenses of issuing and administering the policies may exceed the estimated costs we will realize a gain from this charge to the extent it is not needed to provide benefits and pay expenses under the policies the actual mortality and expense experience under the policies may be used in determining dividends see annual dividends   the policies provide that a charge for taxes may be made against the assets of the account we are not currently making a separate daily charge on assets for federal income taxes we have incurred the portfolios in which the assets that support your policy are invested also bear expenses which reduce the investment rate of return see fee and expense tablesannual fund operating expenses and attached mutual fund prospectuses   transaction charges the policy provides for a fee of up to  for a transfer of assets among the account divisions and for a fee of up to  for a withdrawal of excess amount we are currently waiving these charges   surrender charges if you surrender the policy before you have paid the premium that is due at the beginning of the fifteenth year we will deduct surrender charges from the policy value similarly we will deduct surrender charges on a change to paidup insurance see paidup insurance a table of surrender charges is in the policy   the surrender charges consist of an administrative surrender charge and a premium surrender charge the administrative surrender charge is equal to the sum of the issue expense charges which we have not deducted the administrative surrender charge in the first policy year is  plus  per  of minimum guaranteed death benefit and additional protection this charge grades down linearly each year as you pay the premium or payment of premiums is suspended and is zero after you have paid the premium that is due at the beginning of the tenth policy year or it is suspended   the premium surrender charge is a percentage shown in the table below of the surrender charge base if payment of the premium for a policy year has been suspended the premium surrender charge percentage will be as if you had paid the annual premium during the first five policy years if you pay premiums more frequently than annually we will adjust the premium surrender charge percentages to reflect the actual period for which you have paid premiums   if none of the premium payments during the first five policy years have been suspended the surrender charge base equals the sum of an annual premium for the minimum guaranteed death benefit exclusive of the policy fee and exclusive of any charge for extra mortality plus a term insurance premium for the initial amount of additional protection   if any of the premium payments during the first five policy years have been suspended the surrender charge base equals the lesser of  the sum of an annual premium for the minimum guaranteed death benefit exclusive of the policy fee and exclusive of any charge for extra mortality plus a term insurance premium for the initial amount of additional protection and  the sum of the total premiums paid exclusive of any premiums for additional benefits purchased with the policy and premiums for extra mortality and any extra amount for premiums paid more often than annually divided by the number of years including fractions but not more than five for which premiums have been paid or suspended   for policiessurrendered afterpayment at thebeginning of year    premium surrendercharge percentage      issue age and under     issue age                                             through                                                    and later            for issue ages  through  the percentages are determined by linear interpolation between the percentages shown   for a reduction in face amount we will deduct the difference in surrender charges before and after the reduction    for a policy that has a minimum guaranteed death benefit of  or more the surrender charges will not exceed  per  of minimum guaranteed death benefit for a policy that has a minimum guaranteed death benefit of  or more issued for an insured ages  the surrender charges will not exceed  per  of minimum guaranteed death benefit the surrender charges could equal or exceed the policy value but we will not apply the surrender charges to the value of any paidup additional insurance   expenses of the portfolios the investment performance of each division of the account reflects all expenses borne by the corresponding portfolio see fee and expense tables total annual portfolio operating expenses and the attached mutual fund prospectuses   guarantee of premiums deductions and charges   we guarantee and may not increase the premiums for the minimum guaranteed death benefit and the charge for mortality and expense risks these amounts will not increase regardless of future changes in longevity or increases in expenses   cash value   the cash value for the policy will change daily in response to investment results no minimum cash value is guaranteed the cash value is equal to the policy value plus the value of any paidup additional insurance reduced by any policy debt outstanding and the surrender charges if you are not paying premiums on an annual basis we reduce the cash value for any premiums due later in the policy year   we determine the cash value for a policy at the end of each valuation period each business day together with any nonbusiness days before it is a valuation period a business day is any day on which the new york stock exchange is open for trading in accordance with the requirements of the investment company act of  we may also determine the cash value for a policy on any other day on which there is sufficient trading in securities to materially affect the value of the securities held by the portfolios   you may surrender your policy for the cash value at any time during the lifetime of the insured alternatively you may request that we apply the cash value to provide a reduced amount of fixed or variable paidup insurance see paidup insurance   we will permit partial surrenders of a policy so long as the policy that remains meets the regular minimum size requirements a partial surrender will cause the policy to be split into two policies one policy will be surrendered the other will continue in force on the same terms as the original policy except that the premiums will be based on the reduced amount of insurance you will receive a new policy document the cash value and the death benefit will be proportionately reduced we will allocate reductions among the account divisions in proportion to the amounts in the divisions we will make a deduction from the policy proceeds for a proportionate part of the surrender charges if a partial surrender takes place before you have paid the premium that is due at the beginning of the fifteenth policy year although no fee is presently charged we may make a transaction charge when a partial surrender is effected the amount of the transaction charge will not exceed the actual administrative costs for the transaction   annual dividends   the policies are eligible to share in the divisible surplus if any of the company this divisible surplus is determined each year the share if any of a policy will be credited as a dividend on the policy anniversary decisions concerning the amount and appropriate allocation of divisible surplus are within the sole discretion of the companys board of trustees there is no guaranteed method or formula for the determination or allocation of divisible surplus even if there is a divisible surplus the payment of a dividend on a policy is not guaranteed   dividend illustrations published at the time a life insurance policy is issued reflect the actual recent experience of the issuing company with respect to investment earnings mortality and expenses state law generally prohibits a company from projecting or estimating future results state law also requires that dividends be paid out of surplus after certain necessary amounts are set aside and that such surplus be apportioned equitably among policies eligible for dividends in summary dividends must be based on actual experience and cannot be guaranteed at issue of a policy both federal and state tax law recognize that a dividend is considered to be a refund of a portion of the premium paid   although subject to change the process of determining dividends generally can be described as follows our actuaries annually examine current and recent experience and compare these results with those which were assumed in determining premium rates when each class of policies was issued the factors used to determine classes include but are not limited to year of issue age plan of insurance and risk classification the actuary then determines the amount of dividends to be equitably apportioned to each class of policies based on the actuarys recommendations our board of trustees adopts a dividend scale each year thereby authorizing the distribution of the dividend we pay any dividend on a policys anniversary and the dividend reflects our experience for the prior year    for purposes of the current dividend scale used for the illustrations we publish we have assumed that mortality experience in connection with the policies will be comparable to that actually experienced with all of our life insurance   dividends for variable life insurance are generally lower than those for our fixed benefit life insurance primarily because a variable life insurance policy provides a contractual mechanism for translation of investment experience into a variable death benefit and variable cash value for fixed benefit life insurance the dividend includes amounts produced by favorable investment results dividends based on the minimum guaranteed death benefit for the policies described in this prospectus are expected to be relatively low during the first  policy years   you may use dividends to increase the policy value if the policy has additional protection in force the dividends will be used to increase the policy value unless the policy has excess amount see excess amount if the policy has excess amount or if no additional protection is in force you may use dividends to purchase variable benefit paidup additional insurance or to pay premiums or you may receive the dividend in cash we will use dividends to increase the policy value if you give us no direction if the policy is in force as fixed benefit paidup insurance you may use dividends to purchase fixed benefit paidup additional insurance or you may receive the dividend in cash if the policy is in force as variable benefit paidup insurance you may use the dividends to purchase variable benefit paidup additional insurance or you may receive the dividend in cash   loans and withdrawals   described below are certain terms and conditions that apply when you borrow or withdraw amounts under the policy for information on the tax treatment on loans and withdrawals see tax treatment of policy benefits and consult with your tax advisor   loans you may borrow up to  of the policys cash value using the policy as security if a policy loan is already outstanding the maximum amount for any new loan is  of the amount of cash value the policy would have had if there were no loan less the amount already borrowed you may take loan proceeds in cash or you may apply them to pay premiums on the policy if the premium loan provision is in effect and premium payments are not suspended a loan will automatically be made to pay an overdue premium if the premium is less than the maximum amount available for a new loan   interest on a policy loan accrues and is payable on a daily basis we add unpaid interest to the amount of the loan the policys cash value is reduced by the amount of the policy loan if the cash value decreases to zero the policy will terminate unless a sufficient portion of the policy loan is repaid we will send you a notice at least  days before the termination date the notice will show how much you must repay to keep the policy in force   you select the policy loan interest rate a specified annual effective rate of  is one choice the other choice is a variable rate based on a corporate bond yield index we will adjust the variable rate annually but it will not be less than    we will take the amount of a policy loan including interest as it accrues from the account divisions in proportion to the amounts in the divisions we will transfer the amounts withdrawn to our general account and will credit those amounts on a daily basis with an annual earnings rate equal to the policy loan interest rate less a charge for the mortality and expense risks we have assumed and for expenses including taxes the aggregate charge is currently at the annual rate of  for the  specified policy loan interest rate and  for the variable policy loan interest rate for example the earnings rate corresponding to the specified  policy loan interest rate is currently    a policy loan even if it is repaid will have a permanent effect on the policy value and cash value because the amounts borrowed will not participate in the accounts investment results while the loan is outstanding the effect may be either favorable or unfavorable depending on whether the earnings rate credited to the loan amount is higher or lower than the rate credited to the unborrowed amount left in the account   except when the policy is in force as fixed benefit paidup insurance we will allocate a policy loan between policy value and variable paidup additional insurance in proportion to the amount of cash value attributable to each   you may repay a policy loan and any accrued interest outstanding in whole or in part at any time we will credit payments as of the date we receive them and transfer them from our general account to the account divisions in proportion to the amounts in the divisions as of the same date   withdrawals you may make a withdrawal if the excess amount is sufficient see excess amount a withdrawal may neither decrease the excess amount to less than the surrender charge which would apply if the policy were surrendered nor reduce the loan value to less than any policy debt outstanding a maximum of four withdrawals are permitted per policy year the minimum amount for withdrawals is  an administrative charge of up to  may apply but we are currently waiving that charge we will allocate withdrawals in proportion to the amounts in the account divisions    a withdrawal of policy value decreases the death benefit by the same amount if the death benefit for a policy has been increased to meet the federal tax requirements for life insurance the decrease in the death benefit caused by a subsequent withdrawal may be larger than the amount of the withdrawal   if cumulative withdrawals exceed the cumulative additional premiums which have been used to increase the policy value with both withdrawals and premiums increased by  annual interest subsequent unfavorable investment experience may cause the policy to lapse unless you pay an additional unscheduled premium to increase the policy value the due date for this premium is the policy anniversary following written notice to you   excess amount   the excess amount is the amount by which the policy value exceeds the tabular cash value for the sum of the minimum guaranteed death benefit and any additional protection in effect the tabular cash value is an amount equal to a policy value calculated assuming  a whole life policy with a face amount equal to the sum of the minimum guaranteed death benefit and the additional protection  all premiums are paid when due  no additional premiums or dividends are used to increase policy value  a  level annual net rate of return and  maximum policy charges apply if you are not paying premiums on an annual basis the excess amount is reduced for any premiums due later in the policy year   paidup insurance   if you do not pay a premium within the day grace period and the policy does not qualify for suspension of premium payments the policy will continue in force as a reduced amount of fixed benefit paidup insurance alternatively you may select a reduced amount of variable benefit paidup insurance you must make this selection during the grace period or sooner   if the policy is in force as a reduced amount of fixed benefit paidup insurance we will transfer the amount of the cash value from the account to our general account thereafter the policy will not participate in the accounts investment results unless the policy is subsequently reinstated see reinstatement the minimum cash value for fixed benefit paidup insurance is  if the cash value is less than  as of the last day of the grace period we will treat the policy as surrendered you may select variable benefit paidup insurance only if the cash value of the policy is at least    we determine the amount of paidup insurance by applying the amount of cash value plus any policy debt as a net single premium at the attained age of the insured paidup insurance has cash and loan values for fixed benefit paidup insurance the amounts of these are guaranteed for variable paidup insurance neither the death benefit nor the cash value is guaranteed paidup insurance remains in force for the lifetime of the insured unless you surrender the policy or the policy terminates while the policy is in force as either fixed or variable benefit paidup insurance the minimum guaranteed death benefit and any additional protection will not be in effect any policy debt and the policy loan interest rate will continue see loans and withdrawals   reinstatement   if a premium is due and remains unpaid after the grace period expires the policy may be reinstated while the insured is alive within three years after the premium due date the insured must provide satisfactory evidence of insurability unless reinstatement takes place within  days after the end of the grace period we may require a substantial payment following reinstatement the policy will have the same minimum guaranteed death benefit additional protection policy value and paidup additional insurance as if minimum premiums had been paid when due we will credit a  annual net rate of investment earnings for the period from the due date of the overdue premium to the date of reinstatement we will make an adjustment for any policy debt or the debt may be reinstated the policy may not be reinstated if you have surrendered it for its cash value   right to return policy   you may return a policy for a refund within  days after you sign the application for insurance or within  days or later where required by state law after you received the policy you may mail or deliver the policy to the financial representative who sold it or to our home office the amount of your refund depends on state law in some states the amount of the refund will be the premium you paid in other states the refund will be the sum of the amounts deducted from the premium plus the policy value less any policy debt on the date we receive a written request for the return of the premium at our home office if returned we will consider the policy void from the beginning   right to exchange for a fixed benefit policy   you may exchange a policy for a whole life insurance policy with benefits that do not vary with the investment experience of a separate account fixed benefit policy you may elect the exchange at any time within twentyfour months after the issue date of the policy provided premiums are duly paid we do not require evidence of insurability    the new policy will be on the life of the same insured and will have the same initial guaranteed death benefit policy date and issue age the premiums and cash values will be the same as those for fixed benefit policies we issued on the issue date of the policy   the exchange will be subject to an equitable cash adjustment the amount will recognize the difference in premiums and investment performance of the two policies   an exchange will be effective when we receive a proper written request as well as the policy and any amount due on the exchange   you may also exchange a policy for a fixed benefit policy if any of the mutual funds changes its investment adviser or if there is a material change in the investment policies of a portfolio you will be given notice of any such change and will have  days to make the exchange   other policy provisions   owner the owner is identified in the policy the owner may exercise all rights under the policy while the insured is living ownership may be transferred to another written proof of the transfer must be received by northwestern mutual at its home office in this prospectus you means the owner or prospective purchaser of a policy   beneficiary the beneficiary is the person to whom the death benefit is payable the beneficiary is named in the application after the policy is issued you may change the beneficiary in accordance with the policy provisions   incontestability we will not contest a policy after it has been in force during the lifetime of the insured for two years from the date of issue   suicide if the insured dies by suicide within one year from the date of issue the amount payable under the policy will be limited to the premiums paid less the amount of any policy debt and withdrawals and less the cash value of any variable paidup insurance surrendered   misstatement of age or sex if the age or sex of the insured has been misstated we will adjust benefits under a policy to reflect the correct age and sex   collateral assignment you may assign a policy as collateral security we are not responsible for the validity or effect of a collateral assignment and will not be deemed to know of an assignment before receipt of the assignment in writing at our home office   optional benefits there are two optional benefits available for purchase under the policy  a waiver of premium benefit and  an additional purchase benefit   subject to the terms and conditions of the benefit the waiver of premium benefit waives the payment of all premiums that come due during the total disability of the insured if the disability is due to accident or sickness and it begins on or before the policy anniversary nearest the insureds th birthday if the disability occurs after the policy anniversary nearest the insureds th birthday the benefit waives the payment of all premiums that come due during the total disability of the insured until the policy anniversary nearest the insureds th birthday   subject to the terms and conditions of the benefit the additional purchase benefit guarantees the right to buy more insurance without proof of insurability   if you select one or both of these optional benefits you will be subject to a separate charge see periodic charges other than fund operating expenses any charge will continue to be assessed  as long as the benefit remains in force  until we have paid the benefit or  until you decide you no longer need the benefit and let us know in writing at our home office once the policy has been issued an optional benefit may be issued only upon mutual agreement   benefit payment plans the policy provides a variety of payment plans for policy benefits a northwestern mutual financial representative authorized to sell the policies can explain these provisions on request   deferral of determination and payment so long as premiums have been paid when due we will ordinarily pay policy benefits within seven days after we receive all required documents at our home office however we may defer determination and payment of benefits during any period when it is not reasonably practicable to value securities because the new york stock exchange is closed or an emergency exists or the securities and exchange commission by order permits deferral for the protection of policy owners   if a policy is in force as fixed benefit paidup insurance we have the right to defer payment of the cash value for up to six months from the date of a policy loan or surrender if payment on surrender is deferred for  days or more we will pay interest at an annual effective rate of     voting rights   we are the owner of the fund shares in which all assets of the account are invested as the owner of the shares we will exercise our right to vote the shares to elect directors of the funds to vote on matters required to be approved or ratified by fund shareholders under the investment company act of  and to vote on any other matters that may be presented to any shareholders meeting of the funds however we will vote the shares held in the account in accordance with instructions received from policy owners but may change this voting policy if required to do so by applicable federal law we will vote any shares for which we do not receive instructions and shares held in our general account in the same proportions as the shares for which voting instructions are received from policy owners if the applicable laws or regulations change so as to permit us to vote the shares in our own discretion we may elect to do so   the number of shares for each division of the account for which a policy owner may give instructions is determined by dividing the amount of the policys cash value apportioned to that division if any by the per share value for the corresponding portfolio the number will be determined as of a date we choose but not more than  days before the shareholders meeting fractional votes are counted we will solicit voting instructions with written materials at least  days before the meeting   we may if required by state insurance regulations disregard voting instructions which would require shares to be voted for a change in the subclassification or investment objectives of a portfolio or to approve or disapprove an investment advisory agreement for a portfolio we may also disregard voting instructions that would require changes in the investment policy or investment adviser for a portfolio provided that we reasonably determine to take this action in accordance with applicable federal law if we disregard voting instructions we will include a summary of the action and reasons therefore in the next semiannual report to the owners of the policies   substitution of fund shares and other changes   if in our judgment a portfolio or fund becomes unsuitable for continued use with the policies because of a change in investment objectives or restrictions we may substitute shares of another portfolio or fund or another mutual fund any substitution of shares will be subject to any required approval of the securities and exchange commission the wisconsin commissioner of insurance or other regulatory authority we have also reserved the right subject to applicable federal and state law to operate the account or any of its divisions as a management company under the investment company act of  or in any other form permitted or to terminate registration of the account if registration is no longer required and to change the provisions of the policies to comply with any applicable laws   if we take any of these actions we may make an appropriate endorsement of your policy and take other actions to carry out what we have done   reports   for each policy year you will receive a statement showing the death benefit cash value and any policy loan including interest charged as of the anniversary date we will also send you a confirmation statement when you pay the annual premium the reports and confirmation statements will show the apportionment of invested assets among the account divisions the invested assets equal the policy value plus the value of any variable paidup additions the invested assets may exceed the cash value of your policy because the cash value is reduced by the amount of any applicable surrender charge and any premiums due later in the policy year you will also receive annual reports including financial statements if the policy is in force as fixed benefit paidup insurance statements and reports will be limited to an annual policy statement showing the death benefit cash value and any policy loan   special policy for employers   a reduced minimum amount applies for policies where the insurance involves an employersponsored benefit plan or arrangement the sum of the minimum guaranteed death benefit and the additional protection must be at least  of which the minimum guaranteed death benefit must be at least  the premium for the additional protection is two times the cost of term insurance for the insureds age when the policy is issued premium rates for term insurance are set forth in the policy   these policies for employers may include a provision to permit the amount of additional protection to increase after issue any such increase amount must be based on the terms of the benefit plan or arrangement and may not be subject to the discretion of the insured or the insureds beneficiary a description of the method of determining the amount of any increase is included in the policy changes to the amount of additional protection will be effective on policy anniversaries the surrender charge and all charges for issue and administrative expenses will be based on the initial amount of additional protection   for certain situations where the insurance involves an employersponsored benefit plan or arrangement federal law and the laws of certain states may require that premiums and annuity rates be determined without regard to sex special policies are available for this purpose you are urged to review any questions in this area with qualified counsel    householding   to reduce costs we now send only a single copy of prospectuses and reports to each consenting household rather than sending copies to each contract owner residing in a household if you are a member of such a household you can revoke your consent to householding at any time and can begin receiving your own copy of prospectuses and reports by calling us at    financial statements   financial statements of the account are incorporated by reference into the statement of additional information from the accounts annual report to policy owners the financial statements of northwestern mutual appear in the statement of additional information to receive a copy of the annual report andor the statement of additional information containing such financial statements call    legal proceedings   we are engaged in litigation of various kinds which in our judgment is not of material importance in relation to our total assets there are no pending legal proceedings to which the account is a party   illustrations   your northwestern mutual financial representative will provide you with illustrations for a policy upon your request the illustrations show how the death benefit invested assets and cash value for a policy would vary based on hypothetical investment results the illustrations will be based on the information you give us about the insured and will reflect such factors as the amount of minimum guaranteed death benefit and amount of additional protection that you select these should be based upon realistic expectations given your own individual situation   illustrations for variable life insurance policies do not project or predict investment results the illustrated values assume that nonguaranteed elements such as dividends policy charges and level investment returns will not change given the volatility of the securities markets over time the illustrated scenario is unlikely to occur and the policys actual cash value death benefit and certain expenses which will vary with the investment performance of the portfolios will be more or less than those illustrated in addition the actual timing and amounts of payments deductions expenses and any values removed from the policy will also impact product performance due to these variations even a portfolio that averaged the same return as illustrated will produce values which will be more or less than those which were originally illustrated   tax treatment of policy benefits   general the following discussion provides a general description of federal income tax considerations relating to the policy the discussion is based on current provisions of the internal revenue code code as currently interpreted by the internal revenue service we do not intend this as tax advice the discussion is not exhaustive it does not address the likelihood of future changes in federal income tax law or interpretations thereof and it does not address state or local tax considerations which may be significant in the purchase and ownership of a policy   the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of  enacted on june   made substantial changes to the estate gift and generation skipping transfer tax the act increases the amount of an estate exempt from tax from  in  to  million in   million in  and  million in  the act reduces the top estate gift and generation skipping transfer tax rate from  in  to  in  in  the estate tax and generation skipping transfer tax are repealed and the gift tax is reduced to  all of these changes are sunsetted or repealed in  unless extended or made permanent it is generally believed that the estate tax repeal will not be made permanent but that further changes may be made   life insurance qualification section  of the code defines life insurance for federal income tax purposes we have designed the policy to comply with this definition   the definitional test under the code is currently based on mortality tables adopted in  or earlier however for policies materially changed after  the test will be based on  mortality tables because the policy will not satisfy the definitional test using  mortality tables you will not be permitted to make certain changes to your policy after  as defined by notice    section h of the code authorizes the secretary of the treasury to set standards for diversification of the investments underlying variable life insurance policies final regulations have been issued pursuant to this authority failure to meet the diversification requirements would disqualify the policies as life insurance for purposes of section  of the code we intend to comply with these requirements    on july   the internal revenue service issued rev ruls  and  that provide guidance on when a policy owners control of separate account assets will cause the policy owner and not the life insurance company to be treated as the owner of those assets important indicators of investor control are the ability of the policy owner to select the investment advisor the investment strategy or the particular investments of the separate account if the owner of a policy were treated as the owner of the mutual fund shares held in the account the income and gains related to those shares would be included in the owners gross income for federal income tax purposes we believe that we own the assets of the account under current federal income tax law   tax treatment of life insurance while a policy is in force increases in the cash value of the policy as a result of investment experience are not subject to federal income tax until there is a distribution as defined by the code the death benefit received by a beneficiary will not be subject to federal income tax   unless the policy is a modified endowment contract as described below a loan received under a policy will not be treated as a distribution subject to current federal income tax interest paid by individual owners of the policies will ordinarily not be deductible you should consult a qualified tax advisor as to the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by other purchasers of the policies see other tax considerations   as a general rule the proceeds from a withdrawal of cash value will be taxable only to the extent that the withdrawal exceeds the basis of the policy the basis of the policy is generally equal to the premiums paid less any amounts previously received as taxfree distributions in certain circumstances a withdrawal of cash value during the first  policy years may be taxable to the extent that the cash value exceeds the basis of the policy this means that the amount withdrawn may be taxable even if that amount is less than the basis of the policy   caution must be used when taking cash out of a policy through policy loans if interest is not paid annually it is added to the principal amount and the total amount will continue to accrue for as long as the loan is maintained on the policy if the policy remains in force until death the loan will be repaid from the taxfree death benefit however if the policy terminates by any method other than death the loan will be repaid from the cash value of the policy and the total cash value including the total amount of the loan will be taxable to the extent it exceeds the amount of premiums paid in extreme situations policy owners can face what is called the surrender squeeze the surrender squeeze occurs when the unborrowed cash value remaining in the policy is insufficient to cover the interest payment required to keep the policy in force or to cover the tax due if the policy terminates either the interest would have to be paid annually or the policy would terminate and any income tax due would have to be paid with other assets   a policy may be exchanged taxfree for another life insurance policy an endowment contract or an annuity contract covering the same insured special tax rules may apply when ownership of a policy is transferred you should seek qualified tax advice if you plan a transfer of ownership   modified endowment contracts a policy will be classified as a modified endowment contract if the cumulative premiums paid at any time during the first seven policy years exceed a defined sevenpay limit the sevenpay limit is the sum of the premiums net of expense and administrative charges that would have to be paid in order for the policy to be fully paid for after seven level annual payments a policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract unless any excess premiums are withdrawn from the policy with interest within  days after the end of the policy year in which they are paid   whenever there is a material change under a policy it will generally be treated as a new contract for purposes of determining whether the policy is a modified endowment contract and it will be subjected to a new sevenpay period and a new sevenpay limit the new sevenpay limit would be determined taking into account the cash value of the policy at the time of such change a materially changed policy would be considered a modified endowment contract if it failed to satisfy the new sevenpay limit a material change could occur as a result of a change in the death benefit a change in the level of premium payments and certain other changes a material change could occur as a result of an increase in the death benefit the addition of a benefit or the payment of a premium that is considered unnecessary under the code   if the benefits under the policy are reduced during the first seven policy years after entering into the policy or within seven years after a material change for example by making a withdrawal of cash value or in some cases by lapsing the policy the sevenpay premium limit will be redetermined based on the reduced level of benefits and applied retroactively for purposes of the sevenpay test if the premiums previously paid are greater than the recalculated sevenpay premium limit the policy will become a modified endowment contract a life insurance policy which is received in exchange for a modified endowment contract will also be considered a modified endowment contract   if a policy is a modified endowment contract any distribution from the policy will be taxed on a gainfirst basis distributions for this purpose include a loan including any increase in the loan amount to pay interest on an existing loan or an assignment or a pledge to secure a loan a withdrawal of cash value or a surrender of the policy if a policy terminates while there is a policy loan the cancellation of the loan and accrued loan interest also will be treated as a distribution to the extent not previously treated as such any such distributions will be considered taxable income to the extent the cash value exceeds the basis in the policy for modified endowment contracts the basis would be increased by the amount of any prior loan under the policy that was considered taxable    income for purposes of determining the taxable portion of any distribution all modified endowment contracts issued by northwestern mutual to the same policy owner excluding certain qualified plans during any calendar year are to be aggregated the secretary of the treasury has authority to prescribe additional rules to prevent avoidance of gainfirst taxation on distributions from modified endowment contracts   a  penalty tax will apply to the taxable portion of a distribution from a modified endowment contract the penalty tax will not however apply to distributions i to taxpayers   years of age or older ii in the case of a disability as defined in the code or iii received as part of a series of substantially equal periodic annuity payments for the life or life expectancy of the taxpayer or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the taxpayer and the taxpayers beneficiaries the exceptions generally do not apply to life insurance policies owned by corporations or other entities   business owned life insurance businessowned life insurance may be subject to certain additional rules section a of the code generally disallows a deduction for premiums paid on policies by anyone who is directly or indirectly a beneficiary under the policy increases in cash value may also be subject to tax under the corporation alternative minimum tax provisions   section a of the code limits the policy owners deduction for interest on loans taken against life insurance policies to interest on an aggregate total of  of loans per covered life only with respect to life insurance policies covering key persons generally a key person means an officer or a  owner however the number of key persons will be limited to the greater of a five individuals or b the lesser of  of the total officers and employees of the taxpayer or  individuals deductible interest for these policies will be subject to limits based on current market rates   in addition section f disallows a proportionate amount of a businesss interest deduction on nonlife insurance indebtedness based on the amount of unborrowed cash value of nonexempt life insurance policies held in relation to other business assets exempt policies include policies held by natural persons unless the business is a direct or indirect beneficiary under the policy and policies owned by a business and insuring employees directors officers and  owners as well as joint policies insuring  owners and their spouses   congress also is considering limiting the tax free death benefit on businessowned life insurance to policies insuring highly compensated employees who consent to the coverage   splitdollar arrangements life insurance purchased under a split dollar arrangement is subject to special tax rules notice  provides that  the value of the current life insurance protection provided to the employee under the arrangement is taxed to the employee each year and until the issuance of further guidance can be determined using the governments table  rates or the insurers lower one year term rates which for arrangements entered into after january   must satisfy additional sales requirements and  for split dollar arrangements entered into on or before september   taxation of the equity cash surrender value in excess of the amount payable to the employer is governed by prior law and is subject to the following three safe harbors a the annual accrual of income will not by itself be enough to trigger a taxable transfer b equity will not be taxed regardless of the level of the employers economic interest in the life insurance policy as long as the value of the life insurance protection is treated and reported as an economic benefit and c the employee can elect loan treatment at any time provided all premiums paid by the employer are treated as a loan entered into at the beginning of the first year in which payments are treated as loans   on september   the treasury and internal revenue service issued final regulations regarding the taxation of split dollar arrangements the final regulations apply only to arrangements entered into or materially changed after september   the regulations provide that such split dollar arrangements must be taxed under one of two mutually exclusive tax regimes depending on the ownership of the underlying life insurance policy collateral assignment split dollar arrangements in which the employee owns the policy must be taxed under a loan regime where such an arrangement imposes a below market interest rate or no interest rate the employee is taxed on the imputed interest under section  of the code endorsement split dollar arrangements in which the employer owns the policy must be taxed under an economic benefit regime under this regime the employee is taxed each year on i the value of the current life insurance protection provided to the employee ii the amount of policy cash value to which the employee has current access and iii the value of any other economic benefits provided to the employee during the taxable year   under the sarbanesoxley act of  it is a criminal offense for an employer with publicly traded stock to extend or arrange a personal loan to a director or executive officer after july   one issue that has not been clarified is whether each premium paid by such an employer under a split dollar arrangement with a director or executive officer is a personal loan subject to the new law   new requirements for nonqualified deferred compensation plans were enacted as part of the american jobs creation act of  the law applies to deferrals after december   and imposes conditions on the timing of deferrals distribution triggers funding mechanisms and reporting requirements nonqualified deferred compensation plans that fail to meet these conditions are taxed currently on all compensation previously deferred and interest earned thereon and assessed an additional  penalty the law does not limit the use of life insurance as an informal funding mechanism for nonqualified deferred compensation plans but proposed    regulations treat certain split dollar arrangements as nonqualified deferred compensation plans that must comply with the new rules further guidance is expected on this issue   valuation of life insurance in  the treasury and internal revenue service imposed special valuation rules on life insurance distributed from a qualified plan to a participant or transferred by an employer to an employee notice  provides a safe harbor formula for valuing variable life insurance that is the greater of the interpolated terminal reserve or the cash value adjusted by a surrender factor for policies distributed from qualified plans both increased by a pro rata portion of the estimated dividends for the policy year these rules do not apply to splitdollar arrangements entered into on or before september   and not materially modified thereafter   other tax considerations pursuant to regulations issued in  taxpayers are required to annually report all reportable transactions as defined in the regulations reportable transactions include transactions that are offered under conditions of confidentiality as to tax treatment and involve an advisor who receives a fee of  or more or transactions that include a tax indemnity rev proc  further held that the purchase of life insurance policies by a business does not by itself constitute a reportable transaction   depending on the circumstances the exchange of a policy a policy loan or a change in ownership or an assignment of the policy may have federal income tax consequences in addition federal state and local transfer estate inheritance and other tax consequences of policy ownership premium payments and receipt of policy proceeds depend on the circumstances of each policy owner or beneficiary if you contemplate any such transaction you should consult a qualified tax adviser    more information about northwestern

your reading list by clicking this button tweet northwestern mutual has an enviable reputation for selling life insurance to the rich and also a topflight rating for claimspaying ability from all three of the big rating agencies am best standard  poors and moodys a fourth smaller rating agency weiss ranks it one step down from the top but that still means “excellent” and puts northwestern among the top  of  companies northwesterns annual report is light on financial information but it suggests that the company has both consistent revenues and decent investment returns this according to richard johns is a mirage mr johns a present and former policyholder runs a small organisation policyowner protection services that is devoted to scrutinising one company northwestern mutual the bulk of its efforts appear on a website wwwnmlcomplaintscom and can be split into four rough categories management is rotten the companys financial condition is becoming rotten its insurance products will leave customers feeling rotten and finally top agents are heading for the door either because their activities have triggered probes or because they could no longer bear the rotten culture harsh stuff—and it has not gone unnoticed moodys and standard  poors both say they have had conversations with northwestern about the allegations and concluded there was no cause to adjust their ratings joe belth author of an insurance newsletter in indiana has found that some of the letters on the site are written under pseudonyms mr johns says they were agents or former agents under cover other entries were taken out of context information on the site he says should not be taken seriously in this sectionbush hero or hypocrite revenge of the nerds a slight resonance rubber barons under attack a slap on the chic small but elegant freeing the airwaves reprintsrelated itemsnorthwestern mutual signs of lifemar th  yet can it also be ignored mr johns and his sources are hard to dismiss entirely the website alleges that northwestern is under investigation by the national association of securities dealers nasd for inappropriate sales tactics northwestern acknowledges it is being looked at by the nasd but claims this is only because there is an industrywide investigation into one of its products variable whole life insurance there is a second issue over the late reporting of customer complaints which may result in a small fine it adds one could argue that the consumer of any insurance product would be bettereducated after wading through mr johnss site mr johns was an early critic of variable whole life a popular hybrid of a mutual fund and insurance a related product the variable annuity was cited by the nasd this week when announcing the censure of one firm and civil charges against people at three others none of them at northwestern over the past decade northwesterns record has stood up well within the lifeinsurance industry but it has not been beyond reproach the nmlcomplaintscom site has a vast library of litigation as well as a note that northwestern agents will pay an additional  this year for errors and omissions insurance because of the cost of settling several large claims northwestern says the real number is  including the cost of successful defences mr johnss own crusade began five years ago when he contends he received a poor settlement for a missold product northwestern contends that the site is a huntingground for lawyers seeking clients its response says mr belth has been not to call attention to it why does the company not respond or sue northwestern says there are huge obstacles to effective use of the law to stop commentary on the internet no doubt competitors are watching closely in todays world of angry customers and growing
