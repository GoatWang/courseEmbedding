the nonoccurrence of a specified trigger events that leads to economic andor human loss such as an earthquake of a particular magnitude or a hurricane of a specific category the most common type of eventlinked bonds is known as “catastrophe” or “cat” bonds the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds in one or more of three ways the fund may purchase eventlinked bonds when initially offered the fund may purchase eventlinked bonds in the secondary overthecounter market or the fund may gain indirect exposure to eventlinked bonds using derivatives the fund may pursue other types of eventlinked derivative strategies using derivative instruments that are typically contingent or formulaically related to defined trigger events   trigger events may include hurricanes earthquakes and weatherrelated phenomena nonnatural catastrophes such as plane crashes or other events resulting in a specified level of physical or economic loss such as mortality or longevity trigger events are typically defined by three criteria an event a geographic area in which the event must occur and a threshold of economic or physical loss caused by the event together with a method to measure such loss in order for a trigger event to be deemed to have occurred each of the three criteria must be satisfied while the bond is outstanding or the derivative position remains open the fund has no limit as to the types of events geographic areas or thresholds of loss referenced by eventlinked bonds in which it can invest generally the event is either a natural or nonnatural peril of a kind that results in significant physical or economic loss natural perils include disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes windstorms fires and floods nonnatural perils include disasters resulting from human activity such as commercial and industrial accidents or business interruptions   the fund may also gain exposure to reinsurance contracts by holding notes or preferred shares issued by a special purpose vehicle “spv” whose performance is tied to underlying reinsurance transactions including quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes the fund as holder of a note or preferred share issued by the spv would be entitled to participate in the underwriting results and investment earnings associated with the spv’s underlying reinsurance contracts investments in quota share notes provide exposure to a form of proportional reinsurance in which an investor participates in the premiums and losses of a reinsurer’s portfolio according to a predefined percentage for example under a  quotashare agreement the spv would obtain  of all premiums of the subject portfolio while being responsible for  of all claims and the fund as holder of a quota share note issued by the spv would be entitled to its pro rata share of the premiums received by the spv and would be responsible for its pro rata share of the claims up to the total amount invested investments in excess of loss notes provide exposure to a form of reinsurance pursuant to which one party typically an insurer or reinsurer purchases protection against losses that exceed a specified threshold up to a set limit for example under such an arrangement an insurer may have a book of business with  billion of total risk in respect of large catastrophic losses such an insurer can purchase reinsurance protection from an spv for  of singleevent losses the insurer suffers between  billion and  billion by paying the spv a fixed premium in this example if the insurer suffered a loss of  billion due to one event it would cover the first  billion itself and file a reinsurance claim with the spv to pay  of the further  billion in losses ie  million and pay the remaining  million itself if the insurer had losses of  billion it would cover the first  billion itself look to the spv to pay  of  billion again paying the  million itself and would further retain the obligation to pay the additional  billion that exceeds the reinsurance which in this example covered losses between  billion and  billion the “trigger” for this type of reinsurance contract would be losses in excess of the specified amount   table of contents  prospectus      investments in ilw notes provide exposure to a transaction through which one party typically an insurance company or reinsurance company or a reinsurancerelated asset manager purchases protection based on the total loss arising from a catastrophic event to the entire insurance industry rather than the losses of any particular insurer for example the buyer of a “ million limit us wind ilw attaching at  billion” will pay an upfront premium to a protection writer ie the reinsurer or an spv and in return will receive  million if total losses to the insurance industry from a single us hurricane exceed  billion the industry loss  billion in this case is often referred to as the “trigger” and is reported by an independent third party after an event has occurred the amount of protection offered by the contract  million in this case is referred to as the “limit” ilw notes could also provide exposure to transactions linked to an index not linked to insurance industry losses such as windspeed or earthquake magnitude and location the fund as holder of an ilw note would be entitled to a return linked to the premium paid by the sponsor and the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the trigger event in implementing the fund’s investment strategy stone ridge will seek to invest in reinsurancerelated securities tied to a varied group of available perils and geographic regions further within each region and peril stone ridge seeks to hold a balance of exposures to underlying insurance and reinsurance carriers trigger types and lines of business the adviser will continue to monitor the risk of the fund’s investments on a regular basis   many of the reinsurancerelated securities in which the fund will invest will be issued by nonus issuers as a result the fund may invest substantially in securities issued by foreign sovereigns or by us or foreign entities that are corporations partnerships trusts or other types of business entities   under normal circumstances the fund intends to invest substantially all its assets in reinsurancerelated securities but retains the flexibility to invest at times in other instruments including registered investment companies us government securities cash and cash equivalents the fund may also enter into other types of investments that enable the fund to provide risk transfer services as the adviser may consider appropriate from time to time the fund’s assets may be invested in a whollyowned and controlled subsidiary the “subsidiary” formed under the laws of the cayman islands and advised by the adviser the subsidiary like the fund is expected to invest primarily in reinsurancerelated securities the fund may invest up to  of its assets at the time of purchase in the subsidiary references herein to the fund include references to the subsidiary in respect of the fund’s exposure to reinsurancerelated securities   borrowings   the fund may obtain leverage through borrowings in seeking to achieve its investment objective the fund’s borrowings may be on a secured or unsecured basis and at fixed or variable rates of interest the fund’s ability to obtain leverage through borrowings is dependent upon its ability to establish and maintain an appropriate line of credit the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” requires a closedend fund to maintain asset coverage of not less than  of the value of the outstanding amount of senior securities representing indebtedness as defined in the  act this means that the value of the fund’s total indebtedness may not exceed onethird of the value of its total assets including such indebtedness measured at the time the fund incurs the indebtedness   investment adviser and administrator   stone ridge asset management llc is the investment adviser of the fund as of october   stone ridge managed approximately  billion of assets robert gutmann alexander nyren ross stevens and yan zhao the “portfolio managers” are primarily responsible for the daytoday management of the fund   distributions   the fund expects to declare and pay dividends from net investment income and net realized capital gains at least annually unless shareholders specify otherwise dividends will be reinvested in shares of the fund see “distributions and federal income tax matters” beginning on page  and “dividend reinvestment plan” beginning on page  of this prospectus   table of contents  prospectus      distributor transfer agent and custodian   quasar distributors llc of milwaukee wisconsin is the fund’s distributor us bancorp fund services llc of milwaukee wisconsin is the fund’s transfer agent administrator and accounting agent us bank na of milwaukee wisconsin is the fund’s custodian the fund compensates the distributor transfer agent and custodian for their services   unlisted closedend fund structure limited liquidity   the fund’s shares are not listed and the fund does not currently intend to list its shares for trading on any securities exchange and does not expect any secondary market to develop for its shares shareholders of the fund are not able to have their shares redeemed or otherwise sell their shares on a daily basis because the fund is an unlisted closedend fund in order to provide liquidity to shareholders the fund is structured as an “interval fund” and conducts periodic repurchase offers for a portion of its outstanding shares as described herein an investment in the fund is suitable only for longterm investors who can bear the risks associated with the limited liquidity of the shares   special risk considerations   an investment in the fund involves special risk considerations you should consider carefully the risks summarized below which are described in more detail under “investment objective policies and risks—risk considerations” beginning on page  of this prospectus   the fund is generally sold to i institutional investors including registered investment advisers rias that meet certain qualifications and have completed a training program provided by the adviser ii clients of such institutional investors and iii certain other eligible investors the minimum initial account size is  million subject to certain exceptions see “investment minimums” investors should carefully consider the fund’s risks and investment objectives as an investment in the fund may not be appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program an investment in the fund involves a high degree of risk the reinsurancerelated securities in which the fund invests are typically considered “high yield” and reinsurancerelated debt securities may be considered “junk bonds” it is possible that investing in the fund may result in a loss of some or all of the amount invested before making an investmentallocation decision investors should i consider the suitability of this investment with respect to an investor’s or a client’s investment objectives and individual situation and ii consider factors such as an investor’s or a client’s net worth income age and risk tolerance investment should be avoided where an investorclient has a shortterm investing horizon andor cannot bear the loss of some or all of the investment   limited history   the fund has a limited history of operations and is designed for longterm investors and not as a shortterm trading vehicle   reinsurancerelated securities risk   the principal risk of an investment in a reinsurancerelated security is that a triggering events eg i natural events such as a hurricane tornado or earthquake of a particular sizemagnitude in a designated geographic area or ii nonnatural events such as large aviation disasters will occur and the fund will lose all or a significant portion of the principal it has invested in the security and the right to additional interest payments with respect to the security if multiple triggering events occur that impact a significant portion of the portfolio of the fund the fund could suffer substantial losses and an investor will lose money a majority of the fund’s assets will be invested directly or indirectly in reinsurancerelated securities tied to natural events andor nonnatural disasters and there is inherent uncertainty as to whether when or where such events will occur there is no way to accurately predict whether a triggering event will occur and because of this significant uncertainty reinsurancerelated securities carry a high degree of risk the fund is subject to the principal risks described below whether through the fund’s i derivatives positions or other investments ii investments through the subsidiary or iii direct investments   eventlinked bonds eventlinked or catastrophe bonds carry large uncertainties and major risk exposures to adverse conditions if a trigger event as defined within the terms of the bond involves losses or other metrics exceeding a specific magnitude in the geographic region and time period specified therein the fund may lose a portion or all of its investment in such security including accrued interest andor principal invested in such security such losses may be substantial because catastrophe bonds cover “catastrophic” events that if they occur will result in significant losses catastrophe bonds carry a high degree of risk of loss and are considered “high yield” or “junk bonds” the rating if any primarily reflects the rating agency’s calculated probability that a predefined trigger event will occur thus lowerrated bonds have a greater likelihood of a triggering event occurring and loss to the fund   table of contents  prospectus      quota share notes excess of loss notes ilw notes the fund may gain exposure directly or indirectly to reinsurance contracts through quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes these securities are subject to the same risks discussed herein for eventlinked or catastrophe bonds in addition because quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes represent an interest either proportional or nonproportional in one or more underlying reinsurance contracts the fund has limited transparency into the individual underlying contracts and therefore must rely upon the risk assessment and sound underwriting practices of the issuer accordingly it may be more difficult for the adviser to fully evaluate the underlying risk profile of the fund’s investment in quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes which will place the fund’s assets at greater risk of loss than if the adviser had more complete information the lack of transparency may also make the valuation of quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes more difficult and potentially result in mispricing that could result in losses to the fund see “illiquidity and restricted securities risk” and “valuation risk” discussed herein in quota share notes trades ilw notes trades and excess of loss notes trades the fund cannot lose more than the amount invested   riskmodeling risk the adviser in selecting investments for the fund will generally consider risk models created by independent third parties the sponsor of a reinsurancerelated security or a broker  the adviser may also consider its own risk models based on comparable prior transactions quantitative analysis and industry knowledge risk models are designed to assist investors governments and businesses understand the potential impact of a wide variety of catastrophic events and allow such parties to analyze the probability of loss in regions with the highest exposure the adviser will use the output of the risk models before and after investment to assist the adviser in assessing the risk of a particular reinsurancerelated security or a group of such securities risk models are created using historical scientific and other related data because such risk models are based in part upon historical data and averages there is no guarantee that such information will accurately predict the future occurrence location or severity of any particular catastrophic event and thus may fail to accurately calculate the probability of a trigger event and may underestimate the likelihood of a trigger event in addition any errors or imperfections in a risk model or in the data on which it is based or any technical issues with the construction of the models including for example data problems andor software or other implementation issues could adversely affect the ability of the adviser to use such analyses or models effectively which in turn could adversely affect the fund’s performance risk models are used by the adviser as one input in its risk analysis process for fund investments   illiquidity and restricted securities risk to the extent consistent with the repurchase liquidity requirement of an interval fund the fund may invest without limitation in illiquid securities liquidity risk is the risk that the reinsurancerelated securities held by the fund may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time that the fund would like or at the price that the fund believes the security is currently worth as a relatively new type of financial instrument there is limited trading history for reinsurancerelated securities even for those securities deemed to be liquid illiquid investments may also be difficult to value   certain of the instruments in which the fund may invest are subject to restrictions on resale by the federal securities laws or otherwise such as securities offered privately pursuant to section a of the securities act of  the “ act” and securities issued pursuant to rule a under the  act while certain restricted securities may notwithstanding their limitations on resale be treated as liquid if stone ridge determines pursuant to the applicable procedures that such treatment is warranted there can be no guarantee that any such determination will continue   valuation risk the fund is subject to valuation risk which is the risk that one or more of the securities in which the fund invests are priced incorrectly due to factors such as incomplete data market instability or human error in addition pricing of reinsurancerelated securities is subject to the added uncertainty caused by the inability to generally predict whether when or where a natural disaster or other triggering event will occur the fund’s investments in reinsurancerelated securities for which market quotations are not available will be valued pursuant to procedures adopted by the board   moral hazard risk reinsurancerelated securities are generally subject to one or more types of triggers including socalled “indemnitytriggers” an indemnity trigger is a trigger based on the actual losses of the ceding sponsor ie the party seeking reinsurance reinsurancerelated securities subject to indemnity triggers are often regarded as being subject to potential moral hazard since such reinsurancerelated securities are triggered by actual losses of the ceding sponsor and the ceding sponsor may have an incentive to take actions andor risks that would have an adverse effect on the fund   table of contents  prospectus      limited availability and reinvestment risk investments in reinsurancerelated securities may be limited which may limit the amount of assets the fund may be able to invest in reinsurancerelated securities the limited availability of reinsurancerelated securities may be due to a number of factors including seasonal concentration of issuances limited selection that meets the fund’s investment objective and lack of availability of reinsurancerelated securities in the secondary market   reinsurance industry risk the performance of reinsurancerelated securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events including weather natural disasters hurricanes earthquakes etc nonnatural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical andor economic loss triggering events are typically defined by three criteria an event a geographic area in which the event must occur and a threshold of economic or physical loss caused by the event together with a method to measure such loss generally the event is either a natural or nonnatural peril of a kind that results in significant physical or economic loss natural perils include disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes windstorms fires and floods nonnatural perils include disasters resulting from human activity such as commercial and industrial accidents or business interruptions major natural disasters in populated areas such as in the cases of hurricane katrina in new orleans in  and super storm sandy in the new york city metropolitan area in  or related to highvalue insured property such as plane crashes can result in significant losses and investors in reinsurancerelated securities tied to such exposures may also experience substantial losses if the likelihood and severity of natural and other large disasters increase the risk of significant losses to reinsurers may increase   floatingrate instrument risks   a significant percentage of the reinsurancerelated securities in which the fund directly or indirectly invests are expected to be variable rate or floatingrate eventlinked bonds floatingrate instruments and similar investments may be illiquid or less liquid than other investments   borrowing risk   the fund may borrow to meet repurchase requests or for investment purposes ie to purchase additional portfolio securities the fund’s borrowings may be on a secured or unsecured basis and at fixed or variable rates of interest the fund’s ability to obtain leverage through borrowings is dependent upon its ability to establish and maintain an appropriate line of credit the cost of borrowing may reduce the fund’s return   leveraging risk   the fund may borrow or enter into derivative transactions for investment purposes which will cause the fund to incur investment leverage therefore the fund is subject to leveraging risk leverage magnifies the fund’s exposure to declines in the value of one or more underlying investments or creates investment risk with respect to a larger pool of assets than the fund would otherwise have this risk is enhanced for the fund because it invests substantially all its assets in reinsurancerelated securities   derivative risk   derivatives are financial contracts the value of which depends on or is derived from the underlying security or other reference asset derivatives involve the risk that changes in their value may not move as expected relative to changes in the value of the underlying reference they are designed to track the fund may invest directly or indirectly in derivatives for investment purposes and for hedging and risk management purposes derivatives risk may be more significant when derivatives are used to enhance return or as a substitute for a cash investment position rather than solely to hedge the risk of a position held by the fund see the statement of additional information for additional information of the various types and uses of derivatives in the fund’s strategy   the use of derivatives involves risks that are in addition to and potentially greater than the risks of investing directly in securities and other more traditional assets in particular the fund’s use of overthecounter “otc” derivatives exposes it to the risk that the counterparties will be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments or otherwise honor their obligations if the counterparty defaults the fund will still have contractual remedies but may not be able to enforce them the fund may invest in derivatives with a limited number of counterparties and events affecting the creditworthiness of any of those counterparties may have a pronounced effect on the fund   table of contents  prospectus      derivatives also present other risks described in this prospectus including marketrelated risk illiquidity risk currency risk and credit risk many derivatives in particular otc derivatives are complex and their valuation often requires modeling and judgment which increases the risk of mispricing or improper valuation   the fund’s use of derivatives may not be effective or have the desired results moreover suitable derivatives will not be available in all circumstances in addition the adviser may decide not to use derivatives to hedge or otherwise reduce the fund’s risk exposures potentially resulting in losses for the fund   swaps risk the fund may obtain eventlinked exposure by investing directly or indirectly in among other things eventlinked swaps which typically are contingent or formulaically related to defined trigger events or by pursuing similar eventlinked derivative strategies trigger events include hurricanes earthquakes weatherrelated phenomena and other criteria determined by independent parties if a trigger events occurs the fund may lose the swap’s notional amount as derivative instruments eventlinked swaps are subject to risks in addition to the risks of investing in reinsurancerelated securities including risks associated with the counterparty and leverage   below investment grade securities risk   the fund can invest directly or indirectly without limit in reinsurancerelated securities that are rated below investment grade bonds that are below investment grade are commonly called “junk bonds” which are bonds rated below bbb by standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” or baa by moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” or that have comparable ratings by another rating organization the rating primarily reflects the rating agency’s calculated probability that a predefined trigger event will occur therefore securities with a lower rating reflect the rating agency’s assessment of the substantial risk that a triggering event will occur and result in a loss the rating also reflects the reinsurancerelated security’s credit risk and the model used to calculate the probability of the trigger event the rating system for reinsurancerelated securities is relatively new and significantly less developed than that of corporate bonds and continues to evolve as the market develops there is no minimum rating on the instruments in which the fund may invest the fund may also invest without limit in reinsurancerelated securities that are unrated and judged by the adviser to be of below investment grade quality   credit risk   the reinsurancerelated securities in which the fund invests directly or indirectly will be subject to credit risk the principal invested in many reinsurancerelated securities is held by the spv in a collateral account and invested in various permissible assets set forth under the terms of the spv in these cases typically the collateral account is invested in high quality us government securities ie us treasury bonds however in certain reinsurancerelated securities the collateral account may be invested in high yielding higher risk securities collateral will generally be invested in accordance with the terms of the spv and overseen by a collateral manager appointed by the spv therefore the fund is dependent upon the manager to invest the collateral account proceeds appropriately a small portion of the reinsurancerelated securities in which the fund invests may in lieu of such collateral account arrangements provide for the collateral to be held by the reinsurer when a collateral account is invested in higher yielding higher risk securities or when the collateral is held directly by the reinsurer the fund will be subject to the risk of nonpayment of scheduled principal and interest on such collateral such nonpayments and defaults may reduce the income to the fund and negatively impact the value of fund shares   foreign investing risk   the fund may invest directly or indirectly in reinsurancerelated securities issued by foreign sovereigns and foreign entities that are corporations partnerships trusts or other types of business entities because the majority of reinsurancerelated security issuers are domiciled outside the united states the fund will normally invest significant amounts of its assets in nonus entities accordingly the fund may invest without limitation in securities issued by nonus entities including those in emerging market countries certain spvs in which the fund invests may be sponsored by nonus insurers that are not subject to the same regulation as that to which us insurers are subject such spvs may pose a greater risk of loss for example due to less stringent underwriting andor riskretention requirements the fund’s investments will consist primarily of eventlinked bonds quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes that provide the fund with contractual rights under the terms of the issuance while the contractual rights of eventlinked bonds and quota share notes are similar whether they are issued by a us issuer or a nonus issuer there may be certain additional risks associated with nonus issuers   table of contents  prospectus      foreign currency risk   it is expected that a substantial portion of the fund’s direct or indirect investments in reinsurancerelated securities will be us dollar denominated investments to the extent the fund invests in nonus denominated instruments a change in the value of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in a change in the us dollar value of securities denominated in that foreign currency if the us dollar rises in value against a foreign currency a security denominated in that currency will be worth less in us dollars and if the us dollar decreases in value against a foreign currency a security denominated in that currency will be worth more in us dollars the dollar value of foreign investments may also be affected by exchange controls currency risk also includes the risk that the currency to which the fund has obtained exposure through hedging declines in value relative to the currency being hedged in which event the fund may realize a loss both on the hedging instrument and on the currency being hedged   equity investing risk   the fund may at times invest directly or indirectly in equity securities which may be publicly or privately offered the equity securities in which the fund invests may be more volatile than the equity market as a whole equity securities risk is the risk that the value of equity instruments to which the fund is exposed will fall due to general market or economic conditions overall market changes local regional or global political social or economic instability currency interest rate and commodity price fluctuations perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers participate and the particular circumstances and performance of the issuers market conditions may affect certain types of equity securities to a greater extent than other types although equities have historically generated higher average returns than debt securities over the long term equity securities also have experienced significantly more volatility in returns   subsidiary risk   by investing in the subsidiary the fund is exposed to the risks associated with the subsidiary’s investments the subsidiary will not be registered as an investment company under the  act and will not be subject to all of the investor protections of the  act although the subsidiary will be managed pursuant to compliance policies and procedures that are materially the same as the policies and procedures applicable to the fund changes in the laws of the united states andor the cayman islands could result in the inability of the fund andor the subsidiary to operate as described in this prospectus and could adversely affect the fund   nondiversification risk   the fund is classified as a “nondiversified” fund under the  act accordingly the fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than if it were a “diversified” fund to the extent that the fund invests a higher percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer the fund is subject to a higher degree of risk associated with and developments affecting that issuer than a fund that invests more widely   management and operational risk   the fund is subject to management risk because it relies on the adviser’s ability to achieve its investment objective the fund runs the risk that the adviser’s investment techniques will fail to produce desired results and cause the fund to incur significant losses the adviser may select investments that do not perform as anticipated by the adviser may choose to hedge or not to hedge positions at disadvantageous times and may fail to use derivatives effectively any imperfections errors or limitations in quantitative analyses and models used by the adviser as part of its investment process could affect the fund’s performance   the fund also is subject to the risk of loss as a result of other services provided by the adviser and other service providers including pricing administrative accounting tax legal custody transfer agency and other services operational risk includes the possibility of loss caused by inadequate procedures and controls human error and system failures by a service provider     table of contents  prospectus      tax risk   the fund intends to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company “ric” under subchapter m of chapter  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” in order to qualify for such treatment the fund must derive at least  of its gross income each taxable year from qualifying income meet certain asset diversification tests at the end of each fiscal quarter and distribute at least  of its investment company taxable income the fund’s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to qualify for treatment as a ric an adverse determination or future guidance by the irs might affect the fund’s ability to qualify for such treatment   repurchase offers risk   repurchase offers risk is the risk that the fund’s repurchases of shares may hurt investment performance by forcing the fund to maintain a higher percentage of its assets in liquid investments or to liquidate certain investments when it is not desirable to do so repurchases may be oversubscribed preventing shareholders from selling some or all of their tendered shares back to the fund   antitakeover provisions   the fund’s amended and restated declaration of trust together with any amendments thereto includes provisions that could limit the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the fund or convert the fund to openend status   table of contents  prospectus      fund expenses   the following table describes the fees and expenses you

management investment company registered under the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” the fund was organized as a delaware statutory trust on july   pursuant to a certificate of trust the fund has limited operating history the fund’s principal office is located at  madison avenue st floor new york new york    use of proceeds   the fund will invest the proceeds of the offering of shares “shares” in accordance with its investment objective and policies as stated below it is currently anticipated that the fund will be able to invest all or substantially all of the net proceeds according to its investment objective and policies within approximately three to four months after receipt of the proceeds depending on the amount and timing of proceeds available to the fund as well as the availability of investments consistent with the fund’s investment objective and strategies pending investment of the net proceeds the fund will invest in highquality shortterm debt securities cash andor cash equivalents   investment objective policies and risks   when used in this prospectus the term “invest” includes both direct investing and indirect investing and the term “investments” includes both direct investments and indirect investments for example the fund may invest indirectly by investing in derivatives or a whollyowned and controlled subsidiary the “subsidiary” the fund may be exposed to the different types of investments described below through its investments in the subsidiary  the allocation of the fund’s portfolio in the subsidiary will vary over time and might not always include all of the different types of investments described herein   investment objective   the fund’s investment objective is to achieve longterm capital appreciation there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective   stone ridge asset management llc “stone ridge” or the “adviser” believes that investing in reinsurancerelated securities should involve a longterm view and a systematic focus on sources of expected return not on security selection or market timing in constructing an investment portfolio the adviser identifies a universe of eligible securities with welldefined risk and return characteristics it then seeks to obtain exposure to a meaningful subset of that universe while efficiently managing the portfolio and keeping trading costs low because the risks in reinsurancerelated securities – largely related to natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes and nonnatural catastrophes such as plane crashes – are not similar to the risks investors bear in traditional equities and debt markets the adviser believes that investment in reinsurancerelated securities may provide benefits when added to traditional portfolios as such the adviser does not intend to buy or sell securities for the portfolio based on prospects for the economy or based on movements of traditional equities and debt securities markets   principal investment policies   general composition of the fund   the fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily in reinsurancerelated securities including eventlinked bonds quota share notes excess of loss notes ilw notes and to a lesser extent eventlinked swaps equity securities publicly or privately offered and the derivatives of equity securities of companies in the reinsurance and insurance industry collectively “reinsurancerelated securities” under normal circumstances the fund will invest at least  of its net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in reinsurancerelated securities reinsurancerelated securities typically are “highyield” or below investmentgrade or are unrated reinsurancerelated debt securities that are below investmentgrade may be referred to as “junk bonds” accordingly the fund’s portfolio will be primarily invested in high yield high risk securities high yield securities typically are of below investment grade quality and have below investment grade credit ratings which ratings are associated with securities having high risk speculative characteristics high yield securities may also include securities that are not rated the adviser has broad discretion to allocate the fund’s assets among these investment categories the fund may invest in reinsurancerelated securities across the high yield spectrum but generally intends to focus its investments in higher yielding higher risk securities within the below investmentgrade category the fund has no limit as to the maturity of the securities in which it invests or as to the market capitalization of the issuer to the extent consistent with the repurchase liquidity requirement of an interval fund the fund may invest without limitation in illiquid securities     table of contents  prospectus      eventlinked bonds are variable rate debt securities for which the return of principal and payment of interest are contingent on the nonoccurrence of a specified trigger events that leads to economic andor human loss such as an earthquake of a particular magnitude or a hurricane of a specific category the most common type of eventlinked bonds is known as “catastrophe” or “cat” bonds the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds in one or more of three ways the fund may purchase eventlinked bonds when initially offered the fund may purchase eventlinked bonds in the secondary overthecounter market or the fund may gain indirect exposure to eventlinked bonds using derivatives the fund may pursue other types of eventlinked derivative strategies using derivative instruments that are typically contingent or formulaically related to defined trigger events   trigger events may include hurricanes earthquakes and weatherrelated phenomena nonnatural catastrophes such as plane crashes or other events resulting in a specified level of physical or economic loss such as mortality or longevity trigger events are typically defined by three criteria an event a geographic area in which the event must occur and a threshold of economic or physical loss either actual or modeled caused by the event together with a method to measure such loss in order for a trigger event to be deemed to have occurred each of the three criteria must be satisfied while the bond is outstanding or the derivative position remains open the fund has no limit as to the types of events geographic areas or thresholds of loss referenced by eventlinked bonds in which it can invest generally the event is either a natural or nonnatural peril of a kind that results in significant physical or economic loss natural perils include disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes windstorms fires and floods nonnatural perils include disasters resulting from human activity such as commercial and industrial accidents or business interruptions some eventlinked bonds reference only a single event other eventlinked bonds may reference multiple events the occurrence of any one or other number of which would satisfy these criteria alternatively an eventlinked bond may not specify a particular peril in these cases only the geographic area and threshold of physical or economic loss determines whether a trigger event has occurred   if the trigger events occurs prior to a bond’s maturity or prior to the fund’s closing out a derivative position the fund may lose all or a portion of its principal and forgo additional interest in this regard eventlinked bonds typically have a special condition that states that if the sponsor suffers a loss from a particular predefined catastrophe or other event that results in physical andor economic loss then the issuer’s obligation to pay interest andor repay the principal is either deferred or completely forgiven for example if the fund holds a bond that covers a sponsor’s losses due to a hurricane with a “trigger” at  billion and a hurricane hits causing  billion or more in losses to such sponsor then the fund will lose all or a portion of its principal invested in the bond and forgo all or a portion of any future interest payments if the trigger events does not occur the fund will recover its principal plus interest interest typically accrues and is paid on a quarterly basis for the specified duration of the bond as long as the trigger events does not occur although principal typically is repaid only on the maturity date it may be repaid in installments depending on the terms of the bond   when selecting eventlinked bonds quota share notes and other reinsurancerelated securities for investment the adviser evaluates the evolving universe of reinsurancerelated securities by performing its own analysis based on quantitative and qualitative research the adviser may rely upon information and analysis obtained from brokers dealers and ratings organizations among other sources the adviser then uses quantitative and qualitative analysis to select appropriate reinsurancerelated securities within each triggerevent category trigger event categories include “indemnity triggers” which are tied to the losses of the issuer “parametric triggers” which are tied to the nonoccurrence of specific events with defined parameters “industry loss triggers” which are tied to industrywide losses and “modeled loss triggers” which are tied to the hypothetical losses resulting from a modeled event and could be issuerspecific or industrywide certain investments may have multiple triggers or a combination of the different types of triggers the adviser’s qualitative and quantitative analysis may consider various factors such as transparency sponsor basis risk call provisions alignment of interest and correlation with other investments and will also guide the adviser in determining the desired allocation of reinsurancerelated securities by peril and geographic exposure     table of contents  prospectus      the fund may also gain exposure to reinsurance contracts by holding notes or preferred shares issued by a special purpose vehicle “spv” whose performance is tied to underlying reinsurance transactions including quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes the fund as holder of a note or preferred share issued by the spv would be entitled to participate in the underwriting results and investment earnings associated with the spv’s underlying reinsurance contracts investments in quota share notes provide exposure to a form of proportional reinsurance in which an investor participates in the premiums and losses of a reinsurer’s portfolio according to a predefined percentage for example under a  quotashare agreement the spv would obtain  of all premiums of the subject portfolio while being responsible for  of all claims and the fund as holder of a quota share note issued by the spv would be entitled to its pro rata share of the premiums received by the spv and would be responsible for its pro rata share of the claims up to the total amount invested investments in excess of loss notes provide exposure to a form of reinsurance pursuant to which one party typically an insurer or reinsurer purchases protection against losses that exceed a specified threshold up to a set limit for example under such an arrangement an insurer may have a book of business with  billion of total risk in respect of large catastrophic losses such an insurer can purchase reinsurance protection from an spv for  of singleevent losses the insurer suffers between  billion and  billion by paying the spv a fixed premium in this example if the insurer suffered a loss of  billion due to one event it would cover the first  billion itself and file a reinsurance claim with the spv to pay  of the further  billion in losses ie  million and pay the remaining  million itself if the insurer had losses of  billion it would cover the first  billion itself look to the spv to pay  of  billion again paying the  million itself and would further retain the obligation to pay the additional  billion that exceeds the reinsurance which in this example covered losses between  billion and  billion the “trigger” for this type of reinsurance contract would be losses in excess of the specified amount investments in ilw notes provide exposure to a transaction through which one party typically an insurance or reinsurance company or a reinsurancerelated asset manager purchases protection based on the total loss arising from a catastrophic event to the entire insurance industry rather than the losses of any particular insurer for example the buyer of a “ million limit us wind ilw attaching at  billion” will pay an upfront premium to a protection writer ie the reinsurer or an spv and in return will receive  million if total losses to the insurance industry from a single us hurricane exceed  billion the industry loss  billion in this case is often referred to as the “trigger” and is reported by an independent third party after an event has occurred the amount of protection offered by the contract  million in this case is referred to as the “limit” ilw notes could also provide exposure to transactions linked to an index not linked to insurance industry losses such as windspeed or earthquake magnitude and location  the fund as holder of an ilw note would be entitled to a return linked to the premium paid by the sponsor and the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the trigger event because most eventlinked bonds are rated below investment grade and most quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes are unrated a substantial portion of the fund’s assets may be invested in below investment grade securities similar in some respects to high yield corporate bonds eventlinked catastrophe bonds quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes are exposed to catastrophic insurance risk whereas high yield bonds are typically exposed to the potential default of financially distressed issuers the fund has no limit as to the maturity of the reinsurancerelated securities in which it invests or as to the market capitalization of the issuer the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds quota share notes excess of loss notes ilw notes and debt securities of any credit rating including those rated below investment grade or if unrated determined by the adviser to be of comparable quality with respect to eventlinked bonds the rating if any primarily reflects the rating agency’s calculated probability that a predefined trigger events will occur as well as the overall expected loss to the bond principal in addition to ratings issued by rating agencies eventlinked bonds are generally issued with an attachment probability and expected loss percentage determined by an independent modeler a “risk model” a risk model is created based on historical data and averages as well as scientific and probabilistic analysis and is used to inform investors and others on the potential impact of a wide variety of catastrophic events or other specified events that result in physical andor economic loss the adviser in selecting investments for the fund will generally consider risk models created by independent third parties the sponsor of a reinsurancerelated security or a broker the adviser may also consider its own risk models based on comparable prior transactions quantitative analysis and industry knowledge   table of contents  prospectus      in implementing the fund’s investment strategy stone ridge will seek to invest in reinsurancerelated securities tied to a varied group of available perils and geographic regions further within each region and peril stone ridge seeks to hold a balance of exposures to underlying insurance and reinsurance carriers trigger types and lines of business the adviser will continue to monitor the risk of the fund’s investments on a regular basis   many of the reinsurancerelated securities in which the fund will invest will be issued by nonus issuers as a result the fund may invest substantially in securities issued by foreign sovereigns or by us or foreign entities that are corporations partnerships trusts or other types of business entities   under normal circumstances the fund intends to invest substantially all its assets in reinsurancerelated securities but retains the flexibility to invest at times in other instruments including registered investment companies us government securities cash and cash equivalents the fund may also enter into other types of investments that enable the fund to provide risk transfer services as the adviser may consider appropriate from time to time the fund’s assets may be invested in the subsidiary formed under the laws of the cayman islands and advised by the adviser the subsidiary like the fund is expected to invest primarily in reinsurancerelated securities the fund may invest up to  of its assets at the time of purchase in the subsidiary references herein to the fund include references to the subsidiary in respect of the fund’s exposure to reinsurancerelated securities   the fund may obtain leverage through borrowings in seeking to achieve its investment objective the fund’s borrowings may be on a secured or unsecured basis and at fixed or variable rates of interest the fund’s ability to obtain leverage through borrowings is dependent upon its ability to establish and maintain an appropriate line of credit the  act requires the fund to maintain asset coverage of not less than  with respect to all borrowings this means that the value of the fund’s total indebtedness may not exceed onethird of the value of its total assets including such indebtedness measured at the time the fund incurs the indebtedness   reinsurancerelated securities   the fund will invest substantially in reinsurancerelated securities including “eventlinked” bonds a type of reinsurancerelated security which sometimes are referred to as “insurancelinked” or “catastrophe” bonds quota share notes ilw notes and excess of loss notes   eventlinked bonds eventlinked bonds are variable rate debt securities for which the return of principal and payment of interest are contingent on the nonoccurrence of a specified trigger events that leads to economic andor human loss such as an earthquake of a particular magnitude or a hurricane of a specific category in most cases the trigger events will not be deemed to have occurred unless the events happened in a particular geographic area and was of a certain magnitude based on independent scientific readings andor caused a certain amount of actual or modeled loss geographic areas identified by eventlinked bonds range broadly in scope a limited number of eventlinked bonds do not identify a geographic area meaning that the event can occur anywhere the majority of eventlinked bonds relate to events occurring within the united states or a single state or group of states within the united states europe or a single european country or japan eventlinked bonds also identify a threshold of physical or economic loss the trigger event is deemed to have occurred only if the event meets or exceeds the specified threshold of physical or economic loss some eventlinked bonds base loss on payments actually made by a specific insurance company other eventlinked bonds base loss on modeled payments for a single hypothetical insurer or across the insurance industry or on readings of scientific instruments some eventlinked bonds utilize a combination of these thresholds the fund is entitled to receive principal and interest payments so long as no trigger events occurs of the description and magnitude specified by the instrument eventlinked bonds may be sponsored by government agencies insurance companies reinsurers special purpose corporations or other onshore or offshore entities eventlinked bonds are typically rated by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating agency but also may be unrated the rating for an eventlinked bond if any primarily reflects the rating agency’s calculated probability that a predefined trigger events will occur this rating also reflects the eventlinked bond’s credit risk and the model used to calculate the probability of a trigger event   if a “sponsor” such as an insurance company or reinsurance company a company that insures insurance companies wants to transfer some or all of the risk it assumes in insuring against certain losses it can set up a separate legal structure—commonly known as a special purpose vehicle “spv” municipal state and foreign governments and private companies may also sponsor catastrophe bonds as a hedge against natural or nonnatural disasters the spv is a passive and independent intermediary structure standing between the bond holders and the sponsor immediately after issuing the bonds to investors the spv enters into a “cover agreement” with the sponsor through which the spv provides the sponsor with a protection against specified catastrophic or other similar events the spv generally puts the proceeds received from the bond issuance the “principal” into a trust account the spv uses this principal amount as “collateral” in order to secure its obligation under the cover agreement the principal amount from the bond issuance held as collateral is generally invested into highquality instruments such as us treasury securities or us treasury money market funds the earnings on these high quality instruments as well as insurance premiums paid by the sponsor are used to make periodic variable rate interest payments to investors eg the fund the reinsurancerelated securities typically have rates of interest that reflect the returns of such shortterm collateral investments plus a premium   table of contents  prospectus      as long as the corresponding trigger events covered by the bond—whether a windstorm in europe or an earthquake in california—does not occur during the time investors own the bond investors will receive their interest payments and when the bond matures their principal back from the spv many catastrophe bonds mature in three years although terms generally range from one to five years depending on the bond if the event does occur however the sponsor’s right to the collateral is “triggered” this means the sponsor receives the collateral instead of investors receiving it when the bond matures causing investors to lose most—or all—of their principal and unpaid interest payments when this happens the spv might also have the right to extend the maturity of the bonds to verify that the trigger did occur or to process and audit insurance claims depending on the bond the extension can last anywhere from three months to two years or more   other eventlinked securities the fund may also gain exposure to reinsurance contracts by holding notes or preferred shares issued by an spv whose performance is tied to underlying reinsurance transactions in implementing the fund’s investment strategy stone ridge will seek to invest in reinsurancerelated securities tied to a varied group of available perils and geographic regions further within each region and peril stone ridge seeks to hold a balance of exposures to underlying insurance and reinsurance carriers trigger types and lines of business   liquidity and restricted securities   the fund’s investments in illiquid securities may be substantial the board has delegated to stone ridge the responsibility for determining whether the securities in which the fund invests are liquid or illiquid which stone ridge carries out on a casebycase basis based on procedures approved by the board that set forth various factors relating to the fund’s ability to dispose of such securities in an appropriate manner certain of the instruments in which the fund may invest including most eventlinked bonds quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes are restricted securities in that their disposition is restricted by the federal securities laws or otherwise such as securities offered privately pursuant to section a of the securities act of  the “ act” and securities issued pursuant to rule a under the  act notwithstanding these limitations on resale certain restricted securities may be treated as liquid if stone ridge determines pursuant to the applicable procedures that such treatment is warranted the fund’s board will monitor and periodically review liquidity determinations for certain risks related to the fund’s investments in illiquid instruments see “illiquidity and restricted securities risk” below   below investment grade securities   because most eventlinked bonds are rated below investment grade and most quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes are unrated a substantial portion of the fund’s assets may be invested in below investment grade securities similar in some respects to high yield corporate bonds eventlinked catastrophe bonds quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes are exposed to catastrophic insurance risk whereas high yield bonds are typically exposed to the potential default of financially distressed issuers the fund has no limit as to the maturity of the securities in which it invests or as to the market capitalization of the issuer the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds quota share notes excess of loss notes ilw notes and debt securities of any credit rating including those rated below investment grade commonly referred to as “junk bonds” or if unrated determined by the adviser to be of comparable quality with respect to eventlinked bonds the rating if any primarily reflects the rating agency’s calculated probability that a predefined trigger events will occur as well as the overall expected loss to the bond principal in addition to ratings issued by rating agencies eventlinked bonds are generally issued with an attachment probability and expected loss percentage determined by an independent modeler a “risk model” a risk model is created based on historical data and averages as well as scientific and probabilistic analysis and is used to inform investors and others on the potential impact of a wide variety of catastrophic events or other specified events that result in physical andor economic loss the adviser in selecting investments for the fund will generally consider risk models created by independent third parties the sponsor of a reinsurancerelated security or a broker the adviser may also consider its own risk models based on comparable prior transactions quantitative analysis and industry knowledge  the eventlinked bonds in which the fund may invest may also be subordinated or “junior” to more senior securities of the issuer the investor in a subordinated security of an issuer is generally entitled to payment only after other holders of debt in that issuer have been paid   table of contents  prospectus      a substantial amount of the reinsurancerelated securities in which the fund intends to invest are expected to be structured as variable rate or floatingrate debt securities which will be secured by the collateral contributed by the fund and other investors to the relevant spvs sponsored by the ceding insurer the collateral is typically invested in shortterm instruments such as us treasury securities or us treasury money market funds the reinsurancerelated securities typically have rates of interest that reflect the returns of such shortterm collateral instruments plus a premium   derivatives   the fund may enter into derivatives transactions with respect to any security or other instrument in which it is permitted to invest or any security instrument index or economic indicator related to such instruments “reference instruments” derivatives are financial instruments the value of which is derived from an underlying reference instrument derivatives transactions can involve substantial risk derivatives typically allow the fund to increase or decrease the level of risk to which it is exposed more quickly and efficiently than transactions in other types of instruments the fund incurs costs in connection with opening and closing derivatives positions the fund may engage in the derivative transactions set forth below as well as in other derivative transactions with substantially similar characteristics and risks the fund may but is not required to use futures and options on securities indices and currencies forward foreign currency exchange contracts stock index futures swaps including eventlinked swaps and other derivative instruments the fund may use derivatives for a variety of purposes including i as a hedge against adverse changes in the market prices of securities interest rates or to a lesser extent currency exchange rates ii as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities iii to seek to increase the fund’s return as a nonhedging strategy that may be considered speculative or iv to manage portfolio exposures   derivative transactions generally give rise to a form of leverage leverage may cause the fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged as certain types of leverage may exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the fund’s portfolio securities the loss on leverage transactions may substantially exceed the initial investment the fund may be required to segregate or “earmark” liquid assets or otherwise cover the fund’s obligation created by a transaction that gives rise to leverage the use of leverage may cause the fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or meet certain segregation requirements   nonus investments   the fund may invest directly or indirectly without limit in foreign government and foreign corporate debt securities because the majority of reinsurancerelated security issuers are domiciled outside the united states the fund will normally invest significant amounts of its assets in foreign securities nonus issuers are issuers that are organized andor have their principal offices outside of the united states nonus securities may be issued by nonus governments banks or corporations private issuers or certain supranational organizations such as the world bank and the european union   us government securities   the fund may invest in us government securities which are obligations of or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or governmentsponsored entities us government securities include issues by nongovernmental entities like financial institutions that carry direct guarantees from us government agencies as part of government initiatives although the us government guarantees principal and interest payments on securities issued by the us government and some of its agencies such as securities issued by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae this guarantee does not apply to losses resulting from declines in the market value of these securities some of the us government securities that the fund may hold are not guaranteed or backed by the full faith and credit of the us government such as those issued by fannie mae and freddie mac   equity securities   equity securities include common stocks warrants and rights as well as “equity equivalents” such as preferred stocks and securities convertible into common stock the equity securities in which the fund invests may be publicly or privately offered preferred stocks generally pay a dividend and rank ahead of common stocks and behind debt securities in claims for dividends and for assets of the issuer in a liquidation or bankruptcy the dividend rate of preferred stocks may cause their prices to behave more like those of debt securities a convertible security is one that can be converted into or exchanged for common stock of an issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price upon the occurrence of certain events or according to a price formula convertible securities offer the fund the ability to participate in equity market movements while also seeking some current income convertible debt securities pay interest and convertible preferred stocks pay dividends until they mature or are converted exchanged or redeemed the fund considers some convertible securities to be “equity equivalents” because they are convertible into common stock the credit ratings of those convertible securities generally have less impact on the investment decision although they may still be subject to credit and interest rate risk   table of contents  prospectus      borrowings   the fund may obtain leverage through borrowings in seeking to achieve its investment objective the fund’s borrowings may be on a secured or unsecured basis and at fixed or variable rates of interest the fund’s ability to obtain leverage through borrowings is dependent upon its ability to establish and maintain an appropriate line of credit the  act requires a closedend fund to maintain asset coverage of not less than  of the value of the outstanding amount of senior securities representing indebtedness as defined in the  act this means that the value of the fund’s total indebtedness may not exceed onethird of the value of its total assets including such indebtedness measured at the time the fund incurs the indebtedness the fund also may borrow money from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes in an amount not to exceed  of the fund’s assets such temporary borrowings are not subject to the asset coverage requirements discussed above in connection with the fund’s borrowings for investment purposes   reverse repurchase agreements   the fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements pursuant to which the fund transfers securities to a counterparty in return for cash and agrees to repurchase the securities at a later date and for a higher price reverse repurchase agreements are treated as borrowings by the fund are a form of leverage and may make the value of an investment in the fund more volatile and increase the risks of investing in the fund entering into reverse repurchase agreements and other borrowing transactions may cause the fund to liquidate positions at a disadvantageous time or price in order to satisfy its obligations or meet segregation requirements borrowing money involves transaction and interest costs the fund may pay a commitment fee or other fees to maintain a line of credit and will pay interest on amounts it borrows   to the extent required by sec guidelines if a transaction such as a reverse repurchase agreement exposes the fund to an obligation to another party it will either  enter an offsetting “covered” position for the same type of financial asset or  segregate cash or liquid securities on the books of the custodian with a value sufficient at all times to cover its potential obligations assets used as cover or segregated cannot be sold while the positions requiring cover is open unless replaced with other appropriate assets   subsidiary   the assets of the fund may be invested in the subsidiary which like the fund is expected to invest in reinsurancerelated securities the fund does not expect to invest more than  of its assets at the time of purchase in the subsidiary under an investment management agreement with the subsidiary the adviser will provide the subsidiary with the same type of management services as the adviser provides to the fund if the adviser receives compensation for providing such services to the subsidiary the adviser will not receive compensation from the fund in respect of the assets of the fund that are invested in the subsidiary the fund does not currently intend to sell or transfer all or any portion of its ownership interest in the subsidiary the fund reserves the right to establish an additional subsidiary or subsidiaries subject to the approval of the board of trustees   cash management and temporary investments   normally the fund invests substantially all of its assets to meet its investment objectives the fund may invest the remainder of its assets in securities with remaining maturities of less than one year or cash equivalents or may hold cash for temporary defensive purposes including during periods of unusual cash flows the fund may depart from its principal investment strategies and invest part or all of its assets in these securities or may hold cash the fund may adopt a defensive strategy when the adviser believes securities in which the fund normally invests have special or unusual risks or are less attractive due to adverse market economic political or other conditions   table of contents  prospectus        additional investment practices   in addition to the principal investment strategies described above the fund may also use other investment techniques including the following from timetotime   shortterm trading at times the fund may engage in shortterm trading usually with respect to certain derivative instruments on the types of instruments the fund is permitted to hold in its portfolio if the fund engages in frequent shortterm trading it may incur additional operating expenses which would reduce performance and could cause shareholders to incur a higher level of taxable income or capital gains   securities lending the fund may seek to earn income by lending portfolio securities to brokerdealers or other institutional borrowers the fund does not anticipate lending eventlinked bonds but may lend other portfolio securities loans will only be made to borrowers that have been approved by the adviser the adviser or the securities lending agent will periodically monitor the financial condition of such organizations while any loans are outstanding the fund may lend up to onethird of the value of its total assets including borrowings or such other amount as is permitted under relevant law the fund will not lend portfolio securities if as a result the aggregate of such loans exceeds ⅓ of the value of the fund’s total assets including such loans loan arrangements made by the fund will comply with all other applicable regulatory requirements for securities lending including with respect to changes in market values termination interest paid on loaned securities and ability to call back loaned securities for voting   investments in other investment companies the fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies which can include openend funds closedend funds unit investment trusts and business development companies the fund may invest in exchangetraded funds etfs which are typically openend funds or unit investment trusts listed on a stock exchange one reason the fund might do so is to gain exposure to segments of the markets represented by another fund at times when the fund might not be able to buy the particular type of securities directly as a shareholder of an investment company the fund would be subject to its ratable share of that investment company’s expenses including its advisory and administration expenses the fund does not intend to invest in other investment companies unless the adviser believes that the potential benefits of the investment justify the payment of any premiums or sales charges absent sec exemptive or similar relief the fund’s investments in the securities of other investment companies are subject to the limits that apply to those types of investments under the  act   corporate debt obligations the fund may purchase debt obligations such as bonds debentures notes and preferred stock issued by us and foreign corporations partnerships or other business entities debt securities purchased by the fund may be subordinate to other liabilities of the issuer if a borrower becomes insolvent the borrower’s assets may be insufficient to meet its obligations    portfolio turnover   the fund’s portfolio turnover rate for the fiscal year ended october   was  a high turnover rate  or more necessarily involves greater expenses to the fund   risk considerations   the fund is generally sold to i institutional investors including registered investment advisers rias that meet certain qualifications and have completed a training program provided by the adviser ii clients of such institutional investors and iii certain other eligible investors the minimum initial account size is  million subject to certain exceptions see “investment minimums” investors should carefully consider the fund’s risks and investment objectives as an investment in the fund may not be appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program an investment in the fund involves a high degree of risk the reinsurancerelated securities in which the fund invests are typically considered “high yield” and reinsurancerelated debt securities may be considered “junk bonds” it is possible that investing in the fund may result in a loss of some or all of the amount invested before making an investmentallocation decision investors should i consider the suitability of this investment with respect to an investor’s or a client’s investment objectives and individual situation and ii consider factors such as an investor’s or a client’s net worth income age and risk tolerance investment should be avoided where an investorclient has a shortterm investing horizon andor cannot bear the loss of some or all of the investment   the fund may be subject to the principal risks noted below whether through the fund’s i derivatives positions ii investments through the subsidiary or iii direct investments as with any investment company there is no guarantee that the fund will achieve its investment objective you could lose all or part of your investment in the fund and the fund could underperform other investments   table of contents  prospectus      limited history   the fund has a limited history of operations and thus has limited meaningful operating or financial data on which potential investors may evaluate the fund and its performance and is designed for longterm investors and not as a shortterm trading vehicle   reinsurancerelated securities risk   the principal risk of an investment in a reinsurancerelated security is that a triggering events eg i natural events such as a hurricane tornado or earthquake of a particular sizemagnitude in a designated geographic area or ii nonnatural events such as large aviation disasters will occur and the fund will lose all or a significant portion of the principal it has invested in the security and the right to additional interest payments with respect to the security if multiple triggering events occur that impact a significant portion of the portfolio of the fund the fund could suffer substantial losses and an investor will lose money a majority of the fund’s assets will be invested in reinsurancerelated securities tied to natural events andor nonnatural disasters and there is inherent uncertainty as to whether when or where such events will occur there is no way to accurately predict whether a triggering event will occur and because of this significant uncertainty reinsurancerelated securities carry a high degree of risk   eventlinked bonds eventlinked or catastrophe bonds carry large uncertainties and major risk exposures to adverse conditions if a trigger event as defined within the terms of the bond involves losses or other metrics exceeding a specific magnitude in the geographic region and time period specified therein the fund may lose a portion or all of its investment in such security including accrued interest andor principal invested in such security such losses may be substantial because catastrophe bonds cover “catastrophic” events that if they occur will result in significant losses catastrophe bonds carry a high degree of risk of loss and are considered “high yield” or “junk bonds” the rating if any primarily reflects the rating agency’s calculated probability that a predefined trigger event will occur thus lowerrated bonds have a greater likelihood of a triggering event occurring and loss to the fund   catastrophe bonds quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes are also subject to extension risk the sponsor of such an investment might have the right to extend the maturity of the bond or note to verify that the trigger event did occur or to process and audit insurance claims the typical duration of mandatory and optional extensions of maturity for reinsurancerelated securities currently is between three months to two years in certain circumstances the extension may exceed two years an extension to verify the potential occurrence of a trigger event will reduce the value of the bond or note due to the uncertainty of the occurrence of the trigger event and will hinder the fund’s ability to sell the bond or note even if it is determined that the trigger event did not occur such an extension will delay the fund’s receipt of the bond’s or note’s principal and prevent the reinvestment of such proceeds in other potentially higher yielding securities catastrophe bonds have been in use only since the mid s as a relatively new type of financial instrument there is limited trading history for these securities and in certain instances there may be a limited or no active trading market which may impair the ability of the fund to realize full value in the event of the need to liquidate such assets   quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes the fund may gain exposure directly or through its subsidiary to reinsurance contracts through quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes these securities are subject to the same risks discussed herein for eventlinked or catastrophe bonds in addition because quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes represent an interest either proportional or nonproportional in one or more underlying reinsurance contracts the fund has limited transparency into the individual underlying contracts and therefore must rely upon the risk assessment and sound underwriting practices of the issuer accordingly it may be more difficult for the adviser to fully evaluate the underlying risk profile of the fund’s investment in quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes which will place the fund’s assets at greater risk of loss than if the adviser had more complete information the lack of transparency may also make the valuation of quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes more difficult and potentially result in mispricing that could result in losses to the fund see “illiquidity and restricted securities risk” and “valuation risk” herein in quota share notes trades ilw notes trades and excess of loss notes trades the fund cannot lose more than the amount invested   table of contents  prospectus

broker  the adviser may also consider its own risk models based on comparable prior transactions quantitative analysis and industry knowledge risk models are designed to assist investors governments

use the output of the risk models before and after investment to assist the adviser in assessing the risk of a particular reinsurancerelated security or a group of such securities risk models are created using historical scientific and other related data because such risk models are based in part upon historical data and averages there is no guarantee that such information will accurately predict the future occurrence location or severity of any particular catastrophic event and thus may fail to accurately calculate the probability of a trigger event and may underestimate the likelihood of a trigger event in addition any errors or imperfections in a risk model or in the data on which it is based or any technical issues with the construction of the models including for example data problems andor software or other implementation issues could adversely affect the ability of the adviser to use such analyses or models effectively which in turn could adversely affect the fund’s performance risk models are used by the adviser as one input in its risk analysis process for fund investments   illiquidity and restricted securities risk to the extent consistent with the repurchase liquidity requirement of an interval fund the fund may invest without limitation in illiquid securities liquidity risk is the risk that the reinsurancerelated securities held by the fund may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time that the fund would like or at the price that the fund believes the security is currently worth as a relatively new type of financial instrument there is limited trading history for reinsurancerelated securities the fund may invest substantially in securities that are illiquid there can be no assurances that a liquid market for the fund’s investments will be maintained and the fund’s ability to realize full value in the event of the need to liquidate certain assets may be impaired andor result in losses to the fund even for those securities deemed to be liquid illiquid investments may also be difficult to value   certain of the instruments in which the fund may invest are subject to restrictions on resale by the federal securities laws or otherwise such as securities offered privately pursuant to section a of the  act and securities issued pursuant to rule a under the  act while certain restricted securities may notwithstanding their limitations on resale be treated as liquid if stone ridge determines pursuant to the applicable procedures that such treatment is warranted there can be no guarantee that any such determination will continue restricted securities previously determined to be liquid may subsequently become illiquid while held by the fund even if such restricted securities are not deemed to be illiquid they may nevertheless be difficult to value and the fund may be required to hold restricted securities when it otherwise would sell such securities or may be forced to sell securities at a price lower than the price the fund has valued such securities this may result in losses to the fund and investors   valuation risk the fund is subject to valuation risk which is the risk that one or more of the securities in which the fund invests are priced incorrectly due to factors such as incomplete data market instability or human error in addition pricing of reinsurancerelated securities is subject to the added uncertainty caused by the inability to generally predict whether when or where a natural disaster or other triggering event will occur the fund’s investments in reinsurancerelated securities for which market quotations are not available will be valued pursuant to procedures adopted by the board upon the occurrence or possible occurrence of a trigger event and until the completion of the processing and auditing of applicable loss claims the fund’s investment in a reinsurancerelated security may be priced using fair value methods portfolio securities that are valued using techniques other than market quotations including fair valued securities may be subject to greater fluctuation in their value from one day to the next than would be the case if market quotations were used in addition there is no assurance that the fund could sell a portfolio security for the value established for it at any time and it is possible that the fund would incur a loss if a portfolio security is sold at a discount to its established value if securities are mispriced investors could lose money if and when the fund repurchases their shares because the value of the shares sold is worth more due to the mispricing or could pay too much for shares purchased because the fund overvalued the shares due to the mispricing   moral hazard risk reinsurancerelated securities are generally subject to one or more types of triggers including socalled “indemnitytriggers” an indemnity trigger is a trigger based on the actual losses of the ceding sponsor ie the party seeking reinsurance reinsurancerelated securities subject to indemnity triggers are often regarded as being subject to potential moral hazard since such reinsurancerelated securities are triggered by actual losses of the ceding sponsor and the ceding sponsor may have an incentive to take actions andor risks that would have an adverse effect on the fund for example if an eventlinked bond issued will be triggered at  million in losses to the sponsor once that trigger is hit ie the sponsor experiences  million in losses under the contracts it has written the bond purchaser will lose all or a portion of its principal invested plus any additional interest in this situation the ceding sponsor has an incentive to pay the claims more generously when the loss amount is near the trigger amount set in the bond ie to claim  million in losses when perhaps it could be argued that actual losses were  million thus bonds with indemnity triggers may be subject to moral hazard because the trigger depends on the ceding sponsor to properly identify and calculate losses that do and do not apply in determining whether the trigger amount has been reached in short “moral hazard” refers to this potential for the sponsor to influence bond performance as payouts are based on the individual policy claims against the sponsor and the way the sponsor settles those claims   table of contents  prospectus      limited availability and reinvestment risk investments in reinsurancerelated securities may be limited which may limit the amount of assets the fund may be able to invest in reinsurancerelated securities the limited availability of reinsurancerelated securities may be due to a number of factors including seasonal concentration of issuances limited selection that meets the fund’s investment objective and lack of availability of reinsurancerelated securities in the secondary market original issuances of eventlinked bonds and in particular hurricanerelated catastrophe bonds may be concentrated in the first two calendar quarters of each year while original issuances of quota share notes and excess of loss notes may be concentrated in particular reinsurance renewal months january and to a lesser extent april june and july thereafter the availability of reinsurancerelated securities is subject to natural fluctuations in the secondary market therefore if reinsurancerelated securities held by the fund mature or if the fund must sell securities to meet repurchase requests the fund may be required to hold more cash than it normally would until reinsurancerelated securities meeting the fund’s investment objectives become available due to the potentially limited availability of additional reinsurancerelated securities the fund may be forced to reinvest in securities that are lower yielding or less desirable than the securities the fund sold this is known as reinvestment risk and may reduce the overall return on its portfolio securities   investments in nonvoting securities risk to the extent the fund contractually forgoes its right to vote securities or purchases nonvoting securities of an spv it will not be able to vote on matters that require the approval of the investors in the spv including matters that could adversely affect the fund’s investment in the spv if the reinsurancerelated securities in which the fund invests carry voting rights the fund ordinarily will limit such investments to  or less of the issuing spv’s outstanding voting securities however to enable the fund to invest more of its assets in certain spvs deemed attractive by the adviser the fund may also contractually forego its right to vote securities or may purchase nonvoting securities of such spvs if the fund does not limit its voting rights and is deemed an “affiliate” of the spv the ability of the fund to make future investments in the spv or to engage in other transactions would be severely limited by the requirements of the  act such limitations may interfere with portfolio management of the fund which may adversely impact the fund’s performance   for various reasons the fund may hold some or all of its interest in an spv in nonvoting form one reason for this is to avoid an spv being deemed an “affiliated person” of the fund for purposes of the  act accordingly the fund may agree to waive irrevocably any right that the fund may have to vote securities in amounts in excess of  of an spv’s outstanding voting securities the general policy to waive voting rights has been reviewed by the board the waiver of the fund’s voting rights does not facilitate investments in an spv by the adviser or other clients of the adviser either as a practical or a legal matter and is not intended to confer any benefit on such entities interests in a particular spv even without voting rights are selected based on the investment merits of those interests consistent with the fiduciary duties of both the adviser and the board and generally reflect the judgment of the adviser that such investments are an attractive and appropriate opportunity for the fund for any number of reasons   to the extent the fund holds nonvoting securities of a spv or contractually foregoes its right to vote securities of an spv it will not be able to vote to the full extent of its economic interest on matters that require the approval of the investors in the spv this restriction could diminish the influence of the fund in an spv and adversely affect its investment in the spv which could result in unpredictable and potentially adverse effects on shareholders moreover there is a risk that a court or securities regulators could disregard the statutory definition of “affiliated person” and still treat the spv as an affiliated person of the fund for purposes of the  act   reinsurance industry risk the performance of reinsurancerelated securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events including weather natural disasters hurricanes earthquakes etc nonnatural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical andor economic loss triggering events are typically defined by three criteria an event a geographic area in which the event must occur and a threshold of economic or physical loss caused by the event together with a method to measure such loss generally the event is either a natural or nonnatural peril of a kind that results in significant physical or economic loss natural perils include disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes windstorms fires and floods nonnatural perils include disasters resulting from human activity such as commercial and industrial accidents or business interruptions major natural disasters in populated areas such as in the cases of hurricane katrina in new orleans in  and super storm sandy in the new york city metropolitan area in  or related to highvalue insured property such as plane crashes can result in significant losses and investors in reinsurancerelated securities tied to such exposures may also experience substantial losses if the likelihood and severity of natural and other large disasters increase the risk of significant losses to reinsurers may increase typically one significant triggering event even in a major metropolitan area will not result in financial failure to a reinsurer however a series of major triggering events could cause the failure of a reinsurer similarly to the extent the fund invests in reinsurancerelated securities for which a triggering event occurs losses associated with such event will result in losses to the fund and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurancerelated securities held by the fund will result in substantial losses to the fund in addition unexpected events such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks could lead to government intervention political judicial and legal developments affecting the reinsurance industry could also create new and expanded theories of liability or regulatory or other requirements such changes could have a material adverse effect on the fund   table of contents  prospectus        floatingrate instrument risks   a significant percentage of the reinsurancerelated securities in which the fund invests are expected to be variable rate or floatingrate eventlinked bonds floatingrate instruments and similar investments may be illiquid or less liquid than other investments in addition while the collateral securing most eventlinked bonds in which the fund currently intends to invest is typically invested in lowrisk investments certain spvs in which the fund invests may permit investment of collateral in higher risk higher yielding investments thus the value of collateral if any securing the fund’s investments in eventlinked bonds can decline or may be insufficient to meet the issuer’s obligations and the collateral if repaid to the fund may be difficult to liquidate market quotations for these securities may be volatile andor subject to large spreads between bid and ask prices   subsidiary risk   by investing in the subsidiary the fund is exposed to the risks associated with the subsidiary’s investments the subsidiary will not be registered as an investment company under the  act and will not be subject to all of the investor protections of the  act although the subsidiary will be managed pursuant to compliance policies and procedures that are materially the same as the policies and procedures applicable to the fund changes in the laws of the united states andor the cayman islands could result in the inability of the fund andor the subsidiary to operate as described in this prospectus and could adversely affect the fund   borrowing risk   the fund may borrow to meet repurchase requests or for investment purposes ie to purchase additional portfolio securities the fund’s borrowings may be on a secured or unsecured basis and at fixed or variable rates of interest the fund’s ability to obtain leverage through borrowings is dependent upon its ability to establish and maintain an appropriate line of credit the use of leverage including through borrowings will increase volatility of the fund’s investment portfolio and magnify the fund’s investment losses or gains borrowing also will cost the fund interest expense and other fees the cost of borrowing may reduce the fund’s return  in addition to any more stringent terms imposed by a lender the  act requires a closedend fund to maintain asset coverage of not less than  of the value of the outstanding amount of senior securities representing indebtedness as defined in the  act and generally requires a closedend fund to make provision to prohibit the declaration of any dividend except a dividend payable in stock of the fund or distribution on the fund’s stock or the repurchase of any of the fund’s stock unless at the time of the declaration or repurchase there is asset coverage of at least  after deducting the amount of the dividend distribution or purchase price as the case may be to satisfy  act requirements in connection with borrowings or to meet obligations under maturing loans the fund may be required to dispose of portfolio securities when such disposition might not otherwise be desirable   leveraging risk   the fund may borrow or enter into derivative transactions for investment purposes which will cause the fund to incur investment leverage therefore the fund is subject to leveraging risk leverage magnifies the fund’s exposure to declines in the value of one or more underlying investments or creates investment risk with respect to a larger pool of assets than the fund would otherwise have this risk is enhanced for the fund because it invests substantially all its assets in reinsurancerelated securities reinsurancerelated securities can quickly lose all or much of their value if a triggering event occurs thus to the extent assets subject to a triggering event are leveraged the losses could substantially outweigh the fund’s investment and result in significant losses to the fund the value of an investment in the fund will be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent the fund borrows or uses derivatives or other investments that have embedded leverage engaging in such transactions may cause the fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet segregation requirements   table of contents  prospectus      effects of leverage   assuming that leverage will represent approximately  of the fund’s total assets including the amounts of such leverage and that the fund will bear expenses relating to that leverage at an annual effective interest rate of  based on estimated market interest rates for such financings under current market conditions the annual return that the fund’s portfolio must experience net of expenses in order to cover such costs of the leverage would be less than  these figures are merely estimates based on current market conditions used for illustration purposes only actual expenses associated with leverage used by the fund may vary frequently and may be significantly higher or lower than the rate used for the example above   the following table is furnished in response to requirements of the sec it is designed to illustrate the effects of leverage on common share total return assuming investment portfolio total returns consisting of income and changes in the value of investments held in the fund’s portfolio of     and  these assumed investment portfolio returns are hypothetical figures and are not necessarily indicative of the investment portfolio returns expected to be experienced by the fund the table further assumes that the fund utilizes borrowings representing approximately  of the funds total assets including the amounts of leverage obtained through the use of such borrowings and a projected annual rate of interest on the funds borrowings of  as discussed above your actual returns may be greater or less than those appearing below   assumed return on portfolio net of expenses        common share total return          common share total return is composed of two elements–the common share dividends paid by the fund the amount of which is largely determined by the net investment income of the fund after paying interest expenses on the fund’s leveraging transactions as described above and dividend payments on any preferred shares issued by the fund and gains or losses on the value of the securities the fund owns this table reflects the hypothetical performance of the fund’s portfolio and not the performance of the fund’s common shares the value of which will be determined by market forces and other factors   the fund currently uses leverage as a liquidity source to meet redemption needs and to fund the timing differences related to the purchase of quota share notes and may consider other potential uses in the future  the funds willingness to use leverage and the extent to which leverage is used at any time will depend on many factors including stone ridges assessment of the yield curve environment interest rate trends market conditions and other factors    derivative risk   derivatives are financial contracts the value of which depends on or is derived from the underlying security or other reference asset derivatives involve the risk that changes in their value may not move as expected relative to changes in the value of the underlying reference they are designed to track the fund may invest in derivatives for investment purposes and for hedging and risk management purposes derivatives risk may be more significant when derivatives are used to enhance return or as a substitute for a cash investment position rather than solely to hedge the risk of a position held by the fund see the statement of additional information for additional information of the various types and uses of derivatives in the fund’s strategies the use of derivatives involves risks that are in addition to and potentially greater than the risks of investing directly in securities and other more traditional assets in particular the fund’s use of otc derivatives exposes it to the risk that the counterparties will be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments or otherwise honor their obligations an otc derivatives contract typically can be closed only with the consent of the other party to the contract if the counterparty defaults the fund will still have contractual remedies but may not be able to enforce them because the contract for each otc derivative is individually negotiated the counterparty may interpret contractual terms differently than the fund and if it does the fund may decide not to pursue its claims against the counterparty to avoid incurring the cost and unpredictability of legal proceedings the fund therefore may be unable to obtain payments the adviser believes are owed to it under otc derivatives contracts or those payments may be delayed or made only after the fund has incurred the costs of litigation   table of contents  prospectus    the fund may invest in derivatives that i do not require the counterparty to post collateral eg foreign currency forwards ii require collateral but that do not provide for the fund’s security interest in it to be perfected iii require a significant upfront deposit by the fund unrelated to the derivative’s intrinsic value or iv do not require that collateral be regularly markedtomarket when a counterparty’s obligations are not fully secured by collateral the fund runs the risk of having limited recourse if the counterparty defaults even when obligations are required by contract to be collateralized the fund often will not receive the collateral the day the collateral is required to be posted the fund may invest in derivatives with a limited number of counterparties and events affecting the creditworthiness of any of those counterparties may have a pronounced effect on the fund during periods of market disruptions or stress the fund may have a greater need for cash to provide collateral for large swings in its marktomarket obligations under the derivatives in which it has invested derivatives also present other risks described in this prospectus including marketrelated risk illiquidity risk currency risk and credit risk many derivatives in particular otc derivatives are complex and their valuation often requires modeling and judgment which increases the risk of mispricing or improper valuation the pricing models used may not produce valuations that are consistent with the values the fund realizes when it closes or sells an otc derivative valuation risk is more pronounced when the fund enters into otc derivatives with specialized terms because the value of those derivatives in some cases is determined only by reference to similar derivatives with more standardized terms as a result incorrect valuations may result in increased cash payments to counterparties undercollateralization andor errors in the calculation of the fund’s nav the fund’s use of derivatives may not be effective or have the desired results moreover suitable derivatives will not be available in all circumstances in addition the adviser may decide not to use derivatives to hedge or otherwise reduce the fund’s risk exposures potentially resulting in losses for the fund otc derivatives are highly susceptible to illiquidity risk because many derivatives have a leverage component ie a notional value in excess of the assets needed to establish andor maintain the derivative position adverse changes in the value or level of the underlying investment may result in a loss substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative itself see “leveraging risk” above there is little case or other law interpreting the terms of most derivatives or characterizing their tax treatment the fund’s use of derivatives may be subject to special tax rules and could generate additional taxable income for shareholders see “distributions and federal income tax matters” below options risk a decision as to whether when and how to use options involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a wellconceived and wellexecuted options program may be adversely affected by market behavior or unexpected events successful options strategies may require the anticipation of future movements in securities prices or other economic factors of the underlying investments no assurances can be given that the adviser’s judgment in this respect will be correct the market price of written options will be affected by many factors including changes in the market price or other economic attributes of the underlying investment changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the relevant market and underlying investment and the time remaining before an option’s expiration the market price of options particularly otc options may be adversely affected if the market for the options becomes less liquid or smaller the fund may close out a written option position by buying the option instead of letting it expire or be exercised there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the fund seeks to close out an option position by buying or selling the option reasons for the absence of a liquid secondary market on an exchange include the following i there may be insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions may be imposed by an exchange on opening transactions or closing transactions or both iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions may be imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options iv unusual or unforeseen circumstances may interrupt normal operations on an exchange v the facilities of an exchange or clearinghouse may not at all times be adequate to handle current trading volume or vi a regulator or one or more exchanges could for economic or other reasons decide to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options at some future date if trading were discontinued the secondary market on that exchange or in that class or series of options would cease to exist   table of contents  prospectus    swaps risk the fund may obtain eventlinked exposure by investing in among other things eventlinked swaps which typically are contingent or formulaically related to defined trigger events or by pursuing similar eventlinked derivative strategies trigger events include hurricanes earthquakes weatherrelated phenomena and other criteria determined by independent parties if a trigger events occurs the fund may lose the swap’s notional amount as derivative instruments eventlinked swaps are subject to risks in addition to the risks of investing in reinsurancerelated securities including risks associated with the counterparty and leverage   below investment grade securities risk   the fund can invest without limit in reinsurancerelated securities that are rated below investment grade bonds that are below investment grade are commonly called “junk bonds” which are bonds rated below bbb by standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” or baa by moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” or that have comparable ratings by another rating organization the rating primarily reflects the rating agency’s calculated probability that a predefined trigger event will occur therefore securities with a lower rating reflect the rating agency’s assessment of the substantial risk that a triggering event will occur and result in a loss the rating also reflects the reinsurancerelated security’s credit risk and the model used to calculate the probability of the trigger event the rating system for reinsurancerelated securities is relatively new and significantly less developed than that of corporate bonds and continues to evolve as the market develops there is no minimum rating on the instruments in which the fund may invest the fund may also invest without limit in reinsurancerelated securities that are unrated and are judged by the adviser to be of below investment grade quality most rating agencies rely upon one or more of the reports prepared by the following three independent catastrophemodeling firms eqecat inc air worldwide corporation and risk management solutions inc the adviser may use reports from one or more of these modeling firms as part of its investment process or may create its own internal risk model for this purpose different methodologies are used to evaluate the probability of various types of predefined trigger events if the reports used by the rating agency are flawed it may cause a rating agency to assign a rating to a reinsurancerelated security that is not justified therefore to the extent the adviser relies on rating agency ratings to select securities for the fund the fund may be exposed to greater risks additionally because there are few major independent catastrophemodeling firms the effects of a flawed model or report issued by one or more of such firms will be magnified   credit risk   the reinsurancerelated securities in which the fund invests will be subject to credit risk the principal invested in many reinsurancerelated securities is held by the spv in a collateral account and invested in various permissible assets set forth under the terms of the spv in these cases typically the collateral account is invested in high quality us government securities ie us treasury bonds however in certain reinsurancerelated securities the collateral account may be invested in high yielding higher risk securities collateral will generally be invested in accordance with the terms of the spv and overseen by a collateral manager appointed by the spv therefore the fund is dependent upon the manager to invest the collateral account proceeds appropriately a small portion of the reinsurancerelated securities in which the fund invests may in lieu of such collateral account arrangements provide for the collateral to be held by the reinsurer when a collateral account is invested in higher yielding higher risk securities or when the collateral is held directly by the reinsurer the fund will be subject to the risk of nonpayment of scheduled principal and interest on such collateral such nonpayments and defaults may reduce the income to the fund and negatively impact the value of fund shares   foreign investing risk   the fund may invest in reinsurancerelated securities issued by foreign sovereigns and foreign entities that are corporations partnerships trusts or other types of business entities because the majority of reinsurancerelated security issuers are domiciled outside the us the fund will normally invest significant amounts of its assets in nonus entities accordingly the fund may invest without limitation in securities issued by nonus entities including those in emerging market countries certain spvs in which the fund invests may be sponsored by nonus insurers that are not subject to the same regulation as that to which us insurers are subject such spvs may pose a greater risk of loss for example due to less stringent underwriting andor riskretention requirements the fund’s investments will consist primarily of eventlinked bonds quota share notes excess of loss notes and ilw notes that provide the fund with contractual rights under the terms of the issuance while the contractual rights of eventlinked bonds and quota share notes are similar whether they are issued by a us issuer or a nonus issuer there may be certain additional risks associated with nonus issuers for example foreign issuers could be affected by factors not present in the us including expropriation confiscatory taxation lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards less publicly available financial and other information potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and increased costs to enforce applicable contractual obligations outside the us fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange controls may adversely affect the market value of the fund’s investments in foreign securities see “foreign currency risk” below settlements of securities transactions in foreign countries are subject to risk of loss may be delayed and are generally less frequent than in the us which could affect the liquidity of the fund’s assets   table of contents  prospectus      foreign currency risk   it is expected that a substantial portion of the fund’s investments in reinsurancerelated securities will be us dollar denominated investments to the extent the fund invests in nonus denominated instruments a change in the value of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in a change in the us dollar value of securities denominated in that foreign currency if the us dollar rises in value against a foreign currency a security denominated in that currency will be worth less in us dollars and if the us dollar decreases in value against a foreign currency a security denominated in that currency will be worth more in us dollars the dollar value of foreign investments may also be affected by exchange controls currency risk also includes the risk that the currency to which the fund has obtained exposure through hedging declines in value relative to the currency being hedged in which event the fund may realize a loss both on the hedging instrument and on the currency being hedged   equity investing risk   the fund may at times invest in equity securities which may be publicly or privately offered  the equity securities in which the fund invests may be more volatile than the equity market as a whole equity securities risk is the risk that the value of equity instruments to which the fund is exposed will fall due to general market or economic conditions overall market changes local regional or global political social or economic instability currency interest rate and commodity price fluctuations perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers participate and the particular circumstances and performance of the issuers market conditions may affect certain types of equity securities to a greater extent than other types although equities have historically generated higher average returns than debt securities over the long term equity securities also have experienced significantly more volatility in returns equities to which the fund will be exposed are structurally subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater dividend risk than debt instruments of such issuers finally the prices of equities may be sensitive to rising interest rates as the costs of capital rise and borrowing costs increases preferred securities risk preferred securities may pay fixed or adjustable rates of return preferred securities are subject to issuerspecific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities in addition preferred securities generally pay a dividend and rank ahead of common stocks and behind debt securities in claims for dividends and for assets of the issuer in a liquidation or bankruptcy for this reason the value of preferred securities will usually react more strongly than bonds and other debt to actual or perceived changes in the company’s financial condition or prospects preferred securities may also be sensitive to changes in interest rates when interest rates rise the fixed dividend on preferred securities may be less attractive causing the price of preferred stocks to decline preferred securities of smaller companies may be more vulnerable to adverse developments than preferred stock of larger companies nondiversification risk the fund is classified as a “nondiversified” fund under the  act accordingly the fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than if it were a “diversified” fund to the extent that the fund invests a higher percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer the fund is subject to a higher degree of risk associated with and developments affecting that issuer than a fund that invests more widely   table of contents  prospectus    management and operational risk the fund is subject to management risk because it relies on the adviser’s ability to achieve its investment objective the fund runs the risk that the adviser’s investment techniques will fail to produce desired results and cause the fund to incur significant losses the adviser may fail to use derivatives effectively may select investments that do not perform as anticipated by the adviser and may choose to hedge or not to hedge positions at disadvantageous times any imperfections errors or limitations in quantitative analyses and models used by the adviser as part of its investment process could affect the fund’s performance models that appear to explain prior market data can fail to predict future market events further the data used in models may be inaccurate or may not include the most recent information about a company or a security the fund also is subject to the risk of loss as a result of other services provided by the adviser and other service providers including pricing administrative accounting tax legal custody transfer agency and other services operational risk includes the possibility of loss caused by inadequate procedures and controls human error and system failures by a service provider for example trading delays or errors both human and systematic could prevent the fund from benefiting from potential investment gains or avoiding losses with the increased use of technologies and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions investment companies such as the fund and their service providers including the adviser may be prone to operational and information security risks resulting from cyberattacks andor other technological malfunctions in general cyberattacks are deliberate but unintentional events may have similar effects cyberattacks include among others stealing or corrupting data maintained online or digitally preventing legitimate users from accessing information or services on a website releasing confidential information without authorization and causing operational disruption successful cyberattacks against or security breakdowns of the fund the adviser or the custodian transfer agent or other thirdparty service provider may adversely affect the fund or its shareholders for instance cyberattacks may interfere with the processing of shareholder transactions affect the funds ability to calculate its nav cause the release of private shareholder information or confidential fund information impede trading cause reputational damage and subject the fund to regulatory fines penalties or financial losses reimbursement or other compensation costs and additional compliance costs while the adviser has established business continuity plans and systems designed to prevent cyberattacks there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified     table of contents  prospectus      tax risk   the fund intends to qualify for treatment as a ric under the code in order to qualify for such treatment the fund must derive at least  of its gross income each taxable year from qualifying income meet certain asset diversification tests at the end of each fiscal quarter and distribute at least  of its investment company taxable income the fund’s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to qualify for treatment as a ric an adverse determination or future guidance by the irs might affect the fund’s ability to qualify for such treatment   if in any year the fund were to fail to qualify for treatment as a ric under the code for any reason and were not able to cure such failure the fund would be subject to tax on its taxable income at corporate rates and all distributions from earnings and profits including any distributions of net taxexempt income and net longterm capital gains would be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income   prepayment or call risk   many fixed income securities give the issuer the option to prepay or call the security prior to its maturity date issuers often exercise this right when interest rates fall accordingly if the fund holds a fixed income security that can be prepaid or called prior to its maturity date it may not benefit fully from the increase in value that other fixed income securities generally experience when interest rates fall upon prepayment of the security the fund also would be forced to reinvest the proceeds at then current yields which would be lower than the yield of the security that was prepaid or called in addition if the fund purchases a fixed income security at a premium at a price that exceeds its stated par or principal value the fund may lose the amount of the premium paid in the event of prepayment   extension risk   during periods of rising interest rates the average life of certain types of securities may be extended because of slower than expected principal payments this may lock in a below market interest rate increase the security’s duration the estimated period until the security is paid in full and reduce the value of the security   qib qualification risk   the eventlinked bonds and quota share notes in which the fund invests are only available to qualified institutional buyers “qibs” as defined in rule a under the  act at any given time the fund may not have sufficient assets to be deemed a qib for purposes of rule a whether because investment losses or repurchases cause the fund’s assets to drop below the threshold amount or for other reasons in the event the fund does not qualify as a qib it will not be able to purchase additional eventlinked bonds or quota share notes which may prevent the fund from achieving its investment objective   subordinated securities risk   certain spvs in which the fund invests may issue multiple tranches of interests to investors a holder of securities that are subordinated or “junior” to more senior securities of an issuer is entitled to payment after holders of more senior securities of the issuer subordinated securities are more likely to suffer a credit loss than nonsubordinated securities of the same issuer any loss incurred by the subordinated securities is likely to be proportionately greater and any recovery of interest or principal may take more time as a result even a perceived decline in creditworthiness of the issuer is likely to have a greater impact on them   government securities risk   the fund may invest directly or indirectly in securities issued or guaranteed by the us government including us treasury obligations which differ in their interest rates maturities and times of issuance or its agencies and instrumentalities such as the government national mortgage association ginnie mae the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac us government securities are subject to marketrelated risk risks related to changes in interest rates and credit risk securities such as those issued or guaranteed by ginnie mae or the us treasury that are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states are guaranteed only as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity and the market prices for such securities will fluctuate notwithstanding that these securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states circumstances could arise that would prevent the payment of interest or principal this would result in losses to the fund securities issued or guaranteed by us government related organizations such as fannie mae and freddie mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government and no assurance can be given that the us government would provide financial support therefore us governmentrelated organizations may not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future as a result of their high credit quality and market liquidity us government securities generally provide a lower current return than obligations of other issuers in addition the us treasury department placed fannie mae and freddie mac into conservatorship in september  they remain in conservatorship and the effect that this will have on the companies’ debt and equity securities is unclear although the us government has recently provided financial support to fannie mae and freddie mac there can be no assurance that it will continue to support these or other governmentsponsored entities in the future further the benefits of any such government support may extend only to the holders of certain classes of an issuer’s securities   table of contents  prospectus      focused investment risk   issuers of eventlinked bonds and other reinsurancerelated securities are generally classified as belonging to the financial services sector however the fund has no current intention to invest in banks or other issuers that may be commonly considered in the financial services sector as a result of this categorization of reinsurancerelated securities the fund may be subject to the risks of such focused investing the industries within the financial services sector are subject to extensive government regulation which can limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make and the interest rates and fees they can charge profitability can be largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and the rate of corporate and consumer debt defaults and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers can negatively affect the financial services industries insurance companies can be subject to severe price competition the financial services industries are currently undergoing relatively rapid change as existing distinctions between financial service segments become less clear for example recent business combinations have included insurance finance and securities brokerage under single ownership nonus financial services companies including insurance companies may be subject to different levels of regulation than that to which similar companies operating in the us are subject similarly to the extent the fund has exposure to a significant extent in investments tied economically to a specific geographic region country or a particular market it will have more exposure to regional and country economic risks than it would if it had more geographically diverse investments   cash management risk   the value of the investments held by the fund for cash management or temporary defensive purposes may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in credit ratings of the investments to the extent that the fund has any uninvested cash the fund will be subject to risk with respect to the depository institution holding the cash during such periods it may be more difficult for the fund to achieve its investment objectives   securities lending risk   as with other extensions of credit there are risks of delay and costs involved in recovery of securities or even loss of rights in the securities loaned or in the collateral if the borrower of the securities fails to return the securities or fails financially these delays and costs could be greater with respect to foreign securities the fund may pay lending fees to the party arranging the loan securities lending collateral may be invested in liquid shortterm investments such as money market funds managed by third party advisers or banks the fund bears the risk of investments made with the cash collateral received by the fund in securities lending transactions investments of cash collateral may depreciate andor become illiquid although the fund remains obligated to return the collateral amount to the borrower upon termination or maturity of the securities loan and may realize losses on the collateral investments andor be required to liquidate other portfolio assets in order to satisfy its obligations   quantitative model risk   the fund may use quantitative methods to select investments securities or other investments selected using quantitative methods may perform differently from the market as a whole or from their expected performance for many reasons including factors used in building the quantitative analytical framework the weights placed on each factor and changing sources of market returns among others any errors or imperfections in the quantitative analyses or models of the adviser or any third party or in the data on which they are based could adversely affect the ability of the adviser to use such analyses or models effectively which in turn could adversely affect the fund’s performance there can be no assurance that these methodologies will help the fund to achieve its objective   table of contents  prospectus      expense risk   your actual costs of investing in the fund may be higher than the expenses shown in “annual fund operating expenses” for a variety of reasons for example expense ratios may be higher than those shown if overall net assets decrease net assets are more likely to decrease and fund expense ratios are more likely to increase when markets are volatile   investing in other investment companies risk   investing in other investment companies subjects the fund to the risks of investing in the underlying securities or assets held by those investment companies when investing in another investment company the fund will bear a pro rata portion of the underlying fund’s expenses in addition to its own expenses   repurchase offers risk   as described under “periodic repurchase offers” below the fund is an “interval fund”   in order to provide liquidity to shareholders the fund subject to applicable law conducts quarterly repurchase offers typically for  of the fund’s outstanding shares at nav subject to approval of the board in all cases such repurchases will be for at least  and not more than  of its outstanding shares at nav pursuant to rule c under the  act the fund believes that these repurchase offers are generally beneficial to the fund’s shareholders and repurchases generally will be funded from available cash or sales of portfolio securities however repurchase offers and the need to fund repurchase obligations may affect the ability of the fund to be fully invested or may force the fund to maintain a higher percentage of its assets in liquid investments which may harm the fund’s investment performance moreover diminution in the size of the fund through repurchases may result in untimely sales of portfolio securities with associated imputed transaction costs which may be significant and may limit the ability of the fund to participate in new investment opportunities or to achieve its investment objective if the fund employed investment leverage repurchases of shares would compound the adverse effects of leverage in a declining market in addition if the fund borrows money to finance repurchases interest on that borrowing will negatively affect shareholders who do not tender their shares by increasing fund expenses and reducing any net investment income if a repurchase offer is oversubscribed and the fund determines not to effect additional repurchases beyond the repurchase offer amount or if shareholders tender an amount greater than that which the fund is entitled to purchase the fund will effect repurchases on a pro rata basis and shareholders will have to wait until the next repurchase offer to make another repurchase request as a result shareholders may be unable to liquidate all or a given percentage of their investment in the fund at nav during a particular repurchase offer some shareholders in anticipation of proration may tender more shares than they wish to have repurchased in a particular quarter thereby increasing the likelihood that proration will occur a shareholder may be subject to market and other risks and the nav of shares tendered in a repurchase offer may decline to the extent there is any delay between the repurchase request deadline and the date on which the nav for tendered shares is determined in addition the repurchase of shares by the fund may be a taxable event to shareholders   antitakeover provisions   the fund’s amended and restated declaration of trust together with any amendments thereto includes provisions that could limit the ability of other

the fund’s nav per share may change materially between the date a repurchase offer is mailed and the repurchase request deadline and it may also change materially between the repurchase request deadline and repurchase pricing date the method by which the fund calculates nav is discussed below under “determination of nav” during the period an offer to repurchase is open shareholders may obtain the current nav by calling the fund’s transfer agent at     the fund does not currently charge a repurchase fee however the fund may charge a repurchase fee of up to  which the fund would retain to help offset nonde minimis estimated costs related to the repurchase such as bid to ask spreads incurred by the fund directly or indirectly as a result of repurchasing shares thus allocating estimated transaction costs to the shareholder whose shares are being repurchased the fund may introduce or modify the amount of a repurchase fee at any time the fund may also waive or reduce the repurchase fee if the adviser determines that the repurchase is offset by a corresponding purchase or if for other reasons the fund will not incur transaction costs or will incur reduced transaction costs   table of contents  prospectus      suspension or postponement of repurchase offers   the fund may suspend or postpone a repurchase offer in limited circumstances set forth in rule c under the  act as described below but only with the approval of a majority of the trustees including a majority of trustees who are not “interested persons” of the fund as defined in the  act   the fund may suspend or postpone a repurchase offer only  if making or effecting the repurchase offer would cause the fund to lose its status as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended  if making or effecting the repurchase offer would cause the shares that are subject to the offer that are either listed on a national securities exchange or quoted in an interdealer quotation system of a national securities association to be neither listed on any national securities exchange nor quoted on any interdealer quotation system of a national securities association  for any period during which the new york stock exchange “nyse” or any other market in which the securities owned by the fund are principally traded is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings or during which trading in such market is restricted  for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal by the fund of securities owned by it is not reasonably practicable or during which it is not reasonably practicable for the fund fairly to determine the value of its net assets or  for such other periods as the sec may by order permit for the protection of shareholders of the fund   oversubscribed repurchase offers   there is no minimum number of shares that must be tendered before the fund will honor repurchase requests however the fund’s trustees set for each repurchase offer a maximum percentage of shares that may be repurchased by the fund in the event a repurchase offer by the fund is oversubscribed the fund may repurchase but is not required to repurchase additional shares up to a maximum amount of  of the outstanding shares of the fund if the fund determines not to repurchase additional shares beyond the repurchase offer amount or if shareholders tender an amount of shares greater than that which the fund is entitled to repurchase the fund will repurchase the shares tendered on a pro rata basis the fund does not currently expect to offer to repurchase additional shares in the event a repurchase offer is oversubscribed   if any shares that you wish to tender to the fund are not repurchased because of proration you will have to wait until the next repurchase offer and resubmit a new repurchase request and your repurchase request will not be given any priority over other shareholders’ requests thus there is a risk that the fund may not purchase all of the shares you wish to have repurchased in a given repurchase offer or in any subsequent repurchase offer in anticipation of the possibility of proration some shareholders may tender more shares than they wish to have repurchased in a particular quarter increasing the likelihood of proration    there is no assurance that you will be able to tender your shares when or in the amount that you desire   consequences of repurchase offers   from the time the fund distributes or publishes each repurchase offer notification until the repurchase pricing date for that offer the fund must maintain liquid assets at least equal to the percentage of its shares subject to the repurchase offer for this purpose “liquid assets” means assets that may be sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the price at which the fund values them within the period between the repurchase request deadline and the repurchase payment deadline or which mature by the repurchase payment deadline the fund is permitted to borrow up to the maximum extent permitted under the  act to meet repurchase requests   if the fund borrows to finance repurchases interest on that borrowing will negatively affect shareholders who do not tender their shares by increasing the fund’s expenses and reducing any net investment income there is no assurance that the fund will be able sell a significant amount of additional shares so as to mitigate these effects   these and other possible risks associated with the fund’s repurchase offers are described under “principal risks of investment in the fund—repurchase offers risk” above in addition the repurchase of shares by the fund will be a taxable event to shareholders potentially even to those shareholders that do not participate in the repurchase for a discussion of these tax consequences see “distributions and federal income tax matters” below and “tax status” in the sai   table of contents  prospectus      services agreement   the fund has entered into a “services agreement” with the adviser pursuant to which the fund has appointed the adviser as “servicing agent” to compensate

makes payments to the intermediaries in recognition of the avoided transfer agency costs to the fund associated with the intermediaries’ maintenance of customer accounts or in recognition of the services provided by intermediaries through fund platforms payments made by the fund or the adviser under such agreements are generally based on either  a percentage of the average daily net asset value of the customer shares serviced by the intermediary up to a set maximum or  a per account fee assessed against each account serviced by such intermediary up to a set maximum these payments are in addition to other payments described in this prospectus such as the services agreement investors who invest through financial firms are subject to the eligibility requirements set out herein   determination of net asset value   the nav of the fund’s shares is determined by dividing the total value of the fund’s portfolio investments plus cash and other assets less any liabilities including accrued expenses or dividends by the total number of shares outstanding the fund’s shares are valued as of a particular time the “valuation time” on the last day of each week and last day of each month if different that the new york stock exchange “nyse” is open the fund reserves the right to calculate the net asset value more frequently if deemed desirable the valuation time is ordinarily at the close of regular trading on the nyse normally  pm eastern time   the board has approved procedures pursuant to which the fund will value its investments in accordance with these procedures the fund’s investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at market value market values for various types of securities and other instruments are determined on the basis of closing prices or last sale prices on an exchange or other market or based on quotes or other market information obtained from quotation reporting systems established market makers brokers data delivery vendors or pricing services with respect to pricing of certain reinsurancerelated securities the fund utilizes an external pricing service to provide daily pricing data such pricing is determined by the pricing service based on bids issued by established market makers andor insurance companies or issued by one broker insurance or reinsurance company if only one quote is available and other available sources to the extent the fund invests in openend management companies that are registered under the  act the fund’s nav will be calculated based upon the net asset value of such funds the prospectuses for such funds explain the circumstances under which they will use fair value pricing and its effects please see “computation of net asset value” in the sai for more information shortterm debt securities which have a maturity date of  days or less are valued at amortized cost   if market quotations are not readily available including in cases where available market quotations are deemed to be unreliable or infrequent the fund’s investments will be valued as determined in good faith pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the board “fair value pricing” in these circumstances the fund determines fair value in a manner that seeks to reflect the market value of the security on the valuation date based on consideration of any information or factors it deems appropriate as further described below the valuation committee the “committee” comprised of officers of the adviser and established pursuant to the policies and procedures adopted by the board has the responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the fund’s valuation procedures and fair value determinations made on behalf of the board for purposes of determining the fair value of securities the committee may consider without limitation i indications or quotes from brokers insurance companies or reinsurance companies ii valuations provided by a thirdparty pricing agent iii internal models that take into consideration different factors determined to be relevant by the adviser or iv any combination of the above  fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of an asset or liability the values of the fund’s investments in publicly traded foreign equity securities generally will be determined by a pricing service using pricing models designed to estimate likely changes in the values of those securities between the times in which the trading in those securities is substantially completed and the close of the nyse fair values used to determine the fund’s navs may differ from quoted or published prices or from prices that are used by others for the same investments the use of fair value pricing may not always result in adjustments to the prices of securities or other assets or liabilities held by the fund  it is possible that the fair value determined for a security may be materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of such security thus fair valuation may have an unintended dilutive or accretive effect on the value of shareholders’ investments in the fund        the nyse is open from monday through friday

agents after the nav has been calculated on a particular day will not be used to retroactively adjust the price of a security or the nav determined earlier that day   it is expected that a substantial portion of the fund’s investments will be us dollar denominated investments investments initially valued in currencies other than the us dollar are converted to us dollars using exchange rates obtained from pricing services as a result the nav of the fund’s shares may be affected by changes in the value of currencies in relation to the us dollar international markets are sometimes open on days when us markets are closed which means that the value of foreign securities owned by the fund could change on days when fund shares cannot be bought or sold the value of investments traded in markets outside the us or denominated in currencies other than the us dollar may be affected significantly on a day that the nyse is closed and the nav of the fund’s shares may change on days when an investor is not able to purchase redeem or exchange shares the calculation of the fund’s nav may not take place contemporaneously with the determination of the prices of foreign securities used in nav calculations   distributions and federal income tax matters   it is the fund’s policy to make distributions at least annually of all or substantially all of its net investment income and net realized capital gains if any unless you elect to receive your distributions in cash your ordinary income and capital gain distributions will be reinvested in additional shares of the same share class of the fund at the nav calculated as of the payment date the fund will pay distributions on a pershare basis as a result on the exdividend date of such a payment the nav of the fund will be reduced by the amount of the payment   this section summarizes some of the important us federal income tax consequences of investing in the fund this discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may apply to shareholders or to specific types of shareholders such as taxdeferred retirement plans and persons who are not “us persons” within the meaning of the code you should consult your tax adviser for information concerning the possible application of federal state local or nonus tax laws to you please see the sai for additional information regarding the tax aspects of investing in the fund   the fund has elected and intends to qualify and be treated each year as a “regulated investment company” under subchapter m of chapter  of the internal revenue code of  as amended previously defined above as the “code” to qualify for treatment as a ric the fund must meet certain income asset diversification and distribution requirements   the fund’s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company an adverse determination or future guidance by the irs might affect the fund’s ability to qualify for such treatment the tax treatment of certain investments under one or more of the qualification or distribution tests applicable to rics may not be certain failure of the fund to qualify and be eligible to be treated as a ric would result in fundlevel taxation and consequently a reduced return on your investment  the fund could in some cases cure such failure including by paying a fundlevel tax or interest making additional distributions or disposing of certain assets   table of contents  prospectus      the fund may invest substantially in foreign securities  such investments may include equity securities of passive foreign investment companies “pfics” for federal income tax purposes  investments in a pfic potentially i accelerate the recognition of income by the fund without the receipt of cash ii increase the amount required to be distributed by the fund to qualify as a ric or eliminate a fundlevel tax iii result in a higher percentage of fund distributions treated as ordinary income or iv subject the fund to a fundlevel tax that cannot be eliminated through distributions investments in foreign securities may also include equity securities of controlled foreign corporations in which case the fund will be required to take into account each year as ordinary income its share of certain portions of the issuer’s income whether or not such amounts are distributed to the fund  in any of these circumstances the fund may need to borrow money or to dispose of certain investments in order to make the distributions required to qualify for treatment as a ric and to eliminate a fundlevel tax for additional information please refer to “taxation” in the sai   the fund may invest in a whollyowned subsidiary that is treated as a controlled foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes  the subsidiary will take steps to ensure that income recognized by the fund in respect of the subsidiary will be qualifying income and the fund will limit its investments in the subsidiary in the aggregate to  of its total assets   the fund’s investment in foreign securities may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes which may decrease the fund’s return on those securities the fund may be able to pass through to you a deduction or credit for such foreign taxes as further described in the sai   in addition the fund’s investments in foreign securities foreign currencies and derivatives may increase or accelerate the fund’s recognition of income or gain and may affect the timing amount or character of the fund’s distributions   for federal income tax purposes distributions of net investment income are generally taxable to shareholders as ordinary income the tax treatment of fund distributions of capital gains is determined by how long the fund owned or is deemed to have owned the investments that generated them rather than how long you owned your shares distributions of net capital gains the excess of net longterm capital gains from the sale of investments that the fund owned or is deemed to have owned for more than one year over net shortterm capital losses that are properly reported by the fund as capital gain dividends “capital gain dividends” will be taxable as longterm capital gains includible in net capital gain and taxed to individuals at reduced rates distributions of net gains from the sale of investments that the fund owned or is deemed to have owned for one year or less will be taxable as ordinary income   distributions of investment income properly reported by the fund as derived from “qualified dividend income” will be taxed in the hands of individuals at the rates applicable to net capital gains provided that certain holding period and other requirements are met at both the shareholder and fund level   a  medicare contribution tax is imposed on the “net investment income” of certain individuals estates and trusts to the extent that their income exceeds certain threshold amounts  “net investment income” generally includes dividends interest and net gains from the disposition of investment property including the fund’s ordinary income dividends capital gain dividends and capital gains recognized on the sale repurchase or exchange of fund shares shareholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the effect if any that this provision may have on their investment in fund shares   a distribution will be treated as paid on december  of the current calendar year if it is declared by the fund in october november or december with a record date in such a month and paid by the fund during january of the following calendar year early in each year we will send you a statement showing detailed federal tax information with respect to you distributions for the prior tax year   distributions are taxable to you in the manner described herein even if they are paid from income or gains earned before your investment and thus were included in the price you paid for your shares for example if you purchase shares on or just before the record date of a fund distribution you will pay full price for the shares and could receive a portion of your investment back as a taxable distribution in general you will be taxed on the distributions you receive from the fund whether you receive them as additional shares or in cash   any gain or loss resulting from the sale or exchange of fund shares generally will be treated as a capital gain or loss for federal income tax purposes which will be longterm or shortterm depending on how long you have held your shares   table of contents  prospectus      shareholders who offer all of the shares they hold or are deemed to hold in response to a periodic repurchase offer see “periodic repurchase offers” above generally will be treated as having sold their shares and generally will recognize a capital gain or loss  if a shareholder tenders fewer than all of its shares it is possible that any amounts that the shareholder receives in such repurchase will be taxable as a dividend to such shareholder and there is a risk that shareholders who do not tender any of their shares for repurchase will be treated as having received a dividend distribution as a result of their proportionate increase in the ownership of the fund the fund’s use of cash to repurchase shares could adversely affect its ability to satisfy the distribution requirements for treatment as a ric the fund could also recognize income in connection with its liquidation of portfolio securities to fund share repurchases any such income would be taken into account in determining whether the distribution requirements are satisfied   in general dividends other than capital gain dividends paid by the fund to a person who is not a “us person” within the meaning of the code a “foreign person” are subject to withholding of us federal income tax at a rate of  or lower applicable treaty rate for taxable years beginning on or before december   the code provides a withholding tax exemption for certain interestrelated dividends and shortterm capital gain dividends paid to foreign persons  it is currently unclear whether congress will extend this exemption or what the terms of such an extension would be including whether such extension would have retroactive effect see the sai for additional information regarding foreign shareholders   sections  of the code and the us treasury regulations and irs guidance issued thereunder collectively “fatca” generally require a fund to obtain information sufficient to identify the status of each of its shareholders under fatca or under an applicable intergovernmental agreement an “iga” if a shareholder fails to provide this information or otherwise fails to comply with fatca or an iga the fund or its agent may be required to withhold under fatca  of the dividends it pays and  of the gross process of share repurchases and certain capital gain dividends it pays on or after january   which date under recent treasury guidance is expected to be delayed until on or after january   if a payment by a fund is subject to fatca withholding the fund or its agent is required to withhold even if the payment would otherwise be exempt from withholding under rules applicable to nonus shareholders eg capital gain dividends each prospective shareholder is urged to consult its tax adviser regarding the applicability of fatca and any other reporting requirements in addition foreign countries are considering and may implement laws similar in purpose and scope to fatca as more fully described above   the discussion above is very general please consult your tax adviser about the effect that an investment in the fund could have on your own tax situation including possible foreign federal state or local tax consequences or about any other tax questions you may have   dividend reinvestment plan   dividends and capital gains distributions are automatically reinvested unless otherwise noted  you may notify the transfer agent in writing to   ·    choose to receive dividends or distributions or both in cash or ·    change the way you currently receive distributions shares may be distributed in lieu of cash the number of shares that will be distributed in lieu of cash is determined by dividing the dollar amount of the distribution to be reinvested by the nav as of the close of business on the day of distribution your taxable income is the same regardless of which option you choose for further information about dividend reinvestment contact the transfer agent by

fund as well as the principal investment strategies it employs to achieve its objective and the principal investment risks associated with those strategies additional information about the strategies and other investment practices the fund may employ and certain related risks of the fund are described below   additional information about reinsurancerelated securities   reinsurance occurs when insurance or reinsurance companies share risk by purchasing insurance policies from other insurers or reinsurers to limit the total loss the original insurer or reinsurer would experience in case of disaster reinsurance involves the practice of insurers or reinsurers transferring portions of risk portfolios to other parties by agreement in order to reduce the likelihood of having to pay a large obligation resulting from an insurance claim the intent of reinsurance is for an insurance or reinsurance company to reduce the risks associated with underwritten policies by spreading risks across alternative institutions the party seeking reinsurance is known as the ceding party the party that accepts a portion of the potential obligation in exchange for a share of the insurance premium is known as the reinsurer   eventlinked bonds are a type of reinsurancerelated security the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds in one or more of three ways the fund may purchase eventlinked bonds when initially offered the fund may purchase eventlinked bonds in the secondary overthecounter market or the fund may gain indirect exposure to eventlinked bonds using derivatives as the market for eventlinked bonds evolves the fund expects to participate in that market and to include new types of eventlinked bond offerings in its portfolio   trigger events are typically defined by three criteria an event a geographic area in which the event must occur and a threshold of economic or physical loss caused by the event together with a method to measure such loss in order for a trigger event to be deemed to have occurred each of the three criteria must be satisfied while the bond is outstanding the fund has no limit as to the types of events geographic areas or thresholds of loss referenced by eventlinked bonds in which it can invest generally the event is either a natural or nonnatural peril of a kind that results in significant physical or economic loss natural perils include disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes windstorms fires and floods nonnatural perils include disasters resulting from human activity such as commercial and industrial accidents or business interruptions some eventlinked bonds reference only a single event other eventlinked bonds may reference multiple events the occurrence of any one or other number of which would satisfy this criteria or an eventlinked bond may not specify a particular peril in these cases only the geographic area and threshold of physical or economic loss determines whether a trigger event has occurred for example certain eventlinked bonds commonly referred to as “mortality” bonds discussed further below have trigger events that are deemed to occur if a specific number of deaths occur in an identified geographic area regardless of the peril which caused the loss of life   ·   indemnity triggers indemnity triggers are based on losses paid and reserved for by an identified insurance company generally the identified company sponsored the special purpose vehicle issuing the eventlinked bonds the trigger event would be considered to have occurred only if that company’s losses on catastrophic insurance claims exceeded a certain threshold of insured claims if the company’s losses paid and reserved for were less than the predetermined aggregate amount then the trigger event would not be considered to have occurred and the fund would be entitled to recover its principal plus accrued but unpaid interest indemnity triggers require investors and rating agencies to understand the risks of the insurance and reinsurance policies underwritten by the company which may be difficult to obtain and ascertain particularly in the case of complex commercial insurance and reinsurance policies in addition eventlinked bond investors are dependent upon the company’s ability to estimate and settle catastrophe claims in a manner that would not be disadvantageous to investors’ interests     table of contents  statement of additional information       ·   index triggers index triggers are based on predefined formulas which eliminate the risks relating to a company’s insurance claimshandling practices and potential information barriers however investors are dependent upon the accuracy of the models and other information received from reporting services used to calculate the loss or metric index triggers follow one of the three broad approaches modeledloss industryloss and parametric     o   modeledloss modeledloss triggers are based upon a catastrophemodeling firm’s database estimate of a hypothetical company’s losses based on a model policy portfolio     o   industry loss industry loss triggers are based upon the estimated loss for the insurance industry as a whole from a particular catastrophe estimates are derived from a reporting service such as property claim services     o   parametric parametric triggers are based upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event with certain defined physical parameters eg wind speed of a hurricane as measured from a predetermined location or magnitude of an earthquake as measured from a predetermined location   ·   hybrid triggers hybrid triggers involve more than one metric of physical or economic loss in a single eventlinked bond transaction for example after the occurrence of a qualifying us earthquake a modeledloss index is used to establish a company’s overall market share and then applied to the industryloss index associated with the qualifying event to determine any principal reduction hybrid triggers may be more complicated and difficult to understand for investors and involve the applicable risks associated with the types of triggers described above   longevity and mortality bonds the fund may invest directly or indirectly in both longevity bonds and mortality bonds which are fixedincome securities typically issued by special purpose vehicles created by life insurance companies annuity providers and pension obligors to hedge “longevity risk” or “mortality risk” as applicable faced by those entities   longevity risk is the risk that members of a reference population will live longer on average than anticipated mortality risk is the risk that members of a reference population will live shorter on average than anticipated such risks are among the most significant faced by life insurers annuity providers and pension funds because changes in longevity or mortality rates can significantly affect the liabilities and cash needs of those entities the terms of a longevity bond typically provide that the investor in the bond will receive less than the bond’s par amount at maturity if the actual average longevity life span of a specified population of people observed over a specified period of time typically measured by a longevity index is higher than a specified level if longevity is higher than expected the bond will return less than its par amount at maturity and could return no principal at maturity other types of longevity bonds may provide that if the actual average longevity of two separate populations of people observed over a specified period of time diverge by more than a specified amount the bonds will pay less than their par amount at maturity a mortality bond in contrast to a longevity bond typically provides that the investor in the bond will receive less than the bond’s par amount at maturity if the mortality rate of a specified population of people observed over a specified period of time typically measured by a mortality index is higher than a specified level some mortality bonds often referred to as “extreme mortality bonds” contain remote event triggers which provide that the bonds will lose principal only if the mortality rate of the specified population is substantially higher than the expected level   during their term both longevity bonds and mortality bonds typically pay a floating rate of interest to investors longevity bonds and mortality bonds purchased by the fund involve the risk that stone ridge asset management llc the “adviser” may incorrectly predict the actual level of longevity or mortality as applicable for the reference population of people and the fund will lose all or a portion of the amount of its investment in the bond with respect to mortality bonds held by the fund there is also the risk that an epidemic or other catastrophic event could strike the reference population resulting in mortality rates exceeding expectations and in the fund losing all or a portion of its investment in the bond the fund may also gain this type of exposure through eventlinked derivative instruments such as swaps that are contingent on or formulaically related to longevity or mortality risk   debt investments as part of its regular investment program the fund can invest directly or indirectly in debt investments other than eventlinked bonds the fund may have exposure to debt securities of us or foreign issuers these debt securities may have fixed or floating interest rates may or may not be collateralized and may be below investment grade or if unrated determined by the adviser to be of comparable quality the fund has no limits as to the maturity of debt securities in which the fund invests directly or indirectly or as to the market capitalization range of the issuers the fund does not have investment policies establishing specific maturity ranges for its investments and it may be within any maturity range short medium or long depending on the adviser’s evaluation of investment opportunities available within the debt securities markets     table of contents  statement of additional information      the values of debt securities and other incomeproducing securities such as preferred securities and convertible securities to which the fund is exposed change in response to interest rate changes in general the value of a debt security is likely to fall as interest rates rise this risk is generally greater for obligations with longer maturities or for debt securities that do not pay current interest such as zerocoupon securities debt securities with floating interest rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes although to the extent the fund’s income is based on shortterm interest rates that fluctuate over short periods of time income received by the fund may decrease as a result of a decline in interest rates in response to an interest rate decline debt securities that provide the issuer with the right to call or redeem the security prior to maturity may be called or redeemed if a debt security is repaid more quickly than expected the fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds at the same interest rate reducing the potential for gain when interest rates increase or for other reasons debt securities may be repaid more slowly than expected as a result the maturity of the debt instrument is extended increasing the potential for loss   interest rate changes can be sudden and unpredictable and the fund may lose money if these changes are not anticipated by the adviser a wide variety of factors can cause interest rates to fluctuate eg central bank monetary policies inflation rates general economic conditions and market developments and debt securities may be difficult to value during such periods in recent periods governmental financial regulators including the us federal reserve have taken steps to maintain historically low interest rates by purchasing bonds steps by those regulators to curtail or “taper” such activities could have a material adverse effect on prices for debt securities and on the management of the fund   in addition while debt securities markets have consistently grown over the past three decades the capacity for traditional dealer counterparties to engage in debt securities trading has not kept pace and in some cases has decreased as a result dealer inventories of debt securities which provide a core indication of the ability of financial intermediaries to “make markets” are at or near historic lows in relation to market size because market makers provide stability to a market through their intermediary services any significant reduction in dealer inventories could potentially lead to decreased liquidity and increased volatility in the debt securities markets   us treasury obligations these include treasury bills which have maturities of one year or less when issued treasury notes which have maturities of one to ten years when issued and treasury bonds which have maturities of more than ten years when issued treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states as to timely payments of interest and repayments of principal the fund can also buy or gain exposure to us treasury securities whose interest coupons have been “stripped” by a federal reserve bank zerocoupon us treasury securities described below and treasury inflationprotection securities “tips”   the us treasury securities called “tips” are designed to provide an investment that is not vulnerable to inflation the interest rate paid by tips is fixed the principal value rises or falls semiannually based on changes in the published consumer price index if inflation occurs the principal and interest payments on tips are adjusted to protect investors from inflationary loss if deflation occurs the principal and interest payments will be adjusted downward although the principal will not fall below its face amount at maturity   any increase in the principal amount of an inflationindexed bond will be considered taxable ordinary income even though investors do not receive their principal until maturity   obligations issued or guaranteed by us government agencies or instrumentalities these include direct obligations and mortgagerelated securities that have different levels of credit support from the us government some are supported by the full faith and credit of the united states such as government national mortgage association passthrough mortgage certificates called “ginnie maes” some are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury under certain circumstances such as federal national mortgage association bonds “fannie maes” and federal home loan mortgage corporation obligations “freddie macs” others are supported only by the credit of the entity that issued them securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac are also supported by commitments from the us treasury to purchase certain of those agencies’ securities during market conditions in which the us treasury deems it necessary for the promotion of market stability in september  the federal housing finance agency an independent regulatory agency placed the federal national mortgage corporation and federal home loan mortgage corporation into conservatorship the us department of treasury also entered into a new secured lending credit facility with those companies and a preferred stock purchase agreement under the preferred stock purchase agreement the treasury will ensure that each company maintains a positive net worth     table of contents  statement of additional information      zerocoupon us government securities the fund can invest directly or indirectly in zerocoupon us government securities these will typically be us treasury notes and us treasury bonds that have been stripped of their interest coupons or certificates representing interests in those stripped debt obligations and coupons   zerocoupon securities do not make periodic interest payments and are sold at a deep discount from their face value at maturity the buyer recognizes a rate of return determined by the gradual appreciation of the security which is redeemed at face value on a specified maturity date this discount depends on the time remaining until maturity as well as prevailing interest rates the liquidity of the security and the credit quality of the issuer the discount typically decreases as the maturity date approaches   because zerocoupon securities pay no interest and compound semiannually at the rate fixed at the time of their issuance their value is generally more volatile than the value of other debt securities that pay interest their value may fall more dramatically than the value of interestbearing securities when interest rates rise when prevailing interest rates fall zerocoupon securities tend to rise more rapidly in value because they have a fixed rate of return   the fund’s exposure to zerocoupon securities may cause the fund to recognize income for federal income tax purposes without a corresponding receipt of cash this can require the fund to dispose of investments including when not otherwise advantageous to do so to meet distribution requirements   other zerocoupon securities the fund may also obtain exposure to zerocoupon and delayed interest securities and “stripped” securities of us and foreign corporations and of foreign government issuers these are similar in structure to zerocoupon and “stripped” us government securities but in the case of foreign government securities may or may not be backed by the “full faith and credit” of the issuing foreign government zerocoupon securities issued by foreign governments and by corporations will be subject to greater credit risks than us government zerocoupon securities   other “stripped” securities in addition to buying stripped treasury securities the fund can invest directly or indirectly in stripped mortgagerelated securities that are created by segregating the cash flows from underlying mortgage loans or mortgage securities to create two or more new securities each has a specified percentage of the underlying security’s principal or interest payments these are a form of derivative investment   mortgage securities may be partially stripped so that each class receives some interest and some principal however they may be completely stripped in that case all of the interest is distributed to holders of one type of security known as an “interestonly” security or “io” and all of the principal is distributed to holders of another type of security known as a “principalonly” security or “po” strips can be created for passthrough certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations cmos   the yields to maturity of ios and pos are very sensitive to principal repayments including prepayments on the underlying mortgages if the underlying mortgages experience greater than anticipated prepayments of principal the fund might not fully recoup its investment in an io based on those assets if underlying mortgages experience less than anticipated prepayments of principal the yield on the pos based on them could decline substantially   other floating rate and variable rate obligations the fund can invest directly or indirectly in debt securities other than eventlinked bonds that have floating or variable interest rates those variable rate obligations may have a demand feature that allows the fund to tender the obligation to the issuer or a third party prior to its maturity the tender may be at par value plus accrued interest according to the terms of the obligations   because the interest rates on floating rate bonds adjust periodically to reflect current market rates falling shortterm interest rates should tend to decrease the income payable to the fund on its floating rate investments and rising rates should tend to increase that income however investments in floating rate and variable rate obligations should also mitigate the fluctuations in the fund’s net asset value during periods of changing interest rates compared to changes in values of fixedrate debt securities nevertheless changes in interest rates can affect the value of the fund’s floating rate investments especially if rates change sharply in a short period because the resets of the interest rates on the investments occur periodically and will not all happen simultaneously with changes in prevailing rates having a shorter average reset period for its portfolio of investments may help mitigate that risk   the interest rate on a floating rate demand note is adjusted automatically according to a stated prevailing market rate such as the prime rate the day us treasury bill rate or some other standard the instrument’s rate is adjusted automatically each time the base rate is adjusted the interest rate on a variable rate note is also based on a stated prevailing market rate but is adjusted automatically at specified intervals generally the changes in the interest rate on such securities reduce the fluctuation in their market value as interest rates decrease or increase the potential for capital appreciation or depreciation is less than that for fixedrate obligations of the same maturity     table of contents  statement of additional information      floating rate and variable rate demand notes that have a stated maturity in excess of one year may have features that permit the holder to recover the principal amount of the underlying security at specified intervals not exceeding one year and upon no more than  days’ notice the issuer of that type of note normally has a corresponding right in its discretion after a given period to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the note plus accrued interest generally the issuer must provide a specified number of days’ notice to the holder the fund can also invest directly or indirectly in stepcoupon bonds that have a coupon rate that changes periodically during the life of the security on predetermined dates that are set when the security is issued   money market instruments the fund can invest directly or indirectly in money market instruments which are us dollardenominated highquality shortterm debt obligations to provide liquidity for temporary defensive purposes or for other purposes money market instruments may have fixed variable or floating interest rates examples of money market instruments include obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities bank obligations such as time deposits certificates of deposit and bankers’ acceptances commercial paper and variable amount master demand notes   equity securities the fund may invest directly or indirectly in equity securities including certain types of equity securities of both foreign and us companies those equity securities include common stocks preferred stocks and rights and warrants returns on equities consist of any dividends received plus the amount of appreciation or depreciation in the value of the equity security certain equity securities may be purchased because they may provide dividend income ·   common stock holders of common stock generally have voting rights in the issuer and are entitled to receive common stock dividends when as and if declared by the corporation’s board of directors common stock normally occupies the most subordinated position in an issuer’s capital structure   ·   preferred stocks preferred stock unlike common stock has a stated dividend rate payable from the corporation’s earnings preferred stock dividends may be cumulative or noncumulative participating or auction rate “cumulative” dividend provisions require all or a portion of prior unpaid dividends to be paid preferred stock may be “participating” stock which means that it may be entitled to a dividend exceeding the stated dividend in certain cases   preferred stock may have mandatory sinking fund provisions as well as provisions allowing calls or redemption prior to maturity which also can have a negative impact on prices when interest rates decline   ·   rights and warrants the fund can hold warrants or rights warrants are options to purchase equity securities at specific prices valid for a specific period of time their prices do not necessarily move parallel to the prices of the underlying securities rights are similar to warrants but normally have a short duration and are distributed directly by the issuer to its shareholders rights and warrants have no voting rights receive no dividends and have no rights with respect to the assets of the issuer   ·   risks of investing in equities equities fluctuate in price and their shortterm volatility at times may be great to the extent that the fund obtains exposure to equity securities the value of the fund’s portfolio will be affected by changes in the stock markets market risk can affect the fund’s net asset value per share which will fluctuate as the values of the fund’s portfolio securities change the prices of individual equity securities do not all move in the same direction uniformly or at the same time different stock markets may behave differently from one another   other factors can affect a particular equity security’s price such as poor earnings reports by the issuer loss of major customers major litigation against the issuer or changes in government regulations affecting the issuer or its industry   convertible securities while some convertible securities are a form of debt security in certain cases their conversion feature allowing conversion into equity securities causes them to be regarded more as “equity equivalents” as a result the rating assigned to the security has less impact on the adviser’s investment decision with respect to convertible securities than in the case of nonconvertible fixed income securities the value of a convertible security is a function of its “investment value” and its “conversion value”  if the investment value exceeds the conversion value the security will behave more like a debt security and the security’s price will likely increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise if the conversion value exceeds the investment value the security will behave more like an equity security in that case it will likely sell at a premium over its conversion value and its price will tend to fluctuate directly with the price of the underlying security     table of contents  statement of additional information      derivatives in addition to the derivatives transactions described in the prospectus the fund may also enter into derivatives contracts with respect to any security or other instrument in which it is permitted to invest or with respect to any related security instrument or index “reference instruments” the fund may enter into a variety of derivative contracts but typically expects to enter into put and call options futures contracts options on futures contracts and swaps this universe of investments is subject to change under varying market conditions and as these instruments evolve over time derivatives are financial instruments the value of which is derived from the underlying instrument rate or other reference the derivatives contracts the fund intends to enter into may be listed on an exchange or traded over the counter the fund may enter into derivatives contracts with standardized terms and no or few special or unusual components which are generally traded on an exchange as well as derivatives with more complex features such as caps floors knockouts lookbacks or other “exotic” elements singly or in combination which are generally traded over the counter overthecounter “otc” derivatives may be standardized or have customized features and may have limited or no liquidity the fund’s derivatives contracts may be centrally cleared or settled bilaterally directly with a counterparty the fund’s derivatives contracts may be cash or physically settled   the derivatives contracts the fund may enter into involve substantial risk derivatives typically allow the fund to seek to increase or decrease the level of risk to which it is exposed more quickly and efficiently than transactions in other types of instruments the fund incurs costs in connection with opening and closing derivatives positions   the use of derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the reference instrument due to failure of a counterparty or due to tax or regulatory constraints derivatives may create economic leverage in the fund which magnifies the fund’s exposure to the reference instrument and magnifies potential losses derivatives risk may be more significant when derivatives are used to enhance return or as a substitute for a cash investment position rather than solely to hedge the risk of a position held by the fund when derivatives are used to gain or limit exposure to a particular market or market segment their performance may not correlate as expected to the performance of such market thereby causing the fund to fail to achieve its original purpose for using such derivatives a decision as to whether when and how to use derivatives involves the exercise of specialized skill and judgment and a transaction may be unsuccessful in whole or in part because of market behavior unexpected events or the adviser’s failure to use derivatives effectively derivative instruments may be difficult to value may be illiquid and may be subject to wide swings in valuation caused by changes in the value of the reference instrument   options the fund may write sell call options and put options on securities indices and currencies forward foreign currency exchange contracts stock index futures swaps including eventlinked swaps commodities futures and other derivative instruments a call option typically gives the option buyer the right but not the obligation to buy and requires the option seller to sell a reference instrument at an agreedupon price a put option gives the option buyer the right but not the obligation to sell and requires the option seller to purchase a reference instrument at an agreedupon price if an option is exercised the fund will either purchase or sell the reference instrument at the strike price or pay to the option holder the difference between the strike price and the current price level of the reference instrument depending on the terms of the option the premium the exercise price and the market value of the applicable underlying instrument together will determine the gain or loss realized by the fund as the seller of the option the fund may also purchase call options or put options   the value of options may be adversely affected if the market for such options becomes less liquid or smaller the fund’s ability to close out its position as a seller of an otc option or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market the fund’s ability to terminate otc options is more limited than with exchangetraded options and may involve the risk that brokerdealers participating in such transactions will not fulfill their obligations   call options are marked to market daily and their value will be affected by changes in the value of the underlying securities changes in the dividend rates of the underlying securities an increase in interest rates changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the stock market and the underlying instruments and the remaining time to the options’ expiration additionally the exercise price of an option may be adjusted downward before the option’s expiration as a result of the occurrence of certain corporate or other events affecting the underlying instrument such as extraordinary dividends stock splits merger or other extraordinary distributions or events a reduction in the exercise price of an option would reduce the fund’s capital appreciation potential on the underlying instrument     table of contents  statement of additional information      futures the fund may buy and sell a variety of futures contracts that relate to among other things debt securities these are referred to as “interest rate futures” broadlybased securities indices “stock index futures” and “bond index futures” foreign currencies commodities and individual equity securities “single stock futures” futures are standardized exchangetraded contracts that obligate a purchaser to take delivery and a seller to make delivery of a specific amount of an asset at a specified future date at a specified price a futures contract on an index is an agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the difference between the value of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the index contract originally was written the primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts and options are imperfect correlation liquidity unanticipated market movement and counterparty risk   a purchase or sale of a futures contract may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in the futures contract there can be no guarantee that there will be a correlation between price movements in the futures contracts and in the securities or index positions covering them futures exchanges may limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in certain futures contract prices during a single trading day once the daily limit has been reached in a futures contract subject to the limit no more trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit the daily limit governs only price movements during a particular trading day and therefore does not limit potential losses because the limit may work to prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist at a time when the fund seeks to close out a futures contract and the fund would remain obligated to meet margin requirements until the position is closed   a broadlybased stock index is used as the basis for trading stock index futures they may in some cases be based on equity securities of issuers in a particular industry or group of industries a stock index assigns relative values to the securities included in the index and its value fluctuates in response to the changes in value of the underlying securities a stock index cannot be purchased or sold directly bond index futures are similar contracts based on the future value of the basket of securities that comprise the index these contracts obligate the seller to deliver and the purchaser to take cash to settle the futures transaction there is no delivery made of the underlying securities to settle the futures obligation either party may also settle the transaction by entering into an offsetting contract   an interest rate future obligates the seller to deliver and the purchaser to take cash or a specified type of debt security to settle the futures transaction either party could also enter into an offsetting contract to close out the position similarly a single stock future obligates the seller to deliver and the purchaser to take cash or a specified equity security to settle the futures transaction either party could also enter into an offsetting contract to close out the position single stock futures trade on a very limited number of exchanges with contracts typically not fungible among the exchanges   no money is paid or received by the fund on the purchase or sale of a future upon entering into a futures transaction the fund will be required to deposit an initial margin payment with the futures commission merchant the “fcm” initial margin payments will be deposited with the fund’s custodian bank in an account registered in the futures broker’s name however the fcm can gain access to that account only under specified conditions as the future is marked to market that is its value on the fund’s books is changed to reflect changes in its market value subsequent margin payments called variation margin will be paid to or by the fcm daily   at any time prior to expiration of the future the fund may elect to close out its position by taking an opposite position at which time a final determination of variation margin is made and any additional cash must be paid by or released to the fund all futures transactions except forward contracts are effected through a clearinghouse associated with the exchange on which the contracts are traded   risks of hedging with options and futures the use of hedging strategies requires special skills and knowledge of investment techniques that are different than what is required for normal portfolio management if the adviser uses a hedging strategy at the wrong time or judges market conditions incorrectly hedging strategies may reduce the fund’s return the fund could also experience losses if the prices of its futures and options positions were not correlated with its other investments   the fund’s option activities could affect its portfolio turnover rate and brokerage commissions the exercise of calls written by the fund might cause the fund to sell related portfolio securities thus increasing its turnover rate the exercise by the fund of puts on securities will cause the sale of underlying investments increasing portfolio turnover although the decision whether to exercise a put it holds is within the fund’s control holding a put might cause the fund to sell the related investments for reasons that would not exist in the absence of the put     table of contents  statement of additional information      the fund could pay a brokerage commission each time it buys a call or put sells a call or put or buys or sells an underlying investment in connection with the exercise of a call or put those commissions could be higher on a relative basis than the commissions for direct purchases or sales of the underlying investments premiums paid for options are small in relation to the market value of the underlying investments consequently put and call options offer large amounts of leverage the leverage offered by trading in options could result in the fund’s net asset value being more sensitive to changes in the value of the underlying investment   if a covered call written by the fund is exercised on an underlying investment that has increased in value the fund will be required to sell the investment at the call price it will not be able to realize any profit if the investment has increased in value above the call price   an option position may be closed out only on a market that provides secondary trading for options of the same series and there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for any particular option the fund might experience losses if it could not close out a position because of an illiquid market for the future or option   there is a risk in using short hedging by selling futures or purchasing puts on broadlybased indices or futures to attempt to protect against declines in the value of the fund’s portfolio securities the risk is that the prices of the futures or the applicable index will correlate imperfectly with the behavior of the cash prices of the fund’s securities for example it is possible that while the fund has used derivative instruments in a short hedge the market may advance and the value of the securities held in the fund’s portfolio might decline if that occurred the fund would lose money on the derivative instruments and also experience a decline in the value of its portfolio securities   the risk of imperfect correlation increases as the composition of the fund’s portfolio diverges from the securities included in the applicable index to compensate for the imperfect correlation of movements in the price of the portfolio securities being hedged and movements in the price of the hedging instruments the fund might use derivative instruments in a greater dollar amount than the dollar amount of portfolio securities being hedged it might do so if the historical volatility of the prices of the portfolio securities being hedged is more than the historical volatility of the applicable index   the ordinary spreads between prices in the cash and futures markets are subject to distortions due to differences in the nature of those markets first all participants in the futures market are subject to margin deposit and maintenance requirements rather than meeting additional margin deposit requirements investors may close futures contracts through offsetting transactions which could distort the normal relationship between the cash and futures markets second the liquidity of the futures market depends on participants entering into offsetting transactions rather than making or taking delivery to the extent participants decide to make or take delivery liquidity in the futures market could be reduced thus producing distortion third from the point of view of speculators the deposit requirements in the futures market are less onerous than margin requirements in the securities markets therefore increased participation by speculators in the futures market may cause temporary price distortions   the fund can use derivative instruments to establish a position in the securities markets as a temporary substitute for the purchase of individual securities long hedging by buying futures andor calls on such futures broadlybased indices or on securities it is possible that when the fund does so the market might decline if the fund then concludes not to invest in securities because of concerns that the market might decline further or for other reasons the fund will realize a loss on the hedge position that is not offset by a reduction in the price of the securities purchased   swaps the fund may enter into swap agreements including interest rate total return eventlinked credit default and volatility swaps swap agreements are twoparty contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for a specified period of time typically ranging from a few weeks to more than one year the swapped returns are generally calculated with respect to a notional amount that is the return on a particular dollar amount invested in the underlying asset in a standard swap transaction two parties agree to exchange the returns or the difference between the returns earned or realized on a particular asset such as an equity or debt security commodity or currency or nonasset reference such as an interest rate or index the fund may enter into swap agreements to among other reasons gain exposure to certain markets in the most economical way possible protect against currency fluctuations or reduce risk arising from a particular portfolio position     table of contents  statement of additional information      the fund may enter into swap transactions with certain counterparties pursuant to master netting agreements a master netting agreement provides that all swaps done between the fund and that counterparty shall be regarded as parts of an integral agreement if amounts are payable on a particular date in the same currency in respect of more than one swap transaction the amount payable shall be the net amount in addition the master netting agreement may provide that if one party defaults generally or on any swap the counterparty can terminate all outstanding swaps with that party as a result to the extent the fund enters into master netting agreements with a counterparty the fund may be required to terminate a greater number of swap agreements than if it had not entered into such an agreement which may result in losses to the fund   the use of swap agreements by the fund entails certain risks swap agreements entail credit risk arising from the possibility that the counterparty will default if the counterparty defaults the fund’s loss will consist of the net amount of contractual payments that the fund has not yet received the adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties to the fund’s swap transactions on an ongoing basis swap agreements may effectively add leverage to the fund’s portfolio because the fund would be subject to investment exposure on the notional amount of the swap swap agreements also involve liquidity risk the use of swaps involves investment techniques and risks that are different from those associated with portfolio security transactions these instruments are typically not traded on exchanges under recently adopted rules and regulations however transactions in some types of swaps including interest rate swaps and credit default swaps on north american and european indices are required to be centrally cleared “cleared swaps” for otc swaps there is a risk that the other party to certain of these instruments will not perform its obligations to the fund or that the fund may be unable to enter into offsetting positions to terminate its exposure or liquidate its position under certain of these instruments when it wishes to do so such occurrences could result in losses to the fund for cleared swaps the fund’s counterparty is a clearinghouse rather than a bank or broker since the fund is not a member of the clearinghouses and only members of a clearinghouse “clearing members” can participate directly in the clearinghouse the fund holds cleared swaps through accounts at clearing members in cleared swaps the fund makes payments including margin payments to and receives payments from a clearinghouse through its account at clearing members clearing members guarantee performance of their clients’ obligations to the clearinghouse   swap agreements may be subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and termination and they may have terms of greater than seven days the fund’s obligations under a swap agreement will be accrued daily offset against any amounts owed to the fund under the swap   ·   interest rate swaps the fund may enter into interest rate swaps in an interest rate swap the fund and another party exchange the right to receive or the obligation to pay interest on a security or other reference rate for example they might swap the right to receive floating rate payments for fixed rate payments there is a risk that based on movements of interest rates the payments made by the fund under a swap agreement will be greater than the payments it receives   ·   total return swaps the fund may enter into total return swaps under which one party agrees to pay the other the total return of a defined underlying asset such as a security or basket of securities or nonasset reference such as a securities index during the specified period in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the total return from different underlying assets or references total return swaps could result in losses if the underlying asset or reference does not perform as anticipated by the adviser   ·   credit default swaps the fund may enter into credit default swaps a credit default swap enables an investor to buy or sell protection against a credit event such as a borrower’s or issuer’s failure to make timely payments of interest or principal bankruptcy or restructuring the fund may seek to enhance returns by selling protection or attempt to mitigate credit risk by buying protection against the occurrence of a credit event by a specified borrower or issuer the fund may enter into credit default swaps both directly “unfunded swaps” and indirectly “funded swaps” in the form of a swap embedded within a structured security unfunded and funded credit default swaps may refer to a single security or a basket of securities   if the fund buys credit protection using a credit default swap and a credit event occurs the fund will deliver the defaulted bond underlying the swap and the swap counterparty will pay the par amount of the bond if the fund sells credit protection using a credit default swap and a credit event occurs the fund will pay the par amount of the defaulted bond underlying the swap and the swap counterparty will deliver the bond if the swap is on a basket of assets the notional amount of the swap is reduced by the par amount of the defaulted asset and the fixed payments are then made on the reduced notional amount     table of contents  statement of additional information      risks of credit default swaps include counterparty credit risk if the counterparty fails to meet its obligations and the risk that the fund will not properly assess the cost of the instrument based on the lack of transparency in the market if the fund is selling credit protection there is a risk that a credit event will occur and that the fund will have to pay par value on defaulted bonds if the fund is buying credit protection there is a risk that no credit event will occur and the fund will receive no benefit for the premium paid in addition if the fund is buying credit protection and a credit event does occur there is a risk when the fund does not own the underlying asset that the fund will have difficulty acquiring the asset on the open market and may receive adverse pricing   ·   volatility swap contracts the fund may enter into volatility swaps to hedge the direction of volatility in a particular asset or nonasset reference or for other nonspeculative purposes for volatility swaps counterparties agree to buy or sell volatility at a specific level over a fixed period volatility swaps are subject to credit risks if the counterparty fails to meet its obligations and the risk that the adviser is incorrect in forecasts of volatility of the underlying asset or reference   ·   swap options and swap forwards the fund also may enter into options on swaps as well as forwards on swaps a swap option is a contract that gives a counterparty the right but not the obligation to enter into a new swap agreement or to shorten extend cancel or otherwise modify an existing swap agreement on predesignated terms the fund may write sell and purchase put and call swap options a swap forward is an agreement to enter into a swap agreement at some point in the future usually three to six months from the date of the contract   the writer of the contract receives the premium and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the preset rate on the underlying swap the fund generally will incur a greater risk when it writes a swap option than when it purchases a swap option when the fund purchases a swap option it risks losing only the amount of the premium it has paid if the fund lets the option expire unexercised when the fund writes a swap option it will become obligated upon exercise of the option by the counterparty according to the terms of the underlying agreement counterparty risk the fund will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with which or the brokers dealers and exchanges through which it deals whether it engages in exchange traded or offexchange transactions if the fund’s fcm becomes bankrupt or insolvent or otherwise defaults on its obligations to the fund the fund may not receive all amounts owed to it in respect of its trading despite the clearinghouse fully discharging all of its obligations the commodity exchange act requires an fcm to segregate all funds received from its customers with respect to regulated derivatives transactions from such fcm’s proprietary funds if an fcm were not to do so to the full extent required by law the assets of an account might not be fully protected in the event of the bankruptcy of an fcm furthermore in the event of an fcm’s bankruptcy the fund would be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of an fcm’s combined customer accounts even though certain property specifically traceable to the fund for example us treasury bills deposited by the fund may be held by the fcm fcm bankruptcies have occurred in which customers were unable to recover from the fcm’s estate the full amount of their funds owed and on deposit with such fcm such situations could arise due to various factors or a combination of factors including inadequate fcm capitalization inadequate controls on customer trading and inadequate customer capital in addition an fcm will generally provide the clearinghouse the net amount of variation margin required for cleared swaps for all of its customers in the aggregate rather than individually for each customer the fund is therefore subject to the risk that a clearinghouse will not make variation margin payments owed to the fund if another customer of the clearing member has suffered a loss and is in default the fund may also be subject to the risk that it will be required to provide additional variation margin to the clearinghouse before the clearinghouse will move the fund’s cleared derivatives transactions to another clearing member furthermore in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of a clearinghouse the fund might experience a loss of funds deposited through its fcm as margin with the clearinghouse a loss of unrealized profits on its open positions and the loss of funds owed to it as realized profits on closed positions such a bankruptcy or insolvency might also cause a substantial delay before the fund could obtain the return of funds owed to it by an fcm who was a member of such clearinghouse   in the case of cleared swaps the fcm is required to notify the clearinghouse of the initial margin provided by the clearing member to the clearinghouse that is attributable to each customer however if the fcm does not accurately report the fund’s initial margin the fund is subject to the risk that a clearinghouse will use the fund’s assets held in an omnibus account at the clearinghouse to satisfy payment obligations of a defaulting customer of the clearing member to the clearinghouse     table of contents  statement of additional information      because bilateral derivative transactions are traded between counterparties based on contractual relationships the fund is subject to the risk that a counterparty will not perform its obligations under the related contracts although the fund intends to enter into transactions only with counterparties which the adviser believes to be creditworthy there can be no assurance that a counterparty will not default and that the fund will not sustain a loss on a transaction as a result in situations where the fund is required to post margin or other collateral with a counterparty the counterparty may fail to segregate the collateral or may commingle the collateral with the counterparty’s own assets as a result in the event of the counterparty’s bankruptcy or insolvency the fund’s collateral may be subject to the conflicting claims of the counterparty’s creditors and the fund may be exposed to the risk of a court treating the fund as a general unsecured creditor of the counterparty rather than as the owner of the collateral   the fund is subject to the risk that issuers of the fund’s portfolio instruments may default on their obligations under those instruments and that certain events may occur that have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the value of those instruments there can be no assurance that an issuer of an instrument in which the fund invests will not default or that an event that has an immediate and significant adverse effect on the value of an instrument will not occur and that the fund will not sustain a loss on a transaction as a result   transactions entered into by the fund may be executed on various us and nonus exchanges and may be cleared and settled through various clearinghouses custodians depositories and prime brokers throughout the world although the fund attempts to execute clear and settle the transactions through entities the adviser believes to be sound there can be no assurance that a failure by any such entity will not lead to a loss to the fund   foreign currency transactions the fund also may purchase and sell foreign currency options and foreign currency futures contracts and related options and may engage in foreign currency transactions either on a spot cash basis at the rate prevailing in the currency exchange market at the time or through deliverable and nondeliverable forward foreign currency exchange contracts “forwards” the fund may but is not required to engage in these transactions in order to protect against uncertainty in the level of future foreign exchange rates in the purchase and sale of securities the fund may also use foreign currency options and foreign currency forward contracts to increase exposure to a foreign currency or to shift exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from one country to another suitable currency hedging transactions may not be available in all circumstances and the adviser may decide not to use hedging transactions that are available   under a forward contract one party agrees to purchase and another party agrees to sell a specific currency at a future date that date may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties the transaction price is set at the time the contract is entered into these contracts are traded in the interbank market conducted directly among currency traders usually large commercial banks and their customers   the fund may use currency forward contracts to protect against uncertainty in the level of future exchange rates the use of forward contracts does not eliminate the risk of fluctuations in the prices of the underlying securities the fund owns or intends to acquire but it does fix a rate of exchange in advance although forward contracts may reduce the risk of loss from a decline in the value of the hedged currency at the same time they limit any potential gain if the value of the hedged currency increases   when the fund enters into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a foreign currency or when it anticipates receiving dividend payments in a foreign currency the fund might desire to “lockin” the us dollar price of the security or the us dollar equivalent of the dividend payments to do so the fund could enter into a forward contract for the purchase or sale of the amount of foreign currency involved in the underlying transaction in a fixed amount of us dollars per unit of the foreign currency this is called a “transaction hedge” the transaction hedge will protect the fund against a loss from an adverse change in the currency exchange rates during the period between the date on which the security is purchased or sold or on which the payment is declared and the date on which the payments are made or received   the fund could also use forward contracts to lock in the us dollar value of portfolio positions this is called a “position hedge” when the fund believes that a foreign currency might suffer a substantial decline against the us dollar it could enter into a forward contract to sell an amount of that foreign currency approximating the value of some or all of the fund’s portfolio securities denominated in that foreign currency when the fund believes that the us dollar might suffer a substantial decline against a foreign currency it could enter into a forward contract to buy that foreign currency for a fixed dollar amount alternatively the fund could enter into a forward contract to sell a different foreign currency for a fixed us dollar amount if the fund believes that the us dollar value of the foreign currency to be sold pursuant to its forward contract will fall whenever there is a decline in the us dollar value of the currency in which portfolio securities of the fund are denominated that is referred to as a “cross hedge”     table of contents  statement of additional information      to avoid excess transactions and transaction costs the fund may maintain a net exposure to forward contracts in excess of the value of the fund’s portfolio securities or other assets denominated in foreign currencies subject to appropriate cover or asset segregation   the precise matching of the amounts under forward contracts and the value of the securities involved generally will not be possible because the future value of securities denominated in foreign currencies will change as a consequence of market movements between the date the forward contract is entered into and the date it is sold in some cases the adviser might decide to sell the security and deliver foreign currency to settle the original purchase obligation if the market value of the security is less than the amount of foreign currency the fund is obligated to deliver the fund might have to purchase additional foreign currency on the “spot” that is cash market to settle the security trade if the market value of the security instead exceeds the amount of foreign currency the fund is obligated to deliver to settle the trade the fund might have to sell on the spot market some of the foreign currency received upon the sale of the security there will be additional transaction costs on the spot market in those cases   the projection of shortterm currency market movements is extremely difficult and the successful execution of a shortterm hedging strategy is highly uncertain forward contracts involve the risk that anticipated currency movements will not be accurately predicted causing the fund to sustain losses on these contracts and to pay additional transaction costs the use of forward contracts in this manner might reduce the fund’s performance if there are unanticipated changes in currency prices to a greater degree than if the fund had not entered into such contracts   at or before the maturity of a forward contract requiring the fund to sell a currency the fund might sell a portfolio security and use the sale proceeds to make delivery of the currency in the alternative the fund might retain the security and offset its contractual obligation to deliver the currency by purchasing a second contract under that contract the fund will obtain on the same maturity date the same amount of the currency that it is obligated to deliver similarly the fund might close out a forward contract requiring it to purchase a specified currency by entering into a second contract entitling it to sell the same amount of the same currency on the maturity date of the first contract the fund would realize a gain or loss as a result of entering into such an offsetting forward contract under either circumstance the gain or loss will depend on the extent to which the exchange rate or rates between the currencies involved moved between the execution dates of the first contract and offsetting contract   the costs to the fund of engaging in forward contracts varies with factors such as the currencies involved the length of the contract period and the market conditions then prevailing because forward contracts are usually entered into on a principal basis no brokerage fees or commissions are involved because these contracts are not traded on an exchange the fund must evaluate the credit and performance risk of the counterparty under each forward contract although the fund values its assets daily in terms of us dollars it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into us dollars on a daily basis the fund may convert foreign currency from time to time and will incur costs in doing so foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion but they do seek to realize a profit based on the difference between the prices at which they buy and sell various currencies thus a dealer might offer to sell a foreign currency to one fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange if the fund desires to resell that currency to the dealer   additional information about derivatives transactions   margin the fund may post cash securities or other assets and these instruments may not be denominated in the same currency as the contract they secure or the underlying instrument of the contract this may give rise to a form of currency exposure where changes in the value of foreign currencies can impact the value of the margin on deposit the fund may at times have significant margin obligations to brokerdealers or other entities as a result of listed or otc derivatives positions the fund may use a triparty collateral protection mechanism triparty arrangements may result in higher costs than if the fund had posted margin directly the fund may also establish alternative collateral mechanisms in order to achieve a balance between cost and counterparty credit risk to the fund     table of contents  statement of additional information      asset segregationcover to the extent obligations created by the fund may be deemed to create “senior securities” as defined in the  act the fund may be required to segregate or earmark liquid assets the fund will segregate with its custodian or otherwise designate on its records “earmark” cash cash equivalents or liquid assets in an amount the fund believes to be adequate to ensure that it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its obligations under its derivatives contracts or the fund may engage in other measures to “cover” its obligations with respect to such transactions the amounts that are segregated or earmarked may be based on the derivative’s notional value or on the daily marktomarket obligation under the derivatives contract and may be reduced by amounts on deposit with the applicable broker or counterparty to the derivatives transaction the fund may segregate or earmark amounts in addition to the amounts described above for example if the fund writes a physically settled put option it will typically segregate or earmark liquid assets equal to the exercise price of the option less margin on deposit or hold the reference instrument directly if the fund writes a cash settled put option it will typically segregate or earmark liquid assets equal to the amount the option is in the money meaning the difference between the exercise price of the option and the current market price of the reference instrument when the exercise price of the option is higher than the market price of the reference instrument marked to market on a daily basis less margin on deposit alternatively the fund may in certain circumstances enter into an offsetting position rather than segregating or designating liquid assets eg the fund may cover a written put option with a purchased put option with the same or higher exercise price or cover a written call option with a purchased call option with the same or lower exercise price although the adviser will attempt to ensure that the fund has sufficient liquid assets in respect of its obligations under its derivative contracts it is possible that the fund’s liquid assets may be insufficient to support such obligations under its derivatives positions the fund may modify its asset segregation policies from time to time   leverage leverage may cause the fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged as certain types of leverage may exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the fund’s portfolio securities some derivatives have the potential for loss regardless of the size of the initial investment in the case of swaps the risk of loss generally is related to a notional principal amount even if the parties have not made any initial investment the loss on leverage transactions may substantially exceed the initial investment   hedging although it is not obligated to do so the fund can use derivatives to hedge the fund can use hedging to attempt to protect against declines in the market value of the fund’s portfolio to permit the fund to retain unrealized gains in the value of portfolio securities that have appreciated or to facilitate selling securities for investment reasons the fund can use hedging to establish a portfolio position as a temporary substitute for purchasing particular securities in that case the fund would normally seek to purchase the securities and then terminate that hedging position the fund might also use this type of hedge to attempt to protect against the possibility that its portfolio securities would not be fully included in a rise in value of the market   the fund can use derivatives to hedge by taking or long or short positions in the underlying securities related securities or other derivatives positions to gain long investment exposure the fund may invest in securities directly to gain short investment exposure the fund may use derivatives including futures some of the hedging strategies the fund can use are described below the fund may use additional hedging strategies as discussed elsewhere in this sai and it may employ new hedging strategies when they are developed if those investment methods are consistent with the fund’s investment objectives and are permissible under applicable regulations governing the fund ·    “structured” notes the fund can invest in “structured” notes which are speciallydesigned derivative debt investments whose principal payments or interest payments are linked to the value of an underlying asset such as an equity or debt security currency or commodity or nonasset reference such as an interest rate or index the terms of the instrument may be “structured” by the purchaser the fund and the borrower issuing the note   the values of these notes will fall or rise in response to changes in the values of the underlying asset or reference and the fund might receive less principal or interest if the underlying asset or reference does not perform as anticipated in some cases these notes may pay an amount based on a multiple of the relative change in value of the asset or reference this type of note offers the potential for increased income or principal payments but at a greater risk of loss than a typical debt security of the same maturity and credit quality   the values of these notes are also subject to both credit risk if the counterparty fails to meet its obligations and interest rate risk and therefore the fund could receive more or less than it originally invested when a note matures the prices of these notes may be very volatile and they may have a limited trading market making it difficult for the fund to value them or sell them at an acceptable price     table of contents  statement of additional information      ·   swaps swap options and swap forwards the fund can invest in swap agreements including interest rate total return credit default and volatility swaps and options and forwards thereon for hedging purposes as described more fully under “swaps” above   regulatory issues the adviser is registered with the us commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” as a commodity pool operator “cpo” however with respect to the fund the adviser has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term cpo under the commodity exchange act the “cea” pursuant to cftc rule  accordingly the adviser with respect to the fund is not subject to registration or regulation as a cpo under the cea to remain eligible for the exclusion the fund will be limited in its ability to use certain financial instruments regulated under the cea “commodity interests” including futures and options on futures and certain swaps transactions   tax aspects of certain derivative instruments risks the fund’s investments in options and other derivative instruments could affect the amount timing and character of distributions from the fund in some cases the tax treatment of such investments may not be certain the tax issues relating to these and other types of investments and transactions are described more fully under “taxation” below   foreign government debt obligations the debt obligations of foreign governments and entities may or may not be supported by the full faith and credit of the foreign government the fund may buy securities issued by certain supranational entities which include entities designated or supported by governments to promote economic reconstruction or development international banking organizations and related government agencies the governmental members of these supranational entities are “stockholders” that typically make capital contributions and may be committed to make additional capital contributions if the entity is unable to repay its borrowings a supranational entity’s lending activities may be limited to a percentage of its total capital reserves and net income there can be no assurance that the constituent foreign governments will continue to be able or willing to honor their capitalization commitments for those entities in the past us government policies have discouraged certain investments abroad by us investors thorough taxation or other restrictions and it is possible that such restrictions could be reimposed   passive foreign investment companies and controlled foreign corporations under us federal income tax laws passive foreign investment companies “pfics” are those foreign corporations which generate primarily “passive” income for federal income tax purposes a foreign corporation is a pfic if  or more of its gross income during a fiscal year is passive income or if  or more of its assets are assets that produce or are held to produce passive income   subject to the limits under the  act the fund may invest in foreign mutual funds to gain exposure to the securities of companies in countries that limit or prohibit all direct foreign investment foreign mutual funds are generally deemed to be pfics since nearly all of the income of a mutual fund is passive income some of the other foreign corporations that the fund may invest in such as issuers of “eventlinked” bonds and other interests may also be considered pfics investments in pfics potentially i accelerate the recognition of income without the receipt of cash ii increase the amount required to be distributed by the fund to qualify as a ric or eliminate a fundlevel tax iii result in a higher percentage of fund distributions treated as ordinary income or iv subject the fund to a fundlevel tax that cannot be eliminated through distributions   if a sufficient portion of the voting interests in a foreign issuer including the subsidiary are held by the fund individually or together with other us persons that issuer may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation with respect to the fund in which case the fund will be required to take into account each year as ordinary income its share of certain portions of that issuer’s income whether or not such amounts are distributed to the fund in such circumstances the fund may need to borrow money or to dispose of certain investments in order to make the distributions required to qualify for treatment as a ric     table of contents  statement of additional information      because the fund can purchase securities denominated in foreign currencies a change in the value of a foreign currency against the us dollar could result in a change in the amount of income the fund has available for distribution because a portion of the fund’s investment income may be received in foreign currencies the fund will be required to compute its income in us dollars for distribution to shareholders and therefore the fund will absorb the cost of currency fluctuations after the fund has distributed income subsequent foreign currency losses may result in the fund’s having distributed more income in a particular fiscal period than was available from investment income which could result in a return of capital to shareholders   securities lending the fund may seek to earn income by lending portfolio securities to brokerdealers or other institutional borrowers voting rights or rights to consent with respect to the loaned securities pass to the borrower the fund has the right to call loans at any time on reasonable notice and will do so if both i the adviser receives adequate notice of a proposal upon which shareholders are being asked to vote and ii the adviser believes that the benefits to the fund of voting on such proposal outweigh the benefits to the fund of having the security remain out on loan however the fund bears the risk of delay in the return of the security impairing the fund’s ability to vote on such matters as with other extensions of credit there are risks of delay in recovery or even loss of rights in the securities loaned if the borrower of the securities fails financially loans will only be made when the adviser believes the expected returns net of expenses justify the attendant risk securities loans currently are required to be secured continuously by collateral in cash cash equivalents such as money market instruments or other liquid securities held by the custodian and maintained in an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned   investment in other investment companies the fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies which can include openend funds closedend funds and unit investment trusts subject to the limits set forth in the  act that apply to those types of investments the fund may invest for example in exchangetraded funds which are typically openend funds or unit investment trusts listed on a stock exchange the fund might do so as a way of gaining exposure to the segments of the equity fixedincome markets or other markets represented by the exchangetraded funds’ portfolio at times when the fund may not be able to buy those portfolio securities directly   the shares of other investment companies may fluctuate in price and may be worth more or less when the fund sells them investing in another investment company may involve the payment of substantial premiums above the value of such investment company’s portfolio securities as a shareholder of an investment company the fund would be subject to its ratable share of that investment company’s expenses including its advisory and administration expenses   repurchase agreements the fund may enter into repurchase agreements with banks and brokerdealers it might do so with temporarily available cash eg pending the investment of the proceeds from sales of fund shares or pending the settlement of portfolio securities transactions or for temporary defensive purposes as described below a repurchase agreement is a contract under which the fund acquires a security for a relatively short period usually less than a week for cash and subject to the commitment of the seller to repurchase the security for an agreedupon price on a specified date the repurchase price exceeds the acquisition price and reflects an agreedupon market rate unrelated to the coupon rate on the purchased security approved sellers include us commercial banks us branches of foreign banks or brokerdealers that have been designated as primary dealers in government securities they must meet credit requirements set by the adviser from time to time repurchase agreements afford the fund the opportunity to earn a return on temporarily available cash without market risk although the fund bears the risk of a seller’s failure to meet its obligation to pay the repurchase price when it is required to do so such a default may subject the fund to expenses delays and risks of loss including i possible declines in the value of the underlying security while the fund seeks to enforce its rights thereto ii possible reduced levels of income and lack of access to income during this period and iii the inability to enforce its rights and the expenses involved in attempted enforcement entering into repurchase agreements entails certain risks which include the risk that the counterparty to the repurchase agreement may not be able to fulfill its obligations as discussed above that the parties may disagree as to the meaning or application of contractual terms or that the instrument may not perform as expected there is no limit on the amount of the fund’s net assets that may be subject to repurchase agreements having maturities of seven days or less   reverse repurchase agreements the fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements with banks and brokers reverse repurchase agreements involve sales by the fund of portfolio securities concurrently with an agreement by the fund to repurchase the same securities at a later date at a fixed price during the reverse repurchase agreement period the fund continues to receive principal and interest payments on the securities and also has the opportunity to earn a return on the collateral furnished by the counterparty to secure its obligation to redeliver the securities     table of contents  statement of additional information      if the buyer in a reverse repurchase agreement files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent the fund’s use of proceeds from the sale of its securities may be restricted while the other party or its trustee or receiver determines whether to honor the fund’s right to repurchase the securities furthermore in that situation the fund may be unable to recover the securities it sold in connection with a reverse repurchase agreement and as a result would realize a loss equal to the difference between the value of the securities and the payment it received for them this loss would be greater to the extent the buyer paid less than the value of the securities the fund sold to it eg a buyer may only be willing to pay  for a bond with a market value of  the fund’s use of reverse repurchase agreements also subjects the fund to interest costs based on the difference between the sale and repurchase price of a security involved in such a transaction additionally reverse repurchase agreements entail the same risks as otc derivatives these include the risk that the counterparty to the reverse repurchase agreement may not be able to fulfill its obligations that the parties may disagree as to the meaning or application of contractual terms or that the instrument may not perform as expected reverse repurchase agreements and dollar rolls are not considered borrowings by the fund for purposes of the fund’s fundamental investment restriction on borrowings if the fund covers its obligations under these transactions or maintains liquid assets equal in value to its obligations in respect of these transactions    “whenissued” and “delayeddelivery” transactions the fund may invest in securities on a “whenissued” basis and may purchase or sell securities on a “delayeddelivery” or “forwardcommitment” basis “whenissued” and “delayeddelivery” are terms that refer to securities whose terms and indenture are available and for which a market exists but which are not available for immediate delivery   when such transactions are negotiated the price which is generally expressed in yield terms is fixed at the time the commitment is made delivery and payment for the securities take place at a later date the securities are subject to change in value from market fluctuations during the period until settlement the value at delivery may be less than the purchase price for example changes in interest rates in a direction other than that expected by the adviser before settlement will affect the value of such securities and may cause a loss to the fund during the period between purchase and settlement the fund makes no payment to the issuer and no interest accrues to the fund from the investment until it receives the security at settlement   the fund may engage in whenissued transactions to secure what the adviser considers to be an advantageous price and yield at the time the obligation is entered into when the fund enters into a whenissued or delayeddelivery transaction it relies on the other party to complete the transaction its failure to do so may cause the fund to lose the opportunity to obtain the security at a price and yield the adviser considers to be advantageous   when the fund engages in whenissued and delayeddelivery transactions it does so for the purpose of acquiring or selling securities consistent with its investment objective and policies or for delivery pursuant to options contracts it has entered into and not for the purpose of investment leverage although the fund’s purpose in entering into delayeddelivery or whenissued purchase transactions is to acquire securities it may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if the fund chooses to dispose of the right to acquire a whenissued security prior to its acquisition or to dispose of its right to delivery or receive against a forward commitment it may incur a gain or loss   at the time the fund makes the commitment to purchase or sell a security on a whenissued or delayeddelivery basis it records the transaction on its books and reflects the value of the security purchased in determining the fund’s net asset value in a sale transaction it records the proceeds to be received the fund will identify on its books liquid assets at least equal in value to the value of the fund’s purchase commitments until the fund pays for the investment   whenissued and delayeddelivery transactions can be used by the fund as a defensive technique to hedge against anticipated changes in interest rates and prices for instance in periods of rising interest rates and falling prices the fund might sell securities in its portfolio on a forward commitment basis to attempt to limit its exposure to anticipated falling prices in periods of falling interest rates and rising prices the fund might sell portfolio securities and purchase the same or similar securities on a whenissued or delayeddelivery basis to obtain the benefit of currently higher cash yields   bank loans the fund may invest in bank loans by purchasing a loan the fund acquires some or all of the interest of a bank or other lending institution in a loan to a particular borrower the fund may hold a loan through another financial institution and in such cases would be purchasing a “participation” in the loan the fund also may purchase loans by assignment from another lender and in such cases would act as part of a lending syndicate many loans are secured by the assets of the borrower and most impose restrictive covenants that must be met by the borrower these loans are typically made by a syndicate of banks represented by an agent bank which has negotiated and structured the loan and which is responsible generally for collecting interest principal and other amounts from the borrower on its own behalf and on behalf of the other lending institutions in the syndicate and for enforcing its and their other rights against the borrower each of the lending institutions including the agent bank lends to the borrower a portion of the total amount of the loan and retains the corresponding interest in the loan     table of contents  statement of additional information      the fund’s ability to receive payments of principal and interest and other amounts in connection with loan participations held by it will depend primarily on the financial condition of the borrower as well as the financial institution from which it purchases the loan the value of collateral if any securing a loan can decline or may be insufficient to meet the borrower’s obligations or difficult to liquidate in addition the fund’s access to collateral may be limited by bankruptcy or other insolvency laws the failure by the fund to receive scheduled interest or principal payments on a loan would adversely affect the income of the fund and would likely reduce the value of its assets which would be reflected in a reduction in the fund’s nav banks and other lending institutions generally perform a credit analysis of the borrower before originating a loan or participating in a lending syndicate in selecting the loans in which the fund will invest however the adviser will not rely solely on that credit analysis but will perform its own investment analysis of the borrowers the adviser’s analysis may include consideration of the borrower’s financial strength and managerial experience debt coverage additional borrowing requirements or debt maturity schedules changing financial conditions and responsiveness to changes in business conditions and interest rates the adviser generally will not have access to nonpublic information to which other investors in syndicated loans may have access because loans in which the fund may invest generally are not rated by independent credit rating agencies a decision by the fund to invest in a particular loan will depend almost exclusively on the adviser’s and the original lending institution’s credit analysis of the borrower investments in loans may be of any quality including “distressed” loans and will be subject to the fund’s credit quality policy the loans in which the fund may invest include those that pay fixed rates of interest and those that pay floating rates  ie rates that adjust periodically based on a known lending rate such as a bank’s prime rate   investing directly in loans or other direct debt instruments exposes the fund to various risks similar to those borne by a creditor such risks include the risk of default the risk of delayed repayment and the risk of inadequate collateral transactions in many loans settle on a delayed basis and the fund may not receive the proceeds from the sale of a loan for a substantial period after the sale as a result those proceeds will not be available to make additional investments or to meet the fund’s redemption obligations   in addition when holding a loan participation the fund is subject to the credit risk of the intermediary financial institution if the fund holds its interest in a loan through another financial institution the fund likely would not be able to exercise its rights directly against the borrower and may not be able to cause the financial institution to take what it considers to be appropriate action if the fund relies on a financial institution to administer a loan the fund is subject to the risk that the financial institution may be unwilling or unable to demand and receive payments from the borrower in respect of the loan or otherwise unwilling or unable to perform its administrative obligations   financial institutions and government regulation the collapse of various large financial institutions and investment funds across the globe and widespread related losses have resulted in an ongoing severe liquidity crisis throughout the global credit markets during the last several years sectors of the credit markets continue to experience difficulty including the collateralized mortgagebacked securities and leveraged finance markets along with various other areas of consumer finance the lack of transparency and reliable pricing of assets has resulted in some investors withdrawing from the markets for assetbacked securities and related securities the resulting lack of liquidity has become sufficiently widespread to cause credit issues in areas of the capital markets that have limited exposure to subprime mortgages and has prompted central banks in the united states the european union the united kingdom and elsewhere to take action to attempt to ease these liquidity issues and has also resulted in the united states experiencing a broad and ongoing economic recession delinquencies and losses with respect to certain of these asset types such as auto loans have increased and may continue to increase high unemployment and the continued lack of availability of credit may lead to increased default rates on the collateral underlying many of these securities as a result this may adversely affect the performance and market value of the fund   if a perception develops that there is or in the future could be renewed regulatory focus on participants who benefit from their participation in any us governmentsponsored program or attempts by legislative andor regulatory bodies to impose new restrictions andor taxes and penalties on such participants possibly even with retroactive effect then the fund’s position in such securities may be compromised     table of contents  statement of additional information      the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which was signed into law in july  has resulted in significant revisions of the us financial regulatory framework the doddfrank act covers a broad range of topics including among many others a reorganization of federal financial regulators a process designed to ensure financial systematic stability and the resolution of potentially insolvent financial firms new rules for derivatives trading the creation of a consumer financial protection watchdog the registration and regulation of private funds the regulation of credit rating agencies and new federal requirements for residential mortgage loans the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and any resulting regulation is not yet certain and issuers in which the fund invests may also be affected by the new legislation and regulation in ways that are currently unforeseeable governments or their agencies also may acquire distressed assets from financial institutions and acquire ownership interests in those institutions the longterm implications of government ownership and disposition of these assets are unclear and may have positive or negative effects on the liquidity valuation and performance of the fund’s portfolio holdings   investment in relatively new issuers the fund may occasionally gain exposure to the equities of selected new issuers direct or indirect investments in relatively new issuers ie those having continuous operating histories of less than three years may carry special risks and may be more speculative because such companies are relatively unseasoned such companies also may lack sufficient resources may be unable to generate internally the funds necessary for growth and may find external financing to be unavailable on favorable terms or even totally unavailable those companies will often be involved in the development or marketing of a new product with no established market which could lead to significant losses the securities of such issuers may have a limited trading market which may adversely affect their disposition and can result in their being priced lower than might otherwise be the case if other investors who invest in such issuers trade the same securities when the fund attempts to dispose of its holdings the fund may receive lower prices than might otherwise be the case   treasury obligations treasury obligations may differ from other issuances in their interest rates maturities times of issuance and other characteristics similar to other issuers changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a government may cause the value of the fund’s direct or indirect investment in treasury obligations to decline on august   sp downgraded us treasury securities from aaa rating to aa a downgrade of the ratings of us government debt obligations which are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements could result in higher interest rates for individual and corporate borrowers cause disruptions in the international bond markets and generally have a substantial negative effect on the us economy a downgrade of treasury securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade beyond aa rating by sp may cause the value of the fund’s treasury obligations to decline   adjustable rate and auction preferred stocks typically the dividend rate on an adjustable rate preferred stock is determined prospectively each quarter by applying an adjustment formula established at the time of issuance of the stock although adjustment formulas vary among issues they typically involve a fixed premium or discount relative to rates on specified debt securities issued by the us treasury typically an adjustment formula will provide for a fixed premium or discount adjustment relative to the highest base yield of three specified us treasury securities the day treasury bill the year treasury note and the year treasury bond the premium or discount adjustment to be added to or subtracted from this highest us treasury base rate yield is fixed at the time of issue and cannot be changed without the approval of the holders of the stock the dividend rate on other preferred stocks commonly known as auction preferred stocks is adjusted at intervals that may be more frequent than quarterly such as every  days based on bids submitted by holders and prospective purchasers of such stocks and may be subject to stated maximum and minimum dividend rates the issues of most adjustable rate and auction preferred stocks currently outstanding are perpetual but are redeemable after a specified date at the option of the issuer certain issues supported by the credit of a highrated financial institution provide for mandatory redemption prior to expiration of the credit arrangement no redemption can occur if full cumulative dividends are not paid although the dividend rates on adjustable and auction preferred stocks generally are adjusted or reset frequently the market values of these preferred stocks still may fluctuate in response to changes in interest rates market values of adjustable preferred stocks also may substantially fluctuate if interest rates increase or decrease once the maximum or minimum dividend rate for a particular stock is approached   illiquid securities the fund may hold illiquid securities including among other instruments securities of some private issuers securities traded in unregulated or shallow markets and securities that are purchased in private placements and are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale because relatively few purchasers of these securities may exist especially in the event of adverse economic and liquidity conditions or adverse changes in the issuers financial condition the fund may not be able to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position in such investments at a desirable price or time disposing of illiquid securities may involve timeconsuming negotiation and legal expenses and selling them promptly at an acceptable price may be difficult or impossible   table of contents  statement of additional information      borrowing risk the fund’s investment portfolio which consists primarily of reinsurancerelated securities may limit the number of lenders willing to enter into a borrowing arrangement with the fund result in higher borrowing costs to the fund or less favorable terms under the arrangement because such securities are higher risk instruments as a result the fund may be required to modify its investment program in order to meet the terms of any borrowing arrangement if so the fund may not meet its investment objective   portfolio turnover purchases and sales of portfolio investments may be made as considered advisable by the adviser in the best interests of the shareholders the fund’s portfolio turnover rate may vary from yeartoyear as well as within a year the fund’s distributions of any net shortterm capital gains realized from portfolio transactions are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income in addition higher portfolio turnover rates can result in corresponding increases in portfolio transaction costs for the fund   for reporting purposes the fund’s portfolio turnover rate is calculated by dividing the lesser of purchases or sales of portfolio securities for the fiscal year by the monthly average of the value of the portfolio securities owned by the fund during the fiscal year in determining such portfolio turnover all securities whose maturities at the time of acquisition were one year or less are excluded a  portfolio turnover rate would occur for example if all of the securities in the fund’s investment portfolio other than shortterm money market securities were replaced once during the fiscal year portfolio turnover will not be a limiting factor should the adviser deem it advisable to purchase or sell securities   investment restrictions   fundamental investment restrictions of the fund   the following investment restrictions of the fund are designated as fundamental policies and as such cannot be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority of the fund’s outstanding voting securities under the  act a “majority” vote is defined as the vote of the holders of the lesser of a  or more of the shares of the fund present at a meeting if the holders of more than  of the outstanding shares are present or represented by proxy at the meeting or b more than  of the outstanding shares of the fund under these restrictions the fund    may not issue senior securities except as permitted under the  act    may not borrow money except to the extent permitted under the  act    may not underwrite securities issued by other persons except to the extent that in connection with the disposition of its portfolio investments it may be deemed to be an underwriter under federal securities laws    may not invest more than  of its total assets in a particular industry or group of industries other than securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or its agencies or instrumentalities    may not purchase or sell real estate although it may purchase securities of issuers which deal in real estate including securities of real estate investment trusts and may purchase securities which are secured by interests in real estate    may not purchase or sell commodities except that the fund may purchase and sell futures contracts and options may enter into foreign exchange contracts and may enter into swap agreements and other financial transactions not requiring the delivery of physical commodities and    may not make loans except by purchase of debt obligations in which the fund may invest consistent with its investment policies by entering into repurchase agreements or by lending its portfolio securities the fund may loan no more than onethird of its total assets   for purposes of construing restriction  a large economic or market sector shall not be construed as a single industry or group of industries as discussed in the fund’s prospectus and this sai the fund may invest more than  of its total assets in a single market sector specifically the financial services sector issuers of eventlinked bonds are generally classified as belonging to the financial services sector the fund will be subject to the risks associated with that sector     table of contents  statement of additional information      in determining whether a transaction is permitted under the  act restriction  above will not be construed to prohibit any transaction that is permitted under the  act as interpreted or modified or as otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction from time to time   the fund has also adopted the following fundamental policies in order to repurchase its shares   ·   on a quarterly basis in the months of january april july and october the fund will make an offer to repurchase a designated percentage of the outstanding shares from shareholders a “repurchase offer” pursuant to rule c under the  act as it may be amended from time to time   ·   the fund will repurchase shares that are tendered by a specific date the “repurchase request deadline” the fund’s board will establish the repurchase request deadline for each repurchase offer the repurchase request deadline will ordinarily be on a date approximately seven days before the repurchase occurs but such date may be revised by the adviser in its sole discretion based on factors such as market conditions the level of the fund’s assets and shareholder servicing considerations provided that the board is notified of this change and the reasons for it   ·   there will be a maximum  calendar day period or the next business day if the th calendar day is not a business day between the repurchase request deadline and the date on which the fund’s net asset value applicable to the repurchase offer is determined   trustees and officers   board of trustees   the business and affairs of the fund are managed under the oversight of the board subject to the laws of the state of delaware and the fund’s amended and restated agreement and declaration of trust the “declaration of trust” the trustees are responsible for deciding matters of overall policy and reviewing the actions of the fund’s service providers the officers of the fund conduct and supervise the fund’s daily business operations trustees who are not deemed to be “interested persons” of the fund as defined in the  act are referred to as “independent trustees” trustees who are deemed to be “interested persons” of the fund are referred to as “interested trustees”   the board meets as often as necessary to discharge its responsibilities currently the board conducts regular quarterly meetings including inperson or telephonic meetings and holds special inperson or telephonic meetings as necessary to address specific issues that require attention prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting in addition it is expected that the independent trustees meet at least annually to review among other things investment management agreements service plans and related agreements transfer agency agreements and certain other agreements and to consider such other matters as they deem appropriate   the board has established two standing committees — an audit committee and a valuation committee – which are described below the board may establish other committees or nominate one or more trustees to examine particular issues related to the board’s oversight responsibilities from time to time each committee meets periodically to perform its delegated oversight functions and reports its findings and recommendations to the board   the board does not have a lead independent trustee   the trustees have determined that the fund’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the trustees to effectively perform their oversight responsibilities   information about

procedures that are designed to avoid mitigate monitor and oversee areas that could present potential conflicts of interest the adviser attempts to address these potential conflicts of interest through various compliance policies that are generally intended to place all accounts regardless of fee structure on the same footing for investment management purposes the adviser has adopted trade allocation procedures that are designed to facilitate the fair allocation of limited investment opportunities among multiple funds the adviser’s trade allocation policies generally provide that each day’s transactions in securities that are purchased or sold by multiple accounts are averaged as to price and allocated between the funds in a manner that is equitable to each fund and in accordance with the amount being purchased or sold by each fund trade allocations are reviewed on a periodic basis as part of the adviser’s trade oversight procedures in an attempt to ensure fairness over time across funds and to monitor whether any fund is systematically favored over time there is no guarantee however that the policies and procedures adopted by the adviser and the fund will be able to detect andor prevent every situation in which an actual or potential conflict may appear   these potential conflicts include   allocation of limited time and attention a portfolio manager who is responsible for managing multiple funds may devote unequal time and attention to the management of those funds as a result the portfolio manager may not be able to formulate as complete a strategy or identify equally attractive investment opportunities for each of the funds as might be the case if he were to devote substantially more attention to the management of a single fund the effects of this potential conflict may be more pronounced where funds overseen by a particular portfolio manager have different investment strategies   allocation of limited investment opportunities if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment opportunity that may be suitable for multiple funds the opportunity may be allocated among these several funds which may limit the fund’s ability to take full advantage of the investment opportunity   pursuit of differing strategies at times a portfolio manager may determine that an investment opportunity may be appropriate for only some of the fund for which he exercises investment responsibility or may decide that certain of the funds should take differing positions with respect to a particular security in these cases the portfolio manager may place separate transactions for one or more funds which may affect the market price of the security or the execution of the transaction or both to the detriment or benefit of one or more other funds similarly the adviser or its personnel may take positions that are different from those taken by one or more funds   selection of brokersdealers portfolio managers may be able to select or influence the selection of the brokers and dealers that are used to execute securities transactions for the funds that they supervise in addition to executing trades some brokers and dealers provide portfolio managers with brokerage and research services as those terms are defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” which may result in the payment of higher brokerage fees than might have otherwise been available these services may be more beneficial to certain funds than to others   related business opportunities the adviser or its affiliates may provide more services such as distribution or recordkeeping for some types of funds than for others in such cases a portfolio manager may benefit either directly or indirectly by devoting disproportionate attention to the management of funds that provide greater overall returns to the adviser and its affiliates   variation in compensation a conflict of interest may arise where the financial or other benefits available to a portfolio manager differ among the fund that he manages if the structure of the adviser’s management fee andor a portfolio manager’s compensation differs among funds such as where certain funds pay higher management fees a portfolio manager might be motivated to help certain funds over others a portfolio manager might be motivated to favor funds in which he has an interest or in which the adviser andor its affiliates have interests similarly the desire to maintain or raise assets under management or to enhance a portfolio manager’s performance record or to derive other rewards financial or otherwise could influence a portfolio manager to lend preferential treatment to those funds that could most significantly benefit a portfolio manager     table of contents  statement of additional information      portfolio manager compensation   as of october   portfolio managers receive a base salary and may also receive a bonus compensation of a portfolio manager is determined at the discretion of the adviser it may be based on a number of factors including the portfolio manager’s experience responsibilities the perception of the quality of his or her work efforts and the consistency with which he or she demonstrates kindness to other employees trading counterparties vendors and clients as a firm focused on beta the compensation of portfolio

comprised of officers of the adviser to which they have delegated responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the valuation procedures and fair value determinations made on behalf of the board in accordance with these procedures the fund’s investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at market value listed below is a summary of certain of the methods generally used to value investments some or all of which may be held by the fund under the valuation procedures     table of contents  statement of additional information      shortterm debt instruments such as commercial paper bankers’ acceptances and us treasury bills having a maturity of less than  days are valued at amortized cost   other debt securities including corporate and government debt securities of us or foreign issuers and municipal debt securities in each case having a remaining maturity in excess of  days loans mortgagebacked securities collateralized mortgage obligations and other assetbacked securities except eventlinked bonds are valued by an independent pricing service at an evaluated or estimated mean between the closing bid and asked prices   eventlinked bonds are valued at the average bid price provided by an external pricing service based on bids issued by established market makers andor insurance companies or issued by one broker insurance or reinsurance company if only one quote is available   equity securities are valued at the last sale official close or if there are no reported sales at the mean between the bid and asked price on the primary exchange on which they are traded the values of the funds’ investments in publicly traded foreign equity securities generally will be determined by a pricing service using pricing models designed to estimate likely changes in the values of those securities between the times in which the trading in those securities is substantially completed and the close of the nyse   exchangetraded options are valued at the mean of the bid and asked prices overthecounter options are valued based on quotations obtained from a pricing service or from a broker typically the counterparty to the option   nonexchange traded derivatives are generally valued on the basis of valuations provided by a pricing service or using quotes provided by a brokerdealer typically the counterparty   with respect to pricing of certain reinsurancerelated eventlinked or similar restricted securities for which the funds can obtain an independent bid the funds will utilize a pricing service to provide pricing data to the administrator if the pricing service cannot obtain independent bids for such securities but there is an independent market maker or independent brokers who will supply bids for such securities then the adviser may supply the administrator with a contact from whom to obtain such bids if with respect to such securities independent bids are not available the administrator may obtain prices from an independent pricing service pricing is determined by the independent pricing service based on independent bids issued by brokers or a market maker andor through the use of an evaluated or estimated bid provided by the pricing service   if market quotations are not readily available including in cases where available market quotations are deemed to be unreliable or infrequent the fund’s investments will be valued as determined in good faith pursuant to the valuation procedures socalled “fair value pricing” fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of a security or other asset and fair values used to determine the fund’s nav may differ from quoted or published prices or from prices that are used by others for the same investments also the use of fair value pricing may not always result in adjustments to the prices of securities or other assets held by the fund and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security may be materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of such security the prospectus provides additional information regarding the circumstances in which fair value pricing may be used and related information   portfolio transactions and brokerage   investment decisions and portfolio transactions   investment decisions for the fund are made with a view to achieving its investment objective investment decisions are the product of many factors in addition to basic suitability for the particular client involved including the fund some securities considered for investment by the fund also may be appropriate for other clients served by the adviser thus a particular security may be bought or sold for certain clients even though it could have been bought or sold for other clients at the same time if a purchase or sale of securities consistent with the investment policies of the fund and one or more of these clients is considered at or about the same time transactions in such securities will be allocated among the fund and clients in a manner deemed fair and reasonable by the adviser the adviser will generally execute transactions for the fund on an aggregated basis when the adviser believes that to do so will allow it to obtain best execution and to negotiate more favorable commission rates or other transaction costs that might have otherwise been paid had such orders been placed independently aggregation or “bunching” describes a procedure whereby an investment adviser combines the orders of two or more clients into a single order for the purpose of obtaining better prices and lower execution costs     table of contents  statement of additional information      brokerage and research services   there is generally no stated commission in the case of securities traded on a principal basis in the overthecounter markets but the price paid by the fund usually includes an undisclosed dealer commission or markup in underwritten offerings the price paid by the fund includes a disclosed fixed commission or discount retained by the underwriter or dealer transactions on us stock exchanges and other agency transactions involve the payment by the fund of negotiated brokerage commissions such commissions vary among different brokers also a particular broker may charge different commissions according to such factors as the difficulty and size of the transaction transactions in nonus securities generally involve the payment of fixed brokerage commissions which are generally higher than those in the united states the purchase by the fund of participations or assignments may be pursuant to privately negotiated transactions pursuant to which the fund may be required to pay fees to the seller or forego a portion of payments in respect of the participation agreement   the adviser places orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities options and futures contracts and buys and sells such securities options and futures for the fund through multiple brokers and dealers in so doing the adviser uses its best efforts to obtain for the fund the most favorable price and execution available except to the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage commissions as described below in seeking the most favorable price and execution the adviser having in mind the fund’s best interests considers all factors it deems relevant including price the size of the transaction the nature of the market for the security the amount of the commission the timing of the transaction taking into account market prices and trends the reputation experience and financial stability of the brokerdealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the brokerdealer in that or other transactions   the adviser will place trades for execution only with approved brokers or dealers in effecting purchases and sales of portfolio securities for the accounts of the fund the adviser will seek the best price and execution of the fund’s orders in doing so the fund may pay higher commission rates than the lowest available when the adviser believes it is reasonable to do so in light of the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the broker effecting the transaction as discussed below although the fund may use a brokerdealer that sells fund shares to effect transactions for the fund’s portfolio the fund will not consider the sale of fund shares as a factor when selecting brokerdealers to execute those transactions   it has for many years been a common practice in the investment advisory business for advisers of investment companies and other institutional investors to receive research and brokerage products and services together “services” from brokerdealers which execute portfolio transactions for the clients of such advisers consistent with this practice the adviser receives services from many brokerdealers with which the adviser places the fund’s portfolio transactions these services which in some cases also may be purchased for cash may include among other things such items as general economic and security market reviews industry and company reviews evaluations of securities recommendations as to the purchase and sale of securities and services related to the execution of securities transactions the advisory fees paid by the fund are not reduced because the adviser receives such services even though the receipt of such services relieves the adviser from expenses they might otherwise bear research and brokerage services provided by brokerdealers chosen by the adviser to place the fund’s portfolio transactions may be useful to the adviser in providing services to the adviser’s other clients although not all of these services may be necessarily useful and of value to the adviser in managing the fund conversely research and brokerage services provided to the adviser by brokerdealers in connection with trades executed on behalf of other clients of the adviser may be useful to the adviser in managing the fund although not all of these services may be necessarily useful and of value to the adviser in managing such other clients   in reliance on the “safe harbor” provided by section e of the exchange act the adviser may cause the fund to pay a brokerdealer which provides “brokerage and research services” as defined for purposes of section e to the adviser an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction for the fund in excess of the commission which another brokerdealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the adviser makes a good faith determination that the commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of brokerage and research services provided viewed in terms of either a particular transaction or the adviser’s overall responsibilities to all discretionary accounts   the adviser may place orders for the purchase and sale of exchangelisted portfolio securities with a brokerdealer that is an affiliate of the adviser where in the judgment of the adviser such firm will be able to obtain a price and execution at least as favorable as other qualified brokerdealers pursuant to rules of the sec a brokerdealer that is an affiliate of the adviser may receive and retain compensation for effecting portfolio transactions for the fund on a securities exchange if the commissions paid to such an affiliated brokerdealer by the fund on exchange transactions do not exceed “usual and customary brokerage commissions” the rules define “usual and customary” commissions to include amounts which are “reasonable and fair compared to the commission fee or other remuneration received or to be received by other brokers in connection with comparable transactions involving similar securities being purchased or sold on a securities exchange during a comparable period of time”     table of contents  statement of additional information      because the fund traded all of its securities on a

fund’s total assets and not more than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not more than  of the value of the fund’s total assets is invested x in the securities other than those of the us government or other regulated investment companies of any one issuer or of two or more issuers that the fund controls and that are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or y in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships as defined below and   c   distribute with respect to each taxable year at least  of the sum of its investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the code without regard to the deduction for dividends paid  generally taxable ordinary income and the excess if any of net shortterm capital gains over net longterm capital losses and net taxexempt interest income for such year   in general for purposes of the  gross income requirement described in paragraph a above income derived from a partnership will be treated as qualifying income only to the extent such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership that would be qualifying income if realized directly by the regulated investment company however  of the net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” will be treated as qualifying income a “qualified publicly traded partnership” is defined as a partnership i interests in which are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and ii that derives less than  of its income from the qualifying income described in ai above in general such entities will be treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes because they meet the passive income requirement under section c of the code in addition although in general the passive loss rules of the code do not apply to regulated investment companies such rules do apply to a regulated investment company with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership     table of contents  statement of additional information      for purposes of the diversification test described in b above the term “outstanding voting securities of such issuer” will include the equity securities of a qualified publicly traded partnership also for purposes of the diversification test in b above the identification of the issuer or in some cases issuers of a particular fund investment can depend on the terms and conditions of that investment in some cases identification of the issuer or issuers is uncertain under current law and an adverse determination or future guidance by the internal revenue service “irs” with respect to issuer identification for a particular type of investment may adversely affect the fund’s ability to meet the diversification test in b above in addition if the fund were to own  or more of the voting interests of a corporation the fund would be required to “look through” such corporation to its holdings and combine the appropriate percentage of such corporation’s assets with the fund’s assets for purposes of satisfying the  diversification test described in bii above   gains from foreign currencies including foreign currency options foreign currency swaps foreign currency futures and foreign currency forward contracts currently constitute qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test described in a above however the treasury department has the authority to issue regulations possibly with retroactive effect excluding from the definition of “qualifying income” the fund’s foreign currency gains to the extent that such income is not directly related to the fund’s principal business of investing in stock or securities   the fund’s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company an adverse determination or future guidance by the irs might affect the fund’s ability to qualify for such treatment the tax treatment of certain investments under one or more of the qualification or distribution tests applicable to regulated investment companies may not be certain   the fund may invest in a whollyowned subsidiary that is treated as a controlled foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes the subsidiary will take steps to ensure that income recognized by the fund in respect of the subsidiary will be qualifying income and the fund will limit its investments in the subsidiary in the aggregate to  of the fund’s total assets   if the fund qualifies as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment the fund generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income distributed in a timely manner to its shareholders in the form of dividends including capital gain dividends as defined below   if the fund were to fail to meet the income diversification or distribution tests described above the fund could in some cases cure such failure including by paying a fundlevel tax paying interest making additional distributions or disposing of certain assets if the fund were ineligible to or otherwise did not cure such failure for any year or if the fund were otherwise to fail to qualify as a regulated investment company accorded special tax treatment for such year the fund would be subject to tax on its taxable income at corporate rates and all distributions from earnings and profits including any distributions of net taxexempt income and net longterm capital gains would be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income some portions of such distributions could be eligible for the dividends received deduction in the case of corporate shareholders and  may be eligible to be treated as “qualified dividend income” in the case of shareholders taxed as individuals provided in both cases that the shareholder meets certain holding period and other requirements in respect of the fund’s shares as described below in addition the fund could be required to recognize unrealized gains pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions before requalifying as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment   the fund intends to distribute to its shareholders at least annually substantially all of its investment company taxable income computed without regard to the dividendspaid deduction any net taxexempt income and any net capital gains investment company taxable income that is retained by the fund will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates the fund may also retain for investment its net capital gain if the fund retains any net capital gain it will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained but the fund may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice mailed within  days of the close of the fund’s taxable year to its shareholders who in turn i will be required to include in income for us federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gain their shares of such undistributed amount and ii will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the fund on such undistributed amount against their us federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds on properlyfiled us tax returns to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities if the fund makes this designation for us federal income tax purposes the tax basis of shares owned by a shareholder of the fund will be increased by an amount equal under current law to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital gains included in the shareholder’s gross income under clause i of the preceding sentence and the tax deemed paid by the shareholder under clause ii of the preceding sentence the fund is not required to and there can be no assurance that the fund will make this designation if it retains all or a portion of its net capital gain in a taxable year     table of contents  statement of additional information      in determining its net capital gain including in connection with determining the amount available to support a capital gain dividend its taxable income and its earnings and profits a regulated investment company may elect to treat any postoctober capital loss defined as any net capital loss attributable to the portion if any of the taxable year after october  or if there is no such loss the net longterm capital loss or net shortterm capital loss attributable to any such portion of the taxable year or lateyear ordinary loss generally the sum of its i net ordinary loss from the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of property attributable to the portion if any of the taxable year after october  and its ii other net ordinary loss attributable to the portion if any of the taxable year after december  as if incurred in the succeeding taxable year   if the fund fails to distribute in a calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of  of its ordinary income for such year and  of its capital gain net income for the oneyear period ending on october  of such year plus any retained amount for the prior year the fund will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax on the undistributed amounts for these purposes ordinary gains and losses from the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of property that would be properly taken into account after october  are treated as arising on january  of the following calendar year for purposes of the excise tax the fund will be treated as having distributed any amount on which it has been subject to corporate income tax in the taxable year ending within the calendar year a dividend paid to shareholders in january of a year generally is deemed to have been paid on december  of the preceding year if the dividend is declared and payable to shareholders of record on a date in october november or december of that preceding year the fund intends generally to make distributions sufficient to avoid imposition of the  excise tax although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so   fund distributions   shareholders subject to us federal income tax will be subject to tax on dividends received from the fund regardless of whether received in cash or reinvested in additional shares such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received distributions received by taxexempt shareholders generally will not be subject to us federal income tax to the extent permitted under applicable tax law   for us federal income tax purposes distributions of investment income generally are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income taxes to shareholders on distributions of capital gains are determined by how long the fund owned and is treated for us federal income tax purposes as having owned the investments that generated them rather than how long a shareholder has owned his or her shares in general the fund will recognize longterm capital gain or loss on investments it has owned or is deemed to have owned for more than one year and shortterm capital gain or loss on investments it has owned or is deemed to have owned for one year or less tax rules can alter the fund’s holding period in investments and thereby affect the tax treatment of gain or loss on such investments distributions of net capital gain that is the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss in each case determined with reference to any loss carryforwards that are properly reported by the fund as capital gain dividends “capital gain dividends” generally will be taxable to shareholders as longterm capital gains includible in net capital gain and taxed to individuals at reduced rates distributions of net shortterm capital gain as reduced by any longterm capital loss for the taxable year will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income and shareholders will not be able to offset distributions of the fund’s net shortterm capital gains with capital losses that they recognize with respect to their other investments as required by federal law detailed federal tax information with respect to each calendar year will be furnished to each shareholder early in the succeeding year   the ultimate tax characterization of the fund’s distributions made in a taxable year cannot finally be determined until after the end of that taxable year the fund may make total distributions during a taxable year in an amount that exceeds the fund’s “current and accumulated earnings and profits” generally the net investment income and net capital gains of the fund with respect to that year in which case the excess generally will be treated as a return of capital which will be taxfree to the holders of the shares up to the amount of the shareholder’s tax basis in the applicable shares with any amounts exceeding such basis treated as gain from the sale of such shares   capital losses in excess of capital gains “net capital losses” are not permitted to be deducted against the fund’s net investment income instead potentially subject to certain limitations the fund may carry net capital losses from any taxable year forward to subsequent taxable years without expiration to offset capital gains if any realized during such subsequent taxable years capital loss carryforwards are reduced to the extent they offset currentyear net realized capital gains whether the fund retains or distributes such gains the fund must apply such carryforwards first against gains of the same character the fund’s available capital loss carryforwards if any will be set forth in its annual shareholder report for each fiscal year     table of contents  statement of additional information      “qualified dividend income” received by an individual will be taxed at the rates applicable to net capital gain in order for some portion of the dividends received by the fund shareholder to be “qualified dividend income” the fund must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to some portion of the dividendpaying stocks in its portfolio and the shareholder must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to the fund’s shares in general a dividend will not be treated as qualified dividend income at either the fund or shareholder level  if the dividend is received with respect to any share of stock held for fewer than  days during the day period beginning on the date that is  days before the date on which such share becomes exdividend with respect to such dividend or in the case of certain preferred stock  days during the day period beginning  days before such date  to the extent that the recipient is under an obligation whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property  if the recipient elects to have the dividend income treated as investment income for purposes of the limitation on deductibility of investment interest or  if the dividend is received from a foreign corporation that is a not eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the united states with the exception of dividends paid on stock of such a foreign corporation readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states or b treated as a passive foreign investment company   in general distributions of investment income reported by the fund as derived from qualified dividend income will be treated as qualified dividend income by a shareholder taxed as an individual provided both the shareholder and the fund meet the holding period and other requirements described above if the aggregate qualified dividends received by the fund during any taxable year are  or more of its gross income excluding net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss then  of the fund’s dividends other than capital gain dividends will be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income   in general dividends of net investment income received by corporate shareholders of the fund will qualify for the  dividends received deduction generally available to corporations to the extent of the amount of eligible dividends received by the fund from domestic corporations for the taxable year a dividend received by the fund will not be treated as a dividend eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction   if it has been received with respect to any share of stock that the fund has held for less than  days  days in the case of certain preferred stock during the day period beginning on the date which is  days before the date on which such share becomes exdividend with respect to such dividend during the day period beginning  days before such date in the case of certain preferred stock or  to the extent that the fund is under an obligation pursuant to a short sale or otherwise to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property moreover the dividendsreceived deduction may otherwise be disallowed or reduced  if the corporate shareholder fails to satisfy the foregoing requirements with respect to its shares of the fund or  by application of various provisions of the code for instance the dividendsreceived deduction is reduced in the case of a dividend received on debtfinanced portfolio stock generally stock acquired with borrowed funds   any distribution of income that is attributable to i income received by the fund in lieu of dividends with respect to securities on loan pursuant to a securities lending transaction or ii dividend income received by the fund on securities it temporarily purchased from a counterparty pursuant to a repurchase agreement that is treated for us federal income tax purposes as a loan by the fund will not constitute qualified dividend income to individual shareholders and will not be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction for corporate shareholders   the code generally imposes a  medicare contribution tax on the net investment income of certain individuals trusts and estates to the extent their income exceeds certain threshold amounts for these purposes “net investment income” generally includes among other things i distributions paid by the fund of net investment income and capital gains as described above and ii any net gain from the sale redemption or exchange of fund shares shareholders are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this additional tax on their investment in the fund   dividends and distributions on shares of the fund are generally subject to us federal income tax as described herein to the extent they do not exceed the fund’s realized income and gains “current and accumulated earnings and profits” even though such dividends and distributions may economically represent a return of a particular shareholder’s investment such distributions are likely to occur in respect of shares purchased at a time when the net asset value of the fund reflects either unrealized gains or realized and undistributed income or gains that were therefore included in the price the shareholder paid such realized income or gains may be required to be distributed regardless of whether the fund’s net asset value also reflects unrealized losses such distributions may reduce the fair market value of the fund’s shares below the shareholder’s cost basis in those shares     table of contents  statement of additional information      sale exchange or redemption of shares   the repurchase sale or exchange of fund shares may give rise to a gain or loss in general any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares will be treated as longterm capital gain or loss if the shareholder has held the shares for more than  months otherwise the gain or loss generally will be treated as shortterm capital gain or loss however any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares held for six months or less will be treated as longterm rather than shortterm to the extent of any capital gain dividends received or deemed received by the shareholder with respect to those shares all or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of fund shares will be disallowed under the code’s “wash sale” rule if other substantially identical shares of the fund are purchased within  days before or after the disposition in such a case the basis of the newly purchased shares will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss   shareholders who offer all of the shares they hold or are deemed to hold in response to a periodic repurchase offer see “periodic repurchase offers” in the prospectus generally will be treated as having sold their shares and generally will recognize a capital gain or loss as described in the preceding paragraph however if a shareholder tenders fewer than all of its shares such shareholder may be treated as having received a distribution under section  of the code “section  distribution” unless the redemption is treated as being either i “substantially disproportionate” with respect to such shareholder or ii otherwise “non essentially equivalent to a dividend” under the relevant rules of the code a section  distribution is not treated as a sale or exchange giving rise to capital gain or loss but rather is treated as a dividend to the extent supported by the fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits with the excess treated as a return of capital reducing the shareholder’s tax basis in its fund shares and thereafter as capital gain where a redeeming shareholder is treated as receiving a dividend there is a risk that other shareholders of the fund whose percentage interests in the fund increase as a result of such redemption will be treated as having received a taxable distribution from the fund   the fund’s use of cash to repurchase shares could adversely affect the fund’s ability to satisfy the distribution requirements for qualification as a ric the fund could also recognize income in connection with the liquidation of portfolio securities to fund share repurchases any such income would be taken into account in determining whether the distribution requirements are satisfied   passive foreign investment companies   equity investments by the fund in passive foreign investment companies “pfics” could potentially subject the fund to a us federal income tax or other charge including interest charges on the distributions received from the pfic or on proceeds received from the disposition of shares in the pfic this tax cannot be eliminated by making distributions to fund shareholders however the fund may elect to avoid the imposition of that tax for example if the fund is in a position to and elects to treat a pfic as a “qualified electing fund” ie make a “qef election” the fund will be required to include its share of the pfic’s income and net capital gains annually regardless of whether it receives any distribution from the pfic alternatively the fund may make an election to mark the gains and to a limited extent losses in such holdings “to the market” as though it had sold and repurchased its holdings in those pfics on the last day of the fund’s taxable year such gains and losses are treated as ordinary income and loss the qef and marktomarket elections may accelerate the recognition of income without the receipt of cash and increase the amount required to be distributed by the fund to avoid taxation making either of these elections therefore may require the fund to liquidate other investments including when it is not advantageous to do so to meet its distribution requirement which also may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the fund’s total return dividends paid by pfics will not be eligible to be treated as “qualified dividend income”   a pfic is any foreign corporation i  or more of the gross income of which for the taxable year is passive income or ii the average percentage of the assets of which generally by value but by adjusted tax basis in certain cases that produce or are held for the production of passive income is at least  generally passive income for this purpose means dividends interest including income equivalent to interest royalties rents annuities the excess of gains over losses from certain property transactions and commodities transactions and foreign currency gains passive income for this purpose does not include rents and royalties received by the foreign corporation from active business and certain income received from related persons it is not always possible to identify a foreign corporation as a pfic and the fund may therefore incur the tax and interest charges described above in some instances     table of contents  statement of additional information      controlled foreign corporations   certain of the foreign issuers in which the fund invests may be “controlled foreign corporations” “cfcs” for us federal income tax purposes a us person who owns directly indirectly or constructively  or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation is a “us shareholder” for purposes of the cfc provisions of the code generally a foreign corporation is a cfc if on any day of its taxable year more than  of the voting power or value of its stock is owned directly indirectly or constructively by “us shareholders” if the fund is a “us shareholder” of a cfc the fund will be required to include in gross income for us federal income tax purposes all of the cfc’s “subpart f income” defined below whether or not such income is distributed by the cfc “subpart f income” generally includes interest original issue discount dividends net gains from the disposition of stocks or securities receipts with respect to securities loans net gains from transactions including futures forward and similar transactions in commodities and net payments received with respect to equity swaps and similar derivatives subpart f income is treated as ordinary income regardless of the character of the cfc’s underlying income net losses incurred by a cfc during a tax year do not flow through to the fund and thus will not be available to offset income or capital gain generated from the fund’s other investments in addition net losses incurred by a cfc during a tax year generally cannot be carried forward by the cfc to offset gains realized by it in subsequent tax years the fund’s recognition of any subpart f income from an investment in a cfc will increase the fund’s tax basis in such cfc distributions by the cfc to the fund will be taxfree to the extent of the cfc’s previously undistributed subpart f income and will correspondingly reduce the fund’s tax basis in the cfc and any distributions in excess of the fund’s tax basis in such cfc will be treated as realized gain to the extent the fund recognizes subpart f income in excess of actual cash distributions from a cfc the fund may be required to sell assets including when it is not advantageous to do so to generate the cash necessary to distribute as dividends to its shareholders all of its income and gains and therefore to eliminate any tax liability at the fund level   the subsidiary will be a cfc and the fund will be a us shareholder thereof therefore the rules described in the preceding paragraph will apply to the fund’s investment in the subsidiary a foreign corporation such as the subsidiary generally will not be subject to us taxation unless it is treated as engaged in a us trade or business the subsidiary expects to operate in a manner such that it is not so treated if it were the subsidiary would be subject to us federal income tax on a net basis at a rate of  and would be subject to an additional  branch profits tax thus reducing the yield of the fund’s investment in the subsidiary   foreign taxation   income received by the fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by such countries tax treaties between certain countries and the us may reduce or eliminate such taxes if more than  of the fund’s assets at the close of the taxable year consists of the securities of foreign corporations the fund may elect to permit shareholders to claim a credit or deduction on their income tax returns for their pro rata portions of qualified taxes paid by the fund to foreign countries in respect of foreign securities that the fund has held under code rules for at least the minimum period specified in the code for this purpose “securities of foreign corporations generally includes securities of foreign governments in such a case shareholders will include in gross income from foreign sources their pro rata shares of such taxes paid by the fund a shareholder’s ability to claim an offsetting foreign tax credit or deduction in respect of such foreign taxes is subject to certain limitations imposed by the code which may result in the shareholder’s not receiving a full credit or deduction if any for the amount of such taxes for example shareholders who do not itemize on their us federal income tax returns may claim a credit but not a deduction for such foreign taxes even if the fund were eligible to make such an election for a given year it may determine not to do so shareholders that are not subject to us federal income tax and those who invest in the fund through taxadvantaged accounts including those who invest through individual retirement accounts or other taxadvantaged retirement plans generally will receive no benefit from any tax credit or deduction passed through by the fund   original issue discount and market discount   some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance and all zerocoupon debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance will be treated as debt obligations that are issued originally at a discount generally the amount of the original issue discount “oid” is treated as interest income and is included in the fund’s taxable income and required to be distributed by the fund over the term of the debt obligation even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time ie upon partial or full repayment or disposition of the debt security or is received in kind rather than in cash increases in the principal amount of an inflationindexed bond will be treated as oid     table of contents  statement of additional information      some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance that are acquired by the fund in the secondary market may be treated as having “market discount” very generally market discount is the excess of the stated redemption price of a debt obligation or in the case of an obligation issued with oid its “revised issue price” over the purchase price of such obligation generally any gain recognized on the disposition of and any partial payment of principal on a debt obligation having market discount is treated as ordinary income to the extent the gain or principal payment does not exceed the “accrued market discount” on such debt obligation alternatively the fund may elect to accrue market discount currently in which case the fund will be required to include the accrued market discount in the fund’s income as ordinary income and thus distribute it over the term of the debt security even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time upon partial or full repayment or disposition of the debt security the rate at which the market discount accrues and thus is included in the fund’s income will depend upon which of the permitted accrual methods the fund elects   some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of one year or less from the date of issuance may be treated as having “acquisition discount” very generally the excess of the stated redemption price over the purchase price or oid in the case of certain types of debt obligations generally the fund will be required to include the acquisition discount or oid in income as ordinary income over the term of the debt obligation even though payment of that amount is not received until a later timeie upon partial or full repayment or disposition of the debt security or is received in kind rather than in cash the fund may make one or more of the elections applicable to debt obligations having acquisition discount or oid which could affect the character and timing of recognition of income   if the fund holds the foregoing kinds of securities it may be required to pay out as an income distribution each year an amount that is greater than the total amount of cash interest the fund actually received such distributions may be made from the cash assets of the fund or by liquidation of portfolio securities if necessary including when it is not advantageous to do so the fund may realize gains or losses from such liquidations in the event the fund realizes net capital gains from such transactions its shareholders may receive a larger capital gain distribution than they would in the absence of such transactions   securities purchased at a premium   very generally where the fund purchases a bond at a price that exceeds the redemption price at maturity – that is at a premium – the premium is amortizable over the remaining term of the bond in the case of a taxable bond if the fund makes an election applicable to all such bonds it purchases which election is irrevocable without consent of the irs the fund reduces the current taxable income from the bond by the amortized premium and reduces its tax basis in the bond by the amount of such offset upon the disposition or maturity of such bonds the fund is permitted to deduct any remaining premium allocable to a prior period   higherrisk securities   investments in debt obligations that are at risk of or in default present special tax issues for the fund tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as whether when or to what extent the fund should recognize market discount on a debt obligation when the fund may cease to accrue interest oid or market discount when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless securities and how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income these and other related issues will be addressed by the fund when as and if it invests in such securities in order to seek to ensure that it distributes sufficient income to preserve its eligibility for treatment as a regulated investment company and does not become subject to us federal income or excise tax   issuer deductibility of interest    a portion of the interest paid or accrued on certain high yield discount obligations owned by the fund may not be deductible to and thus may affect the cash flow of the issuer if a portion of the interest paid or accrued on certain high yield discount obligations is not deductible that portion will be treated as a dividend for purposes of the corporate dividends received deduction in such cases if the issuer of the high yield discount obligations is a domestic corporation dividend payments by the fund may be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction to the extent of the deemed dividend portion of such accrued interest interest paid on debt obligations owned by the fund if any that are considered for us tax purposes to be payable in the equity of the issuer or a related party will not be deductible to the issuer possibly affecting the cash flow of the issuer     table of contents  statement of additional information      derivative transactions   the fund’s transactions in derivative instruments as well as any of its other hedging short sale securities loan or similar transactions may be subject to one or more special tax rules including marktomarket constructive sale notional principal contract straddle wash sale and short sale rules these rules may affect whether gains and losses recognized by the fund are treated as ordinary or capital or as shortterm or longterm accelerate the recognition of income or gains to the fund defer losses to the fund and cause adjustments in the holding periods of the fund’s securities these rules therefore could affect the amount timing and character of distributions to shareholders because these and other tax rules applicable to the fund’s investments are in some cases uncertain under current law an adverse determination or future guidance by the irs with respect to these rules may affect whether the fund has made sufficient distributions and otherwise satisfied the relevant requirements to maintain its qualification as a regulated investment company and avoid a fundlevel tax   certain of the fund’s investments in derivative instruments and in foreigncurrency denominated instruments and any of the fund’s transactions in foreign currencies and hedging activities are likely to produce a difference between the fund’s book income and the sum of its taxable income and net taxexempt income if any if the fund’s book income is less than the sum of its taxable income and net taxexempt income if any the fund could be required to make distributions exceeding book income to qualify as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment and to avoid a fundlevel tax if in the alternative the fund’s book income exceeds the sum of its taxable income including realized capital gains and net taxexempt income if any the distribution if any of such excess will be treated as i a dividend to the extent of the fund’s remaining earnings and profits including earnings and profits arising from taxexempt income ii thereafter as a return of capital to the extent of the recipient’s basis in its shares and iii thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset   taxexempt shareholders   income of a regulated investment company that would be ubti if earned directly by a taxexempt entity will not generally be attributed as ubti to a taxexempt shareholder of a regulated investment company notwithstanding this “blocking” effect a taxexempt shareholder could recognize ubti by virtue of its investment in the fund if shares in the fund constitute debtfinanced property in the hands of the taxexempt shareholder within the meaning of code section b   foreign currency transactions   the fund’s transactions in foreign currencies foreign currencydenominated debt obligations and certain foreign currency options futures contracts and forward contracts and similar instruments may give rise to ordinary income or loss to the extent such income or loss results from fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency concerned any such net gains could require a larger dividend toward the end of the calendar year any such net losses will generally reduce and potentially require the recharacterization of prior ordinary income distributions such ordinary income treatment may accelerate fund distributions to shareholders and increase the distributions taxed to shareholders as ordinary income any net ordinary losses so created cannot be carried forward by the fund to offset income or gains earned in subsequent taxable years   nonus shareholders   capital gain dividends are generally not subject to withholding of us federal income tax absent a specific statutory exemption dividends other than capital gain dividends paid by the fund to a shareholder that is not a “us person” within the meaning of the code such shareholder a “foreign shareholder” are subject to withholding of us federal income tax at a rate of  or lower applicable treaty rate even if they are funded by income or gains such as portfolio interest shortterm capital gains or foreign source dividend and interest income that if paid to a foreign shareholder directly would not be subject to withholding   effective for distributions with respect to taxable years of the fund beginning before january   a regulated investment company is not required to withhold any amounts i with respect to distributions other than distributions to a foreign shareholder w that does not provide a satisfactory statement that the beneficial owner is not a us person x to the extent that the dividend is attributable to certain interest on an obligation if the foreign shareholder is the issuer or is a  shareholder of the issuer y that is within certain foreign countries that have inadequate information exchange with the united states or z to the extent the dividend is attributable to interest paid by a person that is a related person of the foreign shareholder and the foreign shareholder is a controlled foreign corporation from ussource interest income of types similar to those not subject to us federal income tax if earned directly by an individual foreign shareholder to the extent such distributions are properly reported as such by the fund in a written notice to shareholders “interestrelated dividends” and ii with respect to distributions other than a distributions to an individual foreign shareholder who is present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating  days or more during the year of the distribution and b distributions subject to special rules regarding the disposition of us real property interests as described below of net shortterm capital gains in excess of net longterm capital losses to the extent such distributions are properly reported by the fund “shortterm capital gain dividends” the fund is permitted to report such part of its dividends as interestrelated or shortterm capital gain dividends as are eligible but is not required to do so in the case of shares held through an intermediary the intermediary may withhold even if the fund reports all or a portion of a payment as an interestrelated or shortterm capital gain dividend to shareholders these exemptions from withholding will not be available to foreign shareholders of the fund if it does not currently report its dividends as interestrelated or shortterm capital gain dividends     table of contents  statement of additional information      the exemption from withholding for interestrelated and shortterm capital gain dividends will expire for distributions with respect to taxable years of the fund beginning on or after january   it is currently unclear whether congress will extend this exemption from withholding for interestrelated and shortterm capital gain dividends for distributions with respect to taxable years of the fund beginning on or after january   or what the terms of such an extension would be including whether such extension would have retroactive effect   foreign shareholders should contact their intermediaries regarding the application of these rules to their accounts   under us federal tax law a foreign

for the management and supervision of the trust the declaration of trust permits the trustees to issue an unlimited number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest of the fund or other series of the trust with or without par value under the declaration of trust the trustees have the authority to create and classify shares of beneficial interest in separate series and classes without further action by shareholders as of the date of this sai the fund is the only series of the trust to the extent permissible by law additional series may be added in the future   the shares of the fund represent an equal proportionate interest in the net assets attributable to such shares of the fund shareholders have certain exclusive voting rights on matters relating to their respective distribution plan if any different classes of the fund if any may bear different expenses relating to the cost of holding shareholder meetings necessitated by the exclusive voting rights of any class of shares   unless otherwise required by the  act or the declaration of trust the trust has no intention of holding annual meetings of shareholders trust shareholders may remove a trustee by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the trust’s outstanding shares and the trustees shall promptly call a meeting for such purpose when requested to do so in writing by the record holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the trust shareholders may under certain circumstances communicate with other shareholders in connection with requesting a special meeting of shareholders however at any time that less than a majority of the trustees holding office were elected by the shareholders the trustees will call a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing trustees   in

holders to one vote per share and fractional votes for fractional shares are freely transferable and have no preemptive subscription or conversion rights when issued shares are fully paid and nonassessable   the declaration of trust disclaims shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the trust the declaration of trust further provides for indemnification out of the fund’s property for all loss and expense of any shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the fund by reason of owning shares of the fund thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is considered remote since it is limited to circumstances in which the disclaimer is inoperative and the fund itself would be unable to meet its obligations   the declaration of trust further provides that the board will not be liable for errors of judgment or mistakes of fact or law however nothing in the declaration of trust protects a trustee against any liability to which the trustee would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office the declaration of trust of the trust provides for indemnification by the trust of trustees and officers of the trust however such persons may not be indemnified against any liability to the trust or

her office   the fund reserves the right to reject any purchase order application that conflicts with the fund’s internal policies or the policies of any regulatory authority the fund does not accept

the “trust” was organized as a delaware statutory trust on july   and is registered under the investment company act of  the “ act” as amended as a continuouslyoffered nondiversified closedend management investment company issuing shares as of april   the trust consisted of one series the “fund” the stone ridge reinsurance risk premium interval fund the “reinsurance risk premium interval fund” the fund commenced operations on december   the fund offers one class of shares to investors with no frontend or backend sales charges a  shareholder service fee no b fees and does not charge a redemption fee there are an unlimited number of authorized shares   the fund has an interval fund structure pursuant to which the fund subject to applicable laws will conduct quarterly repurchase offers typically for  of the fund’s outstanding shares at net asset value subject to approval of the board of trustees and in all cases such repurchases will be for at least  and not more than  of the fund’s outstanding shares in connection with any given repurchase offer it is possible that the fund may offer to repurchase only the minimum amount of  of its outstanding shares it is also possible that a repurchase offer may be oversubscribed with the result that shareholders may only be able to have a portion of their shares repurchased the fund does not currently intend to list its shares for trading on any national securities exchange there is no secondary trading market in the shares the shares are therefore not readily marketable   the investment objective of fund is to achieve longterm capital appreciation the fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing in eventlinked bonds quota shares and to a lesser extent eventlinked swaps equity securities and derivatives of equity securities of companies in the reinsurance industry    summary of significant accounting policies   the following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial statements the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap”   a investment valuation and fair value measurement in determining the net asset value “nav” of the fund’s shares investments in openend mutual funds including money market funds are generally priced at the ending nav provided by the service agent of the trust investments in closedend mutual funds are valued at the last sale price on the exchange on which the shares are primarily traded   futures contracts are valued at the settlement price on the exchange on which they are primarily traded   debt securities with a remaining maturity in excess of  days including corporate debt securities and municipal debt securities collateralized mortgage obligations loans and other assetbacked securities are valued daily using the mean between the closing bid and asked prices provided by either a pricing service or two independent brokers debt securities with a remaining maturity of less than  days are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value   eventlinked bonds catastrophe bonds are valued using average firm bids from at least two independent brokers or at least one firm bid from an independent market maker in the event that the trust’s pricing vendor is unable to provide two independent broker firm bids or a market maker firm bid for eventlinked bonds the adviser will use an indicative price or firm bid as the price of the security or average if multiple such prices provided that the adviser valuation committee the “committee” comprised of officers of the adviser and established pursuant to the policies and procedures adopted by the board determines that the indicative price or firm bid is reasonable the committee will use internal andor independent external models to generate marks for the security if the internal andor independent external marks are within a predetermined range of the indicative price or firm bid then the committee may deem the indicative price or firm bid as reasonable if the pricing sources above are not available the committee will fair value the security pursuant to procedures approved by the board of trustees eventlinked bonds and similar restricted securities are valued on a weekly basis and on the last business day of each month the adviser monitors eventlinked bonds daily for significant events that could affect the value of these investments   participation notes and preference shares “quota shares” and private fund units are valued using at least one firm bid from an independent market maker in the event that the trust’s pricing vendor is unable to provide a market maker firm bid for quota shares the adviser will use an indicative price or firm bid as the price of the security or average if multiple such prices provided that the committee determines that the indicative price or firm bid is reasonable the committee            notes to financial statements april   unaudited   will use internal andor independent external models to generate marks for the security if the internal andor independent external marks are within a predetermined range of the indicative price or firm bid then the committee may deem the indicative price or firm bid as reasonable if the pricing sources above are not available the committee will fair value the security pursuant to procedures approved by the board of trustees quota shares and private fund units are valued on a weekly basis and on the last business day of each month the adviser monitors quota shares and private fund units daily for significant events that could affect the value of these investments   overthecounter “otc” options are valued at the mean of the bid and asked quotations if bid and ask are not available the committee will fair value the security pursuant to procedures approved by the board of trustees   if market values are not readily available including in cases where available market quotations are deemed to be unreliable or infrequent the fund’s investments will be valued as determined in good faith pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the board “fair value pricing” in these circumstances the fund determines fair value in a manner that fairly reflects the market value of the security on the valuation date based on consideration of any information or factors it deems appropriate as further described below the committee has the responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the fund’s valuation procedures and fair value determinations made on behalf of the board for purposes of determining fair value of securities the committee may use or make use of a variety of valuation methodologies including without limitation i mathematical techniques that refer to the prices of similar or related securities ii a percentage increase or decrease across all securities of a region country or industry affected by a significant event iii a multiple of earnings iv a discount from market of a similar freely traded security v the yield to maturity of debt securities vi the recommendation of a pricing service vii a single broker’s or insurance company’s quote viii recent primary andor secondary market transactions that the fund believes to be comparable ix modeling or development of events or x any combination of the above fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of an asset or liability fair values used to determine the fund’s navs may differ from quoted or published prices or from prices that are used by others for the same investments the use of fair value pricing may not always result in adjustments to the prices of securities or other assets or liabilities held by the fund and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security may be materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of such security   the fund has adopted authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish an authoritative definition of fair value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value these standards require additional disclosures about the various inputs and valuation techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   level  inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the fund has the ability to access at the measurement date   level  significant inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly including inputs in markets that are not considered to be active and firm bids from brokers or market makers which are not publically available   level  significant inputs that are unobservable   inputs are used in applying the various valuation techniques and broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make valuation decisions including assumptions about risk a financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement however the determination of what constitutes “observable” requires significant judgment by the adviser the adviser considers observable data to be that market data which is readily available regularly distributed or updated reliable and verifiable not proprietary and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market the categorization of a financial instrument within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the instrument and does not necessarily correspond to the adviser’s perceived risk of that instrument          there were no transfers between levels during the reporting period transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period the following table summarizes the inputs used to value the fund’s investments as of april

value measurement a high amount of loss from severe weather may also increase market risk spreads quota shares are monitored daily for significant events that could affect the value of the instruments   derivative transactions – the fund engaged in derivatives and hedging activities during the period ended april   the use of derivatives included options and futures contracts further information regarding derivative activity for the fund can be found in the schedule of investments   futures contracts – the fund may purchase and sell futures contracts the fund held futures contracts during the period ended april   the fund uses futures contracts to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange rate exposure with futures there is minimal counterparty credit risk to the fund since futures are exchange traded and the exchange’s clearinghouse as counterparty to all exchange traded futures guarantees the futures against default upon entering into a contract a fund deposits and maintains as collateral an initial margin as required by the exchange on which the transaction is effected pursuant to the contract a fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract such receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by a fund as unrealized gains and losses when the contract is closed a fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed in connection with physically settled futures contracts a fund is required under the  act to maintain assets consisting of cash cash equivalents or liquid securities the amount of the segregated assets is required to be adjusted daily to reflect the market value of the purchase obligation for long futures contracts or the market value of the instrument underlying the contract but not less than the market price at which the futures contract was established for short futures contracts   the average notional amount of futures contracts during the period ended april   were as follows                        short futures contracts         foreign currency contracts        us treasury contracts        total short futures contracts        options – the fund may purchase and write call or put options on securities and indices and enter into related closing transactions the fund wrote call or put options during the period ended april   the fund writes put and call options to earn premium income with options there is minimal counterparty credit risk to the fund since options are exchange traded and the exchange’s clearinghouse as counterparty to all exchange traded options guarantees the options against default otc options are customized agreements between the parties with otc options there is no clearinghouse guarantee against default thus otc options are subject to the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligations under the contract          notes to financial statements april   unaudited   as the writer of a call option the fund has the obligation to sell the security at the exercise price during the exercise period as a writer of a put option the fund has the obligation to buy the underlying security at the exercise price during the exercise period the premium that the fund pays when purchasing a call option or receives when writing a call option will reflect among other things the market price of the security the relationship of the exercise price to the market price of the security the relationship of the exercise price to the volatility of the security the length of the option period and supply and demand factors the premium is the market value of the option   a purchaser holder of a put option pays a nonrefundable premium to the seller writer of a put option to obtain the right to sell a specified amount of a security at a fixed price the exercise price during a specified period exercise period conversely the seller writer of a put option upon payment by the holder of the premium has the obligation to buy the security from the holder of the put option at the exercise price during the exercise period when an option is exercised the premium originally received decreases the cost basis of the underlying security or increases the proceeds on the security sold short and the fund realizes a gain or loss from the sale of the security or closing of the short sale   options on indices including weather indices are similar to options on securities except that the index options require cash settlement payments and do not involve the actual purchase or sale of securities   the fund engaged in options during the period ended april   the average market value of written options for the period ended april   was as follows                           written options         the fund did not transact in purchased options during the period ended april     transactions in options written during the period ended april   were as follows                     otc options   contracts   premiums     outstanding beginning of period     –    –     options written               options terminated in closing transactions     –     –     options exercised     –     –     options expired             outstanding end of period     –    –     the

the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   c indemnifications in the normal course of business the fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations which provide general indemnifications the fund’s maximum exposure under these arrangements cannot be known however the fund expects any risk of loss to be remote   d federal income taxes the fund intends to qualify as a “regulated investment company” under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended if so qualified the fund will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent it distributes substantially all of its net investment income and capital gains to shareholders therefore no federal income tax provision is required   e eventlinked bonds eventlinked bonds are variable rate debt securities for which the return of principal and payment of interest are contingent on the nonoccurrence of a specified trigger events that leads to economic andor human loss such as an earthquake of a particular magnitude or a hurricane of a specific category the most common types of eventlinked bonds are known as “catastrophe” or “cat” bonds in most cases the trigger events will not be deemed to have occurred unless the events happened in a particular geographic area and was of a certain magnitude based on independent scientific readings or caused a certain amount of actual or modeled loss if the trigger events occurs prior to a bond’s maturity the fund may lose all or a portion of its principal and forgo additional interest payments in this regard eventlinked bonds typically have a special condition that states that if the issuer ie an insurance or reinsurance company suffers a loss from a particular predefined catastrophe then the issuer’s obligation to pay interest andor repay the principal is either deferred or completely forgiven for example if a fund holds a bond which covers an insurer’s losses due to a hurricane with a “trigger” at  billion and a hurricane hits causing  billion or more in losses to such insurer then the fund will lose all or a portion of its principal invested in the bond and forgo any future interest payments if the trigger events does not occur the fund will recover its principal plus interest interest typically accrues and is paid on a quarterly basis although principal typically is repaid only on the maturity date it may be repaid in installments depending on the terms of the bond the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds directly or indirectly through certain derivative instruments eventlinked swaps are derivative instruments that are typically contingent or formulaically related to defined trigger events trigger events include hurricanes earthquakes and weatherrelated phenomena   f quota shares quota shares are a form of proportional reinsurance in which an investor participates in the premiums and losses of a reinsurer’s portfolio according to a predefined percentage for example under a  quotashare agreement a special purpose vehicle “spv” would obtain  of all premiums of the subject portfolio while being responsible for  of all claims and the fund as holder of a quota share note issued by the spv would be entitled to its pro rata share of the premiums received by the spv and would be responsible for its pro rata share of the claims up to the total amount invested   g distributions to shareholders the fund intends to distribute to its shareholders any net investment income and any net realized long or shortterm capital gains if any at least annually distributions are recorded on exdividend date the fund may periodically make reclassifications among certain of its capital accounts as a result of the characterization of certain income and realized gains determined annually in accordance with federal tax regulations that may differ from generally accepted accounting principles   h foreign securities and currency transactions the fund’s books and records are maintained in us dollars foreign currency denominated transactions ie market value of investment securities assets and liabilities purchases and sales of investment securities and income and expenses are translated into us dollars at the current rate of exchange the fund isolates that portion of results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held and it is reported as realized gains on currency translation and change in unrealized appreciation on foreign currency related items on the fund’s statement of operations          notes to financial statements april   unaudited   the fund may invest in eventlinked securities issued by foreign sovereigns and foreign entities that are corporations partnerships trusts or other types of business entities because the majority of eventlinked security issuers are domiciled outside the united states the fund will normally invest significant amounts of its assets in nonus entities certain spvs in which the fund invests may be sponsored by nonus ceding insurers that are not subject to the same regulation as that to which us ceding insurers are subject such spvs may pose a greater risk of loss for example due to less stringent underwriting andor riskretention requirements the fund’s investments consist partially of eventlinked bonds which provide the fund with contractual rights under the terms of the bond issuance while the contractual rights of eventlinked bonds issued are similar whether they are issued by a us issuer or a nonus issuer there may be certain additional risks associated with nonus issuers for example foreign issuers could be affected by factors not present in the us including expropriation confiscatory taxation lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards less publicly available financial and other information potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and increased costs to enforce applicable contractual obligations outside the us settlements of securities transactions in foreign countries are subject to risk of loss may be delayed and are generally less frequent than in the us which could affect the liquidity of the fund’s assets   i other investment transactions are recorded on the trade date dividend income less any foreign tax withheld is recognized on the exdividend date and interest income is recognized on an accrual basis including amortization accretion of premiums or discounts discounts and premiums on securities purchased are amortized over the lives of the respective securities using the constant yield method   j restricted securities the fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets in securities that are restricted but eligible for purchase and sale by certain qualified buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended as well as other restricted securities restricted securities may be resold in transactions that are exempt from registration under federal securities laws or if the securities are publically registered restricted securities may be deemed illiquid    federal tax matters   provisions for federal income taxes or excise taxes have not been made since the funds have elected to be taxed as regulated investment companies and intend to distribute substantially all taxable income to shareholders and otherwise comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code applicable to regulated investment companies distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may include shortterm capital gains which are included as ordinary income to shareholders for tax purposes additionally us generally accepted accounting principles require that certain components of net assets relating to permanent differences be reclassified between financial and tax reporting the reclassifications have no effect on net assets or net asset value per share   for the period ended october   the effect of permanent “booktax” reclassifications resulted in increases and decreases to components of the funds’ net assets as follows                           undistributed net investment incomeloss   accumulated net realized gainloss   paid in capital                      these differences primarily relate to foreign currency gainlosses and investments in passive foreign investment companies pfics            notes to financial statements april   unaudited   as of october   the components of accumulated earnings losses for income tax purposes were as follows                           tax cost of investments         unrealized appreciation          unrealized depreciation         net unrealized depreciation         undistributed ordinary income          undistributed longterm gains     –     total undistributed earnings          net unrealized depreciation         other accumulated gain          total accumulated earnings         the difference between bookbasis and taxbasis unrealized depreciation is attributable primarily to markettomarket adjustments on pfics   there is no tax liability resulting from unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain income tax provisions taken or expected to be taken on the tax return for the fiscal periodend october   which is the fund’s only open tax year the fund recognizes interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the statement of operations during the period the fund did not incur any interest or penalties    agreements   a investment advisory agreement stone ridge asset management llc

quality of the security being rated however the ratings are general and are not absolute standards of quality or guarantees as to the creditworthiness of an issuer consequently the adviser believes that the quality of debt securities in which the fund invests should be continuously reviewed a rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security because it does not take into account market value or suitability for a particular investor when a security has received a rating from more than one service each rating should be evaluated independently ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by the ratings services from other sources which they consider reliable ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or for other reasons the following is a description of the characteristics of ratings used by moody’s and standard  poor’s moody’s ratings aaa— obligations rated aaa are judged to be of the highest quality subject to the lowest level of credit risk aa—obligations rated aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk a—obligations rated a are judged to be uppermedium grade and are subject to low credit risk baa—obligations rated baa are judged to be mediumgrade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics ba—obligations rated ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk b—obligations rated b are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk caa—obligations rated caa are judged to be speculative of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk ca—obligations rated ca are highly speculative and are likely in or very near default with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest c—obligations rated c are the lowest rated and are typically in default with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest moody’s appends numerical modifiers   and  to each generic rating classification from aa through caa the modifier  indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category standard  poor’s ratings aaa—an obligation rated ‘aaa’ has the highest rating assigned by standard  poor’s the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aa—an obligation rated ‘aa’ differs from the highestrated obligations only to a small degree the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong     table of contents  statement of additional information a   a—an obligation rated ‘a’ is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbb—an obligation rated ‘bbb’ exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation bb b ccc cc and c—obligations rated ‘bb’ ‘b’ ‘ccc’ ‘cc’ and ‘c’ are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics ‘bb’ indicates the least degree of speculation and ‘c’ the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions bb—an obligation rated ‘bb’ is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation b—an obligation rated ‘b’ is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated ‘bb’ but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation ccc—an obligation rated ‘ccc’ is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation cc—an obligation rated ‘cc’ is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment the ‘cc’ rating is used when a default has not yet occurred but standard  poor’s expects default to be a virtual certainty regardless of the anticipated time to default c—an obligation rated ‘c’ is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment and the obligation is expected to have lower relative seniority or lower ultimate recovery compared to obligations that are rated higher d—an obligation rated ‘d’ is in default or in breach of an imputed promise for nonhybrid capital instruments the ‘d’ rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due unless standard  poor’s believes that such payments will be made within five business days in the absence of a stated grace period or within the earlier of the stated grace period or  calendar days the ‘d’ rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty for example due to automatic stay provisions an obligation’s rating is lowered to ‘d’ if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer nr—this indicates that no rating has been requested or that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating or that standard  poor’s does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy the ratings from ‘aa’ to ‘ccc’ may be modified by the addition of a plus  or minus  sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories     table of contents  statement of additional information a     appendix b   stone ridge asset management llc proxy voting policies and procedures i           governing standards   stone ridge asset management llc the “adviser” has adopted written proxy voting policies and guidelines “the proxy policy” as required under rule  the “rule” of the investment advisers act of  “advisers act” in addition to covering the voting of equity securities the proxy policy also applies generally to voting andor consent rights of fixed income securities including but not limited to plans of reorganization waivers and consents under applicable indentures the proxy policy which has been designed to ensure that adviser votes proxies in the best interest of its clients and provides clients with information about how their proxies are voted contains procedures to mitigate conflicts of interests between clients and adviser and its advisory affiliates when voting proxies   ii           policy   the proxy policy applies to those client accounts that contain voting securities and for which adviser has been delegated the authority to vote client proxies when voting proxies for client accounts adviser’s primary objective is to make voting decisions solely in the best interest on behalf of all clients for which it manages assets the adviser has selected an unaffiliated third party proxy research and voting service institutional shareholder services inc “iss” or “proxy voting service” to assist it in researching recordkeeping and voting of proxies with respect to each proxy received the proxy voting service researches the financial implications of the proposals and provides a recommendation to adviser as to how to vote on each proposal based on the proxy voting service’s research of the individual facts and circumstances and the proxy voting service’s application of its research findings to a set of guidelines iss’ us proxy voting summary guidelines these guidelines have been approved by adviser and though adviser intends to vote consistent with the voting recommendation of the proxy voting service upon the recommendation of the applicable portfolio managers adviser may determine to override any recommendation made by the proxy voting service or abstain from voting in the event that the proxy voting service does not provide a recommendation with respect to a proposal adviser may determine to vote on the proposals directly   with respect to the voting of proxies relating to fixed income securities or other debt instruments the proxy policy does not apply however to consent rights that primarily entail decisions to buy or sell investments such as tender or exchange offers conversions put options redemption and dutch auctions the proxy policy is designed and implemented in a manner reasonably expected to ensure that voting and consent rights are exercised in the best interests of the funds and their shareholders   adviser may determine not to vote a proxy for a debt or equity security if  the effect on the applicable economic interests or the value of the portfolio holding is insignificant in relation to an individual’s account portfolio or in the aggregate with all clients  the cost of voting the proxy outweighs the possible benefit to the applicable account including without limitation situations where a jurisdiction imposes share blocking restrictions which may affect the ability of the portfolio managers to effect trades in the related security or  adviser otherwise has determined that it is consistent with its fiduciary obligations not to vote the proxy   in addition neither adviser nor the proxy voting service will be able to vote for any securities on loan by an account in the event that adviser is aware of a material vote on behalf of the mutual fund and adviser has the ability to call back loans and is aware of the securities on loan by the custodian adviser may call back the loan and vote the proxy if time permits   adviser will not accept direction on how to vote individual proxies for which it has voting responsibility from any other person or organization other than the research and information provided by its independent proxy voting service subject to specific provisions in a client’s account documentation related to exception voting in fulfilling its obligations to clients adviser will act in a manner deemed to be prudent and diligent and which is intended to enhance the economic value of the underlying securities held in client accounts    a firm’s advisory affiliates are defined in this policy to include  all officers partners directors or any person performing similar functions  all persons directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the adviser and  all current employees     table of contents  statement of additional information b     iii           conflicts of interest procedures   for voting of securities adviser believes that application of the guidelines to vote proxies should in most cases adequately address any possible conflicts of interest since the guidelines are predetermined however the potential for conflicts of interest exists to the extent the portfolio managers have discretion to vote differently than the guidelines as a general practice adviser will vote in accordance with the voting recommendation provided by the proxy voting service in the event that adviser wishes to vote against the independent voting recommendation adviser requires chief compliance officer “cco” approval prior to a vote being cast   for voting of fixed income securities adviser believes the potential for material conflicts of interest to arise between the interests of the client and the interests of adviser is limited however there may be a potential for a conflict of interest which adviser or its related persons or entities may be a named party to or participating in a bankruptcy workout or other similar committee with respect to the issuer in such instances the portfolio manager must notify the cco prior to casting any decision on behalf of clients   upon the identification or notice received by the cco that there is a conflict of interest with respect to casting a vote the cco will discuss the proxy with the relevant portfolio managers and other senior management in order to determine if the conflict is material in instances where a portfolio manager proposes to vote a proxy inconsistent with the guidelines and a potential immaterial conflict is identified the cco will review the proxy votes in order to determine whether a portfolio manager’s voting rationale appears reasonable upon the detection of a material conflict of interest the cco has final decisionmaking authority regarding adviser’s course of action for the proxy the cco’s determination will be based on maximizing value for adviser’s clients   iv           voting guidelines   for accounts that invest in voting securities adviser has approved the iss’ us proxy voting summary guidelines these guidelines are intended to provide a general overview of iss’ united states policy guidelines by highlighting the key policies that iss applies to companies listed in the united states however iss’ analysis is on a casebycase basis taking into consideration sector industry and business performance factors   for a list of the voting guidelines please visit   httpwwwissgovernancecompolicypolicyinformation   v           amendment   adviser may from time to time amend this policy andor adopt such interpretations of this policy as it deems appropriate provided however that such changes are approved by adviser management   adviser will supervise and periodically review its proxy voting activities and the implementation of the proxy policy all reports and any other information filed with adviser pursuant to this policy shall be treated as confidential except that the same may be disclosed to adviser’s management any regulatory or selfregulatory authority or agency upon its request or as required by law or court or administrative order all records of adviser’s proxy voting
