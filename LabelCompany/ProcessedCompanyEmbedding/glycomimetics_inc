glycomimetics skip to primary navigation skip to content skip to primary sidebar skip to footercontact us menu  main navigationplatform glycomimetics is focused on discovering and developing novel medicines based on an understanding of the role carbohydrates play in important biological processes almost all human proteins that are expressed within the cell are modified by the posttranslational addition of complex carbohydrates to the protein surface many of these carbohydrate structures affect the functions of these proteins and their interactions with other molecules one key to understanding many complex biological interactions therefore is to understand the functional role that specific carbohydrates play this field of study is known as glycobiology the structures of carbohydrates account for much of the complexity and functionality of proteins and protein activity as the structures and roles played by specific carbohydrates are defined glycomimetics is designing specific molecules that can act on these biological processes the term “glycomimetics” refers to molecules that mimic the structure and activity of carbohydrates glycomimetics is discovering and developing compounds that are mimetics of naturally occurring carbohydrates glycomimetics and not natural carbohydrates themselves our product candidates are rationally designed to function more like traditional therapeutics eg exhibiting good bioavailability and pharmacokinetics and to enhance the key biological activity over the native carbohydrate structures by delivering on highly differentiated product profiles glycomimetics drug candidates have potential to address significant unmet medical needs in addition to our drug candidates in the clinic which target vasoocclusive

myeloma by blocking eselectin gmi also may protect normal bloodproducing cells and reduce the toxic side effects of chemotherapy such as low white blood cell counts that make some patients more prone to infections gmi has been tested in healthy volunteers and is now being tested in individuals with aml via a phase  clinical trial results of preclinical studies were presented at the annual meeting of the american society of hematology ash and at the american association for cancer researchers aacr annual meeting gmi has not been approved for use by any worldwide health authority in june  glycomimetics announced that it received fast track designation from the us food and drug administration fda for gmi for treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory aml and elderly patients aged  years or older with aml interim data reports on the ongoing phase  trial have been presented at eha in june  and at ash in december  showing high remission rates and a good safety profile in the study so far about the current trial in aml the study is a multicenter openlabel phase  trial using gmi in combination with standard chemotherapy in individuals with aml the investigational agent will be given throughout the chemotherapy treatment period some additional bone marrow and blood samples will be obtained during routine bone marrow assessments to further inform study doctors about drug activity for more information for more information on the trial and to find a participating site near you please visit httpsclinicaltrialsgovctshowncttermgmirank if you have
