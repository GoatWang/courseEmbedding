define “adjusted ebitda” as ebitda less i customer acquisition costs incurred in the current period ii net gain loss on derivative instruments and iii net current period cash settlements on derivative instruments plus iv noncash compensation expense and v other noncash and nonrecurring operating items ebitda is defined as net income loss before provision for income taxes interest expense and depreciation and amortization we deduct all current period customer acquisition costs representing spending for organic customer acquisitions in the adjusted ebitda calculation because such costs reflect a cash outlay in the period in which they are incurred even though we capitalize such costs and amortize them over two years in accordance with our accounting policies the deduction of current period customer acquisition costs is consistent with how we manage our business but the comparability of adjusted ebitda between periods may be affected by varying levels of customer acquisition costs for example our adjusted ebitda is lower in years of customer growth reflecting larger customer acquisition spending we do not deduct the cost of customer acquisitions through acquisitions of business or portfolios of customers in calculated adjusted ebitda we deduct our net gains losses on derivative instruments excluding current period cash settlements from the adjusted ebitda calculation in order to remove the noncash impact of net gains and losses on derivative instruments we also deduct noncash compensation expense as a result of restricted stock units that are issued under our longterm incentive planwe believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our liquidity and financial condition and results of operations and that adjusted ebitda is also useful to investors as a financial indicator of our ability to incur and service debt pay dividends and fund capital expenditures adjusted ebitda is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our condensed consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors commercial banks and rating agencies use to assess the followingour operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the retail energy industry without regard to financing methods capital structure or historical cost basisthe ability of our assets to generate earnings sufficient to support our proposed cash dividends andour ability to fund capital expenditures including customer acquisition costs and incur and service debtreconciliation of spark’s estimate of adjusted ebitda for the year ended december   to the relevant gaap line items is not being provided as spark is not providing  guidance for net income loss net cash provided by operating activities or the reconciling items between these gaap financial measures and adjusted ebitda spark does not provide guidance for such items because it is not possible to forecast the future noncash impacts of net gains and losses on derivative instruments and noncash compensation expense attributable to grants of equity under our long term incentive plan additionally it is not possible to forecast our provision for income taxes due to the potential for change in our noncontrolling interests’ ownership percentage given the nature of our upc structure accordingly a reconciliation to net income loss or net cash provided by operating activities is not available without unreasonable effortretail gross marginwe define retail gross margin as operating income loss plus i depreciation and amortization expenses and ii general and administrative expenses less i net asset optimization revenues ii net gains losses on nontrading derivative instruments and iii net current period cash settlements on nontrading derivative instruments retail gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity business by removing the impacts of our asset optimization activities and net noncash income loss impact of our economic hedging activities as an indicator of our retail energy business’ operating performance retail gross margin should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than operating income loss its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaapwe believe retail gross margin provides information useful to investors as an indicator of our retail energy businesss operating performancethe gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities the gaap measure most directly comparable to retail gross margin is operating income loss our nongaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss net cash provided by operating activities or operating income loss adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin are not presentations made in accordance with gaap and have important limitations as analytical tools you should not consider adjusted ebitda or retail gross margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap because adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin exclude some but not all items that affect net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities and are defined differently by different companies in our industry our definition of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companiesmanagement compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these data points into management’s decisionmaking processthe following
