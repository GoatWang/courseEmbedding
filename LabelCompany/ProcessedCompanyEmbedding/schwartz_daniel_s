schwartz is running burger king like a startup than a fast food behemoth heres what happenedby disco volanteoctober   in  burger king announced that daniel schwartz a yearold cornell graduate was going to take over as ceo complete with an annual salary of  and potential cash bonus of m he never worked in a restaurant didn’t climb the corporate ladder and had only been with the company for  years seem crazy the only crazy part is how much sense it makes here’s the backstory making moves daniel schwartz had a typical suburban upbringing he grew up on long island and attended the wheatley school where he played basketball and was an honors student after high school daniel shipped off  hours upstate to cornell where he made the dean’s list and in  graduated with a degree in management and applied economics a couple stints at credit suisse and a hedge fund later daniel saw that the brazilianbased investment firm g capital was opening an office in new york and looking for recruits it was  daniel had just turned  and he thought it seemed like a good fit g capital agreed and he got the job in case you aren’t familiar with g capital here are some of the bigger bullet points they created a company called ambev in  ambev merged with the belgianbased company interbrew in  creating inbev inbev bought anheuserbusch in  for b bud light in  g capital bought burger king for b whoppers in  they bought the canadian chain tim hortons for b merged it with burger king and formed restaurant brands international coffee donuts burgers in  they partnered with berkshire hathaway to buy kraft and merge it with heinz forming the kraft heinz company worth about b cheese ketchup etc needless to say they like big old american staples and aren’t fucking around back to burger king and our young ceo daniel played a key role pushing papers during the acquisition and after it was finalized he became deputy chief financial officer of the fast food chain it was his job to cut unnecessary expenditures like the corporate jet the extravagant annual company party at an italian chateau and of course the fancy mahogany offices these cutbacks didn’t stop at the bigticket items either apparently he required everyone to make longdistance calls on skype to save on phone bills send files via email instead of fedex and use communal printers to guilt people into saving paper that’s why in  when the head honcho left to run heinz also owned by g capital it was an easy decision to promote daniel as the st ceo of burger king to put a  yearold ceo in perspective the average age of ceos in the sp  is  zuck being the youngest at  warren buffett the oldest at  is this stuff legit organizations like g capital make their money through mergers and acquisitions– buying selling dividing and combining companies to create value it’s a chess match played with spreadsheets and a means of sparking growth through market dynamics and organizational efficiency rather than relying solely on stuff like product marketing and sales in monopoly terms it’s like two players teaming up halfway through the game to create a monopoly instead of grinding it out until everyone gets bored one has ventnor the other has marvin gardens and atlantic and combined they can start building houses this type of business is totally legal but it really opens the door for exploiting loopholes to gain every advantage possible for example people got pretty peeved when burger king merged with tim hortons in  because from an outside perspective it looked like a clear case of tax inversion– when american companies relocate overseas to avoid paying us taxes maybe this was true maybe not burger king claimed in a statement that the “transaction was driven by growth not tax rates” according to the watchdog group americans for tax fairness however they’re projected to save as much as  million by  from forgone capital gains taxes a changing of the guard this type of drastic shift in mentality doesn’t happen every day for big corporations and from my perspective it’s strangely refreshing investors like g capital look to make big changes quickly and as a result are willing to take risks on young enthusiasm over experience just look at their executive team the cfo is  and the head of investor relations is  now instead of a bloated slowmoving behemoth the company updated its strategy trimmed some fat and invested in highgrowth areas it’s operating like a startup and so far the results are speaking for themselves between  and december  burger king’s shares have gone up roughly  and their market cap doubled to over b that means considering the original price tag and extra profit g capital was essentially able to buy the company for nothing clearly they’re happy with the new direction even the franchise owners love the change and are happy with schwartz calling him “extremely smart” and a “very fast learner” needless to say things are working out well so far for the young ceo i guess it should’ve been expected though based on his senior quote from  “some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them”william shakespeare twelfth night if

razor startup that’s disrupting the  billion men’s grooming industry burger kings ceo daniel schwartz is  years old  bloomberg features burger king is run by children what happened when a bunch of kids took over america’s secondlargest burger chain by devin leonard more stories by devin leonard july    pm edt illustration kyle platts last summer a trim guy with wavy brown hair high cheekbones and a broad smile could be found making whoppers working the drivethrough window and scrubbing bathrooms at a burger king in miami his name was daniel schwartz he learned to make a whopper in less than  seconds and blended in well with his fellow employees except for the fact that schwartz had a guy with a video camera trailing him “i cleaned about  toilets in the past two days” he boasted at one point as if he’d just completed a marathon schwartz was justifiably pumped that june he’d been named burger king’s chief executive officer with a  annual salary and a potential cash bonus of twice that there was another reason for schwartz to be exuberant he was only  and well on his way to becoming a star in the fastfood industry making sure the fixtures in burger king’s restrooms gleam is only one of schwartz’s challenges he’s burger king’s st ceo since the company was founded in  the chain has had six owners and suffered from years of neglect and strategic incoherence unlike his predecessors schwartz isn’t just competing with mcdonald’s and wendy’s he has to keep customers from straying to trendy newcomers such as chipotle mexican grill and panera bread their sales in the us last year grew  percent and  percent respectively according to technomic a food industry consultant sales were essentially flat for burger king and its two primary rivals photographer boru obrien oconnell for bloomberg businessweek schwartz looks much as he did when he was a student on the dean’s list at cornell university all the way back in the aughts he had no experience in fast food before going to burger king he spent almost a decade on wall street after college and he’s surrounded himself with a similarly eager and freshfaced inner circle josh kobza the chief financial officer is  he and schwartz are usually joined on conference calls by alexandre macedo burger king’s ancient yearold president for north american operations and sami siddiqui the head of investor relations who’s  only one of the four saw a day of the seventies schwartz is an outlier in the corporate world matteo tonello managing director at the conference board a nonprofit research organization that studies such things says chief executives that young are a rarity outside of tech enclaves such as silicon valley he says the average age of an incoming ceo at a company in the standard  poor’s stock index was  last year schwartz would be the secondyoungest ceo on the fortune  behind mark zuckerberg if burger king made that list according to figures from boardex a firm that analyzes data about corporate executives and directors “the conventional wisdom is that you need an experienced candidate” tonello says “there’s still a lot of skepticism toward younger ones” these days however burger king is behaving more like a startup than a typical burger chain in  it was purchased for  billion in a leveraged buyout by g capital the brazilian private equity firm that also owns hj heinz with berkshire hathaway and whose principals are among the controlling shareholders of anheuserbusch inbev jorge paulo lemann g’s yearold billionaire cofounder likes to enlist young executives and put them in top positions at the firm’s companies “who says you have to be old to be good” says william ackman the new york hedge fund manager who runs pershing square capital management burger king’s largest investor after g schwartz and his coworkers are apostles of g’s ferocious approach to cost reduction they talk about the need to instill everybody at burger king with an “ownership mentality” meaning mainly that employees should husband the company’s money as if it were their own that’s put an end to some cherished perks after inbev swallowed anheuserbusch in  the american brewery’s executives were informed that they’d no longer get free cases of beer in september bloomberg news reported that executives at heinz bought three months earlier by g and berkshire hathaway had been commanded to turn in their minifridges schwartz who did not cooperate for this article has overseen much chiseling mcdonald’s owned  percent of its  restaurants worldwide in  wendy’s owned  percent of its  outlets historically burger king operated much the same way when g bought the chain in  it owned  percent of its  restaurants around the world since then burger king has sold all but  it keeps the last few for training executives and testing products that’s such a departure from the way its competitors operate that some people are questioning the company’s strategy “unless you keep a certain percentage of stores you don’t really know how the business is operating” says malcolm knapp a new york restaurant industry consultant he contends that burger king’s management is interested primarily in siphoning cash out of the business howard penney managing director of hedgeye risk management a research firm in stamford conn is similarly skeptical of schwartz’s methods “it’s financial engineering” he says burger king disputes this but such suspicions are reasonable after unloading more than  restaurants the company’s corporate head count has fallen from  to  in  now its income flows almost entirely from royalty fees from franchisees on average  percent of franchisees’ monthly revenue that’s less money than before overall but burger king has become a cash machine and g hasn’t been shy about helping itself to some of that money schwartz second from right and coworkers celebrate burger kings return to the stock market in  source nyse at the same time burger king’s business has been growing schwartz negotiated agreements with restaurant operators and financiers in brazil china and russia where american hamburgers are still a novelty they haven’t just purchased restaurants from burger king they’ve also constructed new ones as a result the number of burger kings worldwide rose by  in  to  and the company hasn’t had to spend much money its partners are putting up the bulk of the cash wall street has responded enthusiastically burger king went public again in june  in an offering that put a  billion value on the company as of early july its market cap had risen to more than  billion the doubters are in the minority now and many in the investment community would like mcdonald’s and wendy’s to mimic the kids at burger king “these things are seemingly working at burger king and causing questions to be asked about the strategy of others in fast food” says david palmer an analyst who covers the restaurant industry for ticker symbolryrbc capital marketsticker “like why aren’t you doing what they’re doing” schwartz grew up in albertson ny an uppermiddleclass long island suburb near the border of queens he went to the wheatley school where he played basketball and was an honors student carol vogt his history teacher there thinks he’ll make an accomplished fastfood company ceo “he’ll do fine if he’s anything like he was when he was younger” she says “he’s a very hard worker” schwartz made no secret of his big dreams he summed them up with a quote from shakespeare’s twelfth night that he chose to go with his senior picture in the school’s  yearbook “some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them” at cornell he majored in management and applied economics friends say he was a bright if somewhat colorless guy who spent his time studying and working out after college he worked as an analyst at credit suisse first boston and did time at a hedge fund in stamford when he learned that g was opening an office in new york in  he applied for a job thinking it would be a good fit according to a burger king spokeswoman it was a prescient move for a yearold schwartz started as an analyst and was soon promoted to the private equity group he was involved in a campaign to win seats on the board of csx the american railroad company with children’s investment fund a charitably inclined british hedge fund g made a profit but the interlopers also endured a long nasty courtroom battle with csx the documents that surfaced in the case reveal how much responsibility g was willing to give schwartz despite his youth in  schwartz orchestrated g’s purchase of burger king offering a  percent premium on the chain’s stock price that inspired some headscratching burger king was a mess and had been for decades james mclamore and david edgerton had opened the first burger king in miami they struggled to get by until they noticed crowds flocking to someone else’s hamburger joint in jacksonville fla the other place was dirty the door to the men’s room was hanging by a single hinge but the burgers were tasty—and huge the companys corporate head count has fallen from  to  in  mclamore would write in his surprisingly good autobiography the burger king that the idea for the whopper came to him later that afternoon as he got pleasantly buzzed on the drive back to miami “i had a small bottle of bourbon in the glove compartment and so i poured a little of it into a up i had just bought at the gas station” he wrote all he could think about was the sandwich he’d just eaten and how he might clone it the whopper made its debut in  it was an immediate hit and burger king established itself as mcdonald’s doppelganger and its closest competitor mclamore dreamed of being no  it didn’t happen pressured by his investors he agreed to sell the company in  to pillsbury he soon regretted it pillsbury had little interest in opening restaurants as rapidly as mcdonald’s burger king fell further and further behind in  grand metropolitan a british conglomerate with interests in liquor tobacco and gambling bought pillsbury and burger king became even less of a priority nine years later grand metropolitan merged with guinness to create diageo the new company wanted to focus on johnnie walker not whoppers in  it sold burger king in a leveraged buyout to texas pacific group bain capital and goldman sachs for  billion franchisees welcomed tpg and its partners they couldn’t have been happier to escape from diageo “this is the first day of a new era for burger king” proclaimed julian josephson chairman of the chain’s franchisee association in a  statement the good feelings didn’t last in  burger king put the  double cheese burger on the menu the item increased sales which meant burger king collected more in royalties but franchisees abhorred it they couldn’t make money selling a big cheeseburger for a low price the burger king franchisee association sued the company to get the burger off the menu “it was beyond toxic” says consultant knapp of the chain’s relationship with its franchisees at the time this was the moment when schwartz and the rest of the g squad showed up with an offer to buy burger king for  billion— billion in equity the rest in debt tpg and its partners took it  g had a blueprint for making burger king work once the deal closed in october  the new owners raised double cheeseburger prices and settled the franchisee lawsuit meanwhile burger king’s new ceo bernardo hees a yearold former railroad company head purged  people from the miami headquarters and  more around the world according to filings with the securities and exchange commission in october schwartz then burger king’s new deputy chief financial officer showed up in miami to perform more symphonic cutting “bernardo was the conductor” says martin franklin a burger king board member “daniel was the first violin” according to franklin schwartz played an integral role in rooting out what management considered to be heedless spending the burger king corporate jet was promptly sold the g guys did away with the comfy offices that top executives and their secretaries had enjoyed which people at burger king called mahogany row executives now sit in a spartan openplan office g discovered that the company’s europe middle east and africa division had been throwing an annual  million bash at a chateau beside an italian lake the party is over some cuts appeared to be less about finding big savings than creating an oppressive cheapness employees were instructed to use skype to make longdistance calls instead of running up a cell phone bill they were urged to scan documents and email them rather than use fedex they were ordered to turn in their personal printers and use large communal ones that all paled compared with burger king’s restaurant disposal initiative the rationale was simple who was better qualified to operate a burger king than an experienced franchisee the plan would also relieve g from having to spend more than  million to remodel its restaurants many of which still had oldstyle metal chairs and bright blue booths the new owners would put up the money instead burger king says it has contributed some cash to cover remodeling costs though it won’t provide a number early results under the new management were promising in  net income rose  percent to  million samestore sales swung from a decline of  percent the previous year to a gain of  percent part of the reason was that burger king introduced the largest number of new menu items in its history there were salads wraps chicken strips smoothies and frappés meanwhile schwartz’s deals with foreign restaurateurs were spawning hamburger joints globally and bringing in more royalty income by  burger king finished almost all its costcutting it had to sell more burgers and fries everything went so well that g was able to sell burger king shares to the public as part of the deal g sold  percent of its stock to a group of investors led by ackman for  billion retaining the other  percent the amount was about what g had put up in equity to buy burger king “they basically ended up owning the company for nothing” knapp says in june  hees departed to run heinz and schwartz became burger king’s ceo he spent his first months toiling in burger kings and discovering what it was like for the chain’s cooks and dishwashers brendan berg burger king’s senior director for global learning was schwartz’s guide during his training he remembers his boss struggling to keep up with orders for items from the expanded menu “there’s nothing like standing in the back of the house and the lunch rush is upon you and you have complicated sandwiches” berg says “we had three different barbecue sauces some burgers had raw onions some had red onions we had sweet potato fries we’re standing there side by side and he’s saying ‘brendan this seems like a lot here’ ” after a few of these midday scrabbles schwartz thought it was time to simplify the menu with new products that were easier to assemble and didn’t require a multiplicity of ingredients such as satisfries which were introduced last september and have fewer calories and less fat than burger king’s traditional fries which are still available of course for customers in need of something more filling there is the bacon cheddar stuffed burger schwartz also shook up the management team elevating people closer to his age to top positions as a result the average age of the burger king executive team dipped from an already young  to  “it’s a youthful energetic team” says franklin the board member “these are really intelligent guys” after surviving a few overwhelming lunches it’s not surprising that schwartz looked for simpler products but he needed to reinvent the menu for other reasons by  burger king had completed almost all its costcutting that meant it had to sell more burgers and fries to keep its numbers from weakening the us in particular threatened to drag those numbers down annual sales at burger king’s restaurants in the country declined by  percent to  billion in  according to technomic schwartz also had to come up with new menu items—and unlike the  double cheese burger these would need to generate profits for his franchisees burger king doesn’t break out their margins but its largest franchisee carrols restaurant group a syracuse nybased publicly traded company that owned  outlets last year does in may  carrols purchased  restaurants from burger king which received  million in cash a  percent stake in carrols and two seats on the board one occupied by schwartz last year carrols lost  million because it borrowed so heavily to fund the remodeling plan it agreed to as part of the deal with burger king paul flanders carrols’s chief financial officer says the company hopes to refinance its junkbond debt next year and cut its losses he praises schwartz and says satisfries are helping “incrementally we’re selling more fries” flanders says “but it’s not replacing the existing fries people say one thing and eat another” in july carrols bought  more burger kings meanwhile burger king has  people who spend all their time in the field coaching franchisees on how to boost profitability on a recent morning leslye johnson an indefatigably cheerful burger king coach sat in the upstairs dining room of a burger king in midtown manhattan with kishana scotchman the restaurant’s manager johnson produced an ipad and showed scotchman scores of charts ranking her establishment on everything from hamburger sales cleanliness and service to the congeniality of her staff scotchman a petite yearold with long eyelashes listened intently jotting things down in a pink notebook some nights were generating lousy results scotchman thought she knew why she said one of her night managers was slacking off “i try to look on the camera a lot to see what goes on at night” she said “good good” johnson said smiling “what are you noticing at night” “he stays in the office” “i’ll come back over here and see what’s going on” johnson said “tell him he has a date with me” burger king’s interventions are working according to rbc the company’s samestore sales were up  percent for the first quarter of the year while mcdonald’s increased only  percent the franchisees who made a lot of noise in the past when they were upset with burger king’s management are also happy with schwartz “i don’t focus on how much experience they have” says tom garrett ceo of gps hospitality which has bought  burger kings from the company since  “they are extremely smart which makes them very very fast learners” in late july burger king’s stock had risen  percent mcdonald’s was down  percent wendy’s meanwhile was down  percent despite the release of its muchdiscussed pretzel bacon cheeseburger even a skeptic such as hedgeye’s penney is impressed “the stock has done better than i thought” he says burger king’s stock performance may not be based entirely on burger sales however the company’s been talking publicly about refinancing its debt in coming months this might enable the chain to do something nice for shareholders burger king won’t say what that might be though rbc’s palmer expects the company to pay a special dividend he says there’s “no question” that this has been driving the recent share appreciation of course the biggest beneficiary would be g burger king’s largest shareholder the most important business stories of the day get bloombergs daily newsletter sign up schwartz spent most of june overseas communing with foreign franchisees and investors he didn’t attend the piper jaffray annual consumer conference at the new york palace on madison avenue there were a lot of middleaged restaurant people in coats and ties who run steakhouses noodle places and cheesecake factories they faced a roomful of analysts who wanted to know about their menus and plans for expansion cfo kobza was there in his slimcut suit and opencollar shirt he looked like a wall street guy and gave the impression of having been coached to smile as often as possible he talked opaquely but appetizingly about the refinancing “that could free up a decent amount of cash for us to potentially return to shareholders” he noted that burger king had returned to france after a year hiatus “they still remember the whopper” he said “we walked through the airport with burger king logos on our shirts the security people asked us ‘where’s the burger king’ ” before its here its on the
