blackrock expands index fund offerings for defined contribution plans  business wire blackrock expands index fund offerings for defined contribution plans new mutual funds meet growing demand for index strategies broader index lineup now includes lifepath® target date mutual funds august    am eastern daylight time new yorkbusiness wireblackrock inc nyse blk announced today that it has further expanded its menu of index mutual funds for defined contribution dc plans with the june launch of nine blackrock lifepath® index portfolios and the all country world index ex us fund the firm now features a full suite of  core index mutual funds that sponsors can use to construct a well balanced menu of investment choices for their participants the newest funds which will be available on most major recordkeeping platforms complement a product suite that also includes blackrock’s sp  stock fund small cap index fund tracking the russell  index international index fund tracking the msci eafe index bond index fund tracking the barclay’s us aggregate index and the russell  index fund while indexing has long had a role in collective trust funds used by large and mega institutional dc plans the trend towards indexing is expected to grow in the advisordriven smalltomid size plan markets that have historically featured a heavier allocation to actively managed funds increasingly plan sponsors are recognizing that indexing offers significant benefits to dc plans of all sizes providing a transparent low cost and low maintenance approach to managing some or all of an investment portfolio in  entities now part of blackrock pioneered the development of the industry’s first index fund allowing investors to capture broad market returns in a single investment since then the firm has met changing client needs by expanding its lineup of index solutions across various global equity and fixed income strategies offered through collective trusts mutual funds and ishares® exchange traded funds etfs at june   blackrock managed over  trillion in index based products spanning equity fixed income multi asset and alternative investment strategies “blackrock is uniquely positioned to serve small and midsized dc plan sponsors that want to apply index strategies in their plans now with our enhanced lineup we can help those that prefer to implement this form of investment style through their use of mutual funds” said chip castille managing director and head of blackrock’s us and canada defined contribution group “the growing indexing trend in this market is partly in response to regulatory focus on fees and the desire for increased transparency” he said “sponsors like the publicly available pricing offered by mutual funds as well as the detailed standardized disclosures for prospectuses and other communications” industry wide it’s expected that the share of dc assets in index solutions will nearly have doubled from  in  to  by  – bringing the allocation into closer alignment with the percentage of indexing seen in defined benefit plans “when considering plan design however choosing between indexing and active management does not need to be an eitheror decision” castille added “the first tier in plan design should be a qualified default investment alternative such as a target date fund or an allocation fund that may use indices or active managers the second tier may comprise the building blocks for a diversified portfolio – a suite of efficient professionally managed index and active funds – and the third tier may comprise more specialized exposures including index funds or etfs and actively managed funds for more savvy participants new lifepath index portfolios delivered in mutual fund structure blackrock has long been managing index based target date strategies through its lifepath series of portfolios in fact blackrock created the first target date funds in  under its lifepath brand simplifying risk management and asset allocation and offers access to these strategies primarily to mega and large dc plans these strategies with over  billion in assets under management are offered in collective trust structures with minimum investments that the mid and small plan market could not typically meet by way of the nine newest lifepath index portfolios delivered in a familiar mutual fund structure blackrock is bringing its combined heritage in indexing and target date funds to the fast growing mid and small plan market “we’re convinced that our legacy of experience in index and target date fund management as well as our ongoing commitment to innovation offer unique value to dc plan sponsors” said castille index target date funds typically provide pure low cost exposure to a diversified asset mix as well as the flexibility of a broad range of share classes and fee structures according to mr castille “indexing also ‘narrows the range’ of investment outcomes for a fund making it more likely that the result is in line with a participant’s expectations” he said the lifepath index portfolios employ combinations of equity and bond index funds money market funds and ishares etfs to offer dc plan participants globally diversified portfolios that are optimized for every stage of life leading up to retirement each lifepath index portfolio invests all of its assets in a range of classes including us large cap equities us smallmid cap equities international equities us bonds us inflation linked bonds and money markets target dates reflect broad range of retirement scenarios the new lifepath index portfolios are offered in five year increments reflecting a broad range of potential retirement dates        and  each lifepath portfolio grows more conservative as it approaches its target date an allocation with prudent growth exposure and inflation protection intended for plan participants at retirement is also offered through the lifepath index retirement portfolio with the addition of lifepath index portfolios blackrock now offers both enhanced active and index versions of its lifepath portfolios in a mutual fund offering for dc plans the lifepath portfolios are a series of target date and retirement funds delivering diversified multiasset portfolios that adjust the asset allocation mix in lockstep with the risk aversion of participants on a year horizon to retirement reflecting growing sponsor and participant interest in approaches for transforming accumulated retirement savings into retirement income streams the lifepath suite also includes lifepath retirement income a collective trust fund that combines targetdate fund technology with annuities for an innovative approach to the generation of secure income during the retirement years dc plans carrying growing share of retirement planning burden proprietary nationwide polling of dc plan participants and sponsors conducted by blackrock this spring affirmed that workers now consider the dc plan to be their primary retirement savings vehicle “with dc plans now carrying a growing share of the burden of effective retirement planning for workers we recognize that corporate plan sponsors as well as financial intermediaries more and more are demanding plan options as well matched as possible to particular sponsor needs and objectives” castille said “we are dedicated to offering a comprehensive menu of dc investment choices that address the broad spectrum of critical sponsor concerns including specific plan objectives investment management philosophy participant risk tolerance retirement income and plan costs” he said “this commitment is evidence of our strong advocacy for the cause of effective defined contribution plans that over time will become even more responsive to both sponsors’ and participants’ fundamental goals for retirement financial security” about blackrock blackrock is a leader in investment management risk management and advisory services for institutional
