ferro evergreen investments president and chief executive officer has been in tough places before including a stint with the military in vietnam today hes fighting to keep bostonbased evergreen on track to achieve highly ambitious goals even as the firm found itself this summer on the long list of money managers cited by the securities and exchange commission for market timing and oversight issues mr ferro took the helm at evergreen in september  just as the money management industry was being roiled by new york attorney general eliot spitzers announcement of the first of many markettiming settlements to come a year later with evergreen suddenly added to the roster of firms working out issues with regulators mr ferro said he remains committed to achieving the kind of cache for the evergreen name that industry leaders such as capital research  management co and wellington management co llp enjoy to get there mr ferro might have to draw on a lifetime of experience from experience in vietnam to somewhat less hazardous combat in the financial centers of london and tokyo mr ferro spoke with reporter douglas appell about evergreens efforts to push ahead at a time of turmoil for the industryq the sec has fired a shot across evergreens bow is this a speed bump or a brick walla as we continue to engage in discussions with the sec staff its impossible for us to speculate on an outcome the issues here are not uncommon in this industry and we have enhanced our practices as have other firms at this point we have not seen any significant client withdrawals and we have received positive feedback about the information weve been able to share with clients related coverage conagra adds  million to us pension plans hedge fund flows turn positive for first time in six quarters chicago public school teachers in hunt for core bond manager related conagra adds  million to us pension plans q the secs wells notice suggested shortcomings in compliance and internal controlsa evergreen takes the wells notice very seriously and we continue to be engaged with sec staff with the goal of resolving matters weve worked very closely with our board over time and we feel confident today that we have very strong compliance capabilities and internal controls in place weve made further steps to strengthen our code of ethics and weve identified a number of best practices in the industry that we want to not only adhere to but also be a leader inq how is morale holding upa our employees and teammates at evergreen come to work every day to do the best they possibly can for clients and shareholders with the highest standard of ethics and integrity all of the goals we spoke of before are still in place ive spent the last two weeks doing a lot of town hall meetings at many of our offices including boston charlotte nc and richmond va the reaction has been very positiveq the key goal youve mentioned is to make evergreen one of the industrys premier namesa weve taken a lot of very large steps toward that goal i think our quality of product has consistently improved the quality of service that we provide clients has improved across the board and i think through all of that weve adhered to very high standards of ethical practiceq firms such as janus capital group and mfs investment management have tweaked their compensation systems to bolster resultsa weve actually begun a strategic review of our compensation structure we want to make sure we pay people competitively and attractively but at the same time reward the right type of actions consistent with the goals of the company and our clients through the course of the year well look at best practice in the industry but at the same time look to develop our own individual thoughts on how we can best compensate our people thats something were working on at the highest levels of the companyq is the team growinga we have been actively increasing our research capabilities adding a number of people to our equity research group here in boston and have plans to increase our equity and fixedincome research capabilities in a number of locations where we manage money we have about  on the equity side and just slightly less than that on the fixedincome side so its a very strong commitment to both areasq evergreen has come about as the result of several mergers and acquisitions how do you make the whole greater than the sum of those partsa when i came we had a very different structure a lot of independent investment companies that to my mind did not have the right focus did not have a consistency of management approach and had a lot of redundant product so about four years ago we made an organizational change used evergreen as the overarching brand name for all of the investment activity and i think thats worked very well from the standpoint of an organization that makes sense an organization that knows where its goingq do consultants know the evergreen story a i think evergreen would be characterized as a company on the rise its on peoples radar screens … people are watching very closely to see if it achieves its goals of leadershipq so your imagebuilding exercise is a work in progressa it is and thats why last year we started to do some advertising both on the mutual fund side and the institutional side but advertising is only one part of visibility the first year and a half i was here i didnt go visit a consultant on the institutional side because i knew organizationally there were things we needed to … bring together we were in the process of building a stronger performance record in a number of our products and we needed to have that to move forward i think its very important when you meet with the consultants that you dont insult their intelligence that you have an organizational story and a product story that makes sense and that has a lot of integrity … we needed to wait until we got the proper standards in place the proper performance in place and quite frankly the proper client service in place … before we could go to themq how are you pursuing institutional businessa were casting a wide net we have built up our institutional sales force over the last three years and at the same time weve built up a consultant services group and our client services area that commitment has been paying off q has the regulatory grip on mutual funds made that business any less attractivea were going through a stage of change as to how the industrys going to be managed i think it will make firms think about whether they want to be in the business or not because there will probably be some pressure to spread compliance and legal costs over a larger base but i still think that mutual funds as a product will continue to be very central
