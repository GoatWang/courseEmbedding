know about  lets talk payments toggle menu how many of these microsoft initiatives in fintech did you know about november    nbsp nbspby  sofia in previous articles we have reviewed the ways in which the financial industry giants are joining hands with fintech to keep up with the pace of innovation in the market and stay relevant however banks are not the only ones to feel the urge of paying closer attention to fintech microsoft recently announced in its official blog that it has acquired mobile data lab creator of the popular mileiq app and an innovator in intelligent productivity solutions for mobile professionals addressing the market need and describing the reasoning behind the acquisition microsoft shared in the blog that in the us alone there are over  million small business employees entrepreneurs and other mobile professionals this “selfdirected workforce” as mobile data labs calls them is always seeking ways to reduce time and effort spent on administrative chores like mileage expenses time tracking and reimbursement mobile data lab offers a solution – mileiq the app takes advantage of sensors in modern mobile devices to automatically and contextually capture log and calculate business miles allowing users to confidently claim tax deductions mileiq is used by over  million mobile professionals and has been the topgrossing finance app in the itunes store for  months straight mobile data lab is the most recent example of microsoft corp’s engagement in fintech however the company in recent years has taken other steps to get involved in the hot sector with some interesting examples a recent one is microsoft’s collaboration with deutsche bank to launch fintech labs in berlin in q  called deutsche bank labs where microsoft will be providing technology experience and resources the lab in berlin is a part of a larger fiveyear plan called strategy  to spend  billion in digital initiatives by the bank with labs to be opened in three locations berlin silicon valley and london one of the goals of the lab is to evaluate over  startups a year microsoft as a partner of the lab will be part of the group that evaluates and engages with startups the startups accepted into the program will be provided a trial period to improve their technologies in the lab while also having the opportunity to collaborate with the bank’s partners and clients earlier this year in august nucleus software the leading provider of lending and transaction banking solutions to the global financial services industry announced its strategic partnership with microsoft to deliver the latest version of the bestselling lending software in the world finnone neo on microsoft azure nucleus software’s products power the banking operations of more than  companies across  countries banks and financial services institutions increasingly use microsoft azure worldwide this collaboration between nucleus software and microsoft will provide banks with scalable proven and costeffective it infrastructure to help them launch innovative offerings for customers in the official press release commenting on the partnership mr arup das vice president and global head – lending product nucleus software said “we are excited about our partnership with microsoft for its cloud services to drive the next wave of growth for the banking industry for three decades we have been helping our customers with the bestinclass software technology to stay competitive and deliver superior customer experience the partnership with microsoft is a step ahead in this direction and marks a significant milestone in our product leadership making finnone neo available on the cloud will provide banks and finance companies with a much needed lending platform that is secure scalable and responsive to the changing customer demands” last year in september microsoft announced a partnership with fsisac to fight against cybercrime in the financial industry the company joined hands with the financial services information sharing and analysis center fsisac the global financial industry’s resource for cyber and physical threat intelligence analysis and sharing microsoft piloted the cyber threat intelligence program available to participating fsisac members which were able to receive near realtime information on known malware infections affecting more than  million unique ip address with this information fsisac members can quickly identify infected computers on their networks and clean them of malware through an automated confidential and secure feed distributed via the cloud with microsoft azure this collaboration underscores microsoft’s valuable input of intelligence into the global threat landscape affecting the financial services industry at the same time last year microsoft participated in the sibos financial services conference where the company displayed new apps demonstrating how the cloud can help banks do business in underserved and emerging markets microsoft shared how the company’s software and cloud services are powering and modernizing financial services among the companies microsoft’s solutions will power are denizbank a leading turkish bank and sunguard a provider of it services for the financial industry when it comes to the security in financial services we cannot ignore the question of authentication that is where microsoft is also taking steps to improve the customer experience and security of financial services this year in february microsoft participated in the united states white house cybersecurity and consumer protection summit at stanford university where industry leaders discussed collaborative opportunities and new developments that will improve cybersecurity as the company shared on the official website microsoft has contributed design inputs to the fast identity online fido alliance to be incorporated within fido  technical specifications microsoft states as one of the great challenges in online computing the problem of authentication where the industry needs to move away from passwords to a stronger form of identity verification to address this challenge microsoft joined the fido alliance to work with major industry partners to change the nature of authentication by developing specifications that define an open scalable interoperable set of mechanisms that will allow more secure authentication for online services  was a notable year for microsoft exploring fintech for one more reason – partnership with the canary wharfbased fintech accelerator space level in london as stated in the announcement startups located in level have access to a permanent microsoftbranded area where they can receive mentorship from some of the firm’s experts this will include guidance on technology enterprise sales finance and product development the technology giant will also deliver workshops on cloud and other services level which is owned by canary wharf group has also become a partner in the bizspark plus network microsoft’s programme for startups eric van der kleij head of level said in a statement “welcoming microsoft to level is an important step in our ambition to attract some of the biggest technology players to become integrated into the very fabric of the canary wharf technology cluster and growth opportunities” going back in years it’s worth mentioning one of the early attempts of the software corporation to get involved in the innovative solutions from startups one of the examples is the ip ventures program launched to fuel the imagination of young entrepreneurs and give them the opportunity to develop creative solutions one of the companies that microsoft’s ip ventures powered was zignals that developed a solution to give sophisticated investment advice to consumers in a broad way zignals’ initiative provided quality tools and data so that nonprofessionals and other finance wizards could build trading strategies and then offer them as a subscription to users of the site which is open to anybody microsoft found the company’s business model very interesting – zignals shares revenues collected from the subscriptions with the people who write the strategies ip ventures program director sharieff mansour shared at that time in the press release “ip ventures is about providing access to our innovations providing a speedtomarket advantage for these startups and the end of the story is providing successful exits for everyone involved” speaking of microsoft’s dedication to the startup community and innovation mining it’s also worth mentioning other ways the corporation is doing a great job supporting the startup ecosystem one of them is the bizspark program as described on the official website since  bizspark has helped over  startups in  countries providing access to business mentors investment and partners as well as free microsoft software and services microsoft ventures is another initiative with an emphasis on young bb startups microsoft ventures is a coordinated effort that offers several programs and tools for startups including a global seed fund and dedicated microsoft ventures accelerators in london and dublin london being one of the world’s centers of fintech innovation microsoft ventures has a robust set of fintech startups in the portfolio bihang china cityfalcon uk cringle germany fortunepay india idos india investco france mybank china  myriada uk realty mogul us stockradar china suade uk and sumscope china microsoft innovation centers – microsoft’s global network of stateoftheart technology facilities involves over  government academic and industry participants all committed to collaborating on innovative research technology and software solutions in  the corporation participated in fintech a selection of the hottest fintech startups leading to london being the hub of  of the hottest ones microsoft actively seeks innovation by being a part of the panel along with google american express santander silicon valley bank and a selection of venture capital firms working in the city another interesting example of the way microsoft is leading fintech is the london accelerator programme by microsoft ventures successful applicants started their  weeks participation in october  and are now enjoying the benefits of the programme powered by microsoft among the benefits listed by the company are free london office space in a dynamic and businessfocused environment  mentorship and support cuttingedge curriculum with expert workshops on lean startup methodology finance ip law pr and much more bizspark plus that provides open source friendly azure cloud credits access to the microsoft ecosystem and the investor community most importantly there are two crucial points that microsoft has emphasized the corporation is not asking for any equity in the startups it nurtures and they don’t need to build on microsoft’s tech to get in by launching the programme microsoft wants to assist the startups in realizing their potential and taking their ideas…to the next level of course as described on the official website by the end of the programme all the startups should be  pitchready for any vcangel investor and there is ongoing support networking with peers potential customers and partners plus a global alumni programme for this programme microsoft was looking for startups with a potential to disrupt fintech iot games machine learning cybersecurity enterprise solutions and consumer apps industries using cloudbased technologies along with the abovementioned ways microsoft engages in the fintech community one of the most notable ones is the world cup tech challenge  held in june the startups compete in one of six industry categories digital mediamobile health tech edtech enterprise software next generation technology and fintech microsoft hosts the last round of the competition among the finalists to choose top  fintech startups in its campus in mountain view ca   according to the official website of the cup fintech is a new category for the world cup tech challenge this year and one of the hottest industries in venture capital right now the startups who made the fintech category include play business brave new coin jaccoo pbinvestor and moneero of all the startups in the fintech category moneero is the only one with a focus on mobile payments moneero is also one of four latin american startups to make it this far in the competition and the first company ever from uruguay to compete moneero’s cofounder and coo mauro betschart shared his excitement in the news on the company’s website saying “for moneero being part of the world cup tech is a huge opportunity and we are very happy and proud to be part of this elite group of startups we are working very hard on our ambitious project to be the world’s mobile wallet and as a company from a small country like uruguay to be chosen to present at microsoft’s campus in silicon valley is a great achievement” microsoft also hosted and sponsored the fintech rising in nyc this summer another event in the fintech space along with santander mccarter’s venture capital uk trade  investment pitchbook valuestream and the macallan fintech rising was designed to attract a wide cross section of the financial services community both locally and nationally fintech startups came to pitch to the panel of vc and corporations to gain funding and momentum in development fintech startups pitching the solutions were pp cash bmobilized tactile
