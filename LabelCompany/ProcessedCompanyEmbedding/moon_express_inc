moon express  redefining possible menu redefining possible our mission our mission is to redefine possible by returning to the moon and unlocking its mysteries and resources for the benefit of humanity why the moon the moon is earth’s th continent a new frontier for humanity with precious resources that can bring enormous benefits to life on earth and our future in space expanding earth’s economic and social sphere to the moon is our first step in securing our future not long from now a new generation will look up and see lights on the moon and know that they are part of a multiworld species th continent the moon is a new world with a total landmass approximating north and south america combined the moon has only been reached by government superpowers but new advances in technology are bringing the moon within reach of everyone soon we can all set sail as explorers to earth’s th continent seeking new knowledge opportunity and adventure resources for humanity like the earth the moon has been enriched with vast resources through billions of years of asteroid bombardment unlike the earth these resources are largely on or near the lunar surface relatively accessible we are blazing a trail to the moon to seek and harvest these resources to support a new space renaissance where economic trade between countries will eventually become trade between worlds water one of the greatest practical space discoveries of our generation is the presence of vast quantities of water on the moon verified by nasa in  water ho not only supports life but its constituents hydrogen and oxygen can be used as rocket fuel the discovery of water on the moon is a game changer not just for the economic viability of lunar resources but for the economics of reaching mars and other deep space destinations water is the oil of the solar system and the moon will become a gas station in the sky three maiden expeditions our maiden robotic expeditions to the moon will redefine the possible by bringing the moon within reach of everyone our robotic spacecraft systems will collapse the cost of access to the moon introduce a new commercial paradigm for government missions democratize lunar research and exploration and blaze the trail for commercial space transportation and exploration beyond earth’s orbit mx  e  arrive prospect return we are blazing a trail to become the first private enterprise to reach the moon and reopen the lunar frontier only three government superpowers have ever landed on the moon our first maiden lunar expedition to the equatorial region of the moon will utilize our mxe robotic explorers to deliver a diverse manifest of commercial government and private payloads to the lunar surface at a fraction of the cost of large government programs learn more mx    arrive prospect return our second lunar expedition will utilize our mx exploration system to establish a research outpost on a ‘peak of eternal light’ at the moon’s south pole where direct solar energy and communications with earth are possible our primary objective is to establish a permanent lunar presence while seeking data on local water and other resources that will enable future lunar development learn more mx    arrive prospect return only governments own moon rocks and we want to change that the only moon rocks that exist on earth today were obtained over  years ago by the us during apollo and the soviet union robotically our third expedition will bring back samples of lunar dust and rocks that everyone can own providing scientists with a new source of lunar materials for research and making these treasures from the moon available to collectors and commercial purposes learn more opening the frontier for all of us moon express is working closely with the us government to assure our freedom of enterprise in space with deference to international treaties the “space resource and utilization act of ” was the first step in the process recognizing us private sector rights to seek obtain and utilize space resources on july   moon express became the first company to receive us government approval to send a robotic spacecraft beyond traditional earth orbit and to the moon this was the first time in history that any government signatory to the outer space treaty exercised its rights and obligations to formally authorize and supervise a commercial entity to fly a mission beyond earth orbit this historic ruling is a breakthrough us policy decision supporting our commercial lunar exploration and discovery and heralding a new era of expanding space enterprise our maiden mission approval establishes an important precedent for the private sector to engage in peaceful space exploration bringing with it monumental implications for the advancement of technology science research and development as well as commercial ventures that expand earth’s economic sphere get the latest news robotic explorers our mx family of flexible scalable robotic explorers are capable of reaching the moon and other solar system destinations from earth orbit the mx spacecraft architecture supports multiple applications including delivery of scientific and commercial payloads to the moon at low cost using a rideshare model to science expeditions to distant worlds the maiden launch of our mxe has a diverse manifest of payload customers including the international lunar observatory association infn national laboratories of frascati and the university of maryland celestis lunar memorial spaceflight and google learn more rockets on october   we announced a multimission launch contract with rocket lab usa for up to five launches starting in  moon express is the first company in history to contract multiple launches for space exploration missions our mx family of robotic explorers are configurable to a wide variety of available and emerging launch systems all designed to collapse the cost of deep space access beyond earth orbit mxe robotic explorer aboard the rocket lab usa ‘electron’ rocket moon express space campus cape canaveral florida moon express occupies launch complexes    at cape canaveral adjacent to the kennedy space center on florida’s space coast where many of the robots that explored new worlds and unlocked the secrets of our solar system began their journeys we are now honored to be able to repurpose these historic sites into a vibrant

company to receive government approval for a commercial space mission beyond traditional earth orbit under the requirements of the outer space treaty legal regime for lunar resource extractionedit although the requisite legal regime to enable mining of lunar resources is not fully in place major world space agencies including nasa have put in place a coordination framework for encouraging the type of commercial activity proposed by moon express entrepreneurs are thinking about further commercial expansion into space as space exploration extends to the moon and mars there will be potential opportunities for companies to provide  spacebased resource extraction and processing capabilities for example moon rocks are rich in oxygen that might be exploited to provide life support systems for lunar operations liquid oxygen can also be used as a rocket propellant – and it might be more economical to manufacture it in space than to lift it off the earth mining the moon might also yield titanium – a strong but light metal favoured for highend aerospace applications finally the moon’s known abundance of helium could prove valuable if fusion reactors ever become feasible in the future for business to be confident about investing it needs the certainty of a longterm commitment to space exploration the opportunity to introduce its ideas into government thinking and the rule of law this means common understanding on such difficult issues as property rights and technology transfer the coordination mechanism foreseen as part of the global exploration strategy will provide a forum to discuss these important issues the views of moon express on the legal and political realities of lunar resource utilization were articulated in an april  los angeles times article where naveen jain was interviewed the idea of exploiting the moons resources for private gain is not likely to be a concern jain said the united states he said has already brought back moon rocks to our country without any other country fighting war over it i also think that the moon will be treated no differently than the international water in our oceans he added in this case no one really owns the water but any company or country can mine the resources … from the international water as long as they follow certain safetymoral guidelines jain also noted that there is strong legal precedent and consensus of finders keepers for resources that are liberated through private investment and the same will be true on the moon you dont have to own land to have ownership of resources you unlock from it moon express will use existing precedents of peaceful presence and exploration set by the us government  years ago the outer space treaty of  ratified by  nations including the united states forbids countries from claiming sovereignty over any part of the moon but does not prevent private companies from building or staking claims on the moon mining could fall under similar legal parameters as fishing in international waters on may   the senate subcommittee on space science and competitiveness held a hearing titled reopening the american frontier exploring how the outer space treaty will impact american commerce and settlement in space this hearing examined us government obligations under the outer space treaty on its th anniversary specifically compliance with article vi of the

lights on the moon and know that they are part of a multiworld species th continent the moon is a new world with a total landmass approximating north and south america combined the moon has only been reached by government superpowers but new advances in technology are bringing the moon within reach of everyone soon we can all set sail as explorers to earth’s th continent seeking new knowledge opportunity and adventure resources for humanity like the earth the moon has been enriched with vast resources through billions of years of asteroid bombardment unlike the earth these resources are largely on or near the lunar surface relatively accessible we are blazing a trail to the moon to seek and harvest these resources to support a new space renaissance where economic trade between countries will eventually become trade between worlds water one of the greatest practical space discoveries of our generation is the presence of vast quantities of water on the moon verified by nasa in  water ho not only supports life but its constituents hydrogen and oxygen can be used as rocket fuel the discovery of water on the moon is a game changer not just for the economic viability of lunar resources but for the economics of reaching mars and other deep space destinations water is the oil of the solar system and the moon will become a gas station in the sky three maiden expeditions our maiden robotic expeditions to the moon will redefine the possible by bringing the moon within reach of everyone our robotic spacecraft systems will collapse the cost of access to the moon introduce a new commercial paradigm for government missions democratize lunar research and exploration and blaze the trail for commercial space transportation and exploration beyond earth’s orbit mx

our first maiden lunar expedition to the equatorial region of the moon will utilize our mxe robotic explorers to deliver a diverse manifest of commercial government and private payloads to the lunar surface at a fraction of the cost of large government programs learn more mx    arrive prospect return our second lunar expedition will utilize our mx exploration system to establish a research outpost on a ‘peak of eternal light’ at the moon’s south pole where direct solar energy and communications with earth are possible our primary objective is to establish a permanent lunar presence while seeking data on local water and other resources that will enable future lunar development learn more mx    arrive prospect return only governments own moon rocks and we want to change that the only moon rocks that exist on earth today were obtained over  years ago by the us during apollo and the soviet union robotically our third expedition will bring back samples of lunar dust and rocks that everyone can own providing scientists with a new source of lunar materials for research and making these treasures from the moon available to collectors and commercial purposes learn more opening the frontier for all of us moon express is working closely with the us government to assure our freedom of enterprise in space with deference to international treaties the “space resource and utilization act of ” was the first step in the process recognizing us private sector rights to seek obtain and utilize space resources on july   moon express became the first company to receive us government approval to send a robotic spacecraft beyond traditional earth orbit and to the moon this was the first time in history that any government signatory to the outer space treaty exercised its rights and obligations to formally authorize and supervise a commercial entity to fly a mission beyond earth orbit this historic ruling is a breakthrough us policy decision supporting our commercial lunar exploration and discovery and heralding a new era of expanding space enterprise our maiden mission approval establishes an important precedent for the private sector to engage in peaceful space exploration bringing with it monumental implications for the advancement of technology science research and development as well as commercial ventures that expand earth’s economic sphere get the
