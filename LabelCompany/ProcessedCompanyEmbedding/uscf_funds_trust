the sponsor of the trust “uscf” a copy of the interview published on etfcom is set forth below                  us commodity funds’ changing face march   drew voros   united states commodity funds is an etf issuer known for commodity products such as the  billion united states oil fund lp uso and the  million united states natural gas fund lp ung recently however the firm expanded its product development focus to include equity funds like the stock split index fund tofr and the uscf restaurant leaders fund menu in addition the issuer became part of a public company in december etfcom talked with ceo john love about some of these changes as well as its breadandbutter commodity etfs etfcom let’s talk a little about united states commodity funds under its new structure concierge technologies ticker cncg how did that develop was united states commodity funds actually bought by concierge technologies john love  effectively yes we are  owned by a company called wainwright which is a private company the majority shareholder was nick gerber who founded the company in  the uscf entity was formed early last decade and was the entity through which we launched uso and all of our commodity etfs wainwright owns uscf and so nick gerber also acquired a public company became majority shareholder and got control of a public company which is concierge and recently concierge purchased wainwright which remains uscf  so theres been no change in control just a change in ownership really almost a paperwork thing but we are now a component of a public company etfcom concierge is a collection of different companies that include a food company and a security company where’s the synergy with you an etf issuer love  im exclusively focused on the uscf level everything wainwright and above is nick but yes youre correct it’s a diverse set of companies but from a uscf level theres no change in control—still doing what we did before just different owner of our holding company on paper but same control        etfcom generally speaking uscf is a commodity etf issuer but your most recent etfs have been equity etfs in stock split index fund tofr and uscf restaurant leaders fund menu is the goal here to veer away from commodities and broaden the lineup love  that was definitely the thinking behind tofr and menu we’re taking a stab at diversifying a little bit weve certainly been through the commodity route uso and united states natural gas fund lp ung are our biggest funds and at one time peaked at about  billion in combined assets they’ve contracted quite a bit because interest in those products and in commodities in general fell out of favor our broad commodity basket fund the united states commodity index fund usci is still doing quite well but its not at its alltime high in terms of assets and wed like to see that get bigger commodities are where we have expertise but it might behoove us to explore new avenues and we have the resources and the partners to do a couple things that are in a new space like tofr and menu but definitely our focus remains commodities   etfcom do you have any other funds in registration love  we have a mutual fund thats in registration thats close to launching it’s a broadbased commodity fund in addition we are working on a canadian crude oil fund with which weve partnered with auspice capital in calgary we also have an mlp product which with we partnered with rex shares that’s in registration weve a x oil long and a x oil short fund in registration etfcom those oil funds would be your first leveragedinverse funds love  correct etfcom what are some of the other areas in the commodity space you think would work in an etf wrapper love  when we first launched uso there were no other oil etfs in the market and that was a tremendous advantage then pretty much everybody followed with the singlecommodity etfs not that theres an etf for every single commodity out there but as youve seen some of them are much more successful than others i dont know that it makes sense to launch an etf on every single commodity out there but i think theres still room in the market for innovation and for looking at different ways to potentially find the best way to slice a particular commodity or commodities there are areas like our canadian crude fund thats in registration theres a very interesting story there in that canadian crude is very different than west texas intermediate or brent crude it tends to move a lot more on news there are different fundamentals that represents opportunity etfcom in terms of distribution for your products youre on schwabs commissionfree platforms has that been a crucial factor in your distribution love  its definitely been beneficial its not critical to our distribution overall but its certainly led to business its not just a publicity thing its definitely a distribution channel thats worthwhile                       statement regarding forwardlooking

on nyse arca equities inc “nyse” the investment objective of the fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value “nav” to reflect three times x the daily change in percentage terms of the price of a specified shortterm futures contract on light sweet crude oil called the “benchmark oil futures contract” the fund seeks a return that is  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for a single day the fund should not be expected to provide  of the cumulative return for the benchmark oil futures contract for periods greater than a day   the

brokers and may incur customary brokerage commissions and charges shares of the fund trade on nyse under the ticker symbol “  •  ” and are bought and sold throughout the trading day at bid and ask prices like other publicly traded securities shares will trade on nyse after they are initially purchased by “authorized participants” institutional firms that purchase shares in blocks of  shares called “baskets” through the fund’s marketing agent • the “marketing agent” the initial price per share will be  the initial price per basket will be  and • is the initial authorized participant thereafter the price of a basket will be equal to the nav of  shares on the day that the order to purchase the basket is accepted by the marketing agent the nav per share will be calculated by taking

services in connection with this offering of shares will not exceed ten percent  of the gross proceeds of the offering   the fund is not appropriate for all investors and presents many different risks than other types of funds including risks associated with the use of leverage the fund is intended to be a daily trading tool for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks the fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the benchmark oil futures contract additionally the fund is designed to achieve its stated investment objective on a daily basis but its performance over different periods of time can differ significantly from its stated daily objective the fund is riskier than securities that have intermediate or longterm investment objectives and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold shares of the fund for a period other than one day the return of the fund for a period longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day compounded over the period and usually will differ from the  of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract for the same period daily compounding of the fund’s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longerterm performance during periods of high volatility volatility may be at least as important to the fund’s return for a period as the return of the benchmark oil futures contract accordingly the fund should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily compounding leveraged long investment results investors should actively and frequently monitor their investments in the fund even intraday it is possible that you will suffer significant losses in the fund even if the longterm performance of the benchmark oil futures contract is positive         investors who buy or sell shares during the day from their broker may do so at a premium or discount relative to the market value of the underlying benchmark oil futures contracts in which the fund invests due to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares investing in the fund involves risks similar to those involved with leveraged exposure to the benchmark oil futures contracts and other significant risks see “ risk factors involved with an investment in the fund ”

the benchmark oil futures contract the fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the benchmark oil futures contract for example the return of the fund for a single day should be approximately three times as volatile as the return of a fund for a single day with an objective of matching the same benchmark oil futures contract shareholders who invest in the funds should actively manage and monitor their investments as frequently as daily    the trust and the fund   the uscf funds trust the “trust” is a delaware statutory trust formed on march   the trust is a series trust formed pursuant to the delaware statutory trust act each series a “fund” and collectively the “funds” the united states x oil fund the “fund” formed on  ·   is a series of the trust the fund is a commodity pool that continuously issues common shares of beneficial interest that may be purchased and sold on nyse arca equities inc stock exchange “nyse” the trust and the fund operate pursuant to the trust’s declaration of trust and trust agreement the “trust agreement” dated as of march   wilmington trust company a delaware trust company is the delaware trustee of the trust the trust and the fund are managed and controlled by uscf uscf is a limited liability company formed in delaware on may   that is registered as a commodity pool operator “cpo” with the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” and is a member of the national futures association “nfa”  the fund’s investment objective and strategy   the investment objective of the fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value “nav” to reflect three times x the daily change in percentage terms of the price of a specified shortterm futures contract on light sweet crude oil called the “benchmark oil futures contract” less the fund’s expenses to achieve this objective uscf endeavors to have the notional value of the fund’s aggregate exposure to the benchmark oil futures contract at the close of each trading day approximately equal to the  of the fund’s nav the fund seeks a return that is  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for a single day and does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day    the pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that the return of the fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for a period of longer than a full trading day because the aggregate return of the fund is the product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns    what is the “benchmark oil futures contract”   the benchmark oil futures contract is the futures contract on light sweet crude oil as traded on the new york mercantile exchange the “nymex” that is the near month contract to expire except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire              the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in futures contracts for light sweet crude oil other types of crude oil dieselheating oil gasoline natural gas and other petroleumbased fuels that are traded on the nymex ice futures exchange or other us and foreign exchanges collectively “oil futures contracts” and to a lesser extent in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions other oilrelated investments such as cashsettled options on oil futures contracts forward contracts for oil cleared swap contracts and nonexchange traded “overthecounter” or “otc” transactions that are based on the price of oil other petroleumbased fuels oil futures contracts and indices based on the foregoing collectively “other oilrelated investments” market conditions that uscf currently anticipates could cause the fund to invest in other oilrelated investments include those allowing the fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing for convenience and unless otherwise specified oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments collectively are referred to as “oil interests” in this prospectus the fund seeks to invest in a combination of oil interests such that the daily changes in its nav measured in percentage terms less the fund’s expenses will track three times x the daily changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract also measured in percentage terms as a specific benchmark uscf endeavors to place the fund’s trades in oil interests and otherwise manage the fund’s investments so that the difference between “a” and “b” will be plusminus  percent  of “b” where     •   a is the average daily percentage change in the fund’s per share nav for any period of thirty  successive valuation days ie  any nyse trading day as of which the fund calculates its per share nav less the fund’s expenses and     •   b is three times the average daily percentage change in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract over the same period uscf believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause daily changes in the fund’s share price on nyse on a percentage basis to closely track the daily changes in the fund’s per share nav on a percentage basis the fund will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day  the pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that the return of the fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for a period of longer than a full trading day because the aggregate return of the fund is the product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns during periods of market volatility the volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract may affect the fund’s return as much as or more than the return of the benchmark oil futures contract further the return for investors that invest for periods less than a full trading day or for a period different than a trading day will not be the product of the return of the fund’s stated investment objective and the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract for the full trading day additionally investors should be aware that the fund’s investment objective is not for its nav or market price of shares to equal in dollar terms the spot price of light sweet crude oil natural market forces called contango and backwardation can impact the total return on an investment in the fund’s shares relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and in the future it is likely that the relationship between the market price of the fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation it is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil which could be substantial  principal investment risks of an investment in the fund   an investment in the fund involves a degree of risk some of the risks you may face are summarized below a more extensive discussion of these risks appears beginning on page  investment risk   investors may choose to use the fund as a means of investing indirectly in crude oil there are significant risks and hazards inherent in the crude oil industry that may cause the price of crude oil to widely fluctuate correlation risk   to the extent that investors use the fund as a means of indirectly investing in crude oil there is the risk that the daily changes in the price of the fund’s shares on the nyse on a percentage basis will not closely track the daily changes in the spot price of light sweet crude oil on a percentage basis this could happen if the price of shares traded on the nyse does not correlate closely with the value of the fund’s nav the changes in the fund’s nav do not correlate closely with the changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract or the changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract do not closely correlate with the changes in the cash or spot price of crude oil this is a risk because if these correlations do not exist then investors may not be able to use the fund as a costeffective way to indirectly invest in crude oil or as a hedge against the risk of loss in crude oilrelated transactions   the price relationship between the near month contract to expire and the next month contract to expire that compose the benchmark oil futures contract will vary and may impact both the total return over time of the fund’s nav as well as the degree to which its total return tracks other crude oil price indices’ total returns in cases in which the near month contract’s price is lower than the next month contract’s price a situation known as “contango” in the futures markets then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration in cases in which the near month contract’s price is higher than the next month contract’s price a situation known as “backwardation” in the futures markets then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration              compounding risk   the fund has a singleday investment objective because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time the return of the fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period which will very likely differ from  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract over the same period the fund may lose money if the benchmark oil futures contract performance is flat over time and as a result of daily rebalancing the volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract and the effects of compounding it is even possible that the fund will lose money over time while the level of the benchmark oil futures contract increases   the fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently the fund is not intended to be used by and is not appropriate for investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios   tax risk   the fund is organized and operated as a delaware statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of its trust agreement and applicable state law but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited partnership and therefore has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual funds overthecounter “otc” contract risk   the fund may also invest in negotiated “otc” contracts which are not as liquid as exchangetraded futures contracts otc contracts expose the fund to the risk that the fund’s counterparty may not be able to satisfy its obligations to the fund other risks   the fund pays fees and expenses that are incurred regardless of whether it is profitable unlike mutual funds commodity pools or other investment pools that manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains and distribute such income and gains to their investors the fund generally does not distribute cash to limited partners or other shareholders you should not invest in the fund if you will need cash distributions from the fund to pay taxes on your share of income and gains of the fund if any or for any other reason the fund has no operating history so there is no performance history to serve as a basis for you to evaluate an investment in the fund you will have no rights to participate in the management of the fund and will have to rely on the duties and judgment of uscf to manage the fund the fund is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving uscf the marketing agent various commodity futures brokers and authorized participants uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund uscf’s personnel are directors officers or employees of other entities that may compete with the fund for their services including other commodity pools funds that uscf manages these funds are referred to in this prospectus as the “related public funds” and are identified in the glossary uscf could have a conflict between its responsibilities to the fund and to those other entities as a result of these and other relationships parties involved with the fund have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interest of the fund and the shareholders               the fund’s fees and expenses   this table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund you should note that you may pay brokerage fees on purchases and sales of the fund’s shares which are not reflected in the table authorized participants will pay applicable creation and redemption fees see “creation and redemption of shares creation and redemption transaction fee ” page    annual fund operating expenses expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment       fees and expenses   management fee             •    brokerage fees            •    total annual fund operating expenses           •       the fund is contractually obligated to pay uscf a management fee based on daily net assets and paid monthly of  —  average daily net assets are calculated daily by taking the average of the total net assets of the fund over the calendar year ie  the sum of daily total net assets divided by the number of calendar days in the year on days when markets are closed the total net assets are the total net assets from the last day when the market was open               risk factors involved with an investment in the fund you should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision you should also refer to the other information included in this prospectus as well as information found in our periodic reports which includes the trust’s and the fund’s financial statements and related notes  risks related to leveraged investments due to the compounding of daily returns the fund’s returns over periods longer than a single day will likely differ in amount and possibly even direction from the fund multiple times the benchmark return for the period   the investment objective of the fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its per share nav to reflect three times x the daily change in percentage terms of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund seeks investment results for a single day only as measured from nav calculation time to nav calculation time and not for any other period the return of the fund for a period longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day compounded over the period and usually will differ from three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for the same period the fund could lose money over time regardless of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract including as a result of daily rebalancing the benchmark oil futures contract’s volatility and compounding longer holding periods higher volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract and greater leverage each affect the impact of compounding on the fund’s returns daily compounding of the fund’s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longerterm performance during periods of high volatility volatility may be at least as important to the fund’s return for a period as the return of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the benchmark oil futures contract for example the return for a single day should be approximately three times as volatile for a single day as the return of a fund with an objective of matching the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund is not appropriate for all investors and present different risks than other funds the fund uses leverage and is riskier than similarly benchmarked exchangetraded funds that do not use leverage an investor should only consider an investment in the fund if he or she understands the consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results for a single day daily objective leveraged funds if used properly and in conjunction with the investor’s view on the future direction and volatility of the markets can be useful tools for investors who want to manage their exposure to various markets and market segments and who are willing to monitor andor periodically rebalance their portfolios shareholders who invest in the funds should actively manage and monitor their investments as frequently as daily in general during periods of higher volatility for the benchmark oil futures contract compounding will cause the fund’s results for periods longer than a single day to be less than three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract this effect becomes more pronounced as volatility increases conversely in periods of lower volatility for the benchmark oil futures contract particularly when combined with higher returns for the benchmark oil futures contract the fund’s returns over longer periods can be higher than three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract actual results for a particular period before fees and expenses are also dependent on the magnitude of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract in addition to the volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract intraday priceperformance risk the fund is typically rebalanced at or about the time of its nav calculation as such the intraday position of the fund will generally be different from the fund’s stated daily investment objective ie x when shares are bought intraday the performance of the fund’s shares until the fund’s next nav calculation will generally be greater than or less than the fund’s stated daily multiple the use of leveraged positions could result in the total loss of an investor’s investment the fund utilizes leverage in seeking to achieve its investment objective and will lose more money in market environments adverse to its respective daily investment objectives than funds that do not employ leverage the use of leveraged positions could result in the total loss of an investor’s investment for example because the investment objective of the fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its per share nav to reflect three times x the daily change in percentage terms of the benchmark oil futures contract a singleday movement in the benchmark oil futures contract approaching  at any point in the day could result in the total loss or almost total loss of an investor’s investment if that movement is contrary to the investment objective of the fund even if the benchmark oil futures contract subsequently moves in an opposite direction eliminating all or a portion of the movement this would be the case with downward singleday or intraday movements in the benchmark oil futures contract even if the benchmark oil futures contract maintains a level greater than zero at all times             investment risk   the nav of the fund’s shares relates directly to the value of the benchmark oil futures contracts and other assets held by the fund and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in the fund’s shares past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results all or substantially all of an investment in the fund could be lost the net assets of the fund consist primarily of investments in oil futures contracts and to a lesser extent in other oilrelated investments the nav of the fund’s shares relates directly to the value of these assets less liabilities including accrued but unpaid expenses which in turn relates to the price of light sweet crude oil in the marketplace crude oil prices depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil economic conditions impacting crude oil the demand for crude oil correlates closely with general economic growth rates the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on crude oil prices other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for crude oil sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also may adversely impact the demand for crude oil other crude oil demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for crude oil and therefore its price include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns which affect the demand for crude oil associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as toward alternative fueled vehicles other crude oil supplyrelated factors crude oil prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce crude oil prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of crude oil world oil supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by member countries to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries “opec” production quotas and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the petroleum industry to find produce and refine oil and to manufacture petrochemicals which in turn may affect the supply of and demand for oil other factors impacting the crude oil market the supply of and demand for crude oil may also be impacted by changes in interest rates inflation and other local or regional market conditions as well as by the development of alternative energy sources price volatility may possibly cause the total loss of your investment futures contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes consequently you could lose all or substantially all of your investment in the fund  correlation risk investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of crude oil will have an efficient hedge only if the price investors pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of crude oil investing in the fund’s shares for hedging purposes involves the following risks     •   the market price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be significantly less or more than nav     •   daily percentage changes in nav may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes on a leveraged basis in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract     •   daily percentage changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of light sweet crude oil            further in order to achieve a high degree of correlation with the benchmark oil futures contract the fund seeks to rebalance its portfolios daily to keep exposure consistent with its investment objectives being materially under or overexposed to the benchmark oil futures contract may prevent the fund from achieving a high degree of correlation with the benchmark oil futures contract market disruptions or closures large amounts of assets into or out of the fund regulatory restrictions or extreme market volatility will adversely affect the fund’s ability to adjust exposure to requisite levels the target amount of portfolio exposure is impacted dynamically by the benchmark oil futures contract’s movements during each day because of this it is unlikely that the fund will be perfectly exposed ie x at the end of each day and the likelihood of being materially under or overexposed is higher on days when the benchmark levels are volatile near the close of the trading day in addition unlike other funds that do not rebalance their portfolios as frequently the fund may be subject to increased trading costs associated with daily portfolio rebalancing in order to maintain appropriate exposure to the underlying benchmarks such costs include commissions paid to the fcms and may vary by fcm the market price at which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly less or more than nav the fund’s nav per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in the market value of the fund’s portfolio investments the public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may be different from the nav of the shares price differences may relate primarily to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to but not identical to the same forces influencing the prices of the light sweet crude oil and the benchmark oil futures contract at any point in time uscf expects that exploitation of certain arbitrage opportunities by authorized participants and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track nav per share closely over time but there can be no assurance of that the nav of the fund’s shares may also be influenced by nonconcurrent trading hours between the nyse arca and the various futures exchanges on which crude oil is traded while the shares trade on the nyse arca from  am to  pm eastern time the trading hours for the futures exchanges on which light sweet crude oil trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time for example while the shares trade on the nyse arca until  pm eastern time liquidity in the global light sweet crude market will be reduced after the close of the nymex at  pm eastern time as a result during periods when the nyse arca is open and the futures exchanges on which light sweet crude oil is traded are closed trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen and therefore increase the difference between the price of the shares and the nav of the shares daily percentage changes in the fund’s nav may not correlate with daily percentage changes on a leveraged basis in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract it is possible that the daily percentage changes in the fund’s nav per share may not closely correlate on a leveraged basis to daily percentage changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract noncorrelation may be attributable to disruptions in the market for light sweet crude oil the imposition of position or accountability limits by regulators or exchanges or other extraordinary circumstances as the fund approaches or reaches position limits with respect to the benchmark oil futures contract and other oil futures contracts or in view of market conditions the fund may begin investing in other oilrelated investments in addition the fund is not able to replicate exactly the changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract because the total return generated by the fund is reduced by expenses and transaction costs including those incurred in connection with the fund’s trading activities and increased by interest income from the fund’s holdings of treasuries defined below tracking the benchmark oil futures contract requires trading of the fund’s portfolio with a view to tracking the benchmark oil futures contract over time and is dependent upon the skills of uscf and its trading principals among other factors daily percentage changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of light sweet crude oil the correlation between changes in prices of the benchmark oil futures contract and the spot price of crude oil may at times be only approximate the degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative oil market supply of and demand for oil futures contracts including the benchmark oil futures contract and other oilrelated investments and technical influences in oil futures trading            natural forces in the oil futures market known as “backwardation” and “contango” may increase the fund’s tracking error andor negatively impact total return the design of the fund’s benchmark oil futures contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration when over a four day period it transitions to the next month contract to expire as its benchmark contract and keeps that contract as its benchmark until it becomes the near month contract and close to expiration in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts a situation described as “backwardation” in the futures market then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration conversely in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts a situation described as “contango” in the futures market then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration when compared to total return of other price indices such as the spot price of crude oil the impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return of the fund’s per share nav to vary significantly moreover absent the impact of rising or falling oil prices a prolonged period of contango could have a significant negative impact on the fund’s per share nav and total return and investors could lose part or all of their investment see “additional information about the fund its investment objective and investments” for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and backwardation accountability levels position limits and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error which could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the price of the benchmark oil futures contract designated contract markets such as the nymex and ice futures have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control other than as a hedge which an investment by the fund is not may hold own or control these levels and position limits apply to the futures contracts that the fund invests in to meet its investment objective in addition to accountability levels and position limits the nymex and ice futures also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts the daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement price once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit the cftc has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in  physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture energy and metals markets and rules addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control the position limit rules the position limit rules as proposed would apply to the futures contracts that the fund invests in to meet its investment objective the position limit rules would among other things identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month individual month and all months combined create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions impose responsibilities on dcms and sefs to establish position limits or in some cases position accountability rules and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues otc dcms sefs as well as nonus located platforms the cftc’s first attempt at finalizing the position limit rules in  was successfully challenged by market participants in  and since then the cftc has reproposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times until such time as the position limit rules are adopted the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the position limit rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives collectively “referenced contracts” under that system the cftc enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products eg corn wheat and soy while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products eg oil and natural gas as a result the fund may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits finally subject to certain narrow exceptions the position limit rules require the aggregation for purposes of the position limits of all positions in the  referenced contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates regardless of whether such position existed on us futures exchanges nonus futures exchanges in cleared swaps or in otc swaps under the cftc’s existing position limits requirements and the position limit rules a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a  percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding at this time it is unclear how the position limit rules may affect the fund but the effect may be substantial and adverse by way of example the position limit rules may negatively impact the ability of the fund to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit uscf’s ability to sell additional creation baskets of the fund            all of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the fund’s shares and the price of the benchmark oil futures contract this may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use the fund as a way to hedge against crude oilrelated losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil the fund has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments if the fund encounters accountability levels position limits or price fluctuation limits for oil futures contracts on the nymex or ice futures it may then if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements purchase oil futures contracts on other exchanges that trade listed crude oil futures or enter into swaps or other transactions to meet its investment objective in addition if the fund exceeds accountability levels on either the nymex or ice futures and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the fund’s shares and the price of the benchmark oil futures contract    tax risk   an investor’s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions if any on its shares   cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of uscf uscf does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to shares investors will be required to pay us federal income tax and in some cases state local or foreign income tax on their allocable share of the fund’s taxable income without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions therefore the tax liability of an investor with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash or value of property if any distributed   an investor’s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its shares   due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by the fund in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors an investor’s allocable share of the fund’s income gain deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its shares for a taxable year this difference could be temporary or permanent and if permanent could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income items of income gain deduction loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated and for taxable periods beginning after december   the fund could be liable for us federal income tax if the us internal revenue service “irs” does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by the fund in allocating those items with potential adverse consequences for an investor   the us tax rules pertaining to entities taxed as partnerships are complex and their application to large publicly traded entities such as the fund is in many respects uncertain the fund applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income gains deductions losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects shareholders’ economic gains and losses these assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the internal revenue code the “code” and applicable treasury regulations however and it is possible that the irs will successfully challenge the fund’s allocation methods and require the fund to reallocate items of income gain deduction loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors if this occurs investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest   in addition for periods beginning after december   the fund may be liable for us federal income tax on any “imputed understatement” of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an irs audit the amount of the imputed understatement generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or gains to any investor and decreases in allocations of items of deduction loss or credit to any investor without any offset for any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or gain to any investor or increases in allocations of items of deduction loss or credit to any investor if the fund is required to pay any us federal income taxes on any imputed understatement the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of the fund and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the shares under certain circumstances the fund may be eligible to make an election to cause the investors to take into account the amount of any imputed understatement including any interest and penalties the ability of a publicly traded partnership such as the fund to make this election is uncertain if the election is made the fund would be required to provide investors who owned beneficial interests in the shares in the year to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement setting forth their proportionate shares of the adjustment “adjusted ks” the investors would be required to take the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the adjusted ks are issued the resulting tax liability on an investor of taking the adjustment into account in the year in which the adjusted k is issued may be less favorable to the investor than if the adjustment were taken into account in the reviewed year            the fund could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes which may substantially reduce the value of the shares   the trust on behalf of the fund has received an opinion of counsel that under current us federal income tax laws the fund will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes provided that i at least  percent of the fund’s annual gross income consists of “qualifying income” as defined in the code ii the trust and the fund is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and iii the trust and the fund does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes although uscf anticipates that the fund will satisfy the “qualifying income” requirement for all of its taxable years that result cannot be assured the fund has not requested and nor will the fund request any ruling from the irs with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the irs were to successfully assert that the fund is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year rather than passing through its income gains losses and deductions proportionately to shareholders the fund would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates in addition although the fund currently does not intend to make any distributions with respect to the shares any distributions would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income to the extent of the fund’s current or accumulated earnings and profits subject to holding period and other requirements any such dividend would be a qualifying dividend subject to us federal income tax at the lower maximum tax rates applicable to longterm capital gains taxation of the trust and the fund as a corporation could materially reduce the aftertax return on an investment in shares and could substantially reduce the value of the shares the fund is organized and operated as a delaware statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of its trust agreement and applicable state law but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited partnership and therefore has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual funds   the fund is organized and operated as a delaware statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of its trust agreement and applicable state law but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited partnership and therefore has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual funds no us federal income tax is paid by the fund on its income instead the fund will furnish shareholders each year with tax information on irs schedule k form  and each us shareholder is required to report on its us federal income tax return its allocable share of the income gain loss and deduction of the fund this must be reported without regard to the amount if any of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from the fund during the taxable year a shareholder therefore may be allocated income or gain by the fund but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting from the allocation or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability in addition to federal income taxes shareholders may be subject to other taxes such as state and local income taxes unincorporated business taxes business franchise taxes and estate inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which the fund does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in the fund it is each shareholder’s responsibility to file the appropriate us federal state local and foreign tax returns   if the fund is required to withhold tax with respect to any nonus shareholders the cost of such withholding may be borne by all shareholders under certain circumstances the fund may be required to pay withholding tax with respect to allocations to nonus shareholders although the trust agreement provides that any such withholding will be treated as being distributed to the nonus shareholder the fund may not be able to cause the economic cost of such withholding to be borne by the nonus shareholder on whose behalf such amounts were withheld since the fund does not intend to make any distributions under such circumstances the economic cost of the withholding may be borne by all shareholders not just the shareholders on whose behalf such amounts were withheld this could have a material impact on the value of the shares    otc contract risk   currently otc transactions are subject to changing regulation   a portion of the fund’s assets may be used to trade otc contracts such as forward contracts options swaps or spot contracts otc contracts are typically contracts traded on a principaltoprincipal noncleared basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions the markets for otc contracts rely upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the cftc on participants in the futures markets while certain regulations adopted over the past several years are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the otc market the current regulation of the otc contracts could expose the fund in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants as a result of such regulations if the trust on behalf of the fund enters into or has entered into certain interest rate and credit default swaps such swaps will be required to be centrally cleared determinations on other types of swaps are expected in the future and when finalized could require the fund to centrally clear certain otc instruments presently entered into and settled on a bilateral basis            the fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to otc contracts entered into by the trust on behalf of the fund or held by special purpose or structured vehicles   the fund faces the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to the otc contracts unlike in futures contracts the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions as a result there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions a counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to the fund in which case the fund could suffer significant losses on these contracts if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties the fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding the trust on behalf of the fund may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances valuing otc derivatives may be less certain than actively traded financial instruments   in general valuing otc derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such otc derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources in addition while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating otc contracts they typically are not contractually obligated to do so particularly if they are not a party to the transaction as a result it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding otc derivatives transaction    compounding risk the fund has a singleday investment objective and the fund’s performance for periods greater than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period which is likely to be either better or worse than the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract times the stated multiple in the fund’s investment objective before accounting for fees and fund expenses compounding affects all investments but it has a more significant effect on an a leveraged fund particularly during periods of higher benchmark oil futures contract volatility compounding will cause results for periods longer than a single day to vary from three times x of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract this effect becomes more pronounced as volatility increases fund performance for periods greater than a single day will be affected by the following factors i benchmark oil futures contract volatility ii benchmark oil futures contract performance iii period of time iv financing rates associated with exposure and v other fund expenses the fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently the fund is not intended to be used by and is not appropriate for investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios  other risks nyse may halt trading in the fund’s shares which would adversely impact an investor’s ability to sell shares the fund’s shares are listed for trading on nyse under the market symbol “ • ” trading in shares may be halted due to market conditions or in light nyse rules and procedures for reasons that in the view of nyse make trading in shares inadvisable in addition trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline additionally there can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of the fund’s shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged the lack of an active trading market for the fund shares may result in losses on an investor’s investment in the fund at the time the investor sells the shares although the fund’s shares are listed and traded on nyse there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will be maintained if an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active trading market for them exists the price the investor receives upon sale of the shares assuming they were able to be sold likely would be lower than if an active market existed            certain of the fund’s investments could be illiquid which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time   futures positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price it is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market a market disruption such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market for its currency its crude oil production or exports or another major export can also make it difficult to liquidate a position because both oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments may be illiquid the fund’s oil interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated the large size of the positions that the fund may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to do so otc contracts that are not subject to clearing may be even less marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an exchange do not have uniform terms and conditions and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support such as collateral and in general they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty these conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely impact the fund’s ability to realize the full value of such contracts in addition even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk sudden changes in the value of otc transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party’s exposure on the transaction in such situations the fund is not actively managed and tracks the benchmark oil futures contract during periods in which the price of the benchmark oil futures contract is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising the fund is not actively managed by conventional methods accordingly if the fund’s investments in oil interests are declining in value the fund will not close out such positions except in connection with paying the proceeds to an authorized participant upon the redemption of a basket or closing out futures positions in connection with the monthly change in the benchmark oil futures contract uscf will seek to cause the nav of the fund’s shares to track the benchmark oil futures contract during periods in which its price is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect the fund the futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes regulations and margin requirements in addition the cftc and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including for example the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading regulation of commodity interest transactions in the united states is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action considerable regulatory attention has been focused on nontraditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the united states in addition various national governments outside of the united states have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general the effect of any future regulatory change on the fund is impossible to predict but it could be substantial and adverse an investment in the fund may provide little or no diversification benefits thus in a declining market the fund may have no gains to offset losses from other investments and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in the fund while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes historically oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments have generally been noncorrelated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds noncorrelation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions on the one hand and stocks or bonds on the other hand however there can be no assurance that such noncorrelation will continue during future periods if contrary to historic patterns the fund’s performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in the fund’s shares in such a case the fund may have no gains to offset losses from other investments and investors may suffer losses on their investment in the fund at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments            variables such as drought floods weather embargoes tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on crude oil prices and crude oillinked instruments including oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments than on traditional securities these additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject the fund’s investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities noncorrelation should not be confused with negative correlation where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other there is no historical evidence that the spot price of crude oil and prices of other financial assets such as stocks and bonds are negatively correlated in the absence of negative correlation the fund cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market or vice versa trading in international markets could expose the fund to credit and regulatory risk  the fund invests primarily in oil futures contracts a significant portion of which are traded on united states exchanges including the nymex however a portion of the fund’s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the united states some nonus markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their us counterparts trading on such nonus markets or exchanges presents risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their us counterparts including potentially different or diminished investor protections in trading contracts denominated in currencies other than us dollars the fund is subject to the risk of adverse exchangerate movements between the dollar and the functional currencies of such contracts additionally trading on nonus exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls expropriation increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability an adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets uscf is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage the fund and other funds   uscf was formed to be the sponsor and manager of investment vehicles such as the fund and has been managing such investment vehicles since april  the chief executive officer and president of uscf manage and direct the daytoday activities and affairs of the fund the sixth amended and restated limited liability company agreement of uscf the “llc agreement” provides limited authority to the nonmanagement directors and any director of uscf may be removed by uscf’s parent company which is a closelyheld private company where the majority of shares has historically been voted by one person   uscf’s board of directors currently consists of four management directors each of whom are shareholders of uscf’s parent wainwright holdings inc “wainwright” and three nonmanagement directors each of whom are considered independent for purposes of applicable exchange and sec rules under uscf’s llc agreement the nonmanagement directors have only such authority as the management directors expressly confer upon them which means that the nonmanagement directors may have less authority to control the actions of the management directors than is typically the case with the independent members of a company’s board of directors in addition any director may be removed by written consent of wainwright which is the sole member of uscf wainwright is a privately held company in which the majority of shares are held by or on behalf of nicholas d gerber and his immediate family members the “gerber family” historically shares of wainwright have been voted by and on behalf of the gerber family by nicholas d gerber and it is anticipated that such trend will continue in the future accordingly although uscf is governed by the uscf board of directors which consists of both management directors and nonmanagement directors pursuant to the llc agreement it is possible for mr gerber to exercise his control of wainwright to effect the removal of any director including the nonmanagement directors which comprise the audit committee and to replace that director with another director having control in one person could have a negative impact on uscf and the fund including their regulatory obligations there is a risk that the fund will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such the fund may not earn any profit   the fund is contractually obligated to pay a management fee to uscf fees to brokers subject to a cap and certain expenses regardless of whether the fund’s activities are profitable accordingly the fund must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit            regulation of the commodity interests markets is extensive and constantly changing future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect the fund   the futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes regulations and margin requirements in addition the cftc and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions

considerable regulatory attention has been focused on nontraditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the united states in addition various national governments outside of the united states have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the commodities markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general the effect of any future regulatory change on the fund is impossible to predict but it could be substantial and adverse the trust is not a registered investment company so shareholders do not have the protections of the  act   the trust is not an investment company subject to the  act accordingly investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute which for example requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager   the fund has no operating history so there is no performance history to serve as a basis for you to evaluate an investment in the fund   the fund is new and has no operating history therefore you do not have the benefit of reviewing the past performance of the fund as a basis to evaluate an investment in the fund the sponsor’s current experience involves managing the related public funds the sponsor’s results with the related public funds may not be directly applicable to the fund since the fund has a different investment objective than the related public funds the fund and uscf may have conflicts of interest which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders   the fund is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving uscf various commodity futures brokers the marketing agent and any authorized participants uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund these persons are directors officers or employees of other entities that may compete with the fund for their services they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to those other entities as a result of these and other relationships parties involved with the fund have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of the fund and the shareholders uscf has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest consequently investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably although uscf attempts to monitor these conflicts it is extremely difficult if not impossible for uscf to ensure that these conflicts do not in fact result in adverse consequences to the shareholders the fund may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to its futures commission merchant “fcm” including but not limited to conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients or purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the fcm uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund and could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to the related public funds   the fund and uscf may have inherent conflicts to the extent uscf attempts to maintain the fund’s asset size in order to preserve its fee income and this may not always be consistent with the fund’s objective of having the value of its shares’ nav track on a leveraged basis changes in the value of the benchmark oil futures contracts uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund for example uscf’s directors officers and employees act in such capacity for other entities including the related public funds that may compete with the fund for their services accordingly they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to other entities uscf has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of the fund this authority to manage the investments and operations of the fund may allow uscf to act in a way that furthers its own interests in conflict with the best interests of investors shareholders have very limited voting rights which will limit the ability to influence matters such as amending the trust agreement changing the fund’s basic investment objective dissolving the fund or selling or distributing the fund’s assets            the fund and rex may have conflicts of interest which may permit rex to favor its own interests to the detriment of fund shareholders rex may have conflicts of interest which may permit it to favor its own interests to the detriment of shareholders rex’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund or to rex mlpshares llc these persons are directors officers or employees of other entities that may compete with the fund for their services they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to those other entities as a result of these and other relationships parties involved with rex may have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of the fund and the shareholders uscf has not established any formal procedure to resolve rex conflicts of interest consequently investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably although uscf attempts to monitor these conflicts it is extremely difficult if not impossible for uscf to ensure that these conflicts do not in fact result in adverse consequences to the fund’s shareholders rex’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund and could have a conflict between their responsibilities to other entities rex’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund rather rex’s directors officers and employees act in various capacities for other entities some of which may now or in the future compete with the fund for their services accordingly rex’s officers directors and employees could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to other entities uscf has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of the fund it has delegated certain marketing functions with respect to the fund to rex rex may act in a way that furthers its own interests in conflict with the best interests of investors   shareholders have only very limited voting rights and have the power to replace uscf only under specific circumstances shareholders do not participate in the management of the fund and do not control uscf so they do not have any influence over basic matters that affect the fund   shareholders have very limited voting rights with respect to the fund’s affairs and have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation including for example the right to bring “oppression” or “derivative” actions shareholders may elect a replacement sponsor only if uscf resigns voluntarily or loses its charter shareholders are not permitted to participate in the management or control of the fund or the conduct of its business shareholders must therefore rely upon the duties and judgment of uscf to manage the fund’s affairs for example the dissolution or resignation of uscf would cause the fund to terminate unless within  days of the event shareholders holding shares representing at least   of the outstanding shares of the fund elect to continue the trust and appoint a successor sponsor in addition uscf may terminate the fund if it determines that the fund’s aggregate net assets in relation to its operating expenses make the continued operation of the fund unreasonable or imprudent however no level of losses will require uscf to terminate the fund the fund’s termination would result in the liquidation of its assets and the distribution of the proceeds thereof first to creditors and then to the shareholders in accordance with their positive book capital account balances after giving effect to all contributions distributions and allocations for all periods and the fund could incur losses in liquidating its assets in connection with a termination the fund could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor’s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor’s investment portfolio   the fund could terminate at any time regardless of whether that the fund has incurred losses subject to the terms of the trust agreement in particular unforeseen circumstances including the bankruptcy dissolution or removal of uscf as the sponsor of the trust could cause the fund to terminate unless a successor is appointed in accordance with the trust agreement however no level of losses will require uscf to terminate the fund the fund’s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor’s investment termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor’s investment portfolio an unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on the fund’s nav   if a substantial number of requests for redemption of redemption baskets are received by the fund during a relatively short period of time the fund may not be able to satisfy the requests from the fund assets not committed to trading as a consequence it could be necessary to liquidate positions in the fund’s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation            the fund does not expect to make cash distributions   the fund does not intend to make any cash distributions and intends to reinvest any realized gains in additional oil interests rather than distributing cash to shareholders therefore unlike mutual funds commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors the fund generally does not expect to distribute cash to shareholders an investor should not invest in the fund if the investor will need cash distributions from the fund to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of the fund if any or for any other reason nonetheless although the fund does not intend to make cash distributions the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution eg at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in oil interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax if this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made   proposed money market reform   currently the fund may invest in money market funds as well as treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less as an investment for assets not used for margin or collateral in the futures contracts on july   the sec adopted final rules governing the structure and operation of money market funds in a release adopting amendments to rule a under the  act the new rules will require institutional prime money market funds to price their shares using marketbased values instead of the amortized cost method  ie  to use a “floating nav” in addition all money market funds will be able and in certain cases will be required to impose liquidity fees and temporarily suspend redemptions during periods of market stress subject to certain board findings the sec also revised certain diversification provisions of rule a as well as provisions relating to stress testing compliance with these requirements is not currently required accordingly it is unclear at this time what impact of money market reform would have on the fund’s ability to hedge risk however the imposition of a floating nav could cause the fund to limit remaining assets solely in treasuries and cash the failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker or the fund’s custodian could result in a substantial loss of the fund’s assets and could impair the fund in its ability to execute trades   under cftc regulations a clearing broker maintains customers’ assets in a bulk segregated account if a clearing broker fails to do so or even if the customers’ funds are segregated by the clearing broker but the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a substantial deficit in a customer account the clearing broker’s other customers may be subject to risk of a substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing broker’s bankruptcy in that event the clearing broker’s customers such as the fund are entitled to recover even in respect of property specifically traceable to them only a proportional share of all property available for distribution to all of that clearing broker’s customers the bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in the loss of the fund’s assets posted with the clearing broker the fund may also be subject to the risk of the failure of or delay in performance by any exchanges and markets and their clearing organizations if any on which commodity interest contracts are traded in addition to the extent the fund’s clearing broker is required to post the fund’s assets as margin to a clearinghouse the margin will be maintained in an omnibus account containing the margin of all the clearing broker’s customers if the fund’s clearing broker defaults to a clearinghouse because of a default by one of the clearing broker’s other customers or otherwise then the clearinghouse can look to all of the margin in the omnibus account including margin posted by the fund and any other nondefaulting customers of the clearing broker to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker from time to time clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business a clearing broker’s involvement in costly or timeconsuming legal proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from the clearing broker’s trading operations which could impair the clearing broker’s ability to successfully execute and clear the fund’s trades in addition the majority of the fund’s assets are held in treasuries cash andor cash equivalents with  •  the “custodian” the insolvency of the custodian could result in a loss of the fund’s assets held by the custodian which at any given time could comprise a substantial portion of the fund’s total assets the liability of uscf and the trustee are limited under the trust agreement and the value of the shares will be adversely affected if the fund is required to indemnify the trustee or uscf   under the trust agreement the trustee and uscf are not liable and have the right to be indemnified for any liability or expense incurred absent gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the trustee or uscf or breach by uscf of the trust agreement as the case may be as a result uscf may require the assets of the fund to be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered by it or by the trustee any sale of that kind would reduce the nav of the fund and the value of its shares            although the shares of the fund are limited liability investments certain circumstances such as bankruptcy or indemnification of the fund by a shareholder will increase the shareholder’s liability   the shares of the fund are limited liability investments shareholders may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits recognized on their investment however shareholders could be required as a matter of bankruptcy law to return to the estate of the fund any distribution they received at a time when the fund was in fact insolvent or in violation of its trust agreement in addition a number of states do not have “statutory trust” statutes such as the delaware statutes under which the trust has been formed in the state of delaware it is possible that a court in such state could hold that due to the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary in such jurisdiction the shareholders although entitled under delaware law to the same limitation on personal liability as stockholders in a private corporation for profit organized under the laws of the state of delaware are not so entitled in such state finally in the event the trust or the fund is made a party to any claim dispute demand or litigation or otherwise incurs any liability or expense as a result of or in connection with any shareholder’s or assignee’s obligations or liabilities unrelated to the business of the trust or the fund as applicable such shareholder or assignees cumulatively is required under the trust agreement to indemnify the trust or the fund as applicable for all such liability and expense incurred including attorneys’ and accountants’ fees investors cannot be assured of rex’s continued services and discontinuance may be detrimental to the fund   investors cannot be assured that rex will be willing or able to continue to service the fund for any length of time if rex discontinues its activities on behalf of the fund the fund may be adversely affected   the fund is a series of the trust and as a result a court could potentially conclude that the assets and liabilities of the fund are not segregated from those of another series of the trust thereby potentially exposing assets in the fund to the liabilities of another series of the trust   the fund is a series of a delaware statutory trust and not itself a separate legal entity the delaware statutory trust act provides that if certain provisions are included in the formation and governing documents of a statutory trust organized in series and if separate and distinct records are maintained for any series and the assets associated with that series are held in separate and distinct records and are accounted for in such separate and distinct records separately from the other assets of the statutory trust or any series thereof then the debts liabilities obligations and expenses incurred by a particular series are enforceable against the assets of such series only and not against the assets of the statutory trust generally or any other series thereof conversely none of the debts liabilities obligations and expenses incurred with respect to any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series uscf is not aware of any court case that has interpreted this interseries limitation on liability or provided any guidance as to what is required for compliance uscf intends to maintain separate and distinct records for the fund and account for the fund separately from any other series of the trust but it is possible a court could conclude that the methods used do not satisfy the delaware statutory trust act which would potentially expose assets in one series to the liabilities of another series of the trust uscf and the trustee are not obligated to prosecute any action suit or other proceeding in respect of the fund property   neither uscf nor the trustee is obligated to although each may in its respective discretion prosecute any action suit or other proceeding in respect of the fund property the trust agreement does not confer upon shareholders the right to prosecute any such action suit or other proceeding third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that uscf has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights which may result in significant costs and diverted attention   it is possible that third parties might utilize the fund’s intellectual property or technology including the use of its business methods trademarks and trading program software without permission uscf has a patent for the fund’s business method and has registered its trademarks the fund does not currently have any proprietary software however if it obtains proprietary software in the future any unauthorized use of the fund’s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage the fund may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents trademarks proprietary software and other technology also third parties may independently develop business methods trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of uscf or claim that uscf has violated their intellectual property rights including their copyrights trademark rights trade names trade secrets and patent rights as a result uscf may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets determine the validity and scope of other parties’ proprietary rights defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties’ rights or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid any litigation of this type even if uscf is successful and regardless of the merits may result in significant costs divert its resources from the fund or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements            due to the increased use of technologies intentional and unintentional cyberattacks pose operational and information security risks   with the increased use of technologies such as the internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions the fund is susceptible to operational and information security risks in general cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events cyberattacks include but are not limited to gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as causing denialofservice attacks on websites cyber security failures or breaches of the fund’s clearing broker or third party service provider including but not limited to index providers the administrator and transfer agent the custodian have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations potentially resulting in financial losses the inability of fund shareholders to transact business violations of applicable privacy and other laws regulatory fines penalties reputational damage reimbursement or other compensation costs andor additional compliance costs in addition substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future the fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result while the fund has established business continuity plans there are inherent limitations in such plans    additional information about the fund its investment objective and investments the fund is a series of the trust the trust operates pursuant to the terms of the declaration of trust and trust agreement dated as of march   “trust agreement” which grants full management control of the fund to uscf the trust agreement is posted on the fund’s website at  •   the fund maintains its main business office at  harrison street suite  oakland california  the net assets of the fund consist primarily of investments in the oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments market conditions that uscf currently anticipates could cause the fund to invest in other oilrelated investments include those allowing the fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing the fund invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in futures contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in shortterm obligations of the united states of two years or less “treasuries” cash and cash equivalents the daily holdings of the fund are available on the fund’s website at  •   the fund invests in oil interests to the fullest extent possible without being unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in oil interests in pursuing this objective the primary focus of uscf is the investment in futures contracts and the management of the fund’s investments in treasuries cash andor cash equivalents for margining purposes and as collateral the fund seeks to invest in a combination of oil interests such that the daily changes in its nav measured in percentage terms will track three times x the daily changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract also measured in percentage terms as a specific benchmark uscf endeavors to place the fund’s trades in oil interests and otherwise manage the fund’s investments so that the difference between “a” and “b” will be plusminus  percent  of “b” where     •   a is the average daily percentage change in the fund’s per share nav for any period of thirty  successive valuation days ie  any nyse trading day as of which the fund calculates its per share nav and     •   b is three times the average daily percentage change in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract over the same period    uscf believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily change in the fund’s share price on the nyse exchange on a percentage basis to closely track the daily changes in the fund’s per share nav on a percentage basis uscf further believes that the daily changes in the fund’s nav in percentage terms will track three times x the daily changes in percentage terms in the benchmark oil futures contract less the fund’s expenses the fund will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day  the pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that the return of the fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for such longer period because the aggregate return of the fund is the product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns during periods of market volatility the volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract may affect the fund’s return as much as or more than the return of the benchmark oil futures contract further the return for investors that invest for periods less than a full trading day or for a period different than a trading day will not be the product of the return of the fund’s stated investment objective and the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract for the full trading day additionally investors should be aware that the fund’s investment objective is not for its nav or market price of shares to equal in dollar terms the spot price of light sweet crude oil natural market forces called contango and backwardation can impact the total return on an investment in the fund’s shares relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and in the future it is likely that the relationship between the market price of the fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation it is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil which could be substantial              the fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently the fund is not intended to be used by and is not appropriate for investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios    the fund’s “neutral” investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell the fund’s shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in crude oil in a costeffective manner andor to permit participants in the oil or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their crude oilrelated transactions accordingly depending on the investment objective of an individual investor the risks generally associated with investing in crude oil andor the risks involved in hedging may exist in addition an investment in the fund involves the risk that the daily changes in the price of the fund’s shares in percentage terms will not accurately track the daily changes in the benchmark oil futures contract on a leveraged basis in percentage terms and that daily changes in the benchmark oil futures contract in percentage terms will not closely correlate with daily changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil in percentage terms  impact of contango and backwardation on total returns natural market forces called contango and backwardation can impact the total return on an investment in the fund’s shares relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and in the future it is likely that the relationship between the market price of the fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation it is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil which could be substantial several factors determine the total return from investing in a futures contract position one factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near month futures contracts and “rolling” those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current near month contract and the next month contract for example if the price of the near month contract is higher than the next month contract a situation referred to as “backwardation” in the futures market then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to rise in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration conversely if the price of a near month contract is lower than the next month contract a situation referred to as “contango” in the futures market then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to decline in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration as an example assume that the price of crude oil for immediate delivery the “spot” price was  per barrel and the value of a position in the near month futures contract was also  over time the price of the barrel of crude oil will fluctuate based on a number of market factors including demand for oil relative to its supply the value of the near month contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors if investors seek to maintain their position in a near month contract and not take delivery of the oil every month they must sell their current near month contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month contract if the futures market is in backwardation eg when the price of crude oil futures contracts that expire later than the near month contract are lower than the near

could have fallen  while the value of an investment in the futures contract could have fallen only  over time if backwardation remained constant the difference would continue to increase            if the futures market is in contango the investor would be buying a next month contract for a higher price than the current near month contract using again the  per barrel price above to represent the front month price the price of the next month contract could be  per barrel that is  more expensive than the front month contract hypothetically and assuming no other changes to either prevailing

cash equivalents the value of the next month contract would fall as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of  in this example it would mean that the value of an investment in the second month would tend to rise slower than the spot price of crude oil or fall faster as a result it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of crude oil to have risen  after some period of time while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract will have risen only  assuming contango is large enough or enough time has elapsed similarly the spot price of crude oil could have fallen  while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract could have fallen  over time if contango remained constant the difference would continue to increase historically the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation with backwardation being in place roughly as often as contango since oil futures trading started in  following the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter of  the crude oil market moved into contango and remained in contango for a period of several years during parts of  the level of contango was unusually steep as a combination of slack us and global demand for crude oil and issues involving the physical transportation and storage of crude oil at cushing oklahoma the primary pricing point for oil traded in the us led to unusually high inventories of crude oil since then a combination of improved transportation and storage capacity along with growing demand for crude oil globally has moderated the inventory buildup and lead to reduced levels of contango by  the crude oil futures market was primarily in a state of contango during the year ended december   periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact the fund’s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share nav track on a leveraged basis the daily percentage changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to proportionally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both the fund’s shares and the benchmark oil futures contract it is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future it is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods  trading methodology in managing the fund’s assets uscf does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders uscf instead employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a creation basket is sold uscf purchases oil interests such as the benchmark oil futures contract that have an aggregate market value that approximates three times x the amount of treasuries andor cash received upon the issuance of the creation basket as of the nav calculation time each trading day the fund will also seek to position its portfolio so that its exposure to the benchmark oil futures contract is consistent with its investment objective to provide investment results that correspond before fees and expenses to three times x the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract the specific oil futures contracts purchased depend on various factors including a judgment by uscf as to the appropriate diversification of the fund’s investments in futures contracts with respect to the month of expiration and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts while uscf has made significant investments in nymex oil futures contracts for various reasons including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market position limits or other regulatory requirements limiting the fund’s holdings and market conditions it may invest in oil futures contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in other oilrelated investments to the extent that the fund invests in other oilrelated investments it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the benchmark oil futures contract including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria and then to a lesser extent it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts instruments and noncleared swaps such as swaps in the overthecounter market or commonly referred to as the “otc market” if the fund is required by law or regulation or by one of its regulators including a futures exchange to reduce its position in the benchmark oil futures contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in other oilrelated investments a substantial portion of the fund’s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in other oilrelated investments that are intended to replicate the return on the benchmark oil futures contract as the fund’s assets reach higher levels it is more likely to exceed position limits accountability levels or other regulatory limits and as a result it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in other oilrelated investments at such higher levels in addition market conditions that uscf currently anticipates could cause the fund to invest in other oilrelated investments include those allowing the fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing see “risk factors involved with an investment in the fund” for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on the fund’s ability to invest in otc transactions and cleared swaps            uscf may not be able to fully invest the fund’s assets in benchmark oil futures contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to three times x the fund’s nav for example as standardized contracts the benchmark oil futures contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity and the fund’s nav and the proceeds from the sale of a creation basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts as a result in such circumstances the fund may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the benchmark oil futures contract through the use of other oilrelated investments such as otc contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund anticipates that to the extent it invests in oil futures contracts other than contracts on light sweet crude oil such as futures contracts for dieselheating oil natural gas and other petroleumbased fuels and other oilrelated investments it will enter into various nonexchangetraded derivative contracts to hedge the shortterm price movements of such oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments against the current benchmark oil futures contract uscf does not anticipate letting the fund’s oil futures contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity instead uscf will close existing positions eg  when it changes the benchmark oil futures contracts or other oilrelated investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new oil futures contracts or other oilrelated investments positions may also be closed out to meet orders for redemption baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested the benchmark oil futures contract is changed from the near month contract to the next month contract over a fourday period each month the benchmark oil futures contract changes starting at the end of the day on the date two weeks prior to expiration of the near month contract for that month during the first three days of the period the applicable value of the benchmark oil futures contract is based on a combination of the near month contract and the next month contract as follows  day  consists of  of the then near month contract’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract divided by  of the near month contract’s prior day’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract  day  consists of  of the then near month contract’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract divided by  of the near month contract’s prior day’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract and  day  consists of  of the then near month contract’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract divided by  of the near month contract’s prior day’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract on day  the benchmark oil futures contract is the next month contract to expire at that time and that contract remains the benchmark oil futures contract until the beginning of the following month’s change in the benchmark oil futures contract over a fourday period on each day during the fourday period uscf anticipates it will “roll” the fund’s positions in oil interests by closing or selling a percentage of the fund’s positions in oil interests and reinvesting the proceeds from closing those positions in new oil interests that reflect the change in the benchmark oil futures contract the anticipated dates that the monthly fourday roll period will commence are posted on the fund’s website at  •  and are subject to change without notice by remaining invested as fully as possible in oil futures contracts or other oilrelated investments uscf believes that the daily changes in percentage terms of the fund’s nav will continue to closely track on a leveraged basis the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract uscf believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price of the shares traded on the nyse arca closely tracking the nav of the fund additionally oil futures contracts traded on the nymex have closely tracked the spot price of light sweet crude oil based on these expected interrelationships uscf believes that the changes in the price of the fund’s shares as traded on the nyse arca have closely tracked and will continue to closely track on a daily basis the changes in the spot price of light sweet crude oil on a percentage basis  what are the trading policies of the fund   investment objectives the fund seeks on a daily basis to provide investment results that correspond before fees and expenses to three times x the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund does not seek to achieve its stated objective over a period greater than a single day because the fund seeks investment results for a single day only as measured from the time the fund calculates its nav to the time of the fund’s next nav calculation and on a leveraged basis the fund is different from most exchangetraded funds              as of the nav calculation time each trading day the fund will seek to position its portfolio so that its exposure to the benchmark oil futures contract is consistent with its investment objective the impact of a benchmark oil futures contract’s movements during the day will affect whether the fund’s portfolio needs to be rebalanced for example the fund’s long exposure will need to be increased on days when the benchmark oil futures contract rises and decreased on days the benchmark oil futures contract falls daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time means that the return of the fund for a period longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period which will very likely differ from three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for the period the fund may lose money if the benchmark oil futures contract’s performance is flat over time and it is possible for a fund to lose money over time regardless of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract as a result of daily rebalancing the benchmark oil futures contract’s volatility and compounding there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective or avoid substantial losses the fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than a single day because mathematical compounding prevents the fund from achieving such results results for the fund over periods of time greater than a single day should not be expected to be a simple multiple x of the period return of the benchmark oil futures contract and will likely differ significantly from such the fund may lose money if the benchmark oil futures contract’s performance is flat over time and it is possible for the fund to lose money over time regardless of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract as a result of daily rebalancing the benchmark oil futures contract’s volatility and compounding daily compounding of the fund’s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longerterm performance during periods of high volatility volatility may be at least as important to the fund’s return for a period as the return of the benchmark oil futures contract liquidity   the fund invests only in oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments that in the opinion of uscf are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in other oilrelated investments that in the opinion of uscf may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of the fund spot commodities   while the crude oil futures contracts traded can be physically settled the fund does not intend to take or make physical delivery the fund may from time to time trade in other oilrelated investments including contracts based on the spot price of crude oil leverage   uscf endeavors to have the aggregate market value of its obligations under its oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments equal to three times x the value of the fund’s treasuries cash and cash equivalents whether held by the fund or posted as margin or other collateral at the close of each trading day as measured at the time the fund calculates its nav commodity pools’ trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract’s or other commodity interest’s entire market value borrowings   borrowings are not expected to be used by the fund unless the fund is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery if the fund trades in cash commodities or for shortterm needs created by unexpected redemptions otc derivatives including spreads and straddles   in addition to oil futures contracts there are also a number of listed options on the oil futures contracts on the principal futures exchanges these contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the crude oil market consequently the fund may purchase options on crude oil futures contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective            in addition to the oil futures contracts and options on the oil futures contracts there also exists an active nonexchangetraded market in derivatives tied to crude oil these derivatives transactions also known as otc contracts are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts unlike most of the exchangetraded oil futures contracts or exchangetraded options on the oil futures contracts each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party ie  the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract to reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts the fund will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the master agreement published by the international swaps and derivatives association inc “isda” that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty uscf assesses or reviews as appropriate the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an otc contract pursuant to guidelines approved by uscf’s board the fund may enter into certain transactions where an otc component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract an “exchange for related position” or “efrp transaction” in the most common type of efrp transaction entered into by the fund the otc component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of the fund shares these efrp transactions may expose the fund to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the otc component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract generally the counterparty risk from the efrp transaction will exist only on the day of execution the fund may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking on a leveraged basis the price of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset but with different delivery months the fund does not anticipate engaging in trading in futures contracts listed on a foreign exchange forward contracts or options on such contracts but it may do so as outlined in the fund’s listing exemptive order or as permitted under current regulations pyramiding   uscf has not employed and will not employ the technique commonly known as pyramiding in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest  the fund’s operations    uscf and its

states x oil fund the “fund” a series of the uscf funds trust is a fund that issues shares that trade on nyse arca equities inc “nyse” the investment objective of the fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value “nav” to reflect three times x the daily change in percentage terms of the price of a specified shortterm futures contract on light sweet crude oil called the “benchmark oil futures contract” the benchmark oil futures contract is the futures contract on light sweet crude oil as traded on the new york mercantile exchange the “nymex” traded under the trading symbol “cl” for wti crude oil futures that is the near month contract to expire except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire the fund seeks a return that is  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for a single day the fund should not be expected to provide  of the cumulative return for the benchmark oil futures contract for periods greater than a day   the fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by primarily investing in

dieselheating oil gasoline natural gas and other petroleumbased fuels each of which are traded on the nymex ice futures europe or other us and foreign exchanges as well as cleared swap transactions and otc swap contracts valued based on the foregoing and   iii finally invest in exchangetraded cash settled options on oil futures contracts       all such other investments are referred to as “other

compensation paid to the marketing agent and any affiliate of uscf for marketing andor distributionrelated services in connection with this offering of shares will not exceed ten percent  of the gross proceeds of the offering   the fund is not appropriate for all investors and presents many different risks than other types of funds including risks associated with the use of leverage the fund is intended to be a daily trading tool for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks the fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the benchmark oil futures contract additionally the fund is designed to achieve its stated investment objective on a daily basis but its performance over different periods of time can differ significantly from its stated daily objective the fund is riskier than securities that have intermediate or longterm investment objectives and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold shares of the fund for a period other than one day the return of the fund for a period longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day compounded over the period and usually will differ from the  of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract for the same period daily compounding of the fund’s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longerterm performance during periods of high volatility volatility may be at least as important to the fund’s return for a period as the return of the benchmark oil futures contract accordingly the fund should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily compounding leveraged long investment results investors should actively and frequently monitor their investments in the fund even intraday it is possible that you will suffer significant losses in the fund even if the longterm performance of the benchmark oil futures contract is positive investors who buy or sell shares during the day from their broker may do so at a premium or discount relative to the market value of the underlying benchmark oil futures contracts in which the fund invests due to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares investing in the fund involves risks similar to those involved with leveraged exposure to the benchmark oil futures contracts and

depend upon the terms of the transaction and your circumstances in general however all swaps transactions involve some combination of market risk credit risk counterparty credit risk funding risk liquidity risk and operational risk highly customized swaps transactions in particular may increase liquidity risk which may result in a suspension of redemptions highly leveraged transactions may experience substantial gains or losses in value as a result of relatively small changes in the value or level of an underlying or related market factor in evaluating the risks and contractual obligations associated with a particular swap transaction it is important to consider that a swap transaction may be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the original parties and subject

including risks associated with the effects of leveraged investing an investor should only consider an investment in the fund if he or she understands the consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results the fund seeks to return before fees and expenses a multiple x of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract for a single day not for any other period the return of the fund for a period longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day compounded over the period and usually will differ from the fund’s multiple times the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for the same period daily compounding of the fund’s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longerterm performance during periods of high volatility volatility may be at least as important to the fund’s return for a period as the return of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the benchmark oil futures contract for example the return of the fund for a single day should be approximately three times as volatile as the return of a fund for a single day with an objective of matching the same benchmark oil futures contract shareholders who invest in the funds should actively manage and monitor their investments as frequently as daily   the trust and the fund   the uscf funds trust the “trust” is a delaware statutory trust formed on march   pursuant to the delaware statutory trust act the united states x oil fund the “fund” formed on june   is one of the series of the trust each such series a “rex fund” and together the “rex funds” the fund is a commodity pool that continuously issues common shares of beneficial interest that may be purchased and sold on nyse  the trust and the fund operate pursuant to the trust’s amended and restated declaration of trust and trust agreement the “trust agreement” dated as of june   wilmington trust national association a national banking association with its principal place of business in the state of delaware is the delaware trustee of the trust the trust and the fund are managed and controlled by uscf uscf is a limited liability company formed in delaware on may   that is registered as a commodity pool operator “cpo” with the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” and is a member of the national futures association “nfa” the fund’s investment objective and strategy   the investment objective of the fund will be for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value “nav” to reflect three times x the daily change in percentage terms of the price of a specified shortterm futures contract on light sweet crude oil the “benchmark oil futures contract” less the fund’s expenses to achieve this objective uscf will endeavor to have the notional value of the fund’s aggregate exposure to the benchmark oil futures contract at the close of each trading day approximately equal to  of the fund’s nav the fund will seek a return that is  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for a single day and does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day the pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that the return of the fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for a period of longer than a full trading day because the aggregate return of the fund is the product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns   what is the “benchmark oil futures contract”   the benchmark oil futures contract is the futures contract on light sweet crude oil as traded on the new york mercantile exchange the “nymex” traded under the trading symbol “cl” for wti crude oil futures that is the near month contract to expire except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire      how does the fund intend to meet its investment objectives   the fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by primarily investing in futures contracts for light sweet crude oil that are traded on the nymex ice futures europe or other us and foreign exchanges collectively “oil futures contracts”  the fund will to a lesser extent and in view of regulatory requirements andor market conditions i next invest in a cleared swap transactions based on the benchmark oil futures contract b nonexchange traded “overthecounter” or “otc” negotiated swap contracts that are based on the benchmark oil futures contract and c forward contracts for oil       ii followed by investments in futures contracts for other types of crude oil dieselheating oil gasoline natural gas and other petroleumbased fuels each of which are traded on the nymex ice futures europe or other us and foreign exchanges as well as cleared swap transactions and otc swap contracts valued based on the foregoing and   iii finally invest in exchangetraded cash settled options on oil futures contracts       all such other investments are referred to as “other oilrelated investments” and together with oil futures contracts are “oil interests” for the fund to maintain a consistent  return versus the benchmark oil futures contract the fund’s holdings must be rebalanced on a daily basis by buying additional oil interests or selling oil interests that it holds such rebalancing will occur generally before or at the close of trading of the shares on the exchange at or as near as possible to that day’s settlement price and will be disclosed on the fund’s website as pending trades before the opening of trading on the exchange the next business day and will be taken into account in the fund’s intraday indicative fund value and reflected in the fund’s end of day nav on that business day  the fund anticipates that to the extent it invests in oil futures contracts other than the benchmark oil futures contract or other oilrelated investments it will invest in futures cleared and noncleared swaps and call and put options to hedge the shortterm price movements of such oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments against the price movements of the current benchmark oil futures contract for example if the fund invested in dieselheating oil futures contracts it may also enter into a swap or forward contract that is valued based on the difference between the dieselheating oil futures contract and the benchmark oil futures contract so that the investment in the dieselheating oil futures contracts together with such swap would provide a return that more closely matches the movements in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract uscf currently anticipates that regulatory requirements such as accountability levels set by exchanges or position limits set by exchanges or by other regulators such as the cftc and market conditions including those allowing the fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing could cause the fund to invest in other oilrelated investments the fund will support its investments by holding the amounts of its margin collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in shortterm obligations of the united states of two years or less “treasuries” cash and cash equivalents cash equivalents are shortterm instruments with maturities of less than three months and shall include the following i certificates of deposit issued against funds deposited in a bank or savings and loan association ii bankers’ acceptances which are shortterm credit instruments used to finance commercial transactions iii repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements iv bank time deposits which are monies kept on deposit with banks or savings and loan associations for a stated period of time at a fixed rate of interest v commercial paper which are shortterm unsecured promissory notes and vi money market funds the fund may invest in money market funds as well as treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less as an investment for assets not used for margin or collateral in the oil interests the majority of the fund’s assets will be held in treasuries cash andor cash equivalents with the custodian     the fund will seek to invest in a combination of oil interests such that the daily changes in its nav measured in percentage terms less the fund’s expenses will track three times x the daily changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract also measured in percentage terms as a specific benchmark uscf will endeavor to place the fund’s trades in oil interests and otherwise manage the fund’s investments so that the difference between “a” and “b” will be plusminus  percent  of “b” where  • a is the average daily percentage change in the fund’s per share nav for any period of thirty  successive valuation days ie any nyse trading day as of which the fund calculates its per share nav less the fund’s expenses and   • b is three times the average daily percentage change in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract over the same period   the design of the fund’s benchmark oil futures contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration when over a four day period it transitions to the next month contract to expire as its benchmark contract and keeps that contract as its benchmark until it becomes the near month contract and close to expiration in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts “backwardation”  then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration conversely in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts “contango” then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration uscf believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause daily changes in the fund’s share price on nyse on a percentage basis to closely track the daily changes in the fund’s per share nav on a percentage basis the fund will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day  the pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that the return of the fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for a period of longer than a full trading day because the aggregate return of the fund is the product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns during periods of market volatility the volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract may affect the fund’s return as much as or more than the return of the benchmark oil futures contract further the return for investors that invest for periods less than a full trading day or for a period different than a trading day will not be the product of the return of the fund’s stated investment objective and the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract for the full trading day additionally investors should be aware that the fund’s investment objective is not for its nav or market price of shares to equal in dollar terms the spot price of light sweet crude oil natural market forces called contango and backwardation can impact the total return on an investment in the fund’s shares relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and in the future it is likely that the relationship between the market price of the fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation it is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil which could be substantial principal investment risks of an investment in the fund   an investment in the fund involves a degree of risk some of the risks you may face are summarized below a more extensive discussion of these risks appears beginning on page  investment risk   investors may choose to use the fund as a means of investing indirectly in crude oil there are significant risks and hazards inherent in the crude oil industry that may cause the price of crude oil to widely fluctuate correlation risk   to the extent that investors use the fund as a means of indirectly investing in crude oil there is the risk that the daily changes in the price of the fund’s shares on the nyse on a percentage basis will not closely track the daily changes in the spot price of light sweet crude oil on a percentage basis this could happen if the price of shares traded on the nyse does not correlate closely with the value of the fund’s nav the changes in the fund’s nav do not correlate closely with the changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract or the changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract do not closely correlate with the changes in the cash or spot price of crude oil this is a risk because if these correlations do not exist then investors may not be able to use the fund as a costeffective way to indirectly invest in crude oil or as a hedge against the risk of loss in crude oilrelated transactions      the price relationship between the near month contract to expire and the next month contract to expire that compose the benchmark oil futures contract will vary and may impact both the total return over time of the fund’s nav as well as the degree to which its total return tracks other crude oil price indices’ total returns in cases in which the near month contract’s price is lower than the next month contract’s price a situation known as “contango” in the futures markets then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration in cases in which the near month contract’s price is higher than the next month contract’s price a situation known as “backwardation” in the futures markets then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration   compounding risk   the fund has a singleday investment objective because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time the return of the fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period which will very likely differ from  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract over the same period the fund may lose money if the benchmark oil futures contract performance is flat over time and as a result of daily rebalancing the volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract and the effects of compounding it is even possible that the fund will lose money over time while the level of the benchmark oil futures contract increases   the fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently the fund is not intended to be used by and is not appropriate for investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios   tax risk   the fund is organized and operated as a delaware statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of its trust agreement and applicable state law but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited partnership and therefore has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual funds overthecounter “otc” contract risk   the fund may also invest in negotiated “otc” contracts which are not as liquid as exchangetraded futures contracts otc contracts expose the fund to the risk that the fund’s counterparty may not be able to satisfy its obligations to the fund other risks   the fund pays fees and expenses that are incurred regardless of whether it is profitable unlike mutual funds commodity pools or other investment pools that manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains and distribute such income and gains to their investors the fund generally does not distribute cash to limited partners or other shareholders you should not invest in the fund if you will need cash distributions from the fund to pay taxes on your share of income and gains of the fund if any or for any other reason the fund has no operating history so there is no performance history to serve as a basis for you to evaluate an investment in the fund you will have no rights to participate in the management of the fund and will have to rely on the duties and judgment of uscf to manage the fund the fund is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving uscf the marketing agent various commodity futures brokers and authorized participants uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund uscf’s personnel are directors officers or employees of other entities that may compete with the fund for their services including other commodity pools funds that uscf manages these funds are referred to in this prospectus as the “related public funds” and are identified in the glossary uscf could have a conflict between its responsibilities to the fund and to those other entities as a result of these and other relationships parties involved with the fund have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interest of the fund and the shareholders      the fund’s fees and expenses   this table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund you should note that you may pay brokerage fees on purchases and sales of the fund’s shares which are not reflected in the table authorized participants will pay applicable creation and redemption fees see “creation and redemption of shares creation and redemption transaction fee ” page    annual fund operating expenses expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment       fees and expenses   management fee               brokerage fees               total annual fund operating expenses                  the fund is contractually obligated to pay uscf a management fee based on daily net assets and paid monthly of  per annum on average net assets average daily net assets are calculated daily by taking the average of the total net assets of the fund over the calendar year ie  the sum of daily total net assets divided by the number of calendar days in the year on days when markets are closed the total net assets are the total net assets from the last day when the market was open  the fund determined this estimate as follows based on the fund having two blocks of  shares “creation baskets” sold and  shares outstanding assuming the price of a share is  the fund would receive  upon the sale of a creation basket  shares multiplied by  assuming no change in the settlement price of the contracts the fund would be required to sell and purchase positions in  futures contracts each month to support shares sold in the creation basket  divided by the total value of the futures contracts at an assumed settlement price for the futures contract of  multiplied by  for the leverage assuming futures commission merchants charge approximately  per futures contract for each buy or sale the monthly futures commission merchant commission charge per contract would be approximately  except on the first month in which it would be approximately  because there is no roll and the annual futures commission merchant commission charge per contract would be approximately  assuming no change in the settlement price of the contracts the fund would sell and buy  futures contracts each month to support a creation basket which means that the fund’s annual commission charge per two creation baskets without rebalancing would be approximately   contracts bought and sold  approximately  per month  months the estimated daily rebalancing cost of  of holdings is     contracts   the number of nyse trading days   the fund’s annual commission charge per two creation baskets with rebalancing is  the annual commission charge plus the rebalancing cost as a percentage of the total investment of  to support the issuance of two creation baskets the fund’s annual commission expense would be approximately   divided by  per annum      risk factors involved with an investment in the fund you should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision you should also refer to the other information included in this prospectus as well as information found in our periodic reports which includes the trust’s and the fund’s financial statements and related notes risks related to leveraged investments due to the compounding of daily returns the fund’s returns over periods longer than a single day will likely differ in amount and possibly even direction from the fund multiple times the benchmark return for the period   the investment objective of the fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its per share nav to reflect three times x the daily change in percentage terms of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund seeks investment results for a single day only as measured from nav calculation time to nav calculation time and not for any other period the return of the fund for a period longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day compounded over the period and usually will differ from three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for the same period the fund could lose money over time regardless of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract including as a result of daily rebalancing the benchmark oil futures contract’s volatility and compounding longer holding periods higher volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract and greater leverage each affect the impact of compounding on the fund’s returns daily compounding of the fund’s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longerterm performance during periods of high volatility volatility may be at least as important to the fund’s return for a period as the return of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the benchmark oil futures contract for example the return for a single day should be approximately three times as volatile for a single day as the return of a fund with an objective of matching the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund is not appropriate for all investors and present different risks than other funds the fund uses leverage and is riskier than similarly benchmarked exchangetraded funds that do not use leverage an investor should only consider an investment in the fund if he or she understands the consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results for a single day daily objective leveraged funds if used properly and in conjunction with the investor’s view on the future direction and volatility of the markets can be useful tools for investors who want to manage their exposure to various markets and market segments and who are willing to monitor andor periodically rebalance their portfolios shareholders who invest in the fund should actively manage and monitor their investments as frequently as daily in general during periods of higher volatility for the benchmark oil futures contract compounding will cause the fund’s results for periods longer than a single day to be less than three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract this effect becomes more pronounced as volatility increases conversely in periods of lower volatility for the benchmark oil futures contract particularly when combined with higher returns for the benchmark oil futures contract the fund’s returns over longer periods can be higher than three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract actual results for a particular period before fees and expenses are also dependent on the magnitude of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract in addition to the volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract intraday priceperformance risk the fund is typically rebalanced at or about the time of its nav calculation as such the intraday position of the fund will generally be different from the fund’s stated daily investment objective ie x when shares are bought intraday the performance of the fund’s shares until the fund’s next nav calculation will generally be greater than or less than the fund’s stated daily multiple the use of leveraged positions could result in the total loss of an investor’s investment the fund utilizes leverage in seeking to achieve its investment objective and will lose more money in market environments adverse to its respective daily investment objectives than funds that do not employ leverage the use of leveraged positions could result in the total loss of an investor’s investment      for example because the investment objective of the fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its per share nav to reflect three times x the daily change in percentage terms of the benchmark oil futures contract a singleday movement in the benchmark oil futures contract approaching  at any point in the day could result in the total loss or almost total loss of an investor’s investment if that movement is contrary to the investment objective of the fund even if the benchmark oil futures contract subsequently moves in an opposite direction eliminating all or a portion of the movement this would be the case with downward singleday or intraday movements in the benchmark oil futures contract even if the benchmark oil futures contract maintains a level greater than zero at all times investment risk   the nav of the fund’s shares relates directly to the value of the benchmark oil futures contracts and other assets held by the fund and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in the fund’s shares the net assets of the fund consist primarily of investments in oil futures contracts and to a lesser extent in other oilrelated investments the nav of the fund’s shares relates directly to the value of these assets less liabilities including accrued but unpaid expenses which in turn relates to the price of light sweet crude oil in the marketplace crude oil prices depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil economic conditions impacting crude oil the demand for crude oil correlates closely with general economic growth rates the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on crude oil prices other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for crude oil sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also may adversely impact the demand for crude oil other crude oil demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for crude oil and therefore its price include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns which affect the demand for crude oil associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as toward alternative fueled vehicles other crude oil supplyrelated factors crude oil prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce crude oil prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of crude oil world oil supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by member countries to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries “opec” production quotas and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the petroleum industry to find produce and refine oil and to manufacture petrochemicals which in turn may affect the supply of and demand for oil other factors impacting the crude oil market the supply of and demand for crude oil may also be impacted by changes in interest rates inflation and other local or regional market conditions as well as by the development of alternative energy sources price volatility may possibly cause the total loss of your investment futures contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes consequently you could lose all or substantially all of your investment in the fund correlation risk investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of crude oil will have an efficient hedge only if the price investors pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of crude oil investing in the fund’s shares for hedging purposes involves the following risks        •   the market price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be significantly less or more than nav     •   daily percentage changes in nav may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes on a leveraged basis in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract     •   daily percentage changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of light sweet crude oil         further in order to achieve a high degree of correlation with the benchmark oil futures contract the fund seeks to rebalance its portfolios daily to keep exposure consistent with its investment objectives being materially under or overexposed to the benchmark oil futures contract may prevent the fund from achieving a high degree of correlation with the benchmark oil futures contract market disruptions or closures large amounts of assets into or out of the fund regulatory restrictions or extreme market volatility will adversely affect the fund’s ability to adjust exposure to requisite levels the target amount of portfolio exposure is impacted dynamically by the benchmark oil futures contract’s movements during each day because of this it is unlikely that the fund will be perfectly exposed ie x at the end of each day and the likelihood of being materially under or overexposed is higher on days when the benchmark levels are volatile near the close of the trading day in addition unlike other funds that do not rebalance their portfolios as frequently the fund may be subject to increased trading costs associated with daily portfolio rebalancing in order to maintain appropriate exposure to the underlying benchmarks such costs include commissions paid to the fcms and may vary by fcm the market price at which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly less or more than nav the fund’s nav per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in the market value of the fund’s portfolio investments the public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may be different from the nav of the shares price differences may relate primarily to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to but not identical to the same forces influencing the prices of the light sweet crude oil and the benchmark oil futures contract at any point in time uscf expects that exploitation of certain arbitrage opportunities by authorized participants and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track nav per share closely over time but there can be no assurance of that the nav of the fund’s shares may also be influenced by nonconcurrent trading hours between the nyse and the various futures exchanges on which crude oil is traded while the shares trade on the nyse from  am to  pm eastern time the trading hours for the futures exchanges on which light sweet crude oil trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time for example while the shares trade on the nyse until  pm eastern time liquidity in the global light sweet crude market will be reduced after the close of the nymex at  pm eastern time as a result during periods when the nyse is open and the futures exchanges on which light sweet crude oil is traded are closed trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen and therefore increase the difference between the price of the shares and the nav of the shares daily percentage changes in the fund’s nav may not correlate with daily percentage changes on a leveraged basis in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract it is possible that the daily percentage changes in the fund’s nav per share may not closely correlate on a leveraged basis to daily percentage changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract noncorrelation may be attributable to disruptions in the market for light sweet crude oil the imposition of position or accountability limits by regulators or exchanges or other extraordinary circumstances as the fund approaches or reaches position limits with respect to the benchmark oil futures contract and other oil futures contracts or in view of market conditions the fund may begin investing in other oilrelated investments in addition the fund is not able to replicate exactly the changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract because the total return generated by the fund is reduced by expenses and transaction costs including those incurred in connection with the fund’s trading activities and increased by interest income from the fund’s holdings of treasuries defined below tracking the benchmark oil futures contract requires trading of the fund’s portfolio with a view to tracking the benchmark oil futures contract over time and is dependent upon the skills of uscf and its trading principals among other factors daily percentage changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of light sweet crude oil the correlation between changes in prices of the benchmark oil futures contract and the spot price of crude oil may at times be only approximate the degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative oil market supply of and demand for oil futures contracts including the benchmark oil futures contract and other oilrelated investments and technical influences in oil futures trading      natural forces in the oil futures market known as “backwardation” and “contango” may increase the fund’s tracking error andor negatively impact total return the design of the fund’s benchmark oil futures contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration when over a four day period it transitions to the next month contract to expire as its benchmark contract and keeps that contract as its benchmark until it becomes the near month contract and close to expiration in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts a situation described as “backwardation” in the futures market then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration conversely in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts a situation described as “contango” in the futures market then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration when compared to total return of other price indices such as the spot price of crude oil the impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return of the fund’s per share nav to vary significantly moreover absent the impact of rising or falling oil prices a prolonged period of contango could have a significant negative impact on the fund’s per share nav and total return and investors could lose part or all of their investment see “additional information about the fund its investment objective and investments” for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and backwardation accountability levels position limits and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error which could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the price of the benchmark oil futures contract   designated contract markets such as the nymex and ice futures europe have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control other than as a hedge which an investment by the fund is not may hold own or control these levels and position limits apply to the futures contracts that the fund invests in to meet its investment objective in addition to accountability levels and position limits the nymex and ice futures europe also set daily price limits on futures contracts the daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement price once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit   the accountability levels for the benchmark oil futures contract and other oil futures contracts traded on usbased futures exchanges such as the nymex are not a fixed ceiling but rather a threshold above which the nymex may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor’s positions the current accountability level for investments for any onemonth in the benchmark oil futures contract is  contracts and the all month accountability level is  contracts the current ice futures europe accountability level for any one month in the ice wti crude futures contract the most comparable future to the benchmark oil futures contract is  contracts and the all month accountability level is  contracts if the fund and the related public funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the benchmark oil futures contracts the nymex and ice futures europe will monitor such exposure and may ask for further information on their activities including the total size of all positions investment and trading strategy and the extent of liquidity resources of the fund and the related public funds if deemed necessary by the nymex andor ice futures europe the fund could be ordered to reduce its aggregate net futures contracts back to the accountability level at this time given the size of the oil futures market it is unlikely that a fund or its related public fund will exceed the above accountability levels   uscf also serves as general partner or sponsor of the united states natural gas fund lp “ung” the united states oil fund “uso” the united states  month oil fund lp “usl” the united states gasoline

nyse and referred to collectively herein as the “related public funds” the rex funds are not included in the related public funds provided that upon the effectiveness of this registration statement on form s the fund shall become one of the related public funds      position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express cftc authority to do so in addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time the nymex and ice futures europe impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire the relevant exchange current spot limit for the benchmark oil futures contract and the ice wti crude oil futures contract is  contracts it is unlikely that the fund will run up against such position limits because the fund’s investment strategy is to close out its positions and “roll” from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract during a fourday period beginning two weeks from expiration of the contract   the cftc has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in certain physical commodity futures and option contracts related to such futures and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contract futures including energy contracts such as the benchmark oil futures contracts the “position limit rules” the position limit rules would among other things identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits set thresholds that restrict the size of speculative positions that a person may hold in the spot month other individual months and all months combined create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions impose responsibilities on designated contract markets “dcms” and swap execution facilities “sefs” to establish position limits or in some cases position accountability rules and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues otc dcms sefs as well as certain nonus located platforms the cftc’s first attempt at finalizing the position limit rules in  was successfully challenged by market participants in  and since then the cftc has reproposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times at this time it is unclear how the position limit rules may affect the fund but the effect may be substantial and adverse by way of example the position limit rules may negatively impact the ability of the fund to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit uscf’s ability to sell additional creation baskets of the fund   until such time as the position limit rules are adopted the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the position limit rules will govern transactions in commodities and related under that system the cftc enforces federal limits on speculation in nine agricultural products eg corn wheat and soy while futures exchanges establish and enforce position limits and accountability levels for other agricultural products and certain energy products eg oil and natural gas as a result the fund may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits   under existing and recently adopted cftc regulations for the purpose of position limits a market participant is generally required subject to certain narrow exceptions to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a  percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding with that market participant the “aggregation rules” the aggregation rules will also apply with respect to the position limit rules if and when such position limit rules are adopted all of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the fund’s shares and the price of the benchmark oil futures contract this may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use the fund as a way to hedge against crude oilrelated losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil the fund has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments if the fund encounters accountability levels position limits or price fluctuation limits for oil futures contracts on the nymex or ice futures europe it may then if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements purchase oil futures contracts on other exchanges that trade listed crude oil futures or enter into swaps or other transactions to meet its investment objective in addition if the fund exceeds accountability levels on either the nymex or ice futures europe and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the fund’s shares and the price of the benchmark oil futures contract   tax risk   an investor’s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions if any on its shares   cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of uscf uscf does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to shares investors will be required to pay us federal income tax and in some cases state local or foreign income tax on their allocable share of the fund’s taxable income without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions therefore the tax liability of an investor with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash or value of property if any distributed      an investor’s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its shares   due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by the fund in making allocations for us federal income tax purposes and other factors an investor’s allocable share of the fund’s income gain deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its shares for a taxable year this difference could be temporary or permanent and if permanent could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income items of income gain deduction loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated and for taxable periods beginning after december   the fund could be liable for us federal income tax if the us internal revenue service “irs” does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by the fund in allocating those items with potential adverse consequences for an investor   the us tax rules pertaining to entities taxed as partnerships are complex and their application to large publicly traded entities such as the fund is in many respects uncertain the fund applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income gains deductions losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects shareholders’ economic gains and losses these assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the internal revenue code the “code” and applicable treasury regulations however and it is possible that the irs will successfully challenge the fund’s allocation methods and require the fund to reallocate items of income gain deduction loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors if this occurs investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest   in addition for periods beginning after december   the fund may be liable for us federal income tax on any “imputed understatement” of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an irs audit the amount of the imputed understatement generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or gains to any investor and decreases in allocations of items of deduction loss or credit to any investor without any offset for any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or gain to any investor or increases in allocations of items of deduction loss or credit to any investor if the fund is required to pay any us federal income taxes on any imputed understatement the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of the fund and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the shares under certain circumstances the fund may be eligible to make an election to cause the investors to take into account the amount of any imputed understatement including any interest and penalties the ability of a publicly traded partnership such as the fund to make this election is uncertain if the election is made the fund would be required to provide investors who owned beneficial interests in the shares in the year to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement setting forth their proportionate shares of the adjustment “adjusted ks” the investors would be required to take the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the adjusted ks are issued for an additional discussion please see “us federal income tax considerations – other tax matters” the fund could be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes which may substantially reduce the value of the shares   the trust on behalf of the fund has received an opinion of counsel that under current us federal income tax laws the fund will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes provided that i at least  percent of the fund’s annual gross income consists of “qualifying income” as defined in the code ii the trust and the fund is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and iii the trust and the fund does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes although uscf anticipates that the fund will satisfy the “qualifying income” requirement for all of its taxable years that result cannot be assured the fund has not requested and nor will the fund request any ruling from the irs with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes if the irs were to successfully assert that the fund is taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes in any taxable year rather than passing through its income gains losses and deductions proportionately to shareholders the fund would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates in addition although the fund currently does not intend to make any distributions with respect to the shares any distributions would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income to the extent of the fund’s current or accumulated earnings and profits subject to holding period and other requirements any such dividend would be a qualifying dividend subject to us federal income tax at the lower maximum tax rates applicable to longterm capital gains taxation of the trust and the fund as a corporation could materially reduce the aftertax return on an investment in shares and could substantially reduce the value of the shares the fund is organized and operated as a delaware statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of its trust agreement and applicable state law but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited partnership and therefore has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual funds      the fund is organized and operated as a delaware statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of its trust agreement and applicable state law but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited partnership and therefore has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual funds no us federal income tax is paid by the fund on its income instead the fund will furnish shareholders each year with tax information on irs schedule k form  and each us shareholder is required to report on its us federal income tax return its allocable share of the income gain loss and deduction of the fund this must be reported without regard to the amount if any of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from the fund during the taxable year a shareholder therefore may be allocated income or gain by the fund but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting from the allocation or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability in addition to us federal income taxes shareholders may be subject to other taxes such as state and local income taxes unincorporated business taxes business franchise taxes and estate inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which the fund does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in the fund it is each shareholder’s responsibility to file the appropriate us federal state local and foreign tax returns   if the fund is required to withhold tax with respect to any nonus shareholders the cost of such withholding may be borne by all shareholders under certain circumstances the fund may be required to pay withholding tax with respect to allocations to nonus shareholders although the trust agreement provides that any such withholding will be treated as being distributed to the nonus shareholder the fund may not be able to cause the economic cost of such withholding to be borne by the nonus shareholder on whose behalf such amounts were withheld since the fund does not intend to make any distributions under such circumstances the economic cost of the withholding may be borne by all shareholders not just the shareholders on whose behalf such amounts were withheld this could have a material impact on the value of the shares   otc contract risk   currently otc transactions are subject to changing regulation   a portion of the fund’s assets may be used to trade otc contracts such as forward contracts options swaps or spot contracts otc contracts are typically contracts traded on a principaltoprincipal noncleared basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions the markets for otc contracts rely upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the cftc on participants in the futures markets while certain regulations adopted over the past several years are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the otc market complying with such regulations could have substantial and adverse effects on the fund   the fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to otc contracts entered into by the trust on behalf of the fund or held by special purpose or structured vehicles   the fund faces the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to the otc contracts unlike in futures contracts the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions as a result there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions a counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to the fund in which case the fund could suffer significant losses on these contracts if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties the fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding the trust on behalf of the fund may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances valuing otc derivatives may be less certain than actively traded financial instruments   in general valuing otc derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such otc derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources in addition while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating otc contracts they typically are not contractually obligated to do so particularly if they are not a party to the transaction as a result it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding otc derivatives transaction      compounding risk the fund has a singleday investment objective and the fund’s performance for periods greater than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period which is likely to be either better or worse than the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract times the stated multiple in the fund’s investment objective before accounting for fees and fund expenses compounding affects all investments but it has a more significant effect on a leveraged fund particularly during periods of higher benchmark oil futures contract volatility compounding will cause results for periods longer than a single day to vary from three times x of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract this effect becomes more pronounced as volatility increases fund performance for periods greater than a single day will be affected by the following factors i benchmark oil futures contract volatility ii benchmark oil futures contract performance iii period of time iv financing rates associated with exposure and v other fund expenses the fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently the fund is not intended to be used by and is not appropriate for investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios   the fund’s returns over periods longer than a single day will likely differ in amount and possibly even direction from three times the benchmark oil futures contract return for the period as a result of compounding of daily returns   the fund has an investment objective of corresponding before fees and expenses to x or for the fund’s related inverse fund “united states x short oil fund” an inverse multiple of x the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract for a given day the fund seeks investment results for a single day only as measured from the calculation of the nav for a particular day to the calculation of the nav for the next day see “calculating per share nav” the return of the fund for a period longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day compounded over the period and usually will differ from three times x or three times the inverse x for the united states x short oil fund of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for the same period the fund will lose money if the benchmark oil futures contract’s performance is flat over time and it is possible for the fund to lose money over time regardless of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract as a result of daily rebalancing the benchmark oil futures contract’s volatility and compounding longer holding periods higher benchmark oil futures contract volatility inverse exposure and greater leverage each affect the impact of compounding on the fund’s returns daily compounding of the fund’s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longerterm performance during periods of high volatility volatility may be at least as important to the fund’s return for a period as the return of the fund’s underlying benchmark oil futures contract   the fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the benchmark oil futures contract for example the return for a single day of the fund with a x multiple should be approximately three times as volatile for a single day as the return of the fund with an objective of matching the same benchmark oil futures contract the return for a single day of the united states x short oil fund with a x multiple should be approximately three times the inverse x of the return that would be expected of a fund with an objective of matching the same benchmark oil futures contract the fund is not appropriate for all investors and presents different risks than other funds the fund uses leverage and is riskier than similarly benchmarked exchangetraded funds that do not use leverage an investor should only consider an investment in the fund or the united states x short oil fund if he or she understands the consequences of seeking daily leveraged or daily inverse leveraged investment results for a single day leveraged funds if used properly and in conjunction with the investor’s view on the future direction and volatility of the markets can be useful tools for investors who want to manage their exposure to various markets and market segments and who are willing to monitor andor periodically rebalance their portfolios shareholders who invest in the fund should actively manage and monitor their investments as frequently as daily   the hypothetical examples below illustrate how a leveraged fund’s returns can behave for periods longer than a single day eg a fund that seeks to triple the daily performance of benchmark contract on each day the fund performs in line with its objective three times x the benchmark’s daily performance before fees and expenses notice that in the first example where there has been an overall benchmark loss for the period over the entire sevenday period the fund’s total return is more than three times the loss of the period return of the benchmark oil futures contract for the sevenday period benchmark lost  while the fund lost  not  or  x           benchmark     fund        level     daily performance     daily performance     net asset value   start                              day                            day                           day                           day                           day                            day                            day                            total return                                                                 similarly in another example showing an overall benchmark gain for the period over the entire sevenday period the fund’s total return is considerably less than triple that of the period return of the benchmark for the sevenday period benchmark gained  while the fund gained  versus  or  x      benchmark     fund        level     daily performance     daily performance     net asset value   start                              day                            day                           day                           day                           day                            day                            day                            total return                                                                 these effects are caused by compounding which exists in all investments but has a more significant impact on leveraged funds in general during periods of higher benchmark volatility compounding will cause the fund’s results for periods longer than a single day to be less than three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract or for the short oil fund less than three times the inverse x of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract this effect becomes more pronounced as volatility increases conversely in periods of lower benchmark volatility particularly when combined with higher benchmark oil futures contract returns the fund’s returns over longer periods can be higher than three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract actual results for a particular period before fees and expenses are also dependent on the magnitude of the benchmark oil futures contract return in addition to the benchmark volatility these effects may be even greater with the united states x short oil fund the graphs that follow illustrate this point each of the graphs shows a simulated hypothetical one year performance of the benchmark oil futures contract compared with the performance of the fund and the united states x short oil fund that perfectly achieves its daily investment objective on each day during the period the graphs demonstrate that for periods greater than a single day the fund is likely to underperform or outperform but not match the benchmark oil futures contract performance or for the united states x short oil fund the inverse of the benchmark oil futures contract times the multiple stated as the daily fund objective investors should understand the consequences of holding a daily rebalanced fund for periods longer than a single day and should actively manage and monitor their investments as frequently as daily a oneyear period is used solely for illustrative purposes deviations from the benchmark oil futures contract return times the fund multiple can occur over periods as short as two days each day as measured from daily nav to the next daily nav and may also occur in periods shorter than a single day when measured intraday as opposed to daily nav to the next daily nav see “calculating per share nav” below for additional details to isolate the impact of daily leveraged or for the united states x short oil fund inverse leveraged exposure these graphs assume a no fund expenses or transaction costs b borrowinglending rates to obtain required leveraged or inverse leveraged exposure and cash reinvestment rates of zero percent and c the fund consistently maintaining perfect exposure of x or in the case of the united states x short oil fund x as of the fund’s nav calculation time each day if these assumptions were different each funds’ performance would be different than that shown if fund expenses transaction costs and financing expenses greater than zero percent were included each funds’ performance would also be different than shown each of the graphs also assumes a volatility rate of  which is the approximate fiveyear historical volatility rate of the benchmark oil futures contract as of december   a benchmark’s volatility rate is a statistical measure of the magnitude of fluctuations in its returns these graphs are presented to provide examples of what can occur if an investor choses to hold the funds for periods longer than oneday they are not intended to suggest that longer holding periods such as oneyear are an appropriate holding period        the graph above shows a scenario where the benchmark oil futures contract which exhibits daytoday volatility is flat or trendless over a year ie provides a return of  over the course of the year but the fund x and the united states x short oil fund x are both significantly down   the graph above shows a scenario where the benchmark oil futures contract which exhibits daytoday volatility is down over the year but the fund x is down less than three times the benchmark oil futures contract and the united states x short oil fund x is up significantly less than three times the inverse of the benchmark oil futures contract        the graph above shows a scenario where the benchmark oil futures contract which exhibits daytoday volatility is up over the year but the fund x is up significantly less than three times the benchmark oil futures contract and the united states x short oil fund x is down less than three times the inverse of the benchmark oil futures contract   the tables below illustrate the impact of two factors that affect a leveraged fund’s performance benchmark volatility and benchmark return benchmark oil futures contract volatility is a statistical measure of the magnitude of fluctuations in the returns of a benchmark and is calculated as the standard deviation of the natural logarithms of one plus the benchmark return calculated daily multiplied by the square root of the number of trading days per year assumed to be  the tables show estimated fund returns for a number of combinations of benchmark volatility and benchmark return over a oneyear period to isolate the impact of daily leveraged or inverse leveraged exposure these tables assume a no fund expenses or transaction costs b borrowinglending rates of zero percent to obtain required leveraged or inverse leveraged exposure and cash reinvestment rates of zero percent c the fund consistently maintaining perfect x or x exposure for the united states x short oil fund as of the fund’s nav time each day and d the volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract remains constant over time if these assumptions were different the fund’s performance would be different than that shown if fund expenses transaction costs and financing expenses were included each funds’ performance would be different than shown the first table below shows an example in which each fund has an investment objective to correspond before fees and expenses to three times x the daily performance of its benchmark the fund might be incorrectly expected to achieve a  return on a yearly basis if the benchmark return was  absent the effects of compounding however as the table shows with a benchmark volatility of  the fund would return  in the charts below shaded areas represent those scenarios where the fund and the united states x short oil fund each discussed in the chart with the investment objective as described below will outperform ie return more than the benchmark performance times the stated multiple in the investment objective of the fund or the united states x short oil fund as applicable conversely areas not shaded represent those scenarios where the fund or the united states x short oil fund as applicable will underperform ie return less than the benchmark performance times the multiple stated as the daily fund objective with respect to the fund or the united states x short oil fund as applicable      expected fund return over one year for the fund—the funds objective is only to seek daily investment results before fees and expenses that correspond to three times x the daily performance of a benchmark the fund does not seek to match x the benchmark over a period longer than one day                     benchmark volatility

                                                                                            the foregoing tables are intended to isolate the effect of benchmark volatility and benchmark performance on the return of the fund or the united states x short oil fund the actual returns of the fund or the united states x short oil fund may be significantly greater or less than the returns shown above as a result of any of the factors discussed above or under the below risk factor describing correlation risks      other risks nyse may halt trading in the fund’s shares which would adversely impact an investor’s ability to sell shares the fund’s shares are listed for trading on nyse under the market symbol “usou” trading in shares may be halted due to market conditions or in light nyse rules and procedures for reasons that in the view of nyse make trading in shares inadvisable in addition trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline additionally there can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of the fund’s shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged the lack of an active trading market for the fund shares may result in losses on an investor’s investment in the fund at the time the investor sells the shares although the fund’s shares are listed and traded on nyse there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will be maintained if an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active trading market for them exists the price the investor receives upon sale of the shares assuming they were able to be sold likely would be lower than if an active market existed certain of the fund’s investments could be illiquid which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time   futures positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price it is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market a market disruption such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market for its currency its crude oil production or exports or another major export can also make it difficult to liquidate a position because both oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments may be illiquid the fund’s oil interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated the large size of the positions that the fund may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to do so otc contracts that are not subject to clearing may be even less marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an exchange do not have uniform terms and conditions and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support such as collateral and in general they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty these conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely impact the fund’s ability to realize the full value of such contracts in addition even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk sudden changes in the value of otc transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party’s exposure on the transaction in such situations the fund is not actively managed and tracks the benchmark oil futures contract during periods in which the price of the benchmark oil futures contract is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising the fund is not actively managed by conventional methods accordingly if the fund’s investments in oil interests are declining in value the fund will not close out such positions except in connection with paying the proceeds to an authorized participant upon the redemption of a basket or closing out futures positions in connection with the monthly change in the benchmark oil futures contract uscf will seek to cause the nav of the fund’s shares to track the benchmark oil futures contract during periods in which its price is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect the fund the futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes regulations and margin requirements in addition the cftc and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including for example the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading regulation of commodity interest transactions in the united states is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action considerable regulatory attention has been focused on nontraditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the united states in addition various national governments outside of the united states have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general the effect of any future regulatory change on the fund is impossible to predict but it could be substantial and adverse      an investment in the fund may provide little or no diversification benefits thus in a declining market the fund may have no gains to offset losses from other investments and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in the fund while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes historically oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments have generally been noncorrelated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds noncorrelation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions on the one hand and stocks or bonds on the other hand however there can be no assurance that such noncorrelation will continue during future periods if contrary to historic patterns the fund’s performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in the fund’s shares in such a case the fund may have no gains to offset losses from other investments and investors may suffer losses on their investment in the fund at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments variables such as drought floods weather embargoes tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on crude oil prices and crude oillinked instruments including oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments than on traditional securities these additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject the fund’s investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities noncorrelation should not be confused with negative correlation where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other there is no historical evidence that the spot price of crude oil and prices of other financial assets such as stocks and bonds are negatively correlated in the absence of negative correlation the fund cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market or vice versa trading in international markets could expose the fund to credit and regulatory risk  the fund invests primarily in oil futures contracts a significant portion of which are traded on united states exchanges including the nymex however a portion of the fund’s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the united states some nonus markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their us counterparts trading on such nonus markets or exchanges presents risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their us counterparts including potentially different or diminished investor protections in trading contracts denominated in currencies other than us dollars the fund is subject to the risk of adverse exchangerate movements between the dollar and the functional currencies of such contracts additionally trading on nonus exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls expropriation increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability an adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets uscf’s limited liability agreement “llc agreement” provides limited authority to the nonmanagement directors and any director of uscf may be removed by uscf’s parent company wainwright holdings inc “wainwright” which is a wholly owned subsidiary of concierge technologies inc “concierge” a controlled public company where the majority of shares are owned by nicholas gerber along with certain other family members and certain other shareholders   uscf’s board of directors currently consists of four management directors each of whom are also executive officers or employees of uscf and three nonmanagement directors each of whom are considered independent for purposes of applicable exchange and sec rules under uscf’s llc agreement the nonmanagement directors have only such authority as the management directors expressly confer upon them which means that the nonmanagement directors may have less authority to control the actions of the management directors than is typically the case with the independent members of a company’s board of directors in addition any director may be removed by written consent of wainwright holdings inc “wainwright” which is the sole member of uscf the sole shareholder of wainwright is concierge technologies inc a company publicly traded under the ticker symbol “cncg” mr nicholas gerber along with certain family members and certain other shareholders own the majority of shares in concierge which is the sole shareholder of wainwright the sole member of uscf accordingly although uscf is governed by the uscf board of directors which consists of both management directors and nonmanagement directors pursuant to the llc agreement it is possible for mr gerber to exercise his indirect control of wainwright to effect the removal of any director including the nonmanagement directors which comprise the audit committee and to replace that director with another director having control in one person could have a negative impact on uscf and the fund including their regulatory obligations      there is a risk that the fund will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such the fund may not earn any profit   the fund is contractually obligated to pay a management fee to uscf fees to brokers subject to a cap and certain expenses regardless of whether the fund’s activities are profitable accordingly the fund must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit regulation of the commodity interests markets is extensive and constantly changing future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect the fund   the futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes regulations and margin requirements in addition the cftc and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including for example the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading regulation of commodity interest transactions in the united states is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action considerable regulatory attention has been focused on nontraditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the united states in addition various national governments outside of the united states have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the commodities markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general the effect of any future regulatory change on the fund is impossible to predict but it could be substantial and adverse the trust is not a registered investment company so shareholders do not have the protections of the  act   the trust is not an investment company subject to the  act accordingly investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute which for example requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager   the fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by primarily investing in futures contracts for light sweet crude oil that are traded on the nymex ice futures europe or other us and foreign exchanges collectively “oil futures contracts”   the fund will to a lesser extent and in view of regulatory requirements andor market conditions i next invest in a cleared swap transactions based on the benchmark oil futures contract b nonexchange traded “overthecounter” or “otc” negotiated swap contracts that are based on the benchmark oil futures contract and c forward contracts for oil       ii followed by investments in futures contracts for other types of crude oil dieselheating oil gasoline natural gas and other petroleumbased fuels each of which are traded on the nymex ice futures europe or other us and foreign exchanges as well as cleared swap transactions and otc swap contracts valued based on the foregoing and   iii finally invest in exchangetraded cash settled options on oil futures contracts       all such other investments are referred to as “other oilrelated investments” and together with oil futures contracts are “oil interests” none of the commoditybased derivatives noted above are considered to be “securities” as defined by section a of the securities act of  or under the securities exchange act of  moreover these types of commoditybased derivatives have not been interpreted as being securities under the investment company act of  by the sec in no action letters or other interpretive notices or pursuant to the jurisdictional accord between the sec and the commodity futures trading commission in addition the cash cash equivalents and treasuries are not “investment securities” for purposes of determining whether or not an entity is an investment company required to be registered under the investment company act of  as a result the fund will not be investing in securities and will not be considered an “investment company” for purposes of the investment company act of       the fund has no operating history so there is no performance history to serve as a basis for you to evaluate an investment in the fund   the fund is new and has no operating history therefore you do not have the benefit of reviewing the past performance of the fund as a basis to evaluate an investment in the fund the sponsor’s current experience involves managing the related public funds the sponsor’s results with the related public funds may not be directly applicable to the fund since the fund has a different investment objective than the related public funds the fund and uscf may have conflicts of interest which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders   the fund is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving uscf various commodity futures brokers the marketing agent and any authorized participants uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund these persons are directors officers or employees of other entities that may compete with the fund for their services they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to those other entities as a result of these and other relationships parties involved with the fund have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of the fund and the shareholders uscf has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest consequently investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably although uscf attempts to monitor these conflicts it is extremely difficult if not impossible for uscf to ensure that these conflicts do not in fact result in adverse consequences to the shareholders the fund may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to its futures commission merchant “fcm” including but not limited to conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients or purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the fcm uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund and could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to the related public funds   the fund and uscf may have inherent conflicts to the extent uscf attempts to maintain the fund’s asset size in order to preserve its fee income and this may not always be consistent with the fund’s objective of having the value of its shares’ nav track on a leveraged basis changes in the value of the benchmark oil futures contracts uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund for example uscf’s directors officers and employees act in such capacity for other entities including the related public funds that may compete with the fund for their services accordingly they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to other entities uscf has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of the fund this authority to manage the investments and operations of the fund may allow uscf to act in a way that furthers its own interests in conflict with the best interests of investors shareholders have very limited voting rights which will limit the ability to influence matters such as amending the trust agreement changing the fund’s basic investment objective dissolving the fund or selling or distributing the fund’s assets the fund and rex mlpshares llc “rex” may have conflicts of interest which may permit rex to favor its own interests to the detriment of fund shareholders rex may have conflicts of interest which may permit it to favor its own interests to the detriment of shareholders rex’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund or to rex mlpshares llc and also are directors officers or employees of other entities that may compete with the fund for their services they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to those other entities as a result of these and other relationships parties involved with rex may have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of the fund and the shareholders uscf has not established any formal procedure to resolve rex conflicts of interest consequently investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably although uscf attempts to monitor these conflicts it is extremely difficult if not impossible for uscf to ensure that these conflicts do not in fact result in adverse consequences to the fund’s shareholders      rex’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund and could have a conflict between their responsibilities to other entities rex’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the fund rather rex’s directors officers and employees act in various capacities for other entities some of which may now or in the future compete with the fund for their services accordingly rex’s officers directors and employees could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the fund and to other entities uscf has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of the fund however rex may act in a way that furthers its own interests in conflict with the best interests of investors   investors cannot be assured of rex’s continued services and discontinuance may be detrimental to the fund   investors cannot be assured that rex will be willing or able to continue to service the fund for any length of time if rex discontinues its activities on behalf of the fund the fund may be adversely affected   shareholders have only very limited voting rights and have the power to replace uscf only under specific circumstances shareholders do not participate in the management of the fund and do not control uscf so they do not have any influence over basic matters that affect the fund   shareholders have very limited voting rights with respect to the fund’s affairs and have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation including for example the right to bring “oppression” or “derivative” actions shareholders may elect a replacement sponsor only if uscf resigns voluntarily or loses its charter shareholders are not permitted to participate in the management or control of the fund or the conduct of its business shareholders must therefore rely upon the duties and judgment of uscf to manage the fund’s affairs for example the dissolution or resignation of uscf would cause the fund to terminate unless within  days of the event shareholders holding shares representing at least   of the outstanding shares of the fund elect to continue the trust and appoint a successor sponsor in addition uscf may terminate the fund if it determines that the fund’s aggregate net assets in relation to its operating expenses make the continued operation of the fund unreasonable or imprudent however no level of losses will require uscf to terminate the fund the fund’s termination would result in the liquidation of its assets and the distribution of the proceeds thereof first to creditors and then to the shareholders in accordance with their positive book capital account balances after giving effect to all contributions distributions and allocations for all periods and the fund could incur losses in liquidating its assets in connection with a termination the fund could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor’s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor’s investment portfolio   the fund could terminate at any time regardless of whether that the fund has incurred losses subject to the terms of the trust agreement in particular unforeseen circumstances including the bankruptcy dissolution or removal of uscf as the sponsor of the trust could cause the fund to terminate unless a successor is appointed in accordance with the trust agreement however no level of losses will require uscf to terminate the fund the fund’s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor’s investment termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor’s investment portfolio an unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on the fund’s nav   if a substantial number of requests for redemption of a block of  shares “redemption baskets” are received by the fund during a relatively short period of time the fund may not be able to satisfy the requests from the fund assets not committed to trading as a consequence it could be necessary to liquidate positions in the fund’s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation the fund does not expect to make cash distributions   the fund does not intend to make any cash distributions and intends to reinvest any realized gains in additional oil interests rather than distributing cash to shareholders therefore unlike mutual funds commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors the fund generally does not expect to distribute cash to shareholders an investor should not invest in the fund if the investor will need cash distributions from the fund to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of the fund if any or for any other reason nonetheless although the fund does not intend to make cash distributions the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution eg at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in oil interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax if this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made      money market reform the sec adopted rule a under the  act on july   which became effective on october   to reform money market funds “mmfs” while the new rule applies only to mmfs it may indirectly affect institutional investors such as fund the new rule requires institutional prime mmfs to price their shares using marketbased values instead of the amortized cost method ie to use a “floating net asset value per share” or “floating nav” government and retail funds can continue to use the amortized cost method to value their portfolio securities additionally liquidity fees and gates allow an mmf’s board of directors to directly address runs on a fund mmfs’ boards of directors are required to implement rules to discourage and prevent runs by investors through the use of redemption fees and gates temporary suspension of redemptions the fees and gates could be imposed on a fund whose portfolios fail to meet certain liquidity thresholds although they are optional for government mmfs the fund currently plans to invest in government mmfs as well as treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less as an investment for assets not used for margin or collateral in the futures contracts the fund does not hold any nongovernment mmfs and currently does not anticipate investing in any nongovernment mmfs the new rule further decreases the likelihood that the fund would invest in any nongovernmental mmfs however if the fund were to make investments in nongovernment mmfs in the future such investments could negatively impact the fund because of the changes to mmfs resulting from the new rule the failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker or the fund’s custodian could result in a substantial loss of the fund’s assets and could impair the fund in its ability to execute trades   under cftc regulations a clearing broker maintains customers’ assets in a bulk segregated account if a clearing broker fails to do so or even if the customers’ funds are segregated by the clearing broker but the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a substantial deficit in a customer account the clearing broker’s other customers may be subject to risk of a substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing broker’s bankruptcy in that event the clearing broker’s customers such as the fund are entitled to recover even in respect of property specifically traceable to them only a proportional share of all property available for distribution to all of that clearing broker’s customers the bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in the loss of the fund’s assets posted with the clearing broker the fund may also be subject to the risk of the failure of or delay in performance by any exchanges and markets and their clearing organizations if any on which commodity interest contracts are traded in addition to the extent the fund’s clearing broker is required to post the fund’s assets as margin to a clearinghouse the margin will be maintained in an omnibus account containing the margin of all the clearing broker’s customers if the fund’s clearing broker defaults to a clearinghouse because of a default by one of the clearing broker’s other customers or otherwise then the clearinghouse can look to all of the margin in the omnibus account including margin posted by the fund and any other nondefaulting customers of the clearing broker to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker from time to time clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business a clearing broker’s involvement in costly or timeconsuming legal proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from the clearing broker’s trading operations which could impair the clearing broker’s ability to successfully execute and clear the fund’s trades in addition the majority of the fund’s assets are held in treasuries cash andor cash equivalents with bbhco the “custodian” the insolvency of the custodian could result in a loss of the fund’s assets held by the custodian which at any given time could comprise a substantial portion of the fund’s total assets the liability of uscf and the trustee are limited under the trust agreement and the value of the shares will be adversely affected if the fund is required to indemnify the trustee or uscf   under the trust agreement the trustee and uscf are not liable and have the right to be indemnified for any liability or expense incurred absent gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the trustee or uscf or breach by uscf of the trust agreement as the case may be as a result uscf may require the assets of the fund to be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered by it or by the trustee any sale of that kind would reduce the nav of the fund and the value of its shares      although the shares of the fund are limited liability investments certain circumstances such as bankruptcy or indemnification of the fund by a shareholder will increase the shareholder’s liability   the shares of the fund are limited liability investments shareholders may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits recognized on their investment however shareholders could be required as a matter of bankruptcy law to return to the estate of the fund any distribution they received at a time when the fund was in fact insolvent or in violation of its trust agreement in addition a number of states do not have “statutory trust” statutes such as the delaware statutes under which the trust has been formed in the state of delaware it is possible that a court in such state could hold that due to the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary in such jurisdiction the shareholders although entitled under delaware law to the same limitation on personal liability as stockholders in a private corporation for profit organized under the laws of the state of delaware are not so entitled in such state finally in the event the trust or the fund is made a party to any claim dispute demand or litigation or otherwise incurs any liability or expense as a result of or in connection with any shareholder’s or assignee’s obligations or liabilities unrelated to the business of the trust or the fund as applicable such shareholder or assignees cumulatively is required under the trust agreement to indemnify the trust or the fund as applicable for all such liability and expense incurred including attorneys’ and accountants’ fees   the fund is a series of the trust and as a result a court could potentially conclude that the assets and liabilities of the fund are not segregated from those of another series of the trust thereby potentially exposing assets in the fund to the liabilities of another series of the trust   the fund is a series of a delaware statutory trust and not itself a separate legal entity the delaware statutory trust act provides that if certain provisions are included in the formation and governing documents of a statutory trust organized in series and if separate and distinct records are maintained for any series and the assets associated with that series are held in separate and distinct records and are accounted for in such separate and distinct records separately from the other assets of the statutory trust or any series thereof then the debts liabilities obligations and expenses incurred by a particular series are enforceable against the assets of such series only and not against the assets of the statutory trust generally or any other series thereof conversely none of the debts liabilities obligations and expenses incurred with respect to any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series uscf is not aware of any court case that has interpreted this interseries limitation on liability or provided any guidance as to what is required for compliance uscf intends to maintain separate and distinct records for the fund and account for the fund separately from any other series of the trust but it is possible a court could conclude that the methods used do not satisfy the delaware statutory trust act which would potentially expose assets in one series to the liabilities of another series of the trust uscf and the trustee are not obligated to prosecute any action suit or other proceeding in respect of the fund property   neither uscf nor the trustee is obligated to although each may in its respective discretion prosecute any action suit or other proceeding in respect of the fund property the trust agreement does not confer upon shareholders the right to prosecute any such action suit or other proceeding third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that uscf has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights which may result in significant costs and diverted attention   it is possible that third parties might utilize the fund’s intellectual property or technology including the use of its business methods trademarks and trading program software without permission uscf has a patent for the fund’s business method and has registered its trademarks the fund does not currently have any proprietary software however if it obtains proprietary software in the future any unauthorized use of the fund’s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage the fund may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents trademarks proprietary software and other technology also third parties may independently develop business methods trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of uscf or claim that uscf has violated their intellectual property rights including their copyrights trademark rights trade names trade secrets and patent rights as a result uscf may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets determine the validity and scope of other parties’ proprietary rights defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties’ rights or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid any litigation of this type even if uscf is successful and regardless of the merits may result in significant costs divert its resources from the fund or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements      due to the increased use of technologies intentional and unintentional cyberattacks pose operational and information security risks   with the increased use of technologies such as the internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions the fund is susceptible to operational and information security risks in general cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events cyberattacks include but are not limited to gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as causing denialofservice attacks on websites cyber security failures or breaches of the fund’s clearing broker or third party service provider including but not limited to index providers the administrator and transfer agent the custodian have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations potentially resulting in financial losses the inability of fund shareholders to transact business violations of applicable privacy and other laws regulatory fines penalties reputational damage reimbursement or other compensation costs andor additional compliance costs in addition substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future the fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result while the fund has established business continuity plans there are inherent limitations in such plans   additional information about the fund its investment objective and investments the fund is a series of the trust the trust operates pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated declaration of trust and trust agreement dated as of june   “trust agreement” which grants full management control of the fund to uscf the fund maintains its main business office at  harrison street suite  oakland california  the fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by primarily investing in futures contracts for light sweet crude oil that are traded on the nymex ice futures europe or other us and foreign exchanges collectively “oil futures contracts”   the fund will to a lesser extent and in view of regulatory requirements andor market conditions   i next invest in a cleared swap transactions based on the benchmark oil futures contract b nonexchange traded “overthecounter” or “otc” negotiated swap contracts that are based on the benchmark oil futures contract and c forward contracts for oil   ii followed by investments in futures contracts for other types of crude oil dieselheating oil gasoline natural gas and other petroleumbased fuels each of which are traded on the nymex ice futures europe or other us and foreign exchanges as well as cleared swap transactions and otc swap contracts valued based on the foregoing and   iii finally invest in exchangetraded cash settled options on oil futures contracts       all such other investments are referred to as “other oilrelated investments” and together with oil futures contracts are “oil interests” for the fund to maintain a consistent  return versus the benchmark oil futures contract the fund’s holdings must be rebalanced on a daily basis by buying additional oil interests or selling oil interests that it holds such rebalancing will occur generally before or at the close of trading of the shares on the exchange at or as near as possible to that day’s settlement price and will be disclosed on the fund’s website as pending trades before the opening of trading on the exchange the next business day and will be taken into account in the fund’s intraday indicative fund value and reflected in the fund’s end of day nav on that business day  the fund anticipates that to the extent it invests in oil futures contracts other than the benchmark oil futures contract or other oilrelated investments it will invest in futures cleared and noncleared swaps and call and put options to hedge the shortterm price movements of such oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments against the price movements of the current benchmark oil futures contract for example if the fund invested in dieselheating oil futures contracts it may also enter into a swap or forward contract that is valued based on the difference between the dieselheating oil futures contract and the benchmark oil futures contract so that the investment in the dieselheating oil futures contracts together with such swap would provide a return that more closely matches the movements in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract the daily holdings of the fund are available on the fund’s website at httpwwwuscfinvestmentscom      the fund invests in oil interests to the fullest extent possible without being unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in oil interests in pursuing this objective the primary focus of uscf is the investment in futures contracts and the management of the fund’s investments in treasuries cash andor cash equivalents for margining purposes and as collateral the fund seeks to invest in a combination of oil interests such that the daily changes in its nav measured in percentage terms will track three times x the daily changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract also measured in percentage terms as a specific benchmark uscf endeavors to place the fund’s trades in oil interests and otherwise manage the fund’s investments so that the difference between “a” and “b” will be plusminus  percent  of “b” where     •   a is the average daily percentage change in the fund’s per share nav for any period of thirty  successive valuation days ie  any nyse trading day as of which the fund calculates its per share nav and     •   b is three times the average daily percentage change in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract over the same period            uscf believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily change in the fund’s share price on the nyse exchange on a percentage basis to closely track the daily changes in the fund’s per share nav on a percentage basis uscf further believes that the daily changes in the fund’s nav in percentage terms will track three times x the daily changes in percentage terms in the benchmark oil futures contract less the fund’s expenses the fund will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day  the pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that the return of the fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to  of the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for such longer period because the aggregate return of the fund is the product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns during periods of market volatility the volatility of the benchmark oil futures contract may affect the fund’s return as much as or more than the return of the benchmark oil futures contract further the return for investors that invest for periods less than a full trading day or for a period different than a trading day will not be the product of the return of the fund’s stated investment objective and the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract for the full trading day additionally investors should be aware that the fund’s investment objective is not for its nav or market price of shares to equal in dollar terms the spot price of light sweet crude oil natural market forces called contango and backwardation can impact the total return on an investment in the fund’s shares relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and in the future it is likely that the relationship between the market price of the fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation it is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil which could be substantial   the fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently the fund is not intended to be used by and is not appropriate for investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios    the fund’s “neutral” investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell the fund’s shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in crude oil in a costeffective manner andor to permit participants in the oil or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their crude oilrelated transactions accordingly depending on the investment objective of an individual investor the risks generally associated with investing in crude oil andor the risks involved in hedging may exist in addition an investment in the fund involves the risk that the daily changes in the price of the fund’s shares in percentage terms will not accurately track the daily changes in the benchmark oil futures contract on a leveraged basis in percentage terms and that daily changes in the benchmark oil futures contract in percentage terms will not closely correlate with daily changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil in percentage terms impact of contango and backwardation on total returns several factors determine the total return from investing in futures contracts one factor arises from “rolling” futures contracts that will expire at the end of the current month the “near” or “front” month contract forward each month prior to expiration for a strategy that entails holding the near month contract the price relationship between that futures contract and the next month futures contract will impact returns for example if the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the next futures month contract a situation referred to as “backwardation” then absent any other change the price of a next month futures contract tends to rise in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration conversely if the price of a near month futures contract is lower than the next month futures contract a situation referred to as “contango” then absent any other change the price of a next month futures contract tends to decline in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration      contango and backwardation are natural market forces that can impact the total return on an investment in the fund’s shares relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil in the future it is likely that the relationship between the market price of the fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil will continue to be impacted by contango and backwardation it is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil which could be substantial as an example assume that the price of crude oil for immediate delivery the “spot” price was  per barrel and the value of a position in the near month futures contract was also  over time the price of the barrel of crude oil will fluctuate based on a number of market factors including demand for oil relative to its supply the value of the near month contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors if investors seek to maintain their position in a near month contract and not take delivery of the oil every month they must sell their current near month contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month contract if the futures market is in backwardation eg when the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the next month futures contract the investor would buy a next month futures contract for a lower price than the current near month futures contract assuming the price of the next month futures contract was  per barrel or  cheaper than the  near month futures contract then hypothetically and assuming no other changes eg to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship between the spot price the near month contract and the next month contract and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash andor cash equivalents the value of the  next month futures contract would rise to  as it approaches expiration in this example the value of an investment in the next month futures contract would tend to outperform the spot price of crude oil as a result it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise  while the spot price of crude oil may have risen a lower amount eg only  similarly the spot price of crude oil could have fallen  while the value of an investment in the futures contract might have fallen another amount eg only  over time if backwardation remained constant this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase if the futures market is in contango an investor would be buying a next month futures contract for a higher price than the current near month futures contract again assuming the near month futures contract is  per barrel the price of the next month futures contract might be  per barrel or  more expensive than the front month futures contract hypothetically and assuming no other changes the value of the  next month futures contract would fall to  as it approaches expiration in this example the value of an investment in the second month would tend to underperform the spot price of crude oil as a result it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise only  while the spot price of crude oil may have risen a higher amount eg  similarly the spot price of crude oil could have fallen  while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract might have fallen another amount eg  over time if contango remained constant this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase historically the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation with backwardation being in place roughly as often as contango since oil futures trading started in  following the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter of  the crude oil market moved into contango and remained in contango for a period of several years during parts of  the level of contango was unusually steep as a combination of slack us and global demand for crude oil and issues involving the physical transportation and storage of crude oil at cushing oklahoma the primary pricing point for oil traded in the us led to unusually high inventories of crude oil a combination of improved transportation and storage capacity along with growing demand for crude oil globally moderated the inventory buildup and lead to reduced levels of contango by  however at the end of november  global crude oil inventories grew rapidly after opec decided to defend its market share against us shaleoil producers resulting in another period during which the crude oil market remained primarily in contango sometimes steep contango this period of contango continued through december   in addition the crude oil markets are expected to remain in contango until us and global oil inventories decline significantly if opec’s recent cuts in oil production have their intended effect on the crude oil market then such a decline may occur in  periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact the fund’s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share nav track on a leveraged basis the daily percentage changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to proportionally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both the fund’s shares and the benchmark oil futures contract it is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future it is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods      trading methodology in managing the fund’s assets uscf does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders uscf instead employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a creation basket is sold uscf purchases oil interests such as the benchmark oil futures contract that have an aggregate market value that approximates three times x the amount of treasuries andor cash received upon the issuance of the creation basket as of the nav calculation time each trading day the fund will also seek to position its portfolio so that its exposure to the benchmark oil futures contract is consistent with its investment objective to provide investment results that correspond before fees and expenses to three times x the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract the specific oil futures contracts purchased depend on various factors including a judgment by uscf as to the appropriate diversification of the fund’s investments in futures contracts with respect to the month of expiration and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts while uscf has made significant investments in nymex oil futures contracts for various reasons including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market position limits or other regulatory requirements limiting the fund’s holdings and market conditions it may invest in oil futures contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in other oilrelated investments to the extent that the fund invests in other oilrelated investments it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the benchmark oil futures contract including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria and then to a lesser extent it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts instruments and noncleared swaps such as swaps in the overthecounter market or commonly referred to as the “otc market” if the fund is required by law or regulation or by one of its regulators including a futures exchange to reduce its position in the benchmark oil futures contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in other oilrelated investments a substantial portion of the fund’s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in other oilrelated investments that are intended to replicate the return on the benchmark oil futures contract as the fund’s assets reach higher levels it is more likely to exceed position limits accountability levels or other regulatory limits and as a result it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in other oilrelated investments at such higher levels in addition market conditions that uscf currently anticipates could cause the fund to invest in other oilrelated investments include those allowing the fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing see “risk factors involved with an investment in the fund” for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on the fund’s ability to invest in otc transactions and cleared swaps uscf may not be able to fully invest the fund’s assets in benchmark oil futures contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to three times x the fund’s nav for example as standardized contracts the benchmark oil futures contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity and the fund’s nav and the proceeds from the sale of a creation basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts as a result in such circumstances the fund may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the benchmark oil futures contract through the use of other oilrelated investments such as otc contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund anticipates that to the extent it invests in oil futures contracts other than contracts on light sweet crude oil such as futures contracts for dieselheating oil natural gas and other petroleumbased fuels and other oilrelated investments it will enter into various nonexchangetraded derivative contracts to hedge the shortterm price movements of such oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments against the current benchmark oil futures contract uscf does not anticipate letting the fund’s oil futures contracts expire and taking or making delivery of the underlying commodity instead uscf will close existing positions eg  when it changes the benchmark oil futures contracts or other oilrelated investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new oil futures contracts or other oilrelated investments positions may also be closed out to meet orders for redemption baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested      the benchmark oil futures contract is changed from the near month contract to the next month contract over a fourday period each month the benchmark oil futures contract changes starting at the end of the day on the date two weeks prior to expiration of the near month contract for that month during the first three days of the period the applicable value of the benchmark oil futures contract is based on a combination of the near month contract and the next month contract as follows  day  consists of  of the then near month contract’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract divided by  of the near month contract’s prior day’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract  day  consists of  of the then near month contract’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract divided by  of the near month contract’s prior day’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract and  day  consists of  of the then near month contract’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract divided by  of the near month contract’s prior day’s price plus  of the price of the next month contract on day  the benchmark oil futures contract is the next month contract to expire at that time and that contract remains the benchmark oil futures contract until the beginning of the following month’s change in the benchmark oil futures contract over a fourday period on each day during the fourday period uscf anticipates it will “roll” the fund’s positions in oil interests by closing or selling a percentage of the fund’s positions in oil interests and reinvesting the proceeds from closing those positions in new oil interests that reflect the change in the benchmark oil futures contract the anticipated dates that the monthly fourday roll period will commence are posted on the fund’s website at wwwuscfinvestmentscom and are subject to change without notice by remaining invested as fully as possible in oil futures contracts or other oilrelated investments uscf believes that the daily changes in percentage terms of the fund’s nav will continue to closely track on a leveraged basis the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract uscf believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price of the shares traded on the nyse closely tracking the nav of the fund additionally oil futures contracts traded on the nymex have closely tracked the spot price of light sweet crude oil based on these expected interrelationships uscf believes that the changes in the price of the fund’s shares as traded on the nyse will closely track on a daily basis the changes in the spot price of light sweet crude oil on a percentage basis what are the trading policies of the fund   investment objectives the fund seeks on a daily basis to provide investment results that correspond before fees and expenses to three times x the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund does not seek to achieve its stated objective over a period greater than a single day because the fund seeks investment results for a single day only as measured from the time the fund calculates its nav to the time of the fund’s next nav calculation and on a leveraged basis the fund is different from most exchangetraded funds   as of the nav calculation time each trading day the fund will seek to position its portfolio so that its exposure to the benchmark oil futures contract is consistent with its investment objective the impact of a benchmark oil futures contract’s movements during the day will affect whether the fund’s portfolio needs to be rebalanced for example the fund’s long exposure will need to be increased on days when the benchmark oil futures contract rises and decreased on days the benchmark oil futures contract falls daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time means that the return of the fund for a period longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period which will very likely differ from three times x the return of the benchmark oil futures contract for the period the fund may lose money if the benchmark oil futures contract’s performance is flat over time and it is possible for a fund to lose money over time regardless of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract as a result of daily rebalancing the benchmark oil futures contract’s volatility and compounding there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective or avoid substantial losses the fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than a single day because mathematical compounding prevents the fund from achieving such results results for the fund over periods of time greater than a single day should not be expected to be a simple multiple x of the period return of the benchmark oil futures contract and will likely differ significantly from such the fund may lose money if the benchmark oil futures contract’s performance is flat over time and it is possible for the fund to lose money over time regardless of the performance of the benchmark oil futures contract as a result of daily rebalancing the benchmark oil futures contract’s volatility and compounding daily compounding of the fund’s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longerterm performance during periods of high volatility volatility may be at least as important to the fund’s return for a period as the return of the benchmark oil futures contract liquidity   the fund invests only in oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments that in the opinion of uscf are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in other oilrelated investments that in the opinion of uscf may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of the fund      spot commodities   while the crude oil futures contracts traded can be physically settled the fund does not intend to take or make physical delivery the fund may from time to time trade in other oilrelated investments including contracts based on the spot price of crude oil leverage   uscf endeavors to have the aggregate market value of its obligations under its oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments equal to three times x the fund’s total net assets commodity pools’ trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract’s or other commodity interest’s entire market value borrowings   borrowings are not expected to be used by the fund unless the fund is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery if the fund trades in cash commodities or for shortterm needs created by unexpected redemptions otc derivatives including spreads and straddles   in addition to oil futures contracts there are also a number of listed options on the oil futures contracts on the principal futures exchanges these contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the crude oil market consequently the fund may purchase options on crude oil futures contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective in addition to the oil futures contracts and options on the oil futures contracts there also exists an active nonexchangetraded market in derivatives tied to crude oil these derivatives transactions also known as otc contracts are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts unlike most of the exchangetraded oil futures contracts or exchangetraded options on the oil futures contracts each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party ie  the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract to reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts the fund will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the master agreement published by the international swaps and derivatives association inc “isda” that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty uscf assesses or reviews as appropriate the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an otc contract pursuant to guidelines approved by uscf’s board the fund may enter into certain transactions where an otc component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract an “exchange for related position” or “efrp transaction” in the most common type of efrp transaction entered into by the fund the otc component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of the fund shares these efrp transactions may expose the fund to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the otc component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract generally the counterparty risk from the efrp transaction will exist only on the day of execution the fund may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking on a leveraged basis the price of the benchmark oil futures contract the fund would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset but with different delivery months the fund does not anticipate engaging in trading in futures contracts listed on a foreign exchange forward contracts or options on such contracts but it may do so as outlined in the fund’s listing exemptive order or as permitted under current regulations      pyramiding   uscf has not employed and will not employ the technique commonly known as pyramiding in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest   prior performance of the fund and the related public funds   none of the related pubic funds listed below use leverage     performance of the fund this pool has not commenced trading and

liability damage cost or expense was not the result of negligence or misconduct and such liability or loss was not the result of negligence or misconduct by uscf and such indemnification or agreement to hold harmless is recoverable only out of the assets of the fund provisions of federal and state securities laws   this offering is made pursuant to federal and state securities laws the sec and state securities agencies take the position that indemnification of uscf that arises out of an alleged violation of such laws is prohibited unless certain conditions are met   these conditions require that no indemnification of uscf or any underwriter for the fund may be made in respect of any losses liabilities or expenses arising from or out of an alleged violation of federal or state securities laws unless i there has been a successful adjudication on the merits of each count involving alleged securities law violations as to the party seeking indemnification and the court approves the indemnification ii such claim has been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction as to the party seeking indemnification or iii a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims against the party seeking indemnification and finds that indemnification of the settlement and related costs should be made provided that before seeking such approval uscf or other indemnitee must apprise the court of the position held by regulatory agencies against such indemnification these agencies are the sec and the securities administrator of the state or states in which the plaintiffs claim they were offered or sold interests provisions of the  act and nasaa guidelines   insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the  act may be permitted to uscf or its directors officers or persons controlling the trust and the fund the trust has been informed that the sec and the various state administrators believe that such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the  act and the north american securities administrators association inc “nasaa” commodity pool guidelines and is therefore unenforceable

 such financial statements were included herein in reliance upon the report of spicer jeffries llp dated june   given on its authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing us federal income tax considerations   the following discussion summarizes certain us federal income tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of shares of the fund and the us federal income tax treatment of the fund as of the date hereof in general this discussion is applicable to a shareholder who holds its shares as a capital asset this summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to an investment in shares for example we have not described tax consequences that may be relevant to certain types of shareholders subject to special treatment under us federal income tax laws including dealers or traders in securities commodities or currencies financial institutions taxexempt entities insurance companies persons holding shares as a part of a position in a “straddle” or as part of a “hedging” “conversion” or other integrated transaction for us federal income tax purposes or holders of shares whose “functional currency” is not the us dollar furthermore the discussion below is based upon the provisions of the code and regulations “treasury regulations” rulings and judicial decisions thereunder as of the date hereof and such authorities may be repealed revoked or modified possibly with retroactive effect so as to result in us federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below      as used herein the term “us shareholder” means a shareholder that is for us federal income tax purposes i a citizen or resident of the united states ii a corporation or partnership created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or any state thereof or the district of columbia iii an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source or iv a trust x that is subject to the supervision of a court within the united states and the control of one or more united states persons as described in section a of the code or y that has a valid election in effect under applicable treasury regulations to be treated as a united states person a “nonus shareholder” is a holder that is not a us shareholder if a partnership holds our shares the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership if you are a partner of a partnership holding our shares you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences uscf has received the opinion of eversheds sutherland us llp counsel to the trust that subject to the conditions limitations and assumptions stated in this discussion the material us federal income tax consequences to the fund and to us shareholders and nonus shareholders as defined below will be as described in the following paragraphs in rendering its opinion eversheds sutherland us llp has relied on the facts and assumptions described in this prospectus as well as certain factual representations made by the trust and uscf this opinion is not binding on the irs no ruling has been requested from the irs with respect to any matter affecting the fund or prospective investors and the irs may disagree with the tax positions taken by the trust if the irs were to challenge the trust’s tax positions in litigation they might not be sustained by the courts each prospective investor is advised to consult its own tax advisor regarding the us federal income tax consequences of an investment in shares as well as any applicable state local or foreign tax consequences in light of its particular circumstances tax status of the trust and the fund   the trust is organized and operated as a statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of the trust agreement and applicable delaware law notwithstanding the trust’s status as a statutory trust and the fund’s status as a series of that trust due to the nature of its activities the fund will be treated as a partnership rather than a trust for us federal income tax purposes in addition the trading of shares on nyse will cause the fund to be classified as a “publicly traded partnership” for us federal income tax purposes under the code a publicly traded partnership is generally taxable as a corporation in the case of an entity such as the fund that is not registered under the investment company act of  however an exception to this general rule applies if at least  of the entity’s gross income is “qualifying income” for each taxable year of its existence for this purpose “qualifying income” is defined as including in pertinent part interest other than from a financial business dividends and gains from the sale or disposition of capital assets held for the production of interest or dividends in addition qualifying income includes any income that would satisfy the requirements of code section b which includes dividends interest gains from the sale of stock or securities net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership and other income including but not limited to gains from option futures or forward contraction derived with respect to its business of investment in securities further in the case of a partnership a principal activity of which is the buying and selling of commodities other than as inventory or of futures forwards and options with respect to commodities “qualifying income” includes income and gains from commodities and futures forwards options and swaps and other notional principal contracts with respect to commodities in connection with the opinion provided by eversheds sutherland us llp the trust and uscf have represented among other things the following to eversheds sutherland us llp     •   at least  of the fund’s gross income for each taxable year will be derived from i income and gains from commodities not held as inventory or futures forwards options swaps and other notional principal contracts with respect to commodities and ii interest income     •   the fund is organized and will be operated in accordance with its governing documents and applicable law and     •   the fund has not elected and the fund will not elect to be classified as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes      based in part on these representations eversheds sutherland us llp is of the opinion that the fund will be classified as a partnership that it is not taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes the fund’s taxation as a partnership rather than a corporation will require uscf to conduct the fund’s business activities in such a manner that it satisfies the qualifying income exception on a continuing basis no assurance can be given that the fund’s operations for any given year will produce income that satisfies the requirements of the qualifying income exception eversheds sutherland us llp will not review the fund’s ongoing compliance with these requirements and will have no obligation to advise the trust the fund or the fund’s shareholders in the event of any subsequent change in the facts representations or applicable law relied upon in reaching its opinion if the fund failed to satisfy the qualifying income exception in any year other than a failure that is determined by the irs to be inadvertent and that is cured within a reasonable time after discovery in which case the fund could be required to pay over amounts determined by the irs the fund would be taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes and would pay us federal income tax on its income at regular corporate rates in that event shareholders of the fund would not report their share of the fund’s income or loss on their returns in addition any distributions to shareholders would be treated as ordinary dividends to the extent of the fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits subject to holding period and other requirements any such dividend would be a qualifying dividend subject to us federal income tax at the lower maximum tax rates applicable to longterm capital gains to the extent a distribution exceeded the fund’s earnings and profits it would be treated as a return of capital up to the amount of a shareholder’s basis in its shares and thereafter as gain from the sale of shares accordingly if the fund were to be taxable as a corporation it would likely have a material adverse effect on the economic return from an investment in the fund and on the value of the shares the remainder of this summary assumes that the fund is classified for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership that it is not taxable as a corporation us shareholders   tax consequences of ownership of shares   taxation of the fund’s income no us federal income tax is paid by the fund on its income instead the fund files annual partnership returns and each us shareholder is required to report on its us federal income tax return its allocable share of the fund’s income gain loss deduction and credit reported on the fund’s partnership return these items must be reported without regard to the amount if any of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from the fund during the taxable year as a result if for example the fund recognizes ordinary income in the form of interest on treasuries and other investments and net capital gain from oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments for a taxable year shareholders must report their share of these items regardless of whether the fund makes any distributions to shareholders consequently a shareholder may be taxed on income or gain recognized by the fund but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the resulting tax liability or a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability because uscf currently does not intend to make distributions it is likely that a us shareholder that is allocated income or gain from the fund will be required to pay taxes on its allocable share of such income or gain from sources other than the fund distributions monthly conventions for allocations of the fund’s profit and loss and capital account restatement under code section  the determination of a partner’s distributive share of any item of income gain loss deduction or credit is governed by the applicable organizational document unless the allocation provided by such document lacks “substantial economic effect” an allocation that lacks substantial economic effect nonetheless will be respected if it is in accordance with the partners’ interests in the partnership determined by taking into account all facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangements among the partners subject to the discussion below concerning certain conventions to be used by the fund allocations of the fund income pursuant to the trust agreement should be considered as having substantial economic effect or as being in accordance with a shareholder’s interest in the fund in situations where a partner’s interest in a partnership is sold or otherwise transferred during a taxable year the code generally requires that partnership tax items for the year be allocated to the partner using either an interim closing of the books or a daily proration method the fund intends to allocate tax items using an interim closing of the books method under which income gain loss deductions and credits will be determined on a monthly “marktomarket” basis taking into account the fund’s accrued income and deductions and gains and losses both realized and unrealized for the month the tax items for each month during the taxable year will then be allocated among the holders of shares in proportion to the number of shares owned by them as of the close of business on the last trading day of the previous month the “monthly allocation convention”      under the monthly allocation convention if an investor who held a share as of the close of business on the last trading day of the previous month disposes of a share during the current month such investor will be treated for purposes of making allocations as if it owned the share throughout the current month for example an investor who buys a share on april  of a year and sells it on may  of the same year will be allocated all of the tax items attributable to may because he is deemed to hold it through the last day of may but will not be allocated any of the tax items attributable to april the tax items attributable to that share for april will be allocated to the person who is the actual or deemed holder of the share as of the close of business on the last trading day of march under the monthly convention an investor who purchases and sells a share during the same month and therefore does not hold and is not deemed to hold the share at the close of business on the last trading day of either that month or the previous month will receive no allocations with respect to that share for any period accordingly investors may receive no allocations with respect to shares that they actually held or may receive allocations with respect to shares attributable to periods that they did not actually hold the shares investors who hold a share on the last trading day of the first month of the fund’s operation will be allocated the tax items for that month as well as the tax items for the following month attributable to the share by investing in shares a us shareholder agrees that in the absence of new legislation regulatory or administrative guidance or judicial rulings to the contrary it will file its us income tax returns in a manner that is consistent with the monthly allocation convention as described above and with the irs schedule k or any successor form provided to shareholders by the trust in addition for any month in which a creation basket is issued or a redemption basket is redeemed the fund generally will credit or debit the “book” capital accounts of its existing shareholders with any unrealized gain or loss on the fund’s assets for this purpose unrealized gain or loss will be computed based on the lowest fair market value of the fund’s assets during the month in which shares are issued or redeemed which may be different than the value of the assets at the time of an issuance or redemption the capital accounts as adjusted in this manner will be used in making tax allocations intended to account for the differences between the tax basis and fair market value of assets of the fund at the time new shares are issued or outstanding shares are redeemed socalled “reverse code section c allocations” the intended effect of these adjustments is to equitably allocate among shareholders any unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the fund’s assets existing at the time of a contribution or redemption for book and tax purposes uscf believes that application of the conventions described above is consistent with the intent of the partnership provisions of the code and applicable treasury regulations and that the resulting allocations should have substantial economic effect or otherwise should be respected as being in accordance with shareholders’ interests in the fund for us federal income tax purposes the code and existing treasury regulations do not expressly permit adoption of these conventions although the monthly allocation convention described above is consistent with methods permitted under the applicable treasury regulations as well as the legislative history for the provisions that requires allocations to appropriately reflect changes in ownership interests it is possible that the irs could successfully challenge the fund’s allocation conventions on the ground that they do not satisfy the technical requirements of the code or treasury regulations requiring a shareholder to report a greater or lesser share of items of income gain loss deduction or credit than if our conventions were respected uscf is authorized to revise our allocation method to conform to the requirements of future treasury regulations the conventions used by the fund in making tax allocations may cause a shareholder to be allocated more or less income or loss for us federal income tax purposes than its proportionate share of the economic income or loss realized by the fund during the period it held its shares this mismatch between taxable and economic income or loss in some cases may be temporary reversing itself in a later period when the shares are sold but could be permanent section  election the fund intends to make the election permitted by section  of the code which election is irrevocable without the consent of the irs the effect of this election is that when a secondary market sale of shares occurs the fund adjusts the purchaser’s proportionate share of the tax basis of its assets to fair market value as reflected in the price paid for the shares as if the purchaser had directly acquired an interest in the fund’s assets the section  election is intended to eliminate disparities between a partner’s basis in its partnership interest and its share of the tax bases of the partnership’s assets so that the partner’s allocable share of taxable gain or loss on a disposition of an asset will correspond to its share of the appreciation or depreciation in the value of the asset since it acquired its interest depending on the price paid for shares and the tax bases of the fund’s assets at the time of the purchase the effect of the section  election on a purchaser of shares may be favorable or unfavorable in order to make the appropriate basis adjustments in a cost effective manner the fund will perform only one basis adjustment per month using the lowest closing price for fund shares during that month regardless of the price a purchaser actually paid for the shares as a result the basis adjustments made with respect to a purchaser in accordance with the section  election may not conform to the price such purchaser paid for its shares which may result in the purchaser being allocated additional gain or loss from the fund compared to the gain or loss that would be allocated to such purchaser if the actual price of the acquired shares was used to perform the adjustment it is possible the irs will successfully assert that the conventions and assumptions applied are improper and require different basis adjustments to be made which could adversely affect some shareholders      section  contracts for us federal income tax purposes the fund generally is required to us a “marktomarket” method of accounting under which unrealized gains and losses instruments constituting “section  contracts” are recognized currently a section  contract is defined as including in relevant part  a futures contract that is traded on or subject to the rules of a national securities exchange which is registered with the sec a domestic board of trade designated as a contract market by the cftc or any other board of trade or exchange designated by the secretary of the treasury and with respect to which the amount required to be deposited and the amount that may be withdrawn depends on a system of “marking to market”  a forward contract on exchangetraded foreign currencies where the contracts are traded in the interbank market  a nonequity option traded on or subject to the rules of a qualified board or exchange  a dealer equity option or  a dealer securities futures contract section  contracts held at the end of each taxable year are treated as if they were sold for their fair market value on the last business day of the taxable year ie are “marked to market” in addition any gain or loss realized from a disposition termination or markingtomarket of a section  contract generally is treated as longterm capital gain or loss to the extent of  thereof and as shortterm capital gain or loss to the extent of  thereof without regard to the actual holding period “ –  treatment” many of the fund’s oil futures contracts and some of its other oilrelated investments will qualify as “section  contracts” under the code gain or loss recognized through disposition termination or markingto market of the fund’s section  contracts will be subject to  –  treatment and allocated to shareholders in accordance with the monthly allocation convention cleared swaps and other commodity swaps will most likely not qualify as section  contracts if a commodity swap is not treated as a section  contract any gain or loss on the swap recognized at the time of disposition or termination will be longterm or shortterm capital gain or loss depending on the holding period of the swap limitations on deductibility of losses and certain expenses a number of different provisions of the code may defer or disallow the deduction of losses or expenses allocated to shareholders by the fund including but not limited to those described below a shareholder’s deduction of its allocable share of any loss of the fund is limited to the lesser of  the tax basis in its shares or  in the case of a shareholder that is an individual or a closely held corporation the amount which the shareholder is considered to have “at risk” with respect to the fund’s activities in general the amount at risk will be a shareholder’s invested capital losses in excess of the lesser of tax basis or the amount at risk must be deferred until years in which the fund generates additional taxable income against which to offset such carryover losses or until additional capital is placed at risk noncorporate taxpayers are permitted to deduct capital losses only to the extent of their capital gains for the taxable year plus  of other income unused capital losses can be carried forward and used to offset capital gains in future years in addition a noncorporate taxpayer may elect to carry back net losses on section  contracts to each of the three preceding years and use them to offset section  contract gains in those years subject to certain limitations corporate taxpayers generally may deduct capital losses only to the extent of capital gains subject to special carryback and carryforward rules otherwise deductible expenses incurred by noncorporate taxpayers constituting “miscellaneous itemized deductions” generally including investmentrelated expenses other than interest and certain other specified expenses are deductible only to the extent they exceed  of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income for the year although the matter is not free from doubt we believe the management fees that the fund pays to uscf and other expenses of the fund constitute investmentrelated expenses subject to the miscellaneous itemized deduction limitation rather than expenses incurred in connection with a trade or business and will report these expenses consistent with that interpretation the code imposes additional limitations on the amount of certain itemized deductions allowable to individuals with adjusted gross income in excess of certain amounts by reducing the otherwise allowable portion of such deductions by an amount equal to the lesser of     •    of the individual’s adjusted gross income in excess of certain threshold amounts or     •    of the amount of certain itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the taxable year         noncorporate shareholders generally may deduct “investment interest expense” only to the extent of their “net investment income” investment interest expense of a shareholder will generally include any interest accrued by the fund and any interest paid or accrued on direct borrowings by a shareholder to purchase or carry its shares such as interest with respect to a margin account net investment income generally includes gross income from property held for investment including “portfolio income” under the passive loss rules but not absent an election longterm capital gains or certain qualifying dividend income less deductible expenses other than interest directly connected with the production of investment income      to the extent that the fund allocates losses or expenses to you that must be deferred or disallowed as a result of these or other limitations in the code you may be taxed on income in excess of your economic income or distributions if any on your shares as one example you could be allocated and required to pay tax on your share of interest income accrued by the fund for a particular taxable year and in the same year allocated a share of a capital loss that you cannot deduct currently because of the limitations discussed above as another example you could be allocated and required to pay tax on your share of interest income and capital gain for a year but be unable to deduct some or all of your share of management fees andor margin account interest incurred by you with respect to your shares shareholders are urged to consult their own professional tax advisors regarding the effect of limitations under the code on their ability to deduct their allocable share of the fund’s losses and expenses tax basis of shares   a shareholder’s tax basis in its shares is important in determining  the amount of taxable gain it will realize on the sale or other disposition of its shares  the amount of nontaxable distributions that it may receive from the fund and  its ability to utilize its distributive share of any losses of the fund on its tax return a shareholder’s initial tax basis of its shares will equal its cost for the shares plus its share of the fund’s liabilities if any at the time of purchase in general a shareholder’s “share” of those liabilities will equal the sum of i the entire amount of any otherwise nonrecourse liability of the fund as to which the shareholder or an affiliate is the creditor a “partner nonrecourse liability” and ii a pro rata share of any nonrecourse liabilities of the fund that are not partner nonrecourse liabilities as to any shareholder a shareholder’s tax basis in its shares generally will be  increased by a its allocable share of the fund’s taxable income and gain and b any additional contributions by the shareholder to the fund and  decreased but not below zero by a its allocable share of the fund’s tax deductions and losses and b any distributions by the fund to the shareholder for this purpose an increase in a shareholder’s share of the fund’s liabilities will be treated as a contribution of cash by the shareholder to the fund and a decrease in that share will be treated as a distribution of cash by the fund to the shareholder pursuant to certain irs rulings a shareholder will be required to maintain a single “unified” basis in all shares that it owns as a result when a shareholder that acquired its shares at different prices sells less than all of its shares such shareholder will not be entitled to specify particular shares  eg  those with a higher basis as having been sold rather it must determine its gain or loss on the sale by using an “equitable apportionment” method to allocate a portion of its unified basis in its shares to the shares sold treatment of the fund distributions if the fund makes nonliquidating distributions to shareholders such distributions generally will not be taxable to the shareholders for us federal income tax purposes except to the extent that the sum of i the amount of cash and ii the fair market value subject to certain exceptions and adjustments of marketable securities distributed exceeds the shareholder’s adjusted basis of its interest in the fund immediately before the distribution any cash distributions in excess of a shareholder’s tax basis generally will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of shares constructive termination of the partnership the fund will be considered to have been terminated for us federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of  or more of the total interests in its shares within a month period a termination would result in the closing of the fund’s taxable year for all shareholders in the case of a shareholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending december  the closing of the fund’s taxable year may result in more than  months of our taxable income or loss being includable in its taxable income for the year of termination we would be required to make new tax elections after a termination a termination could result in tax penalties for the shareholders if we were unable to determine that the termination had occurred moreover a termination might either accelerate the application of or subject us to any tax legislation enacted before the termination tax consequences of disposition of shares   if a shareholder sells its shares it will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and its adjusted tax basis for the shares sold a shareholder’s amount realized will be the sum of the cash or the fair market value of other property received plus its share of any the fund debt outstanding gain or loss recognized by a shareholder on the sale or exchange of shares held for more than one year will generally be taxable as longterm capital gain or loss otherwise such gain or loss will generally be taxable as shortterm capital gain or loss a special election is available under the treasury regulations that will allow shareholders to identify and use the actual holding periods for the shares sold for purposes of determining whether the gain or loss recognized on a sale of shares will give rise to longterm or shortterm capital gain or loss it is expected that most shareholders will be eligible to elect and generally will elect to identify and use the actual holding period for shares sold if a shareholder fails to make the election or is not able to identify the holding periods of the shares sold the shareholder may have a split holding period in the shares sold under such circumstances a shareholder will be required to determine its holding period in the shares sold by first determining the portion of its entire interest in the fund that would give rise to longterm capital gain or loss if its entire interest were sold and the portion that would give rise to shortterm capital gain or loss if the entire interest were sold the shareholder would then treat each share sold as giving rise to longterm capital gain or loss and shortterm capital gain or loss in the same proportions as if it had sold its entire interest in the fund      under section  of the code a portion of a shareholder’s gain or loss from the sale of shares regardless of the holding period for such shares will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss to the extent attributable to “unrealized receivables” or “inventory” owned by the fund the term “unrealized receivables” includes among other things market discount bonds and shortterm debt instruments to the extent such items would give rise to ordinary income if sold by the fund however the short term capital gain on section  contracts resulting from  –  treatment described above should not be subject to this rule if some or all of a shareholder’s shares are lent by its broker or other agent to a third party — for example for use by the third party in covering a short sale — the shareholder may be considered as having made a taxable disposition of the loaned shares in which case —     •   the shareholder may recognize taxable gain or loss to the same extent as if it had sold the shares for cash     •   any of the fund’s income gain loss or deduction allocable to those shares during the period of the loan will not be reportable by the shareholder for us federal income tax purposes and     •   any distributions the shareholder receives with respect to the shares under the loan agreements will be fully taxable to the shareholder most likely as ordinary income         shareholders desiring to avoid these and other possible consequences of a deemed disposition of their shares should consider modifying any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit the lending of their shares other tax matters   information reporting the trust will report tax information to the beneficial owners of shares and the irs shareholders of the fund are treated as beneficial owners for us federal income tax purposes accordingly the fund will furnish its shareholders each year with tax information on irs schedule k form  which will be used by the shareholders in completing their tax returns the irs has ruled that assignees of partnership interests who have not been admitted to a partnership as partners but who have the capacity to exercise substantial dominion and control over the assigned partnership interests will be considered beneficial owners for us federal income tax purposes on the basis of such ruling except as otherwise provided herein we will treat as a shareholder any person whose shares are held on their behalf by a broker or other nominee if that person has the right to direct the nominee in the exercise of all substantive rights attendant to the ownership of the shares persons who hold an interest in the fund as a nominee for another person are required to furnish to us the following information  the name address and taxpayer identification number of the beneficial owner and the nominee  whether the beneficial owner is a a person that is not a us person b a foreign government an international organization or any whollyowned agency or instrumentality of either of the foregoing or c a taxexempt entity  the number and a description of shares acquired or transferred for the beneficial owner and  certain information including the dates of acquisitions and transfers means of acquisitions and transfers and acquisition cost for purchases as well as the amount of net proceeds from sales brokers and financial institutions are required to furnish additional information including whether they are us persons and certain information on shares they acquire hold or transfer for their own account a penalty of  per failure up to a maximum of  per calendar year is imposed by the code for failure to report such information correctly to the fund if the failure to furnish such information correctly is determined to be willful the per failure penalty increases to  or if greater  of the aggregate amount of items required to be reported and the  maximum does not apply the nominee is required to supply the beneficial owner of the shares with the information furnished to the fund      partnership audit procedures the irs may audit the us federal income tax returns filed by the fund under current law adjustments resulting from any such audit may require each shareholder to adjust a prior year’s tax liability and could result in an audit of the shareholder’s own return any audit of a shareholder’s return could result in adjustments of nonpartnership items as well as the fund items partnerships are generally treated as separate entities for purposes of federal tax audits judicial review of administrative adjustments by the irs and tax settlement proceedings the tax treatment of partnership items of income gain loss deduction and credit are determined at the partnership level in a unified partnership proceeding rather than in separate proceedings with the shareholders the code provides for one shareholder to be designated as the “tax matters partner” and represent the partnership purposes of these proceedings the trust agreement appoints uscf as the tax matters partner of the fund in addition for periods beginning after december   the fund may be liable for us federal income tax on any “imputed understatement” of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an irs audit the amount of the imputed understatement generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or gains to any shareholder and decreases in allocations of items of deduction loss or credit to any shareholder without any offset for any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or gain to any shareholder or increases in allocations of items of deduction loss or credit to any shareholder if the fund is required to pay any us federal income taxes on any imputed understatement the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of the fund and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the shares under certain circumstances the fund may be eligible to make an election a “pushout election” to cause the shareholders to take into account the amount of any imputed understatement including any interest and penalties the ability of a publicly traded partnership such as the fund to make this election is uncertain if the election is made the fund would be required to provide shareholders who owned beneficial interests in the shares in the year to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement setting forth their proportionate shares of the adjustment “adjusted ks” the shareholders would be required to take the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the adjusted ks are issued the code provides for one person to be designated as the “partnership representative” to represent a partnership in all matters related to the audit of any partnership year the partnership representative is authorized to bind the partnership and all of its partners including exclusive authority to settle any tax audit contest any tax matter in a court proceeding to extend the statute of limitations with respect to any tax matter and to make certain elections including the pushout election the trust agreement will appoint uscf as the partnership representative of the fund tax shelter disclosure rules in certain circumstances the code and treasury regulations require that the irs be notified of certain “reportable transactions” through a disclosure statement attached to a taxpayer’s us federal income tax return these disclosure rules may apply to transactions irrespective of whether they are structured to achieve particular tax benefits they could require disclosure by the trust or shareholders if a shareholder incurs a loss in excess of a specified threshold from a sale or redemption of its shares or possibly in other circumstances while these rules generally do not require disclosure of a loss recognized on the disposition of an asset in which the taxpayer has a “qualifying basis” generally a basis equal to the amount of cash paid by the taxpayer for such asset they apply to a loss recognized with respect to interests in a passthrough entity such as the shares even if the taxpayer’s basis in such interests is equal to the amount of cash it paid in addition significant penalties may be imposed in connection with a failure to comply with these reporting requirements investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of these reporting requirements to their specific situation additional tax on investment income individuals with income in excess of   in the case of married individuals filing jointly and certain estates and trusts are subject to an additional  tax on their “net investment income” which generally includes income from interest dividends annuities royalties and rents and net capital gains other than certain amounts earned from trades or businesses the income subject to the additional  tax also includes income from businesses involved in the trading of financial instruments or commodities taxexempt organizations subject to numerous exceptions qualified retirement plans and individual retirement accounts charitable organizations and certain other organizations that otherwise are exempt from us federal income tax collectively “exempt organizations” nonetheless are subject to the tax on unrelated business taxable income “ubti” generally ubti means the gross income derived by an exempt organization from a trade or business that it regularly carries on the conduct of which is not substantially related to the exercise or performance of its exempt purpose or function less allowable deductions directly connected with that trade or business if the fund were to regularly carry on directly or indirectly a trade or business that is unrelated with respect to an exempt organization shareholder of the fund then in computing its ubti the shareholder must include its share of  the fund’s gross income from the unrelated trade or business whether or not distributed and  the fund’s allowable deductions directly connected with that gross income ubti generally does not include dividends interest or payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale of property other than property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business nonetheless income on and gain from the disposition of “debtfinanced property” is ubti debtfinanced property generally is incomeproducing property including securities the use of which is not substantially related to the exempt organization’s taxexempt purposes and with respect to which there is “acquisition indebtedness” at any time during the taxable year or if the property was disposed of during the taxable year the month period ending with the disposition acquisition indebtedness includes debt incurred to acquire property debt incurred before the acquisition of property if the debt would not have been incurred but for the acquisition and debt incurred subsequent to the acquisition of property if the debt would not have been incurred but for the acquisition and at the time of acquisition the incurrence of debt was foreseeable the portion of the income from debtfinanced property attributable to acquisition indebtedness is equal to the ratio of the average outstanding principal amount of acquisition indebtedness over the average adjusted basis of the property for the year the fund anticipates that it will employ leverage as part of its investment strategy as a result the fund anticipates that a portion of its income will constitute ubti in addition an exempt organization shareholder that incurs acquisition indebtedness to purchase its shares in the fund may have ubti      the federal tax rate applicable to an exempt organization shareholder on its ubti generally will be either the corporate or trust tax rate depending upon the shareholder’s form of organization the fund may report to each such shareholder information as to the portion if any of the shareholder’s income and gains from the fund for any year that will be treated as ubti the calculation of that amount is complex and there can be no assurance that the fund’s calculation of ubti will be accepted by the irs an exempt organization shareholder will be required to make payments of estimated us federal income tax with respect to its ubti regulated investment companies interests in and income from “qualified publicly traded partnerships” satisfying certain gross income tests are treated as qualifying assets and income respectively for purposes of determining eligibility for regulated investment company “ric” status a ric may invest up to  of its assets in interests in a qualified publicly traded partnership the determination of whether a publicly traded partnership such as the fund is a qualified publicly traded partnership is made on an annual basis while the issue is not certain the fund does not expect to be treated a qualified publicly traded partnership nonus shareholders   generally nonus persons who derive us source income or gain from investing or engaging in a us business are taxable on two categories of income the first category consists of amounts that are fixed determinable annual and periodic income such as interest dividends and rent that are not connected with the operation of a us trade or business “fdap” the second category is income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business “eci” fdap income other than interest that is considered “portfolio interest” is generally subject to a  withholding tax which may be reduced for certain categories of income by a treaty between the us and the recipient’s country of residence in contrast eci is generally subject to us tax on a net basis at graduated rates upon the filing of a us tax return where a nonus person has eci as a result of an investment in a partnership the eci is subject to a withholding tax at a rate of  for individual shareholders and a rate of  for corporate shareholders withholding on allocations and distributions the code provides that a nonus person who is a partner in a partnership that is engaged in a us trade or business during a taxable year will also be considered to be engaged in a us trade or business during that year classifying an activity by a partnership as an investment or an operating business is a factual determination under certain safe harbors in the code an investment fund whose activities consist of trading in stocks securities or commodities for its own account generally will not be considered to be engaged in a us trade or business unless it is a dealer is such stocks securities or commodities this safe harbor applies to investments in commodities only if the commodities are of a kind customarily dealt in on an organized commodity exchange and if the transaction is of a kind customarily consummated at such place although the matter is not free from doubt the fund believes that the activities directly conducted by the fund will not result in the fund being engaged in a trade or business within in the united states however there can be no assurance that the irs would not successfully assert that the fund’s activities constitute a us trade or business in the event that the fund’s activities were considered to constitute a us trade or business the fund would be required to withhold at the highest rate specified in code section  currently  on allocations of our income to individual nonus shareholders and the highest rate specified in code section b currently  on allocations of our income to corporate nonus shareholders when such income is allocated or distributed a nonus shareholder with eci will generally be required to file a us federal income tax return and the return will provide the nonus shareholder with the mechanism to seek a refund of any withholding in excess of such shareholder’s actual us federal income tax liability any amount withheld by the fund will be treated as a distribution to the nonus shareholder if the fund is not treated as engaged in a us trade or business a nonus shareholder may nevertheless be treated as having fdap income which would be subject to a  withholding tax possibly subject to reduction by treaty with respect to some or all of its distributions from the fund or its allocable share of the fund’s income amounts withheld on behalf of a nonus shareholder will be treated as being distributed to such shareholder to the extent any interest income allocated to a nonus shareholder that otherwise constitutes fdap is considered “portfolio interest” neither the allocation of such interest income to the nonus shareholder nor a subsequent distribution of such interest income to the nonus shareholder will be subject to withholding provided that the nonus shareholder is not otherwise engaged in a trade or business in the us and provides the fund with a timely and properly completed and executed irs form wben wbene or other applicable form in general “portfolio interest” is interest paid on debt obligations issued in registered form unless the “recipient” owns  or more of the voting power of the issuer      the trust expects that most of the fund’s interest income will qualify as “portfolio interest” in order for the fund to avoid withholding on any interest income allocable to nonus shareholders that would qualify as “portfolio interest” it will be necessary for all nonus shareholders to provide the fund with a timely and properly completed and executed form wben wbene or other applicable form gain from sale of shares gain from the sale or exchange of shares may be taxable to a nonus shareholder if the nonus shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the us for  days or more during the taxable year in such case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a  withholding tax on the amount of such individual’s gain branch profits tax on corporate nonus shareholders in addition to the taxes noted above any nonus shareholders that are corporations may also be subject to an additional tax the branch profits tax at a rate of  the branch profits tax is imposed on a nonus corporation’s dividend equivalent amount which generally consists of the corporation’s aftertax earnings and profits that are effectively connected with the corporation’s us trade or business but are not reinvested in a us business this tax may be reduced or eliminated by an income tax treaty between the united states and the country in which the nonus shareholder is a “qualified resident” prospective nonus shareholders should consult their own tax advisor with regard to these and other tax issues unique to nonus shareholders backup withholding   the fund may be required to withhold us federal income tax “backup withholding” at a rate of  from all payments to  any shareholder who fails to furnish the fund with his her or its correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that the shareholder is exempt from backup withholding and  any shareholder with respect to whom the irs notifies the fund that the shareholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the irs and to respond to notices to that effect backup withholding is not an additional tax and may be returned or credited against a taxpayer’s regular us federal income tax liability if appropriate information is provided to the irs foreign account tax compliance act provisions   legislation commonly referred to as the “foreign account tax compliance act” or “fatca” generally imposes a  withholding tax on payments of certain types of income to foreign financial institutions “ffis” unless such ffis i enter into an agreement with the us treasury to report certain required information with respect to accounts held by united states persons or held by foreign entities that have united states persons as substantial owners certain information or ii reside in a jurisdiction that has entered into an intergovernmental agreement “iga” with the united states to collect and share such information and comply with the terms of such iga and any enabling legislation or regulations the types of income subject to the tax include ussource interest and dividends and after december   the gross proceeds from the sale of any property that could produce ussource interest or dividends the information to be reported includes the identity and taxpayer identification number of each account holder that is a us person and transaction activity within the holder’s account in addition subject to certain exceptions this legislation also imposes a  withholding on payments to foreign entities that are not ffis unless the foreign entities certify that they do not have a greater than  us owner or provide the withholding agent with identifying information on each greater than  us owner depending on the status of a nonus shareholder and the status of the intermediaries through which they hold their shares nonus shareholders could be subject to this  withholding tax with respect to distributions on their shares and proceeds from the sale of their shares under certain circumstances a nonus shareholder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes   other tax considerations   in addition to us federal income taxes shareholders may be subject to other taxes such as state and local income taxes unincorporated business taxes business franchise taxes and estate inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which the fund does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in the fund it is each shareholder’s responsibility to file the appropriate us federal state local and foreign tax returns eversheds sutherland us llp has not provided an opinion concerning any aspects of state local or foreign tax or us federal tax other than those us federal income tax issues discussed herein      investment by erisa accounts   general   most employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts “iras” are subject to the employee retirement income security act of  as amended “erisa” or the code or both this section discusses certain considerations that arise under erisa and the code that a fiduciary of i an employee benefit plan as defined in erisa ii a plan as defined in section  of the code or iii any collective investment vehicle business trust investment partnership pooled separate account or other entity the assets of which are treated as comprised at least in part of “plan assets” under the erisa “plan assets” rules “plan asset entity” who has investment discretion should take into account before deciding to invest the plan’s assets in the fund employee benefit plans under erisa plans under the code and plan asset entities are collectively referred to below as “plans” and fiduciaries with investment discretion are referred to below as “plan fiduciaries” this summary is based on the provisions of erisa and the code as of the date hereof this summary is not intended to be complete but only to address certain questions under erisa and the code likely to be raised by your advisors the summary does not include state or local law potential plan investors are urged to consult with their own professional advisors concerning the appropriateness of an investment in the fund and the manner in which shares should be purchased special investment considerations   each plan fiduciary must consider the facts and circumstances that are relevant to an investment in the fund including the role that an investment in the fund would play in the plan’s overall investment portfolio each plan fiduciary before deciding to invest in the fund must be satisfied that the investment is prudent for the plan that the investments of the plan are diversified so as to minimize the risk of large losses and that an investment in the fund complies with the terms of the plan the fund and plan assets   a regulation issued under erisa contains rules for determining when an investment by a plan in an equity interest of a statutory trust will result in the underlying assets of the statutory trust being deemed plan assets for purposes of erisa and section  of the code those rules provide that assets of a statutory trust will not be plan assets of a plan that purchases an equity interest in the statutory trust if the equity interest purchased is a publiclyoffered security if the underlying assets of a statutory trust are considered to be assets of any plan for purposes of erisa or section  of the code the operations of that trust would be subject to and in some cases limited by the provisions of erisa and section  of the code the publiclyoffered security exception described above applies if the equity interest is a security that is      freely transferable determined based on the relevant facts and circumstances      part of a class of securities that is widely held meaning that the class of securities is owned by  or more investors independent of the issuer and of each other and      either a part of a class of securities registered under section b or g of the exchange act or b sold to the plan as part of a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the  act and the class of which such security is a part is registered under the exchange act within  days or such later time as may be allowed by the sec after the end of the fiscal year of the issuer in which the offering of such security occurred       the plan asset regulations under erisa state that the determination of whether a security is freely transferable is to be made based on all the relevant facts and circumstances in the case of a security that is part of an offering in which the minimum investment is  or less the following requirements alone or in combination ordinarily will not affect a finding that the security is freely transferable  a requirement that no transfer or assignment of the security or rights relating to the security be made that would violate any federal or state law and  a requirement that no transfer or assignment be made without advance written notice given to the entity that issued the security      uscf believes that the conditions described above are satisfied with respect to the shares of the fund uscf believes that the shares of the fund therefore constitute publiclyoffered securities and the underlying assets of the fund should not be considered to constitute plan assets of any plan that purchases shares prohibited transactions   erisa and the code generally prohibit certain transactions involving a plan and persons who have certain specified relationships to the plan in general shares may not be purchased with the assets of a plan if uscf the clearing brokers the trading advisors if any or any of their affiliates agents or employees either     •   exercise any discretionary authority or discretionary control with respect to management of the plan     •   exercise any authority or control with respect to management or disposition of the assets of the plan     •   render investment advice for a fee or other compensation direct or indirect with respect to any monies or other property of the plan     •   have any authority or responsibility to render investment advice with respect to any monies or other property of the plan or     •   have any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of the plan         also a prohibited transaction may occur under erisa or the code when circumstances indicate that  the investment in shares is made or retained for the purpose of avoiding application of the fiduciary standards of erisa  the investment in shares constitutes an arrangement under which the fund is expected to engage in transactions that would otherwise be prohibited if entered into directly by the plan purchasing the shares  the investing plan by itself has the authority or influence to cause the fund to engage in such transactions or  a person who is prohibited from transacting with the investing plan may but only with the aid of certain of its affiliates and the investing plan cause the fund to engage in such transactions with such person special ira rules   iras are not subject to erisa’s fiduciary standards but are subject to their own rules including the prohibited transaction rules of section  of the code which generally mirror erisa’s prohibited transaction rules for example iras are subject to special custody rules and must maintain a qualifying ira custodial arrangement separate and distinct from the fund and its custodial arrangement if a separate qualifying custodial arrangement is not maintained an investment in the shares will be treated as a distribution from the ira second iras are prohibited from investing in certain commingled investments and uscf makes no representation regarding whether an investment in shares is an inappropriate commingled investment for an ira third in applying the prohibited transaction provisions of section  of the code in addition to the rules summarized above the individual for whose benefit the ira is maintained is also treated as the creator of the ira for example if the owner or beneficiary of an ira enters into any transaction arrangement or agreement involving the assets of his or her ira to benefit the ira owner or beneficiary or his or her relatives or business affiliates personally or with the understanding that such benefit will occur directly or indirectly such transaction could give rise to a prohibited transaction that is not exempted by any available exemption moreover in the case of an ira the consequences of a nonexempt prohibited transaction are that the ira’s assets will be treated as if they were distributed causing immediate taxation of the assets including any early distribution penalty tax applicable under section  of the code in addition to any other fines or penalties that may apply exempt plans   certain employee benefit plans may be governmental plans or church plans governmental plans and church plans are generally not subject to erisa nor do the prohibited transaction provisions described above

  shares are issued in registered form in accordance with the trust agreement the administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring shares in certificated form the administrator keeps a record of all shareholders and holders of the shares in certificated form in the registry “register” uscf recognizes transfer of shares in certified form only if done in accordance with the trust agreement the beneficial interests in such shares are held in bookentry form through participants andor accountholders in dtc book entry   individual certificates are not issued for the shares instead shares are represented by one or more global certificates which are deposited by the administrator with dtc and registered in the name of cede  co as nominee for dtc the global certificates evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time shareholders are limited to  participants in dtc such as banks brokers dealers and trust companies “dtc participants”  those who maintain either directly or indirectly a custodial relationship with a dtc participant “indirect participants” and  those who hold interests in the shares through dtc participants or indirect participants in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares dtc participants acting on behalf of investors holding shares through such participants’ accounts in dtc will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for dtc’s sameday funds settlement system shares are credited to dtc participants’ securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment   dtc   dtc has advised us as follows it is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the state of new york and is a member of the federal reserve system a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the new york uniform commercial code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of section a of the exchange act dtc holds securities for dtc participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between dtc participants through electronic bookentry changes in accounts of dtc participants   transfer of shares   the shares are only transferable through the bookentry system of dtc shareholders who are not dtc participants may transfer their shares through dtc by instructing the dtc participant holding their shares or by instructing the indirect participant or other entity through which their shares are held to transfer the shares transfers are made in accordance with standard securities industry practice transfers of interests in shares with dtc are made in accordance with the usual rules and operating procedures of dtc and the nature of the transfer dtc has established procedures to facilitate transfers among the participants andor accountholders of dtc because dtc can only act on behalf of dtc participants who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants the ability of a person or entity having an interest in a global certificate to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in dtc or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest may be affected by the lack of a certificate or other definitive document representing such interest dtc has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a shareholder including without limitation the presentation of a global certificate for exchange only at the direction of one or more dtc participants in whose account with dtc interests in global certificates are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the global certificate as to which such dtc participant or participants has or have given such direction      interseries limitation on liability   because the trust was established as a delaware statutory trust each series established under the trust will be operated so that it will be liable only for obligations attributable to such series and will not be liable for obligations of any other series or affected by losses of any other series if any creditor or shareholder of any particular series asserts against the series a valid claim with respect to its indebtedness or shares the creditor or shareholder will only be able to obtain recovery from the assets of that series and not from the assets of any other series or the trust generally the assets of each series will include only those funds and other assets that are paid to held by or distributed to the series on account of and for the benefit of that series including without limitation amounts delivered to the trust for the purchase of shares in a series this limitation on liability is referred to as the interseries limitation on liability the interseries limitation on liability is expressly provided for under the delaware statutory trust act which provides that if certain conditions as set forth in section a are met then the debts of any particular series will be enforceable only against the assets of such series and not against the assets of any other series or the trust generally in furtherance of the interseries limitation on liability every party providing services to the trust the fund or uscf on behalf of the trust or the fund will acknowledge and consent in writing to the interseries limitation on liability with respect to such party’s claims the existence of a trustee should not be taken as an indication of any additional level of management or supervision over the fund to the greatest extent permissible under delaware law the trustee acts in an entirely passive role delegating all authority for the management and operation of the fund and the trust to uscf the trustee does not provide custodial services with respect to the assets of the fund   recognition of the trust in certain states   a number of states do not have “statutory trust” statutes such as that under which the trust has been formed in the state of delaware it is possible although unlikely that a court in such state could hold that due to the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary in such jurisdiction the shareholders although entitled under delaware law to the same limitation on personal liability as stockholders in a private corporation for profit organized under the laws of the state of delaware are not so entitled in such state to protect shareholders against any loss of limited liability the trust agreement provides that each written obligation undertaken by uscf on behalf of the trust or the fund shall give notice that the obligation is not binding upon the shareholders individually but is binding only upon the assets and property of the fund and no resort shall be had to the shareholders’ personal property for satisfaction of such obligation furthermore the trust and the fund indemnify all shareholders of the fund against any liability that such shareholders might incur solely based on their status as shareholders of one or more shares other than for taxes for which such shareholder is liable under the trust agreement what is the plan of distribution   buying and selling shares   most investors will buy and sell shares of the fund in secondary market transactions through brokers shares will trade on nyse under the ticker symbol “usou” shares are bought and sold throughout the trading day like other publicly traded securities when buying or selling shares through a broker most investors will incur customary brokerage commissions and charges investors are encouraged to review the terms of their brokerage account for details on applicable charges marketing agent and authorized participants   the offering of the fund’s shares will be a best efforts offering the fund intends to continuously offer creation baskets consisting of  shares through the marketing agent to authorized participants authorized participants will pay a transaction fee equal to  of total nav of the creation baskets for each order they place to create or redeem one or more creation baskets uscf will pay the marketing agent a service fee in consideration of its provision of marketing services  authorized participants will not receive from the fund uscf or any of their affiliates any fee or other compensation in connection with the sale of shares in no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the marketing agent and any affiliate of uscf for marketing andor distributionrelated services in connection with this offering exceed ten percent  of the gross proceeds of this offering the offering of baskets will be made in compliance with conduct rule  of finra accordingly authorized participants will not make any sales to any account over which they have discretionary authority without the prior written approval of a purchaser of shares      the per share price of shares offered in creation baskets on any subsequent day will be the total nav of the fund calculated shortly after the close of nyse on that day divided by the number of issued and outstanding shares of the fund an authorized participant is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares by executing an authorized participant agreement an authorized participant will become part of the group of parties eligible to purchase baskets from and put baskets for redemption to the fund an authorized participant will not be under any obligation to create or redeem baskets or to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create the initial authorized participant of the fund will be rbc capital markets llc    because new shares can be created and issued on an ongoing basis at any point during the life of the fund a “distribution” as such term is used in the  act will be occurring authorized participants other brokerdealers and other persons are cautioned that some of their activities may result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that would render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectusdelivery and liability provisions of the  act for example the initial authorized participant will be a statutory underwriter with respect to the initial purchase of creation baskets in addition any purchaser who purchases shares with a view towards distribution of such shares may be deemed to be a statutory underwriter in addition an authorized participant other brokerdealer firm or its client will be deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases a basket from the fund breaks the basket down into the constituent shares and sells the shares to its customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for the shares in contrast authorized participants may engage in secondary market or other transactions in shares that would not be deemed “underwriting” for example an authorized participant may act in the capacity of a broker or dealer with respect to shares that were previously distributed by other authorized participants a determination of whether a particular market participant is an underwriter must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the brokerdealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that would lead to designation as an underwriter and subject them to the prospectusdelivery and liability provisions of the  act dealers who are neither authorized participants nor “underwriters” but are nonetheless participating in a distribution as contrasted to ordinary secondary trading transactions and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of section c of the  act would be unable to take advantage of the prospectusdelivery exemption provided by section  of the  act uscf intends any brokerdealers selling shares will be members of finra investors intending to create or redeem baskets through authorized participants in transactions not involving a brokerdealer registered in such investor’s state of domicile or residence should consult their legal advisor regarding applicable broker dealer regulatory requirements under the state securities laws prior to such creation or redemption while the authorized participants may be indemnified by uscf they will not be entitled to receive a discount or commission from the trust or uscf for their purchases of creation baskets calculating per share nav   the fund’s per share nav will be calculated by     •   taking the current market value of its total assets     •   subtracting any liabilities and     •   dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares         the administrator will calculate the nav of each fund once each nyse trading day the nav for a normal trading day will be released after  pm eastern time “et” trading during the exchange’s core trading session typically closes at  pm et for futures contracts and options traded on exchanges the administrator will use the closing or settlement price published by the applicable exchange or in the case of a market disruption the last traded price before settlement in the case of the benchmark oil futures contract the nymex closing price determined at the earlier of the close of the nymex or  pm et for the contracts traded on the nymex will be used other investments’ values for purposes of determining the nav for each fund including treasuries cash equivalents other than money market funds cleared and noncleared swaps forwards options and swaps will be calculated by the administrator using market quotations and market data if available or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the nyse or  pm et money market funds will be valued at their end of day nav the funds may hold cash in the form of us dollars      third parties supplying quotations or market data may include without limitation information vendors dealers in the relevant markets endusers of the relevant product brokers and other sources of market information other information customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including without limitation relevant rates prices yields yield curves volatilities spreads correlations or other market data in the relevant market or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by a fund in the regular course of business for the valuation of similar transactions the information may include costs of funding to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized in addition in order to provide updated information relating to the fund for use by investors and market professionals nyse will calculate and disseminate throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value the indicative fund value will be calculated by using the prior day’s closing nav per share of the fund as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the active light sweet oil futures contract on the nymex the prices reported for the active oil futures contract month are adjusted based on the prior day’s spread differential between settlement values for that contract and the spot month contract in the event that the spot month contract is also the benchmark oil futures contract the last sale price for the benchmark oil futures contract is not adjusted the indicative fund value share basis disseminated during nyse core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the nav because the per share nav is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of the fund’s investments the indicative fund value share basis disseminated during nyse core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the nav because nav is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of the fund’s investments the indicative fund value will be disseminated on a per share basis every  seconds during regular nyse core trading session hours of  am new york time to  pm new york time the normal trading hours of the nymex are  am new york time to  pm new york time this means that there will be a gap in time at the end of each day during which the fund’s shares are traded on the nyse but realtime nymex trading prices for oil futures contracts traded on the nymex are not available during such gaps in time the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such oil futures contracts from the nymex’s immediately preceding trading session in addition other oil futures contracts other oilrelated investments and treasuries held by the fund will be valued by the administrator using rates and points received from clientapproved third party vendors such as reuters and wm company and advisor quotes these investments will not be included in the indicative fund value nyse will disseminate the indicative fund value through the facilities of ctacq high speed lines in addition the indicative fund value will be published on nyse’ website and will be available through online information services such as bloomberg and reuters dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of the shares of the fund on nyse investors and market professionals will be able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of the fund and the indicative fund value if the market price of the shares of the fund diverges significantly from the indicative fund value market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades for example if the fund appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value a market professional could buy shares of the fund on nyse and sell short oil futures contracts such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of the fund and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants creation and redemption of shares   the fund intends to create and redeem shares from time to time but only in one or more creation baskets or redemption baskets the creation and redemption of baskets will be made only in exchange for delivery to the fund or the distribution by the fund of the amount of treasuries andor cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed the amount of which will be equal to the combined nav of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined as of  pm new york time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received      authorized participants will be the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets authorized participants must be  registered brokerdealers or other securities market participants such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as brokerdealers to engage in securities transactions described below and  dtc participants to become an authorized participant a person must enter into an authorized participant agreement with uscf the authorized participant agreement will provide the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the treasuries and any cash required for such creation and redemptions the authorized participant agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by the fund without the consent of any limited partner or shareholder or authorized participant authorized participants pay a transaction fee equal to  of total nav of the creation baskets to the fund for each order they place to create one or more creation baskets or to redeem one or more redemption baskets the transaction fee may be reduced increased or otherwise changed by uscf authorized participants who make deposits with the fund in exchange for baskets receive no fees commission or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the fund or uscf and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to uscf or the fund to effect any sale or resale of shares certain authorized participants are expected to be capable of participating directly in the physical crude oil market and the crude oil futures market in some cases authorized participants or their affiliates may from time to time buy or sell crude oil or oil interests and may profit in these instances uscf believes that the size and operation of the crude oil market make it unlikely that an authorized participant’s direct activities in the crude oil or securities markets will significantly affect the price of crude oil oil interests or the price of the shares each authorized participant will be required to be registered as a brokerdealer under the exchange act and a member in good standing with finra or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a brokerdealer or a member of finra and will be qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires certain authorized participants may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations each authorized participant has its own set of rules and procedures internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime under the authorized participant agreement uscf and the trust under limited circumstances agree to indemnify the authorized participants against certain liabilities including liabilities under the  act and to contribute to the payments the authorized participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities the following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the trust agreement and the form of authorized participant agreement for more detail the trust agreement is attached to this prospectus the form of authorized participant agreement will be filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part see “where you can find more information” for information about where you can obtain the registration statement creation procedures   on any business day an authorized participant may place an order with the marketing agent to create one or more baskets for purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders a “business day” means any day other than a day when nyse or any futures exchange upon which a benchmark oil futures contract is traded is closed for regular trading purchase orders must be placed by  pm new york time or the close of regular trading on nyse whichever is earlier the day on which the marketing agent accepts a purchase order in satisfactory form and approves such order in accordance with the procedures set forth in the authorized participant agreement is referred to as the purchase order date by placing a purchase order an authorized participant agrees to deposit treasuries cash or a combination of treasuries and cash with the trust as described below prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order the authorized participant must also have wired to the custodian the nonrefundable transaction fee due for the purchase order authorized participants may not withdraw a creation request   the manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the authorized participant agreement by placing a purchase order an authorized participant agrees to  deposit treasuries cash or a combination of treasuries and cash with the custodian of the fund and  if required by uscf in its sole discretion enter into or arrange for a block trade an exchange for physical or exchange for swap or any other otc transaction through itself or a designated acceptable broker with the fund for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date if an authorized participant fails to consummate  and  the order shall be cancelled the number and types of contracts specified shall be determined by uscf in its sole discretion to meet the fund’s investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the authorized participant’s purchase of shares      determination of required deposits   the total deposit required to create each basket “creation basket deposit” is the amount of treasuries andor cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of the fund net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees expenses and other liabilities on the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the purchase order date uscf intends to determine directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the administrator the requirements for treasuries and cash including the remaining maturities of the treasuries and proportions of treasuries and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets the marketing agent will publish an estimate of the creation basket deposit requirements at the beginning of each business day the amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the treasuries required to be included in a creation basket deposit as of  pm new york time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit delivery of required deposits   an authorized participant who places a purchase order will be responsible for transferring to the fund’s account with the custodian the required amount of treasuries andor cash by noon new york time on the third business day following the purchase order date upon receipt of the deposit amount the administrator will direct dtc to credit the number of baskets ordered to the authorized participant’s dtc account on the third business day following the purchase order date the expense and risk of delivery and ownership of treasuries until such treasuries have been received by the custodian on behalf of the fund shall be borne solely by the authorized participant because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by  pm new york time but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until  pm new york time on the date the purchase order is received authorized participants will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket the fund’s nav and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined rejection of purchase orders   uscf acting by itself or through the marketing agent shall have the absolute right but shall have no obligation to reject any purchase order or creation basket deposit if uscf determines that     •   the purchase order or creation basket deposit is not in proper form     •   it would not be in the best interest of the shareholders of the fund     •   due to position limits or otherwise investment alternatives that will enable the fund to meet its investment objective are not available to the fund at that time     •   the acceptance of the purchase order or the creation basket deposit would have adverse tax consequences to the fund or its shareholders     •   the acceptance or receipt of which would in the opinion of counsel to uscf be unlawful or     •   circumstances outside the control of uscf the marketing agent or the custodian make it for all practical purposes not feasible to process creation baskets including if uscf determines that the investments available to the fund at that time will not enable it to meet its investment objective         none of uscf the marketing agent or the custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or creation basket deposit redemption procedures   the procedures by which an authorized participant will be able to redeem one or more baskets will mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets on any business day an authorized participant may place an order with the marketing agent to redeem one or more baskets redemption orders must be placed by  pm new york time or the close of regular trading on nyse whichever is earlier a redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form and approved by the marketing agent “redemption order date” in accordance with the procedures set forth in the authorized participant agreement the redemption procedures allow authorized participants to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder to redeem any shares in an amount less than a redemption basket or to redeem baskets other than through an authorized participant      by placing a redemption order an authorized participant agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through dtc’s bookentry system to the fund not later than noon new york time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order the authorized participant must also have wired to uscf’s account at the custodian the nonrefundable transaction fee due for the redemption order an authorized participant may not withdraw a redemption order the manner by which redemptions will be made will be dictated by the terms of the authorized participant agreement by placing a redemption order an authorized participant will be agreeing to  deliver the redemption basket to be redeemed through dtc’s bookentry system to the fund’s account with the custodian no later than  pm new york time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order “redemption order date” and  if required by uscf in its sole discretion enter into or arrange for a block trade an exchange for physical or exchange for swap or any other otc transaction through itself or a designated acceptable broker with

of the authorized participant’s sale of shares determination of redemption distribution   the redemption distribution from the fund will consist of a transfer to the redeeming authorized participant of an amount of treasuries andor cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of the fund net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees expenses and other liabilities on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received uscf directly or in consultation with the administrator determines the requirements for treasuries and cash including the remaining maturities of the treasuries and proportions of treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets the marketing agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day   delivery of redemption distribution   the redemption distribution due from the fund will be delivered to the authorized participant on the third business day following the redemption order date if by  pm new york time on such third business day the fund’s dtc account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed if the fund’s dtc account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if uscf receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which uscf may from time to time determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to the fund’s dtc account by  pm new york time on such next business day any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled pursuant to information from uscf the custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to the fund’s dtc account by  pm new york time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the authorized participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through dtc’s book entrysystem on such terms as uscf may from time to time determine suspension or rejection of redemption orders   uscf may in its discretion suspend the right of redemption or postpone the redemption settlement date  for any period during which nyse or any of the futures exchanges upon which a benchmark oil futures contract is traded is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings or trading on nyse or such futures exchanges is suspended or restricted  for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery disposal or evaluation of treasuries is not reasonably practicable or  for such other period as uscf determines to be necessary for the protection of the shareholders for example uscf may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of the fund’s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption if uscf has difficulty liquidating the fund’s positions eg  because of a market disruption event in the futures markets or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over the counter contract it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified none of uscf the marketing agent or the custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement      redemption orders must be made in whole baskets uscf acting by itself or through the marketing agent may in its sole discretion reject any redemption order  uscf determines that the redemption order is not in proper form  the fulfillment of which its counsel advises may be illegal under applicable laws and regulations or  if circumstances outside the control of uscf the marketing agent or the custodian make it for all practical purposes not feasible for the shares to be delivered under the redemption order uscf may also reject a redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding shares to  shares  ie  two  baskets or less creation and redemption transaction fee   to compensate the fund for expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets an authorized participant is required to pay a transaction fee to the fund equal to  of total nav of the creation baskets to create or redeem baskets the transaction fee may be reduced increased or otherwise changed by uscf uscf shall notify dtc of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until thirty  days after the date of notice   tax responsibility   authorized participants are responsible for any transfer tax sales or use tax stamp tax recording tax value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the authorized participant and agree to indemnify uscf and the fund if they are required by law to pay any such tax together with any applicable penalties additions to tax and interest thereon secondary market transactions   as noted the fund will create and redeem shares from time to time but only in one or more creation baskets or redemption baskets the creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to the fund or the distribution by the fund of the amount of treasuries andor cash equal to the aggregate nav of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received as discussed above authorized participants will be the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets authorized participants must be registered brokerdealers or other securities market participants such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as brokerdealers to engage in securities transactions an authorized participant will be under no obligation to create or redeem baskets and an authorized participant will be under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create authorized participants that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at pershare offering prices that are expected to reflect among other factors the trading price of the shares on nyse the nav of the shares at the time the authorized participant purchased the creation baskets the nav of the shares at the time of the offer of the shares to the public the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale and the liquidity of the oil futures contract market and the market for other oilrelated investments baskets will generally be redeemed when the price per share is at a discount to the nav per share shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by authorized participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices an order for one or more baskets may be placed by an authorized participant on behalf of multiple clients authorized participants who make deposits with the fund in exchange for baskets receive no fees commissions or other forms of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the fund or uscf and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to uscf or the fund to effect any sale or resale of shares shares trade in the secondary market on nyse shares are expected to trade in the secondary market on nyse shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their nav per share the amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the nav per share may be influenced by various factors including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market and the liquidity of the oil futures contract market and the market for other oilrelated investments while the shares trade during the core trading session on the nyse until  pm new york time liquidity in the market for oil interests may be reduced after the close of the nymex at  pm new york time as a result during this time trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen      use of proceeds   uscf will cause the fund to transfer the proceeds of the sale of creation baskets to the custodian or another custodian for use in trading activities uscf will invest the fund’s assets in oil interests when the fund purchases oil interests that are exchangetraded the fund will be required to deposit typically  to  with the fcm on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under the oil interests at maturity this deposit is known as initial margin counterparties in transactions in otc contracts will generally impose similar collateral requirements on the fund uscf will invest the fund’s assets that remain after margin and collateral is posted in treasuries cash andor cash equivalents subject to these margin and collateral requirements uscf has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that will be     •   held as margin or collateral with fcms or other custodians     •   used for other investments and     •   held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves   approximately  to  of the fund’s assets will be committed as margin for commodity futures contracts however from time to time the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially more or less than such range ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both exchangetraded and otc contracts based on changes in the value of the oil interests furthermore ongoing collateral requirements with respect to otc contracts are negotiated by the parties and may be affected by overall market volatility volatility of the underlying commodity or index the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under the oil interests and each party’s creditworthiness in light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchangetraded and otc contracts and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments it is not possible to estimate what portion of the fund’s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time the treasuries cash and cash equivalents held by the fund will
