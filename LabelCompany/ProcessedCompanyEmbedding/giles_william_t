rhodes you may begin william c rhodes iii  autozone inc good morning and thank you for joining us today for autozones  second quarter conference call with me today are bill giles executive vice president chief financial officer and it and brian campbell vice president treasurer investor relations and tax regarding the second quarter i hope youve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarters results if not the press release along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website wwwautozoneinccom please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them to begin this morning i want to thank all autozoners across the company for their tremendous efforts during what ultimately resulted in a challenging quarter our results this quarter were below our expectations due largely to a delay in tax refunds this year compared to last unfortunately our performance this quarter ended our remarkable string of  consecutive quarters of doubledigit growth in earnings per share while this is clearly disappointing i want to recognize and acknowledge the incredible performance of our teams across the company for delivering this virtually unheard of level of consistent performance for over a decade our sales increased  for the quarter and our domestic samestore sales were flat its worth highlighting the first nine weeks comp sales were up  while the last three weeks comp sales declined  and unfortunately the last week was materially weaker than the other two weeks as a result of these weaker than expected sales in the last few weeks we ended the quarter with flat samestore sales in an effort to provide a little more color our sales through the christmas holiday season were quite strong remember prior to christmas we had some significant winter conditions and our sales as expected were strong after christmas the weather was much more mild with minimal snow and ice in the midwest northeast and midatlantic during this period our sales growth moderated then as noted above in the last three weeks when we began lapping the beginning of last years tax refund season our samestore sales declined fairly significantly late last year the irs announced that in an effort to combat fraudulent tax refund filings they would be delaying the issuance of refunds associated with returns claiming the earned income tax credit unfortunately the timing of refunds typically begins in the last two or three weeks of our second quarter and this year most of the refunds were delayed until after our quarter concluded as context as of the end of our quarter this year the irs had issued  billion in tax refunds compared to last year when they had issued  billion this delay clearly created a material headwind this past quarter but all indications are that total tax refunds for the year will be generally consistent with last year our expectation is we have shifted some sales from q into q regarding regional discrepancies our northeast midatlantic and midwestern stores performed slightly better for the quarter than the remainder of the country as a reminder our northeastern midatlantic and midwestern stores represent approximately  of our overall sales clearly this year we experienced more winter conditions early in the quarter than we did last year but we expected the winter conditions to be more pronounced and last longer we are exiting this winter with two consecutive fairly mild winters in regards to our three primary merchandise categories failure maintenance and discretionary merchandise we experienced similar slowing trends across all three categories during the last three weeks of our quarter the majority of our sales are in the failure category and close behind is maintenance the deterioration in the last three weeks also drove our retail traffic count down for the quarter while our average ticket trends were consistent with q during the quarter we opened another  new stores in the united states we expect to open approximately  new domestic stores in fiscal  our commercial business continued to expand with  sales growth over last years second quarter while opening  net new programs we expect to open approximately  net new commercial programs for the fiscal year or approximately  additional programs in the last two quarters of the year at the end of the quarter  of our domestic stores had a commercial program and we continued to expand in mexico opening three new stores we didnt open any additional imc branches this quarter but we did open one new store in brazil while the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus we believe we have great growth opportunities outside of the us regarding the internet we experienced improving trends versus our first quarter as our results improved sequentially as the quarter moved along when i discuss online im referencing business shipped directly to the customer and not buyonline and pickupinstore our pickupinstore business sales are recorded in store sales and are not in our all other category our pickupinstore business continues to grow rapidly up over  for the quarter under the yes weve got it theme we are focused on improving our store closure rates while our winter quarter is a lowervolume quarter we still see plenty of examples of not being able to say yes to product requests because we didnt have or couldnt find what the customers needed within our network in the spirit of satisfying our customers we are making ongoing significant system investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers shopping patterns across all of our platforms we understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores commercial shops phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers needs as our primary objective remains growing our domestic retail and commercial businesses we continued with our inventory availability initiatives in order to respond to the everincreasing challenge of parts demand in the industry this past quarter we rolled out two additional mega hub locations and now have  in operation we are working diligently on the development of future sites and we expect to open approximately five more over the remainder of fiscal  our mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations additionally we are continuing development on our two new distribution centers based in washington state and florida and we are expanding our distribution center in illinois our current expectations are for the washington state facility to come online in late fiscal  or early  while the florida facility will open six months to  months later for your modeling purposes each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately  million now id like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives these are two very discrete and different strategies addressing different opportunities multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the instock levels for the skus that are stocked in our stores and the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets meaning adding skus that would not have been available locally in our network before regarding multiple frequency of deliveries we had roughly  stores receiving three or more deliveries per week at the end of q this quarter we added just over  additional sites as we tempered our rollout to focus on standardizing our operations and refining some of our methodologies this has been a considerable change and we havent yet been able to fully achieve our desired results on a variety of fronts as you remember up until recently we have serviced the vast majority of our stores once a week all of our systems processes and practices were focused on the cadence of these activities being onceaweek this past quarters deleverage was generally as expected but still a bit higher than we thought at the beginning of the quarter due to the softness in sales at the end of the quarter once we open our new distribution centers it will allow us to alleviate some of the cost pressures we continue to model  basis points to  basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in  the second ongoing initiative is the mega hub store concept we are currently operating  mega hubs we are very excited about what the mega hubs allow us to offer customers as a reminder these super sized autozone stores carry  to  unique skus approximately twice what a hub store carries today they provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations currently we have just over  domestic stores with access to mega hub inventory a majority or about twothirds of those  stores receive their service on an overnight basis today but as we expand our mega hubs more of them will receive this service same day and many will receive it multiple times per day we expect to ultimately operate  to  mega hubs once the implementation is complete the constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate while an average autozone location is just under  square feet a mega hub is  to  square feet or even more identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging and it takes time while there are incremental costs to those rollouts we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share our current assumption on this rollout is that we wont experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal  along with improving local parts availability and assortment we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers provide our autozoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders we will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fill our customers needs regardless of how difficult the request regarding mexico we opened three stores this quarter and now have  total stores in local currency mexico experienced another solid quarter however mexico sales in us dollars declined given the decrease in the value of the peso to the us dollar as our peso financial results are converted to us dollars on an average rate over the quarter we continued to experience headwinds to our net earnings as a result based on exchange rate differences this year to last we experienced an  headwind to eps this past quarter alone sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down  over last years second quarter as a reminder our alldata and ecommerce business which includes autozonecom and autoanything make up this segment of sale this compares to being down  last quarter and reflects stronger performance in autozonecoms business for q as i previously mentioned we continue to see  plus growth in our buyonline pickupinstore sales this strength in pickupinstore encourages us to continue investing in our instore experience pickupinstore while smaller than home delivery is quickly catching up in sales volume we recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase and our ecommerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience we see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and on how to do repairs while these businesses are small for us and less than  of our total sales the omnichannel experience is important and we will continue to invest in our ecommerce platform with the continued aging of the car population we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both diy and difm as new vehicle unit sales are reaching alltime highs and gas prices on average remain subdued miles driven continue to increase the lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income this trend remains encouraging regarding our expectations for the remainder of  we expect performance to improve in q if for no other reason than the shift in timing of income tax refunds as we exit a disappointing performance in q we are reinforcing to ourselves that we must continue to focus on both shortterm and longterm performance and we will be keenly focused on continuing to deliver consistently strong performance now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for  yes weve got it the key priorities for the year are great people providing great service profitably growing our commercial business leveraging the internet yes weve got it and leveraging information technology on the retail front this past quarter under the great people providing great service theme we continued with our intense focus on improving execution while weve been adding store payroll this year were now enhancing our training to storelevel autozoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability and the yes weve got it theme weve been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a goforward basis we realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses the focus is on making sure autozoners can see inventory availability across the entire organization not just their store swiftly and accurately in regards to commercial we opened  net new programs during the quarter our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of  programs in  as we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will continue to grow our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding resources and new programs to this very important growth initiative we should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish our second quarter at  we continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best if not the best in all of hardlines retailing however our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital it is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors capital before i pass the discussion over to bill giles to talk about our financial results id like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are to our entire teams efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers wants needs and desires we remain bullish on our future performance because we have a great business operated by exceptional autozoners now ill turn the call over to bill giles bill william t giles  autozone inc thanks bill and good morning everyone to start this morning let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail commercial and international results for the quarter total auto parts sales which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses our mexico and brazil stores and our  imc branches increased  switching over to macro trends during the quarter nationally unleaded gas prices started out at  a gallon and ended the quarter at  a gallon a slight increase last year gas prices decreased per gallon during the second quarter starting out at  and ending at  while prices at the pump are higher today than they were last year at this time we continue to feel the absolute price of  a gallon is not high enough amount to change the driving behavior of americans as we continue to see miles driven increasing we also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over seven years old the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear miles driven increased  in october  in november and  in december and for all of  miles driven were up  the other statistic we highlight is the number of sevenyearold and older vehicles on the road which continues to trend at our industrys favor for the trailing  weeks ended total sales for autozone store was  million for the quarter total commercial sales increased  and the second quarter commercial represented  of our total sales and grew  million over last years q this past quarter we opened  net new programs versus  programs opened in our second quarter of last fiscal year we now have our commercial program in  stores or  of our domestic stores supported by  hub stores and approximately  of our programs are three years old or younger in  we expect to open approximately  new programs as we have begun our fiscal  our trends have accelerated which is encouraging to us we are focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams particularly the store managers and district managers we remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers we are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel  should be a better sales growth year than  our mexico stores continued to perform well we opened three new stores during the second quarter we currently have  stores in mexico this upcoming year we expect to open approximately  new stores as bill said earlier we were challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso while sales and base currency were above plan this quarter the devaluation in the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year the peso devalued over the course of the quarter and this has created a headwind and our eps was negatively impacted by  a share we do believe the mexico leadership team has done an exceptional job managing the pesodenominated business regarding brazil we opened one new store and currently are operating nine stores our plans are to grow between  and  total stores over the next few years and while sales growth has been very encouraging we continue to refine our business model to make sure that it works for us financially gross margin for the quarter was  of sales down  basis points the decrease in gross margin was attributable to higher shrink expense and higher supply chain costs associated with the current inventory initiatives partially offset by lower acquisition costs in regards to product cost inflation it was relatively insignificant currently we feel costs will be predictable and manageable and we remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and well make the appropriate adjustments should they arise compared to the prior year we have incurred more costs related to our supply chain in support of our inventory availability initiatives along with rising shrink expense after several years of declining expenses the merchandising organization has and will continue to work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lowering acquisition costs our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment sga for the quarter was  of sales higher by  basis points from last years second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of sales were higher than last year due to higher domestic store payroll offset in part by lower incentive compensation we are beginning to see an acceleration in average wage rates as certain states and municipalities have increased minimum wages and as some national retailers have also increased entrylevel wages ebit for the quarter was  million up  over last years second quarter our ebit margin was  interest expense for the quarter was  million compared with  million in q a year ago debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was  billion or  million more than last years balance of  billion our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at  times ebitdar while in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on managements opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions we remain committed to both our investmentgrade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy for the quarter our tax rate was  versus last years q of  and i want to take a moment to remind listeners of autozones first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard the new standard requires us to recognize the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock options as a credit to income tax expenses on the pl this past quarter it lowered our tax rate  basis points this accounting change also increases the diluted share count calculation net income for the quarter was  million up  over last year our diluted share count of  million was down  from last years second quarter the combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to  up  over the prior years second quarter excluding the impact of the previously mentioned change in accounting for stock option exercises our eps would have increased by  for the quarter relating to the cash flow statement for the second fiscal quarter we generated  million of operating cash flow net fixed assets were up  versus last year capital expenditures for the quarter totaled  million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open  new locations this quarter capital expenditures on existing stores hub and mega hub store remodels or openings work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters initial investments in our new domestic dcs and information technology investments with the new stores opened we finished this past quarter with  stores in  states the district of columbia and puerto rico  stores in mexico and nine in brazil for a total autozone store count of  we also had  imc branches open at fiscal yearend taking our total locations to  depreciation totaled  million for the quarter versus last years second quarter expense of  million this is generally in line with the recent quarter growth rates we repurchased  million of autozone stock in the second quarter and at quarterend we had  million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was  times at quarterend again i want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric the metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria we continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy next id like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis the companys inventory increased  over the same period last year driven primarily by our ongoing inventory initiatives during the fiscal year and to a lesser extent by the deterioration of sales trends at the end of the quarter inventory per location was  versus  last year and  just this past quarter net inventory defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative  versus a negative  last year and a negative  last quarter as a result accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at  finally as bill previously mentioned our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of  we have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital now ill turn it back to bill rhodes william c rhodes iii  autozone inc thank you bill this quarter our sales and profitability performance were not up to our standard much of the challenge was macro in terms of delayed irs refunds but we have also incurred rising operating costs which include our initiatives at the end of the day we have had a remarkable track record of success and we will continue to focus on optimizing both short and longterm performance we have an exceptional team that executes extremely well our focus remains on being successful over the long run that success will be attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers to execute at a high level we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge we cannot and will not take our eye off of execution we must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution over the course of the last quarter two topics have garnered a significant amount of attention and before we move to qa i would like to address those directly first following the election the borderadjustable tax has become a hot topic as im sure many of you know i was part of a contingent of retail industry leaders association ceos who went to washington dc and met with president trump members of his administration and various members of congress to share our perspective on the potential harmful effects of this proposal while we are concerned about the impact on retail business models we are more concerned about the ramifications for hard working american families due to likely significant inflation that would ensue our key message is that we certainly support a progrowth agenda including corporate and individual tax reform but we stress the importance of a thoughtful approach to tax reform to avoid any unintended consequences secondly there have been articles written and increased dialogue around online retailers encroaching on our space much of the information highlighted is not new news there havent been any significant changes in the competitive landscape including suppliers relationships with online retailers we are very aware of online threats and we are very focused on leveraging our longstanding strengths to effectively compete with all competitive sets while clearly the online channel has grown their share in the automotive aftermarket and virtually every other retail sector todate our portion of the sector of the industry has continued to grow generally in line with the overall market while we can never take any competition lightly we believe we have some clear strengths that allow us to more than effectively compete specifically the trustworthy advice provided by our autozoners each and every day helps customers in many ways in many cases where they dont know what parts or services that they need and we provide basic services to get them on their way we also have the ability to test parts on cars to determine exactly what the problem is with  of the us population within eight miles of an autozone the immediacy to resolve a customers needs with trustworthy advice and having the right highquality parts remains a competitive advantage for us our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations in whatever way they choose to shop with us we are fortunate to operate in one of the stronger retail segments and we continue to be excited about our industrys growth prospects for  as consumers continually look to save money while taking care of their cars we are committed to providing the trustworthy advice they have grown to expect it truly is the valueadd that differentiates us from any other faceless transactions customers have come to expect that advice from us it is with this focus we will implement more enhancements on both our website and instore to provide even more knowledgeable service we dont ever expect an online experience to replace the advice our customers want but they do expect more information on repairing their vehicles this aspect of service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone and it will be long into the future our longterm model is to grow new store square footage at a low singledigit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate therefore we look to routinely grow ebit dollars in the mid singledigit range or better in times of strength and we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares enhancing our earnings per share growth into doubledigits we feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run we believe our steady consistent strategy is correct it is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter our belief is strong consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our longterm performance in the end delivering strong eps growth and roic each and every quarter is how we measure our sales now wed like to open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from alan rifkin from btig your line is open alan rifkin  btig llc thank you very much bill rhodes based on your past experience with the delays in income tax refunds is there any reason why we should not believe that the revenues lost in q will be replaced dollarfordollar in your fiscal third quarter william c rhodes iii  autozone inc thats a great question alan how are you i would say first of all all indications that we see are that the total tax refund dollars will be the same as they have been the last few years so that is a good thing the piece that we dont know and which is unchartered waters for us is the timing is going to be delayed significantly more than it has been in the past weve had times where its been a week or a weekandahalf this time there was a full threeweek or more delay for the most significant of those refunds and so one thing that we question – we dont have any facts to know whether its good bad or indifferent for us is with the timing being in a different time of year do more of those dollars come into our sector or do more of those dollars go into another sector we dont know the answer to that so were somewhat going to have to wait and see what happens alan rifkin  btig llc okay thank you and a followup if i may so with respect to your three initiatives increased delivery the hubs and the mega hubs all of which are at various stages of maturity can you just go through and assess your belief in terms of the potential progress of each of those three and what the ultimate revenue gains and profitability gains and most importantly roic gains can be if you had to rank the three initiatives bill in terms of ultimately what would give you the biggest bang for the buck how would you rank them thank you william c rhodes iii  autozone inc yeah great first of all i would start with hubs weve got  or so hubs that are out there today they are tried and true we first started them around  we somewhat deemphasized them in the middle s and realized in  or  how vitally important they were so we rejuvenated them in  or so and they have been humming right along ever since that gave us the insight that expanded parts coverage is a material differentiator in the marketplace so then we came up with the concept of mega hubs which basically doubles the number of skus that we carry in the local marketplace that takes it to  to  skus ever since we began talking about the mega hub every time weve talked about it weve said they continue to exceed our performance i dont know that we could be more bullish or more open about how good that has worked for us so far so were really excited about that everybody keeps asking us why dont we go faster i promise you were going as fast as we can but a big part of this is finding really highquality retail space thats  square feet thats not easy to do i think our teams have done a great job getting the  that we have open we have about five or so more to open in the second half of the year we hope to be able to open  to  were still trying to figure out what that right number is as we continue to outperform i think that makes the likelihood of the number being higher rather than lower and then the third one is alan rifkin  btig llc  william c rhodes iii  autozone inc im sorry alan rifkin  btig llc no im sorry bill please go ahead william c rhodes iii  autozone inc the third one is multiple frequency of delivery mfd for us and that ones been a little bit of a mix bag so far we absolutely believe its the right thing to do but weve gone and weve changed a significant amount forever in our year history the vast majority of our stores weve delivered onceaweek and so our replenishment algorithms are based on onceaweek deliveries our dcs and the way theyre structured are set for onceaweek deliveries our stores and the way they put up trucks are set for onceaweek deliveries and on and on and on and as weve gone further if you know we kind of slowed this one down about six months ago we slowed it down because we started to uncover some unintended consequences that were happening as a result of those changes we still believe this in some form is going to be the right thing to do for our customer and for our business we still got quite a bit of work to do to make sure that we optimize it so that one is still a little bit in flux the other two are tried and true theyre in full implementation mode we just got some work to do to refine mfd sorry alan alan rifkin  btig llc no thank you very much does the potential exist for any of the hubs to be converted to mega hubs william c rhodes iii  autozone inc yeah thats whats happened with some of them some of them are on a piece of property where we can add another  square feet and so weve done that others of them are landlocked and it may be a great hub store thats in the right place but we have to move it because weve got to get a bigger facility its strictly about the size of the facility alan rifkin  btig llc okay thank you very much william c rhodes iii  autozone inc yeah thank you operator the next question comes from seth sigman credit suisse your line is now open seth i sigman  credit suisse securities usa llc thanks good morning guys william c rhodes iii  autozone inc good morning seth i sigman  credit suisse securities usa llc a couple of questions on gross margin first on the shrink issue it seemed to be one of the biggest differences versus prior quarters have you seen a change in the actual losses or does that just reflect inventory growth over the last few quarters and how do we think about that drag on margin rate going forward into the back half of the year william t giles  autozone inc thats a good question i mean weve had really a number of years of unprecedented shrink results theyve been really historically low and now were seeing that turn the other way and we recognize as you highlighted weve made a lot of changes as bill just kind of walked through a little bit on some of the inventory availability initiatives particularly on more frequent deliveries so weve introduced a lot more activity in the supply chain and the store operations and suspect that that probably has contributed a little bit but i would expect that headwind to continue for a little bit of time it takes time for shrink to be able to turn around its not something thats going to turn around in a particular quarter but i suspect it will continue to improve and the teams are working really hard to be able to bring it down seth i sigman  credit suisse securities usa llc okay and then i guess more broadly there has been some gross margin pressure across the space as you think about pricing have you seen any change in pricing behavior i mean it seems like most of the gross margin issues are companyspecific or isolated but just wondering if youve seen any sort of promotions or pricing changes across the group william t giles  autozone inc yeah thats a good question because when you look at our gross margin weve rifle shot at two  particular individual items both supply chain which is inventory availability initiatives that were very conscious  about shrink which has been in the historic lows and now a little bit higher past that our gross margin rate is very healthy we have not seen any kind of pricing activities in the marketplace that i would consider to be disruptive our merchandising organization continues to work very hard at lowering acquisition costs and have been very successful at it so overall i would categorize our gross margin is very healthy it continues to be very healthy in rational industry weve got a couple of items that are in our control and were working hard at reducing them seth i sigman  credit suisse securities usa llc okay thanks very much operator the next question comes from simeon gutman from morgan stanley your line is open benjamin g zerman  morgan stanley  co llc hey guys this is ben zerman on for simeon thanks for taking my questions i wanted to piggy back a little bit on the inventory initiatives and then ask another question related to miles driven trends related to inventory initiatives it looked like you actually slowed the multifrequency delivery rollouts a little bit this quarter yet the shrink expense popped up can you give us any color around what to expect in terms of gross margins for the back half of the year should we expect them to expand if the shrink in inventory headwinds persist or can you give us some color on that and then i have one more question william c rhodes iii  autozone inc i think first of all we did intentionally slow down the multiple frequency delivery rollout we actually tipped that on the last call that we were going to move from   stores a quarter to  stores in a quarter and thats what we did and we did that because its causing quite a bit of change and with change comes some disruption in our supply chain and we wanted to slow it down so that we can work through some of those elements to change management and honestly its had the desired result i think things are settling down a bit in our distribution centers we added a tremendous amount of workload to them over the last couple of years so were pleased with that change clearly that has resulted in some increased cost in our supply chain you saw that called out in our press release part of that was due to mfd part of that was also due to the significant decline in sales that we had in the last three weeks so i think as we think about it going forward weve been sayings its  or  basis points of headwind going forward regarding the shrink question i wouldnt necessarily draw a direct correlation in slowing down mfd and an increase in shrink as bill previously stated i do think weve been moving a lot of inventory throughout our network over the last couple of years and when you move inventory the more times you handle it the more susceptible you are to shrink i again want to say what he said weve had unprecedented improvements in our shrink expense over the last six years its going the other way now but i am highly confident that our team will get back out in front of it and control it effectively the only problem is when shrink starts going one way or the other it has a bit of a tail to it and takes some time to turn around but i think we would expect that to be a bit of a headwind for the balance of the year benjamin g zerman  morgan stanley  co llc got it thank you and then just one more question around miles driven i know miles driven on at least a oneyear twoyear basis decelerated a little bit in december i dont know if youve seen this data but if you were to slice the miles driven data by average vehicle age and look at each individual vehicle bucket are you seeing any difference in trends between miles driven within your sweet spot of say year old to year old vehicles versus newer vehicles that tend to be with more the dealer while theyre under warranty william t giles  autozone inc no and im not so sure that we have access to slice it that way i mean from our perspective the  increase for  is a great number i mean for us to be able to be anything above a  on miles driven is a really solid number and so its going to reflect more wear and tear and we feel really good about where the age of the vehicles are and the increased wear and tear that they are incurring given the higher miles driven so i think again it points to a really healthy industry benjamin g zerman  morgan stanley  co llc okay thanks guys william t giles  autozone inc thanks operator the next question comes from michael lasser from ubs your line is open michael goldsmith  ubs securities llc good morning its michael goldsmith on for michael lasser this morning thanks a lot for taking my questions my first question is on the tax refunds and the delay in those tax refunds did that have an outsized impact on particular parts categories or the diy or commercial side of the business and does the amount that you can recapture differ between these segments william c rhodes iii  autozone inc yeah i think the second part of your question is yet to be determined historically we think weve recaptured them this time as i said earlier the timeframe is significantly different so well have to wait and see a little bit i think – the parts categories yeah theres some differences i dont think theres really any material differences in which categories respond differently theres some of them deferred maintenance categories like brakes where youll see a more pronounced difference failure category is a little bit less pronounced because you have to get the car up and running that day you asked specifically about differences between retail and commercial and i would say its definitely more pronounced in retail but as it lingered we saw it increase in commercial all of this is going to play itself out over the next three weeks or four weeks we think it is transitory in nature theres nothing we could have done about it as we now look back on it i dont think theres anything we would do differently as a result well just somewhat have to deal with the consequences of them trying to deal with fraud which i think is the right thing to do michael goldsmith  ubs securities llc thats helpful and then as a followup given that we had a little bit of a colder december than last year but generally a milder winter overall how does that impact the setup for the rest of the year for zone and the industry overall william c rhodes iii  autozone inc yeah to me thats the most germane question that were talking about we loved what happened in december last year we didnt have that kind of winter weather and it was very encouraging to us all the longterm forecasts said that it was going to last longer and be more pronounced but basically as soon as we got through the christmas holidays the weather got much more mild we would have preferred that december would have repeated itself in january in the past weve had a very mild winter followed by a more normalized winter and weve seen those sales rebound in the spring and particularly in the summer were a little bit uncertain as we go into this year we think clearly some of the deferred maintenance items that were pulled into december and january last year that did not happen so we would anticipate getting those deferred maintenance items in the third quarter and in the beginnings of the fourth quarter but as far as failure items because of the difficult winter i think its still yet to be seen so – chassis parts and brakes and the like so were going to have to wait and see if its a little bit of a different cycle for us michael goldsmith  ubs securities llc thanks again operator thank you the next question comes from brian nagel from oppenheimer your line is open brian nagel  oppenheimer  co inc hi good morning william t giles  autozone inc good morning brian nagel  oppenheimer  co inc so i hope not to beat a dead horse here but first question quickly on the tax refunds i think its basically a followup to the prior question if you look at i guess the results we saw today it seems as though this delay likely had a larger impact on the diy side so the question i have is that – and i understand this delay is different than prior delays but as you look back over time is that usually what happens do you usually see a more pronounced impact on the diy side william c rhodes iii  autozone inc yeah i would say number one were much more mature in our retail business than we are in our commercial business so any macro headwinds or tailwinds we see more pronounced in the retail business but clearly every time weve seen it it has been a bigger impact on retail than it has commercial this time we clearly saw it in commercial although it lagged a weekandahalf or so brian nagel  oppenheimer  co inc okay and the second question i have – and i appreciate your comments bill in your prepared remarks regarding ecommerce because that has been a topic lately so the question i have is has autozone taken any proactive – any more proactive actions lately such as pricing – more aggressively pricing against some of the online competitors or even in advertising to protect the business more from this type of competition william c rhodes iii  autozone inc i would say no i would say we are continuing to execute our strategy and i also want to say our heads not in the sand were very much cognizant of whats going on in and around us but i would say our pricing philosophies our advertising philosophies todate have not changed as a result of any competitive threat i would say were constantly looking for ways to optimize our pricing and were constantly looking for ways to improve our advertising and clearly digital advertising is becoming more and more important whether thats going up against an onlineonly competitor or going up against traditional brickandmortar competitors that is becoming a more and more important element but i dont see that as a shift because of online competition brian nagel  oppenheimer  co inc got it thank you william c rhodes iii  autozone inc yeah thank you operator next question comes from matt fassler from goldman sachs your line is open chandni luthra  goldman sachs  co thanks thank you for taking my question this is chandni luthra on behalf of matt fassler most of my questions have been answered but just quickly wanted to touch base on one or two topics in terms of tax refunds last week seemed to have seen a little bit of a pickup in the refund activity bill could you talk if your comps also saw a bit of refunds in the last week or this week just curious there william c rhodes iii  autozone inc yeah sure last week wednesday thursday and friday i think there was something like  billion of tax refunds that were released not that were paying attention we clearly saw our sales increase as a result of that i want to be really careful about getting into too finite of issues on whats going on daytoday or even over a weekend were in this business for the long term but clearly as those large amount of refunds hit the market we saw a pickup in our business and ill leave it at that chandni luthra  goldman sachs  co great thank you and then a followup on the lines of a question that brian just asked in terms of the online business the other category alldata autoanything that declined  and was weak second quarter running how are you thinking about improving trends in this business thank you william t giles  autozone inc yeah i think on both very different businesses by the way and they have made some improvements since the previous quarter so i think theyll continue to grow i think autoanything has had some challenges over the last six or so months and theres some real opportunities for us to expand sku assortments and also to increase our search engine optimization activities et cetera in order to drive traffic so i think that well continue to be competitive there and alldata continues to be a very strong business and a very important business in the commercial segment as well so both businesses are flattish at the moment down a little bit but theyre making some improvements and we expect to see them continue to make improvements over the next few quarters chandni luthra  goldman sachs  co perfect thank you operator thank you the next question is coming from the line of mike baker from deutsche bank your line is open michael baker  deutsche bank securities inc thanks i guess you had said you havent really changed your pricing strategy so ill ask the question why not how do you look at amazons pricing versus yours i think a lot of us have done pricing studies and it does look like they are a little bit below you so why wouldnt that necessitate a change to your strategy william c rhodes iii  autozone inc yeah i dont think theres any question that theyre priced below us in many different cases but i think the value proposition is extraordinarily different number one the convenience factor you can walk into our store and the sense of immediacy particularly if you have a failure part thats right at your hand so you can get back on the road immediately versus having to wait overnight or a couple of days in most cases i dont think many consumers today are willing to wait when their car is down for that so thats one element there are many elements another element is weve got tremendous trustworthy advice in our autozoners instore that comes with a cost and therefore its part of the value proposition but for an autozoner to help a customer figure out what is going on with their vehicle and what the solution is theres value to the customer in that we do core returns – a significant amount of our sales come with a core return where theyre to take that core back and on and on and on so i think we feel like theres a significant value proposition differential between us and any online competitor and what happens with that over time well see weve dealt with price competition for years and some of that price competition for instance is in mass merchandising and weve effectively managed through that over the years because theres a different value proposition so we dont see it necessarily any different michael baker  deutsche bank securities inc so i guess to follow up on that – and those are good points are there any way to quantify those points whether it be the need for immediacy you gave us the yearoveryear growth in buyonline instore pickup but what percent of your total sales was that or maybe what percent of your sales come with some consultation rather than just someone grabbing an item and going percent of returns anything like that and by the way can you help us what do you mean by a core return im not familiar william c rhodes iii  autozone inc so a core return is if you buy an alternator from us we will sell you the alternator for lets say  and has a  core because the old alternator is – its a remanufactured alternator and the old alternator is the raw material to make the next one so theres a deposit if you will is what a core charge is so the point is theres a tremendous reverse supply chain in this business that doesnt exist in many other businesses a lot other businesses can talk about returns but this one has a significant reverse supply chain on buyonline pickupinstore its not a significant part of our business today so i dont want to overstate that and then you asked how are we going to determine what this right price differential is over time i think were going to do it just the same way weve done the last  years its trial and error weve had different competitive channels over the years and we have very effectively been able to optimize our pricing in light of the different competitive sets and i think well continue to do that michael baker  deutsche bank securities inc okay good i think ill turn it over to someone else now thanks william c rhodes iii  autozone inc thanks william t giles  autozone inc thanks mike operator the next question we have is coming from dan wewer raymond james your line is open dan r wewer  raymond james  associates inc thanks bill one of the territories that did not achieve aboveaverage samestore sales growth was the southeast weve seen a large number of oreilly stores opening in the state of florida can you talk about how the growing competitive overlap in that state could be impacting sales growth william c rhodes iii  autozone inc yeah dan i wouldnt overstate their role into south florida we have different competitors that are going into different parts of the country all the time clearly florida is a strong market for us but were not the most dominant player as far as store count in florida there are others that have significantly more stores than us i dont think were seeing anything different in florida than weve seen as weve had competitive encroachments in other parts of the country dan r wewer  raymond james  associates inc okay and then just a second question and talking about mexico it sounds like that could be a longerterm challenge given some of the political decisions being made in washington is there anything that you can do to – whether its hedging or pricing anything to improve the profitability of your stores in mexico william c rhodes iii  autozone inc yeah i would start with first of all were very pleased with the performance of our mexico business i think our team down there has done a superb job of managing in light of this significant devaluation of the peso frankly this all started a couple of years ago and if you recall we were talking last year that we thought it would kind of be a onetime deal and then would have muted impact going forward that clearly has not happened post the election the peso significantly deteriorated yet again we cant manage the peso we can go off and hedge but weve elected not to do that weve elected to try to do most of our hedging by buying in local currency and therefore we hedge the product cost versus hedging the profitabilities but at the end of the day if theres a deterioration in the peso it hurts our us dollar profits but at the end of the day we would be doing the same thing in mexico that weve been doing all along and its been a good business for us and we anticipate it being a good business for a long time dan r wewer  raymond james  associates inc and then the last question i have is on the better momentum in commercial do you think thats primarily the sales training that you alluded to earlier focusing on yes weve got it are you expanding that message to a larger number of commercial customers or is it just going to your existing platinum or gold accounts and hitting them more aggressively william c rhodes iii  autozone inc i think its multifaceted number one yes were out communicating to our customers yes weve got it in a way that we never have before we believe we can do that because were in a better position than we ever have been before so i would add a lot of the emphasis to just strictly the improvements that we have in inventory availability and then as weve talked over the last year another big part of what were trying to do is significantly increase the engagement of our store managers and our district managers in this business many of us myself included grew up with the retail business and so for lack of a better term its kind of our comfort zone or our fast ball weve got to force ourselves to get deeper and deeper into the commercial business and i think were doing that over time and i think that will pay longterm significant dividends dan r wewer  raymond james  associates inc okay great thank you william c rhodes iii  autozone inc thank you dan operator thank you the next question we have is coming from steven forbes from guggenheim securities your line is open steven forbes  guggenheim securities llc good morning guys william c rhodes iii  autozone inc good morning william t giles  autozone inc good morning steven forbes  guggenheim securities llc i wanted to focus on growth in the commercial segment given the acceleration this quarter and maybe just highlevel – some highlevel commentary on how this business is progressing relative to your expectations in both segments right building existing customers and then also gaining new customers william t giles  autozone inc i think on both sides weve been very pleased overall even with the recent performance of the quarter i mean we had an acceleration in our commercial programs overall were clearly gaining share growing significantly faster than the industry the team has put in several new programs in order to help drive both existing customers as well as prospecting and attaining new customers as well so that business does seem to be healthier and it seems on a track to continue to grow so i think on both sides its been healthy but its really more the existing customers that have been really strong and thats the one area that were really focused on steven forbes  guggenheim securities llc and then maybe staying on that topic as a followup i mean is there anything to call out regionally i mean we talked about some of the regions so far this call from a performance standpoint within the commercial segment any one outstripping others and then do you know where youre gaining share from when you think about growing your existing customer base or is it really broad william t giles  autozone inc its very broad and in fairness we have a low market share so we believe that theres enormous greenfield opportunities for us across the country all the regions performed reasonably well clearly the weatheraffected regions in prior years had been more challenged but they werent this year they continued to perform well so we see it pretty balanced across the country so we feel pretty good about the commercial team as a whole and how theyre performing steven forbes  guggenheim securities llc thank you operator thank you and that concludes our questionandanswer session ill hand the call over back to mr bill rhodes thank you william c rhodes iii  autozone inc okay thank you before we conclude the call i would like it take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be very solid were excited about our growth prospects for the balance of the year well not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives we have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year but i want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint as we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing longterm shareholder value we are confident autozone will continue to be very successful thank you all for participating in todays call have a great day operator that concludes todays call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect copyright policy all transcripts
