is our story as told by brian friedman ghp investment advisors ghpia president “it was the mids and cpas robert hochstadt and steven levey had been offering comprehensive financial plans for their clients for years their firm gelfond hochstadt pangburn pc now called ghp horwath pc had become one of the first accounting firms nationally to have a standalone financial planning division bob encouraged longtime friend and partner steve to get accredited in all aspects of financial planning steve became one of the first cpas in the us to earn a personal financial specialist pfs designation and not long after that bob earned his pfs while both had earned national recognition with the american institute of certified public accountants and had clients around the world they did not like relying on commissionbased stockbrokers to implement the investment portion of the plan this is where i came in as a cfa charter holder with extensive experience in investment management and economic research i was looking to combine my experience with a quality cpa firm i had just read a forbes magazine article that featured steve and the firm of gelfond hochstadt pangburn pc and realized that i  knew bob — he was a good friend of my father’s and i knew his oldest son growing up in denver i sought out bob and discovered that he and steve had recently formed ghpia and were ready to take it to the next level all three of us were already thinking about the opportunity to create a comprehensive wealth management firm — so the timing could not have been more perfect ghp had been offering financial planning services to its clients for years so it had a decided advantage when cpa firms were allowed to also offer investment management services in the mids i joined ghpia in  with bob steve and other ghp horwath directors as my partners the rest is history or rather history in the making” — brian ghp investment advisors inc  california suite  denver co  tel   privacy policy  terms
