to hire a home architect who will be involved in all phases of the design process from the initial concept to the completed construction the architect is often the first person you will hire for your project if necessary they might also help you select and hire queensland subcontractors which can include the builders engineers and landscaper interior architects are also involved in negotiating contracts for all involved participants it is for these reasons that it is extremely important for you to have a good relationship with the bryden residential architect you hire he or she can be the tiebreaking vote between you and the general contractor and can be your biggest advocate during the construction process different architecture firms in bryden qld au provide different services so the scope of the work can span from predesign environmental impact studies to selecting furniture and finishes depending on what your specific needs arewhat sort of process can i expect from a residential architectas far as the process goes the architecture firm or individual that you choose will start with concept drawings and finish with construction drawings and documents some firms even design with d renderings and videos but that should not be assumed there should be plenty of meetings between you and your building designer until you have agreed upon a design that you are completely happy with always keep in mind that the designer will have building codes to follow and likely preexisting design limitations when dealing with a remodel so while they might not be able to execute your exact ideas they always have your safety and aesthetics in mind one of the most important duties of a residential architect is to serve as managers and supervise most aspects of construction as well as facilitate communication between all other contractors so you can expect them to be present throughout the entire building process to ensure everything is executed as plannedit is very important to hire the right professional for the job remember that the most wellknown or established designer might not provide the best architectural services for your needs it all comes down to the individual project research and ask people whose work you like for recommendations its important to have somewhat of an idea of the style of house architecture that you prefer as well as the amount you would like to spend residential architects in bryden qld au are natural problem solvers they will assess the entire situation and help you to solve your problems too dont settle for a single company too early call and interview a few make sure that you feel like your personalities will mesh well and that you like their professional perspectivequestions to ask prospective bryden interior architects what is your fee structure what does the cost include do you have professional liability insurance can you handle my special requests ada leed etc what types of renderings d video illustrative will you produce what is your experience with similar projects when do you expect to start and be finished with the project what do your services include its best that the services are until construction is completed what happens when the cost exceeds the budget can you provide me with references would you say your work has a defining style this is important in case the architects personal style will interfere with your vision will you help with hiring a general contractor and subcontractors what do you estimate the cost will be what will i need to provide are there any complications you foresee

was drivingmanufacturers of the windscreen were not liable because too much time had lapsed between the manufacture of the windscreen and the incident the windscreen had been in place for over a year in addition it may have shattered for other reasons such as poor fitting by the car makersimportance of causationandrews v hopkinson plaintiff wished to acquire a secondhand car from the d who carried on the business of a dealer in secondhand cars before entering into a hirepurchase agreement with a finance company to whom the d sold the secondhand car chosen by the plaintiff the d said   its a good little bus i would stake my life on it you will have no trouble with it  he undertook to arrange for an engineers report to be prepared for submission to the proposed insurers the engineers inspection included the testing of the steering wheel for excessive play but he did not jack up the car upon being told that the plaintiff had effected an insurance with a different company and did not carry out a full inspection or complete his report while the car was being driven by the plaintiff along a main road it suddenly swerved towards a lorry and collided with it causing the plaintiff serious injuries an examination of the car disclosed that the cause of the accident was the failure of the draglink joint of the steering mechanism owing to the badly worn condition of the socket and the ball pin  there was a breach of the express warranty that the car was in good condition and reasonably safe and fit for use on the public highway the warranty was enforceable even though the plaintiff bought the motorcar from a finance company the whole of the damages could fairly be considered as loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events from the breach of warranty and so recoverable as damages for breach  the d was also guilty of negligence in failing to make the necessary examination or at least in failing to warn the plaintiff that no such examination had been carried outdesign defectsdifficult to detect but have potentially very serious consequences as they will affect every product see the thalidomide litigation in the s calls began to appear for stricter liability for manufacturers of defective products growing pressure for reform combined with ec initiatives to harmonise the rules on defective products in member states resulted in a change in the law ec directive aim was to achieve a fair apportionment of the risks inherent in modern technological productioncpa issue with donoghue v stevensondepended on proof of negligence this was often difficult to prove in practice the costs and risks of litigation left many consumers without an effective remedyconsumer protection act  basic premisevictim that is anyone who suffers injury or damage caused by the product should be able to sue the producer of the product provided that he or she can prove that the product was defective it then falls to the producer to raise any defences listed under s  although there are also some explicit limits on recovery products are defined broadly they include any goods electricity coal gas and even agricultural productswho is liabless manufacturers or producers ownbranders sb parties importing goods into the european community sc not for supliersjoint liablenot for suppliers unless they dont supply requested information in timea digdeep plc which provides coal to the publicdigdeep provides coal coal is obviously a natural element but we are told in s  that a producer includes someone who has won or abstracted the product hence digdeep plc is a producer and therefore could be sued under the actb eric sells widgets to the public he bought them from fred who did not tell him where they came from there is no manufacturing mark on the widgetseric is not a producer he has not manufactured the widgets he merely supplies them any liability under the act will depend on s  this states that where damage is caused wholly or partly by a defect in a product any person who supplied the product shall be liable if the person who suffered the damage requests the supplier to identify one or more of the persons to whom s  applies in relation to the product that request is made within a reasonable period after the damage occurs and at a time when it is not reasonably practicable for the person making the request to identify all those persons the supplier fails within a reasonable period after receiving the request either to comply with the request or to identify the person who supplied the product to him eric cannot inform any victim of the manufacturer¡¦s identity he can however identify fred provided he informs the victim within a reasonable period of the identity of fred he will not be liablec george lives in brussels he bought a wahoo jeep from japan he now wishes to sell it to harriet who lives in londongeorge has imported a product from outside the ec into the ec he is not the producer he could only be liable if he satisfies sc which renders liable any person who has imported the product into a member state from a place outside the member states in order in the course of any business of his to supply it to another however george does not appear to be acting in the course of business thus he is not liable under the actd indigo plc sell jeans marked indigos they are manufactured for them by jackiejackie is obviously within the act as a producer however to the p the jeans are marked indigos s b provides that any person who by putting his name on the product or using a trade mark or other distinguishing mark in relation to the product has held himself out to be the producer of the product will be liable both jackie and indigo are therefore potentially liable under the actwhen is

through blood transfusions which had used blood or blood products obtained from infected donors although the national blood authority had known of the risk of infection from at least the s it was at that time impossible to detect it was argued that persons generally could not expect  clean blood in view of such undetectable risksact imposed strict liability and it was irrelevant that the national blood authority had taken all reasonable steps to detect such risks patients having a blood transfusion were entitled to expect that the blood would be safe and if it was not it was defectivenote burton j specifically mentioned that warnings could render even nonstandardproducts safe provided that the warnings were clear and widely knowna v national blood authority  standardnonstandard distinctionexplained that nonstandard products or rogue products would more easily be shown to be defective they were not produced in the way that the d intended which immediately suggested some flaw in contrast standard products  that is products which complied with the manufacturers intention  would be more difficult to prove to be defective the court would look at all the factors listed in ss  and  to ascertain whether they were in fact defectivecourt found that the blood infected with hepatitis c was a nonstandard product  it differed from the standard product of uninfected bloodabouzaid v mothercare uk one of the elastic straps slipped and lashed back the buckle attached to the elastic strap hit him in the eye causing serious permanent damage the claimant sued mothercare the supplier of the product claiming damages in negligence and also under the consumer protection act mothercare conceded that it was the producer of the product within the meaning of part  of the act arguments for dthe product was not defective when the product was supplied because there had been no previous instances of this type of injury and in  consumers could not reasonably have expected the product to be designed differently so as to avoid the risk of this type of injury even if the product were defective the respondent was entitled to use the development risks defence in section   e of the act this section provides that a producer will not be responsible for a defect in a product if the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the relevant time was not such that a producer might be expected to have discovered the defect for the same reasons it did not act negligently in  by supplying the product in that form and the claimant acted carelessly in trying to attach the product and was therefore partly responsible for his own injury consulting engineer retained as an expert witness by the parties concluded that in  no manufacturer of childcare products could reasonably have recognised the potential risk of this type of accident because at that time even experts in the safety of childcare products had not recognised the problem he further concluded that he would advise a manufacturer today that such a product would have a safety defect unless the potential risk of injuries was eliminated by design or consumers were warned of the possible risks and how to avoid them such warnings would need to be included in instructions for fitting the cosytoes that avoided the difficulties experienced by the c and his motherca approach to dcourt of appeal accepted the experts evidence that no prudent manufacturer would have anticipated the risk at the time therefore there had been no breach by mothercare of any common law duty of carethe case depended on whether the product had a defect as defined in section  of the act section  provides that a product has a defect if the safety of the product is not such as persons generally are entitled to expect at the time the product was purchased the claimant argued that the risk arose because of the tendency of elastic to whip back this risk was the same in  as it was in  and therefore if it constituted a defect in  it constituted a defect in the court of appeal considered that a defect within the consumer protection act depended on a consumers expectations of safety the court considered whether public expectations had changed between  and  it concluded that there had been no change therefore the product was defective in  the court accepted that the public was entitled to expect a certain level of safety in a product even where a producer could not reasonably have anticipated a particular risk and guarded against it this was the purpose behind the strict liability provisions in the consumer protection act court of appeal considered that whether a producer might be expected to have discovered the defect had nothing to do with the state of scientific or technical knowledge at the time it would have been a simple matter to discover the defect by performing a practical test no advance in scientific or technical knowledge between  and  would have been required to perform such a test the only reason that such a test had not been carried out was that the manufacturers had presumably not thought of doing one the court also expressed doubts as to whether a record of accidents could fall within the definition of scientific or technical knowledgeabouzaid v mothercare uk vimpkey conclusionsthe producer was found liable under the consumer protection acts strict liability provisions even though it was not negligent  the exercise of all proper care will not necessarily protect the producer from strict liability if a consumer is injured by a defect in the product a manufacturer or supplier may be liable under strict liability even if the risk could not have been recognised at the time of supply the development risks defence will be available only where there has been some scientific or technical advance since the time of supply which enabled the defect to be identified consumer expectations of safety are the key to defining a defect under the consumer protection act how these expectations may change over time is an unresolved problem under the act also it is not the consumers actual expectations of safety that is important under the act but what consumers are entitled to expect grey areas will still cause problems until more cases have been through the courts for example in richardson v lrc products it was held by the high court last year that in the case of a condom which ruptured in use the product was not defective because the public was not entitled to expect that any method of contraception intended to defeat nature will be  effectiveworsley v tambrands ltd claimant suffered toxic shock syndrome tsswhich she alleged was caused by a tampon manufactured by the defendant thedefendant denied causation and argued that there was at most a statistical associationbetween tampon use and tss since the claim was disposed of on the defendantssubmission that there was no case to answer the question of medical causation wasunresolvedcs h had thrown away the leaflet contained in the box which incorporated warnings of the symptoms of tss and the steps to be taken in the event of their manifestation thus the c was forced to argue that the full warnings should have been displayed on the box andor that the warnings over the years which she had read should have been designed to make a greater impact on her memoryi the d had placed on the outside of the box a clearly legible warning directing the user to the leaflet contained inside ii the leaflet was legible literate unambiguous and adequate to inform the user of the warning signs of tss and the steps to be take if those signs manifested themselves these findings were sufficient to dispose of the allegation of an information defect in the product the judge went on to find that iii the d was unable to cater for lost leaflets or those who choose not to replace them as the c could have doneworsley v tambrands ltd causation issuecausation without making a distinction between the two causes of action to which different tests it is submitted should be applied on page  the judge stated that the c must prove the tampon was defective and that the damage was caused in whole or part by the defect this follows closely the statutory wording at page  however the issues are characterised as whether the british leaflet fell below the cl or statutory standard and if so whether a different design would have caused the c to act differently it is arguable that the second question is only relevant to the causation test in negligence but was applied to both causes of action the statutory test is whether the defect caused the damage in relation to manufacturing and design defects there appears to be no place for a requirement for the c to prove a different outcome in the absence of the defect complained of in the case of a design defect however the position is less clear because the effect of the defect is to influence the conduct of the c in those circumstances it is arguably necessary to look at the hypothetical conduct of the c in the absence of the influencing factor in order to complete the link between defect and damageambrose industries manufactures relaxeze pills for people suffering from headaches on the box it states in bold type be warned there is a very small risk that these pills may cause epileptic fits in some people anyone at risk of epilepsy should consult their doctor before use this is also stated in the instructions accompanying the pills which the user is instructed to keep beryl buys the pills and throws away the box with the instructions inside she takes one pill and then has an epileptic fit would a court find relaxeze to be defective under s ambrose is a producer under the act ss  a the pills it has manufactured have caused beryl a serious injury but ambrose will only be liable under the act if the pills are found to be defective under s  it depends whether they provide the safety which persons generally are entitled to expect they are a standard product that is ambrose knows that each pill will contain a risk of fits looking at s  generally we note that the packaging contains an express warning as do the instructions inside beryl it would seem reads neither the packaging nor the instructions but they are available guidance may be gained from the case of worsley v tambrands ltd  piqr p here mrs worsley on purchasing tampons had been warned of the risk of toxic shock syndrome on the packaging of the product and in detail on a leaflet which accompanied the product which the p was advised to read and keep ebsworth j held thatthe reality of this case is that the c had lost the relevant leaflet and for some inexplicable reason misremembered its contents as to the onset of the illness that does not render the box or the leaflet defective and the claim must fail the d had done what a menstruating woman was in all the circumstances entitled to expect  they had a clearly legible warning on the outside of the box directing the user to the leaflet  the leaflet was legible literate and unambiguous and contained all the material necessary to convey both the warning signs and the action required if any of them were present and  they cannot cater for lost leaflets or for those who choose not to replace themin worsley therefore mrs worsley should have been alerted due to the warning of the initial symptoms of her illness and would have been able to go to her doctor before it became lifethreatening here ambrose would argue that it gave a clear warning which should have alerted beryl to the risk of an epileptic attack and if she was at risk she should have consulted her doctor although worsley is clearly a stronger case in that there was a time lapse between the initial symptoms and the onset of serious illness it could be argued that by analogy to worsley ambrose has given a sufficient warning of the dangers to render the product safecpa defencesstrict liability does not mean

anyone the damage was likely to be severe that the likelihood of such damage was due to characteristics not normally found in alsatians except in the   particular circumstances  namely an untrained

the appeal that in all the circumstances it was not unreasonable for the d to keep the dog in the yard to protect his property that accordingly as the plaintiff was a trespasser the d was excepted from liability under s  by s   b and further that as the plaintiff entered the yard knowing all about the dog she must be taken to have voluntarily accepted the risk of damage thereby absolving the d

a number of peacocks he dotes on the animals and feeds them every dayone day he decides to take his pet dogs to visit his sister agatha he piles the dogs into the back of his van and says goodbye to the peacocks one of the peacocks florence follows the car out of the drive and wanders into the main road barry who is driving too fast drives into florence and suffers severe injuries alexander who is driving very slowly sees the crash in his rearview mirror and stops he backs up the van in an attempt to help barry staggers out of the car and towards alexanders van he opens the back of the van in an attempt to obtain assistance but is attacked by jupiter one of alexanders pet dogs jupiter is normally very mild but is very protective of the van in which the dogs always travel on visits to agatha advise barry on his claim for personal injuries suffered due to the crash and the attack by jupiterbarry will attempt to claim under the animals act  first he must identify whether the animals involved will be classified as dangerous or nondangerous under the definition in s  a dangerous species is a species  a which is not commonly domesticated in the british islands and b whose fully grown animals normally have such characteristics that they are likely unless restrained to cause severe damage or that any damage they may cause is likely to be severe peacocks are not commonly domesticated but dogs arethe claim involving florence will therefore proceed under s  this provides that the keeper of the dangerous animal  here alexander  will be strictly liable for any damage caused by such an animal we can assume that florences escape caused the accident see mirvahedy v henley   ac  horses escaping from a field on to a dual carriageway defences do however exist barry has been at least contributorily n it may even be found on more detailed investigation that the accident was his fault entirely s  barry could try an alternative claim against alexander for negligence  how did the peacock escape  but the defences would be equally applicable against such a claimjupiter is a pet dog and therefore any liability would arise under s  barry would have to satisfy the three tests it is foreseeable that a dog may cause severe injury to an individual jupiters reaction however might be seen as the ordinary act of a dog defending his territory however in curtis v betts   wlr  the court found the attack on a young boy by a normally docile dog while being transferred into a land rover to be transported to the local park for exercise did satisfy s b the dog was very protective of areas regarded as its territory and this could be regarded as a temporary characteristic equally therefore we can argue that jupiter defending the back of the van was a temporary characteristic capable of satisfying s b liability would then depend on whether alexander was aware of this factif we assume that he does do any defences arise again we can argue fault or contributory negligence but here the court would ask whether barry should have been aware that there were dogs in the back of the van bearing in mind his condition at the time it certainly would be difficult to claim that he voluntarily assumed that risk under s  as there is no evidence that he entered the back of the van he cannot be deemed a trespasser under s  barrys claim will thus depend largely on whether the court finds him to be at fault and if so to what degreeproduct liability directive v faultin contrast to the approach under traditional fault liability the product liability directive concentrates on the objective characteristics of a given product and asks whether it is to be considered defective the conduct of the manufacturer is not taken into consideration when assessing his responsibility instead he is accountable in an objective way ie he is strictly liable for any damage caused by his productproducer in the directivemanufacturer of a finished product the producer of any raw material or the manufacturer of a component part or any person who by putting his name trademark or other distinguishing feature on the product presents himself as its producer also any persons who import into the community a product for sale hire leasing or any form of distribution in the course of their business when the producer cannot be identified each supplier of the product is treated as its producer unless he informs the consumer in reasonable time who the real producer or the person who supplied him with the product is the same applies to an imported product if the product does not indicate the identity of the importer even if the name of the producer is indicatedproducts concerning the directive are  all moveables even though incorporated into another moveable or into an immovable with the exception of   primary agriculture products and game   this is a very wide definition it clearly includes all finished goods as well as raw materials and components incorporated in a finished product the product does not have to be a consumer product but it must have been industrially produced electricity is specifically included in the definitionplaintiff is required to provedefect and damage and the causal link between them damage according to article  means either damage caused by death or by personal injuries or damage to or destruction of an item of property other than the defective product itself provided that a the item of property is of a type ordinarily intended for private use or consumption and b was used by the injured person mainly for his own private use or consumption compensation for nonmaterial damage pain and suffering loss of reputation etc is expressly excluded from the directive leaving this to the national legislationconcept of defectivenesstested by reference not to the products functioning and performance but to the expectation of safety which should apply to it in the circumstances three factors are specified in the directive as amongst those which are to be taken into account in deciding whether a product is defective    the presentation of the product   this could include consideration of marketing product description information and warnings in this case the expectation of safety of a product may be qualified by instructions contraindication and precautions issued to the consumer the use to which it could reasonably be expected that the product would be put   it is not surprising that the use to which the product was in fact put when it caused the damage is taken into account given that the general approach to consumer safety in the directive is objective a producer may often find that his product has been put to an unintended use misused or abused the third factor is   the time when the product was put into circulation  a product should not be defective if it becomes dangerous only after extensive or reasonable life if it may become less safe with time however it must be accompanied by an adequate warning thus use by a consumer after an expire date clearly marked on a product should excuse the manufacturer the directive also provides expressly that   a product shall not be considered defective for the sole reason that a better product is subsequently put into circulation preamble of the directive which mentions that there should be   a fair apportionment of risk between the injured person and the producer so that the producer should be able to free himself from liability if he furnishes proof as to the existence of certain exonerating circumstances   the producer can exculpate himself if he proves in accordance with article a that he did not put the product into circulation or b that in the circumstances it is probable that the defect which caused the damage did not exist at the time when the product was put into circulation by him or that this defect come into being afterwards or c that the product was neither manufactured by him for safe or any form of distribution for economic purposes nor manufactured or distributed by him in the course of his businessproof of causation rests on the plaintiffnotion of strict liability in the directive entails that the consumer must prove that the product caused the injury and also that but for a defect in the product that injury would not have arisencritique and economic analysis of the directiveegime of strict liability for defective products appears to represent a development in favour of consumers at the expense of producers in fact the system is intended to address at least some of the problems which arose under the contract and fault liability theories when applied to the area of consumer protection but although the range of potential ds has been extended this may not necessarily lead to an increase in the findings of liability itself proof of causation still rests on the cproducer can avoid liability by seemingly only having to prove that he complied with docavailability of the development risks defence is highly problematic in england it may be advisable to forego the proof of the product being defective in favour of an action for breach of the implied condition of merchantable quality proof of causation still rests on the cdirective in no way alters other existing national rules on the burden of proof producer can avoid liability by seemingly only having to prove that he complied with the general duty of care to which he might have been expected to conform in manufacturing and supplying a product and therefore that the defect probably did not exist at that time in fault liability the question is whether the producers conduct was reasonable the question of what constitutes reasonable conduct can only be answered in the context of the state of actual and constructive knowledge of the d of the relevant time which in turn involves consideration of the discoverability of the problemdevelopment risks defencejustification of the development risks defence is the encouragement a research into new products a producer confronted with absolute liability for unforeseeable defects will obviously not risk marketing any new products because of the cost of potential liability and the danger of damage to reputation in the event of successful proceedings against him this is to the ultimate detriment of the consumerit becomes a matter of strategy thereafter given the availability of insurance whether it is advisable to allow the development risks losses to fall upon the individuals or whether it is more desirable to require all consumers to contribute to the costs of insurance when making their purchasescommon product liability regime in europe encompasses two main purposesfair apportionment of risks and the enhancement of market unitysignificant differences between cpa and directiveessence of the present law is that the producer of a defective product is liable for damage caused by that product unless he can rely on one of the defences thus the system focuses on the condition of the product instead of the conduct of its producertitle of the act can be misleading however as it will protect not only a consumer but anyone who suffers injury or damage as a result of a defective product the c must show a damage b defect in the product and c a causal link between the twosection  there is a defective product if the safety of the product is not such as persons generally are entitled to expect the definition is not confined to or which are dangerous to health but includes risk to property and products damage and inconveniencedifficultyit fails to provide a readily ascertainable objective standard against which a manufacturer can ensure the safety of his product and in that respect does not move too for ahead from the previous position under the law of tdefences are found in section  of the actone is that the defect is attributable to compliance with any statutory requirement or ec obligation also that the person proceeded against did not at any time supply the product to another which covers cases of mistaken identity where the wrong manufacturer or supplier is sued or where the goods are stolen from the manufacturer or distributor the third defence exculpates the manufacturer for goods supplied for nonprofit reasons eg gifts charity etc another defence can be mode from the fact that the defect did not exist in the product at the relevant time the most important one is the development risks defence which has been incorporated into the act in england whereby   the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the relevant time was not such that a producer of products of the same description as the producer in question might be expected to have discovered the defect if it had existed in his products while they were under his control  advertisementupgrade to remove ads board of directors  clearford – water managed english   español      –  legget drive
