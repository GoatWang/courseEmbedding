lending cash collateral is unable or unwilling or is perceived whether by market participants ratings agencies pricing services or otherwise as unable or unwilling to make timely principal andor interest payments or to otherwise honor its obligations securities are subject to varying degrees of credit risk which are often reflected in their credit ratings and a fund holding a fixed income security is subject to the risk that the security s credit rating will be downgraded securities issued by the us treasury historically have presented minimal credit risk however at least one major rating agency downgraded the longterm us credit rating in  due to the rising public debt burden and perception of greater policymaking uncertainty in the us and introduced greater uncertainty about the ability of the us to repay its obligations a further credit rating downgrade or a us credit default could decrease the value and increase the volatility of a portfolio s investments to the extent that a portfolio has exposure to securities issued by the us treasury counterparty risk a portfolio is also subject to the risk that a counterparty to a derivatives contract repurchase agreement aloan of portfolio securities or an unsettled transaction may be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments or otherwise honor its obligations to the portfolio if a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations goes bankrupt or otherwise experiences a business interruption a portfolio could miss investment opportunities or otherwise hold investments it would prefer to sell resulting in losses for the portfolio counterparty risk may be pronounced during unusually adverse market conditions and may be particularly acute in environments in which financial services firms are exposed to systemic risks of the type evidenced by the  insolvency of lehman brothers and subsequent market disruptions portfolios that invest directly in foreign nonus currencies or in securities that trade in or receive revenues in foreign currencies or in derivatives that provide exposure to foreign currencies are subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the us dollar or in the case of hedging positions that the us dollar will decline in value relative to the currency being hedged currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons including changes in interest rates intervention or the failure to intervene by us or nonus governments central banks or supranational entities such as the international monetary fund or by the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the united states or abroad as a result a portfolio s exposure to foreign currencies including investments in foreign currencydenominated securities may reduce the returns of that portfolio the local emerging market currencies in which a portfolio may be invested from time to time may experience substantially greater volatility against the us dollar than the major convertible currencies of developed countries derivatives are financial contracts whose value depends on or is derived from the value of an underlying asset reference rate or index the derivatives that may be used by a portfolio are discussed in more detail under characteristics and risks of securities and investment techniques derivatives in this prospectus and described in more detail under investment objectives and policies in the statement of additional information a portfolio may but is not required to use derivatives as part of a strategy designed to reduce exposure to other risks such as risks associated with changes in interest rates or currency risk a portfolio may also use derivatives for leverage which increases opportunities for gain but also involves greater risk of loss due to leveraging risk and to gain exposure to issuers indices sectors currencies andor geographic regions a portfolio s use of derivative instruments involves risks different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments a portfolio s investment in a derivative instrument could lose more than the principal amount invested and the use of certain derivatives may subject a portfolio to the potential for unlimited loss derivatives are subject to a number of risks described elsewhere in this section such as liquidity risk market risk credit and counterparty risk and management risk as a seller of a credit default swap a portfolio effectively adds economic leverage because in addition to its total net assets the portfolio is  premier multiseries vit emerging markets risk subject to investment exposure on the notional amount of the swap see leveraging risk additionally holding a position in a credit default swap could result in losses if a portfolio does not correctly evaluate the creditworthiness of the company on which the credit default swap is based to the extent a portfolio writes call options on individual securities that it does not hold in its portfolio ie naked call options it is subject to the risk that a liquid market for the underlying security may not exist at the time an option is exercised or when a portfolio otherwise seeks to close out an option position naked call options have speculative characteristics and the potential for unlimited loss derivatives also involve the risk of mispricing or improper valuation the risk of ambiguous documentation and the risk that changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset rate or index also suitable derivative transactions may not be available in all circumstances and there can be no assurance that a portfolio will engage in these transactions to reduce exposure to other risks when that would be beneficial or that if used such strategies will be successful under recently adopted rules and regulations transactions in some types of swaps including interest rate swaps and credit default swaps on north american and european indices are required to be centrally cleared in a cleared derivatives transaction a portfolio s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker since a portfolio is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house can participate directly in the clearing house a portfolio will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members in cleared derivatives transactions a portfolio will make payments including margin payments to and receive payments from a clearing house through their accounts at clearing members clearing members guarantee performance of their clients obligations to the clearing house centrally cleared derivative arrangements may be less favorable to mutual funds than bilateral arrangements for example a portfolio may be required to provide greater amounts of margin for cleared derivatives transactions than for bilateral derivatives transactions also in contrast to bilateral derivatives transactions following a period of notice to a portfolio a clearing member generally can require termination of existing cleared derivatives transactions at any time or increases in margin requirements above the margin that the clearing member required at the beginning of a transaction clearing houses also have broad rights to increase margin requirements for existing transactions or to terminate transactions at any time other recent us and nonus legislative and regulatory reforms including those related to the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the  act restrictions with respect to senior securities have resulted in and may in the future result in new regulation of derivative instruments and the portfolios use of such instruments new regulations could among other things restrict a portfolio s ability to engage in derivative transactions for example by making certain types of derivative instruments or transactions no longer available to a portfolio establish new margin requirements andor increase the costs of derivatives transactions and the portfolio may as a result be unable to execute its investment strategies in a manner its sub adviser might otherwise choose a portfolio that invests in nonus securities andor currencies may experience more rapid and extreme changes in value than a portfolio that invests exclusively in securities of us issuers or securities that trade exclusively in us markets see nonus investment risk below nonus investment risk may be particularly high to the extent that a portfolio invests in emerging market securities that is securities of issuers tied economically to countries with developing economies these securities may present market credit currency liquidity legal political technical and other risks different from or greater than the risks of investing in developed countries certain emerging market countries may impose restrictions on foreign investment and repatriation of investment income and capital in addition foreign investors including a portfolio may be required to register the proceeds of sales and future economic or political crises could lead to price controls forced mergers nationalization or the creation of government monopolies the currencies of emerging market countries may experience significant declines against the us dollar and devaluation may occur subsequent to investments in these currencies by a portfolio see currency risk inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had and may continue to have negative effects on the economies and securities markets of certain emerging market countries emerging market securities may trade in more limited volume than comparable securities in developed foreign markets emerging market securities may have different clearance and settlement procedures which may be unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions or otherwise make it difficult to engage in such transactions settlement problems may cause a portfolio to miss attractive investment opportunities hold a portion of its assets in cash pending investment or be delayed in disposing of a portfolio security all of which would negatively affect the portfolio s performance prospectus  equity securities risk fixed income risk in addition the risks associated with investing in a narrowlydefined geographic area discussed below under nonus investment risk and focused investment risk  are generally more pronounced with respect to investments in emerging market countries a portfolio may also be subject to emerging markets risk if it invests in derivatives or other securities or instruments whose value or returns are related to the value or returns of emerging market securities equity securities represent an ownership interest or the right to acquire an ownership interest in an issuer equity securities may take the form of shares of common stock of a corporation membership interests in a limited liability company limited partnership interests or other forms of ownership interests equity securities also include among other things preferred stocks convertible securities and warrants the value of a company s equity securities may fall as a result of factors directly relating to that company such as decisions made by its management or lower demand for the company s products or services the value of an equity security may also fall because of factors affecting not just the company but also companies in the same industry or in a number of different industries such as increases in production costs the value of a company s equity securities may also be affected by changes in financial markets that are relatively unrelated to the company or its industry such as changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates or adverse circumstances involving the credit markets in addition because a company s equity securities rank junior in priority to the interests of bond holders and other creditors a company s equity securities will usually react more strongly than its bonds and other debt to actual or perceived changes in the company s financial condition or prospects to the extent a portfolio invests in equityrelated instruments it will also be subject to these risks a portfolio s investments may focus on equity securities of companies that its portfolio managers believe will experience relatively rapid earnings growth growth securities or that its portfolio managers believe are selling at a price lower than their true value value securities growth securities typically trade at higher multiples of current earnings than other securities therefore the value of growth securities may be more sensitive to changes in current or expected earnings than the value of other securities companies that issue value securities may have experienced adverse business developments or may be subject to special risks that have caused their securities to be out of favor if a portfolio manager s assessment of a company s prospects is wrong or if the market does not recognize the value of the company the price of its securities may decline or may not approach the value that the portfolio manager anticipates a portfolio that invests in fixed income instruments is subject to interest rate risk changes in the market values of fixed income instruments are largely a function of changes in the current level of interest rates the value of a portfolio s investments in fixed income instruments will typically change as the level of interest rates fluctuate during periods of declining interest rates the values of fixed income instruments are generally expected to rise conversely during periods of rising interest rates the values of fixed income instruments are generally expected to decline duration is one measure of the expected life of a fixed income instrument that is used to determine the sensitivity of a security s price to changes in interest rates securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates usually making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations as a general rule a  rise in interest rates means a  fall in value for every year of positive duration similarly as a general rule if a portfolio exhibited a negative duration profile and interest rates declined by  there would be a  fall in value for every year of negative duration inflationindexed securities including treasury inflation protected securities tips decline in value when interest rates rise in certain interest rate environments such as when real interest rates are rising faster than nominal interest rates inflationindexed securities may experience greater losses than other fixed income instruments with similar durations a nominal interest rate can be described as the sum of a real interest rate and an expected inflation rate also some portfolios eg portfolios with mortgagebacked and other prepayable securities have changing durations and may have increasing durations precisely when that is least advantageous ie when interest rates are rising a portfolio that invests in securities that are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in prevailing interest rates is subject to relatively high levels of interest rate risk such securities include various mortgagerelated securities eg the interestonly or io class of a stripped mortgagebacked security and zero coupon securities fixed income instruments including certain us government securities that do not make periodic interest payments and are purchased at a discount from their value at maturity the portfolios may invest in securities issued by us government agencies or government enterprises although some of these securities may be guaranteed as to the payment of principal or interest by the relevant enterprise or agency others may not be guaranteed and therefore may be riskier than securities guaranteed by the us treasury  premier multiseries vit high yield risk index risk interest rate risk ipo risk focused investment risk a portfolio that invests in high yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality sometimes referred to as high yield securities or junk bonds  may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than a portfolio that does not invest in such securities these securities are considered predominately speculative with respect to the issuer s continuing ability to make principal and interest payments an economic downturn or period of rising interest rates could adversely affect the market for these securities and reduce a portfolio s ability to sell these securities liquidity risk if the issuer of a security is in default with respect to interest or principal payments a portfolio may lose its entire investment because of the risks involved in investing in high yield securities an investment in a portfolio that invests in such securities should be considered speculative the debt instruments of many nonus governments including their agencies subdivisions and instrumentalities are below investment grade and are therefore considered high yield instruments because certain underlying funds and other acquired funds invest in derivatives that are linked to the performance of an index they will be subject to the risks associated with changes in the applicable index if the applicable index changes such a fund could receive lower interest payments in the case of a debtrelated derivative or experience a reduction in the value of the derivative to below what the fund paid certain indexed securities may create leverage to the extent that they increase or decrease in value at a rate that is a multiple of the changes in the applicable index interest rate risk is the risk that fixed income securities valuations will change because of changes in interest rates during periods of rising nominal interest rates the values of fixed income instruments are generally expected to decline conversely during periods of declining nominal interest rates the values of fixed income instruments are generally expected to rise to the extent that a portfolio effectively has short positions with respect to fixed income instruments the values of such short positions would generally be expected to rise when nominal interest rates rise and to decline when nominal interest rates decline a nominal interest rate can be described as the sum of a real interest rate and an expected inflation rate fixed income securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates usually making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations the values of equity and other nonfixed income securities may also decline due to fluctuations in interest rates variable and floating rate securities generally are less sensitive to interest rate changes but may decline in value if their interest rates do not rise as much or as quickly as interest rates in general conversely floating rate securities will not generally increase in value if interest rates decline inverse floating rate securities may decrease in value if interest rates increase inverse floating rate securities may also exhibit greater price volatility than a fixed rate obligation with similar credit quality when a portfolio holds variable or floating rate securities a decrease or in the case of inverse floating rate securities an increase in market interest rates will adversely affect the income received from such securities and the net asset value of the portfolio s shares securities offered in initial public offerings ipos are subject to many of the same risks of investing in companies with smaller market capitalizations and often to a heightened degree securities issued in ipos have no trading history and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods in addition the prices of securities sold in ipos may be highly volatile at any particular time or from time to time a portfolio may not be able to invest in securities issued in ipos or invest to the extent desired because for example only a small portion if any of the securities being offered in an ipo may be made available to that portfolio in addition under certain market conditions a relatively small number of companies may issue securities in ipos similarly as the number of funds to which ipo securities are allocated increases the number of securities issued to any one fund may decrease the investment performance of a portfolio during periods when it is unable to invest significantly or at all in ipos may be lower than during periods when that portfolio is able to do so in addition as a portfolio increases in size the impact of ipos on that portfolio s performance will generally decrease focusing portfolio investments in a small number of issuers industries foreign currencies or regions increases risk portfolios that are nondiversified because they may invest a significant portion of their assets in a relatively small number of issuers may have more risk because changes in the value of a single security or the impact of a single economic political or regulatory occurrence may have a greater adverse impact on a portfolio s net asset value similarly certain underlying bond funds may have more risk because they may invest a substantial portion of their assets in bonds of similar projects or from issuers of the same status some of those issuers also may present substantial credit or other risks diversified portfolios that invest in a relatively small number of issuers are subject to similar risks in addition a portfolio may be subject to increased risk to the extent it focuses its investments in securities denominated in a particular foreign currency or in a narrowly defined geographic area for example regional economic risks relating to weather emergencies and natural disasters similarly a portfolio that focuses its investments in a certain type of issuer is particularly vulnerable to prospectus  issuer risk leveraging risk liquidity risk management risk events affecting such type of issuer also a portfolio may have greater risk to the extent it invests a substantial portion of its assets in a group of related industries or sectors  the industries comprising any particular sector and investments in a particular foreign currency or in a narrowly defined geographic area outside the united states may share common characteristics are often subject to similar business risks and regulatory burdens and react similarly to economic market political or other developments furthermore certain issuers industries and regions may be adversely affected by the impacts of climate change on the demand for and the development of goods and services and related production costs and the impacts of legislation regulation and international accords related to climate change as well as any indirect consequences of regulation or business trends driven by climate change the value of a security may decline for a number of reasons that directly relate to the issuer such as management performance financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer s goods or services as well as the historical and prospective earnings of the issuer and the value of its assets leverage including borrowing will cause the value of a portfolio s shares to be more volatile than if the portfolio did not use leverage this is because leverage tends to exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the portfolio s portfolio securities a portfolio may engage in transactions or purchase instruments that give rise to forms of leverage such transactions and instruments may include among others the use of reverse repurchase agreements and other borrowings the investment of collateral from loans of portfolio securities or the use of whenissued delayeddelivery or forward commitment transactions the use of derivatives and short sales may also involve leverage the use of leverage may cause a portfolio to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its obligations or to meet segregation requirements certain types of leveraging transactions such as short sales that are not against the box could theoretically be subject to unlimited losses in cases where a portfolio for any reason is unable to close out the transaction in addition to the extent a portfolio borrows money interest costs on such borrowings may not be recovered by any appreciation of the securities purchased with the borrowed amounts and could exceed the portfolio s investment returns resulting in greater losses liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell possibly preventing a portfolio from purchasing or selling such illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price or possibly requiring a portfolio to dispose of other investments at unfavorable times or prices in order to satisfy its obligations portfolios with principal investment strategies that involve securities of companies with smaller market capitalizations nonus securities rule a securities derivatives or securities with substantial market andor credit risk tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk additionally the market for certain investments may become illiquid under adverse market or economic conditions independent of any specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer in such cases a portfolio due to limitations on investments in illiquid securities and the difficulty in purchasing and selling such securities or instruments may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain issuer or sector each portfolio is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed investment portfolio the manager the respective subadviser and the individual portfolio managers will apply investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the portfolios but there can be no guarantee that these will produce the desired results to the extent the portfolio managers employ quantitative models whether proprietary or maintained by third parties there can be no assurance that such models will behave as expected in all market conditions including due to deviations between expected and actual relationships among variables any imperfections errors or limitations in such models could affect a portfolio s performance by necessity such models make simplifying assumptions that limit their effectiveness in addition the computer programming used to construct or the data employed by quantitative models may contain errors which may cause losses for a portfolio or reduce performance in the event thirdparty models become increasingly costly or unavailable the portfolio managers may be forced to rely on proprietary models or to reduce or discontinue their use of quantitative models the portfolios are also subject to the risk that deficiencies in the operational systems or controls of the manager or another service provider will cause losses for the portfolios or hinder portfolio operations for example trading delays or errors both human and systemic could prevent a portfolio from purchasing a security expected to appreciate in value additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may affect the investment techniques available to the manager each subadviser and each individual portfolio manager in connection with managing the portfolios and may also adversely affect the ability of the portfolios to achieve their respective investment objectives  premier multiseries vit market risk mortgagerelated and other asset backed risk to the extent portfolio managers employ strategies that are not correlated to broader markets or that are intended to seek returns under a variety of market conditions certain portfolios may outperform the general securities market during periods of flat or negative market performance and underperform the securities market during periods of strong market performance the market price of securities owned by a portfolio may go up or down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably to the extent a portfolio invests substantially in common stocks andor other equity securities a principal risk of investing in the portfolio is that the investments in its portfolio will decline in value due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries or sectors represented in those markets the values of securities may decline due to general market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular company such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings changes in interest or currency rates adverse changes to credit markets or adverse investor sentiment generally they may also decline due to factors that disproportionately affect a particular industry group of related industries or sector such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry or sector the market price of fixed income securities as well as equity securities and other types of investments may decline due to changes in interest rates or other factors affecting the applicable markets generally equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities although under certain market conditions fixed income securities may have comparable or greater price volatility during a general downturn in securities markets multiple asset classes may decline in value simultaneously the portfolios are subject to the risk that geopolitical and other events will disrupt securities markets adversely affect global economies and markets and thereby decrease the value of the portfolios investments the wars in iraq and afghanistan have had a substantial effect on the economies and securities markets of the us and other countries terrorism in the us and around the world has had a similar global impact and has increased geopolitical risk the terrorist attacks on september   resulted in the closure of some us securities markets for four days and similar attacks are possible in the future securities markets may be susceptible to market manipulation eg the potential manipulation of the london interbank offered rate libor or other fraudulent trade practices which could disrupt the orderly functioning of these markets or adversely affect the value of investments traded in these markets including investments of the portfolios while the us government has honored its credit obligations continuously for the last  years it remains possible that the us could default on its obligations while it is impossible to predict the consequences of such an unprecedented event it is likely that a default by the us would be highly disruptive to the us and global securities markets and could significantly impair the value of the portfolios investments similarly political events within the us at times have resulted and may in the future result in a shutdown of government services which could negatively affect the us economy decrease the value of many portfolio investments and increase uncertainty in or impair the operation of the us or other securities markets the uncertainty surrounding the sovereign debt of a significant number of european union countries as well as the continued existence of the european union itself have disrupted and may continue to disrupt markets in the us and around the world if one or more countries leave the european union or the european union dissolves the world s securities markets likely will be significantly disrupted substantial government interventions eg currency controls also could negatively impact the portfolios war terrorism economic uncertainty and related geopolitical events have led and in the future may lead to increased shortterm market volatility and may have adverse longterm effects on us and world economies and markets generally likewise natural and environmental disasters such as the earthquake and tsunami in japan in early  and systemic market dislocations of the kind surrounding the insolvency of lehman brothers in  if repeated would be highly disruptive to economies and markets adversely affecting individual companies and industries securities markets interest rates credit ratings inflation investor sentiment and other factors affecting the value of the portfolios investments during such market disruptions the portfolios exposure to the risks described elsewhere in this summary of principal risks section will likely increase market disruptions including sudden government interventions can also prevent a portfolio from implementing its investment program for a period of time and achieving its investment objective for example a market disruption may adversely affect the orderly functioning of the securities markets and may cause the portfolios derivatives counterparties to discontinue offering derivatives on some underlying commodities securities reference rates or indices or to offer them on a more limited basis to the extent a portfolio has focused its investments in the stock index of a particular region adverse geopolitical and other events could have a disproportionate impact on the portfolio a portfolio that invests in a variety of mortgagerelated and other assetbacked securities is subject to certain additional risks generally rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of fixedrate mortgagerelated securities making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates as a result in a period of rising interest rates prospectus  nonus investment risk reit and real estaterelated investment risk smaller company risk turnover risk to the extent a portfolio holds mortgagerelated securities it may exhibit additional volatility this is known as extension risk in addition adjustable and fixedrate mortgagerelated securities may involve special risks relating to unanticipated rates of prepayment on the mortgages underlying the securities this is known as prepayment risk when interest rates decline borrowers may pay off their mortgages sooner than expected this can reduce the returns of a portfolio because the portfolio may have to reinvest that money at the lower prevailing interest rates a portfolio s investments in other assetbacked securities are subject to risks similar to those associated with mortgagerelated securities as well as additional risks associated with the nature of the assets and the servicing of those assets the market for mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities has recently experienced high volatility and a lack of liquidity as a result the value of many of these securities has significantly declined there can be no assurance that these markets will become more liquid or less volatile and it is possible that the value of these securities could decline further a portfolio that invests in nonus securities may cause it to experience more rapid and extreme changes in value than portfolios that invest exclusively in securities of us issuers or securities that trade exclusively in us markets the securities markets of many nonus countries are relatively small with a limited number of companies representing a small number of industries additionally issuers of nonus securities are often not subject to the same degree of regulation as us issuers reporting accounting and auditing standards of nonus countries differ in some cases significantly from us standards also nationalization expropriation or confiscatory taxation currency blockage market disruption political changes security suspensions or diplomatic developments could adversely affect a portfolio s investments in a nonus country in the event of nationalization expropriation or other confiscation a portfolio could lose its entire investment in nonus securities the more a portfolio invests its assets in a particular currency or geographic area the more exposure it will generally have to regional economic risks including weather emergencies and natural disasters for example to the extent a portfolio may invest more than  of its assets in particular countries it may be subject to increased risks due to political economic social or regulatory events in those countries adverse developments in certain regions can also adversely affect securities of other countries whose economies appear to be unrelated in addition a portfolio s investments in nonus securities may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by countries outside the us which could reduce the return on an investment in a portfolio to the extent that a portfolio invests in real estaterelated investments such as securities of real estaterelated companies real estate investment trusts reits real estate operating companies reocs and related instruments and derivatives it will be subject to the risks associated with owning real estate and with the real estate industry generally these include difficulties in valuing and disposing of real estate the possibility of declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and local economic conditions the possibility of adverse changes in the climate for real estate environmental liability risks the risk of increases in property taxes and operating expenses possible adverse changes in zoning laws the risk of casualty or condemnation losses limitations on rents the possibility of adverse changes in interest rates and in the credit markets and the possibility of borrowers paying off mortgages sooner than expected which may lead to reinvestment of assets at lower prevailing interest rates the value of investments in the real estate sector also may be affected by macroeconomic developments and social and economic trends to the extent a portfolio invests in reits and or reocs it will also be subject to the risk that a reit or reoc will default on its obligations or go bankrupt by investing in reits andor reocs indirectly through a portfolio a shareholder will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of a portfolio but also indirectly similar expenses of such reits or reocs the general risks associated with investing in equity securities and liquidity risk are particularly pronounced for securities of companies with smaller market capitalizations these companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources or they may depend on a few key employees securities of smaller companies may trade less frequently and in lesser volume than more widely held securities and their values may fluctuate more sharply than other securities they may also trade in the overthecounter market or on a regional exchange or may otherwise have limited liquidity companies with mediumsized market capitalizations also have substantial exposure to these risks a change in the securities held by a portfolio is known as portfolio turnover higher portfolio turnover involves correspondingly greater expenses to a portfolio including brokerage commissions or dealer markups and other transaction costs on the sale of securities and reinvestments in other securities such sales may also adversely impact a portfolio s aftertax returns the trading costs and tax effects associated with portfolio turnover may adversely affect a portfolio s performance  premier multiseries vit view more similar documents allocation strategies a c  i shares prospectus august   allocation

that time the fed has paused increases in interest rates and has downgraded its projections for growth in the us for  in its official statement following its meeting in june  the fed said the committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run given generally tepid growth and low inflation outside the us a number of international central banks pursued highly accommodative monetary policies during the reporting period for example both the european central bank and the bank of japan introduced negative interest rates meanwhile the bank of england boe kept rates unchanged during

june   the nfj dividend value portfolio the portfolio returned  underperforming the russell  value index the benchmark which returned  market overview us large cap equities outpaced their small cap counterparts during the reporting period as the russell  index gained  versus the russell  index which appreciated  us equities as measured by the sp  index suffered the worst start to a calendar year in decades touching a month low in midfebruary  before recovering to end the reporting period with modest gains the reporting period closed on a historic somewhat unexpected note with the united kingdom choosing to exit the european union on june  the days that followed the vote saw a spike in uncertainty with the sp  index dropping  in two daysa  standard deviation event as a result of the volatility in the financial markets the fed has taken a dovish stance on interest rates thus far in  and reduced the number of rate increases it expects in  from four to two portfolio review relative underperformance over the reporting period was due to negative stock selection while sector allocation was positive selection across the consumer staples and information technology sectors boosted relative returns but gains were overwhelmed by holdings in the financials and health care sectors which failed to keep pace with benchmark shares investors continued to favor more defensive and bondproxylike equities while rising oil prices boosted performance across the energy and materials sectors within the benchmark five sectors delivered doubledigit total returns utilities telecom services energy materials and consumer staples in terms of sector allocation two sectors dipped into negative territory over the reporting period including financials and consumer discretionary the portfolios overweight in telecom services and underweight in financials contributed to performance results conversely an underweight in utilities and overweight in consumer discretionary detracted from the portfolios relative performance outlook as we have done for over  years nfj investment group is giving prudence to its philosophy and maintaining a disciplined adherence to its investment process allianz global investors and nfj continue to advocate that clients must take risk to generate an excess return and that an active approach at current valuation levels will be necessary to generate alpha nfjs focus on dividendpaying stocksone of the three pillars that the nfj framework was founded on in may be one solution to help investors generate returns and protect purchasing power in an era where equity appreciation may be more challenged over time the nfj investment team seeks to offer a dividend premium relative to their corresponding benchmarks in order to generate income for investors at sound valuation levels additionally dividendpaying stocks may protect investors from market volatility potentially providing an income stream that is independent of market movements as value equity managers our philosophy is to continuously style tilt toward low valuation and higherquality equities over time research has shown investing in low valuation equities has

which appears on the portfolio summary page in this semiannual report please refer to this information when reviewing the shareholder expense example for the portfolio shareholder expense example shareholders incur two types of costs  transaction costs and  ongoing costs including investment management fees distribution andor service b fees and other portfolio expenses the shareholder expense example is intended to help shareholders understand ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the portfolio and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds the shareholder expense example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period as indicated and held for the entire period through june   actual expenses the information in the table for actual performance provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in these columns together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the column entitled expenses paid during period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the information in the table for hypothetical performance  return before expenses provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the portfolios actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the portfolios actual return the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the portfolio and other funds to do so compare this  hypothetical example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of other funds please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs therefore the information for hypothetical performance  return before expenses is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds in addition if these

price was determined by using a single brokers quote the valuation techniques used by the portfolio to measure fair value during the six months ended june   were intended to maximize the use of observable inputs and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs the portfolios policy is to recognize transfers between levels at the end of the reporting period an investment assets or liabilitys level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level input individually or in aggregate that is significant to the fair value measurement the objective of fair value measurement remains the same even when there is a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability and regardless of the valuation techniques used investments categorized as level  or

interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade more specifically the us central bank increased the federal funds rate from a range between  and  to a range between  and  however since that time the fed has paused increases in interest rates and has downgraded its projections for growth in the us for  in its official statement following its meeting in june  the fed said the committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run given generally tepid growth and low inflation outside the us a number of international central banks pursued highly accommodative monetary policies during the reporting period for example both the european central bank and the bank of japan introduced negative interest rates meanwhile the bank of england boe kept rates unchanged during the reporting

the investment team has the ability to dynamically adjust the equity allocation up to  when markets are favorable and down to  in times of market stress market overview during the reporting period equities experienced bouts of volatility while global bonds rallied boosted in part by more aggressive monetary easing from developedcountry central banks initially concerns about a slowdown in china and a further decline in oil prices contributed to a selloff in equities from the start of  through march despite this early volatility many equity markets subsequently recovered losses as the reporting period progressed helped by a recovery in oil and more sanguine forecasts for global growth however in late june  news that the uk had voted in favor of leaving the eu contributed to another brief decline in equities ultimately us equities ended the reporting period in positive territory as measured by the sp  index which was up  however equities in japan in local currency terms declined  as measured by the msci japan index and equities in europe fell in local currency terms by  as measured by the msci europe index the msci eafe index as measured in local currency terms posted a negative result of  while the losses were less pronounced in dollar terms in light of modest dollar weakness for the period down  in usd for the reporting period fixed income returns outpaced equities both globally and in the us returning  and  respectively as measured by the barclays global aggregate and barclays us aggregate bond indices in the us weaker than expected us jobs data early in the reporting period contributed to delayed expectations of interest rate increases by the fed lending support to us treasuries which finished the period up  according to the barclays aggregate bond treasury index and outperforming us equities which returned  as measured by the sp  index within global bonds emerging market bonds denominated in dollars were one of the best performers returning  as measured by the jpm embi portfolio review in global equities the portfolio entered the reporting period with an underweight of  versus  for the benchmark the portfolio had a reduced emphasis on both developed equities outside the us with a weight of  versus a weight of  for the benchmark and emerging market equities with a weight of  versus  for the benchmark conversely the portfolio was modestly overweight us large cap equities with a  weight versus a  weight for the benchmark during the reporting period equity positions were broadly decreased amidst the early  selloff with underweights to us and eafe reaching   versus  benchmark and   versus  benchmark exposures to both were subsequently increased although eafe remained  underweight at just  compared to a benchmark of  at the end of the reporting period us equities ended the reporting period roughly equal weighted versus the benchmark at  of the portfolio in fixed income the portfolio entered the reporting period with an underweight of  versus  for the benchmark reflecting underweights to us government bonds with a weight of  versus  for the benchmark and corporate bonds with a weight of  versus  for the benchmark meanwhile the portfolios exposure to emerging market debt was roughly in line with the benchmarks  weight as the portfolio was derisked in the early year selloff allocations to treasuries and cash were increased reaching  and  respectively by the end of the reporting period us government bonds were reduced to a  portfolio weight versus  benchmark weight conversely the portfolio ended the reporting period with overweights to emerging market bonds with a portfolio weight of  versus  for the benchmark and us corporates with a weight of  versus  for the benchmark in the portfolios opportunistic segment which represents fixed income or equity investments that are outside the benchmark a roughly  weight to italian government bonds was held at the beginning of the reporting period although the position was closed out during the period in favor of an allocation to us high yield bonds real estate investment trusts reits were added early in the reporting period and ended with a  weight while the portfolio ultimately ended the reporting period with a return below the benchmark the result included a combination of detractors and contributors the primary detractor from relative results over the reporting period was the intraperiod underweight to equities as markets rallied off their early year declines the preponderance of underperformance was accrued in march  when developed equity markets gained around  and emerging markets topped  thus the portfolios defensive position detracted the effect was partially offset by the contributive effects of being overweight emerging market bonds which gained over  in the first half of  positioning effects in the portfolios opportunistic exposure also added modestly in terms of absolute performance all but one of the asset classes in the portfolios benchmark posted gains over the reporting period in developed equities the us market as measured by the sp  index gained  while markets outside the us as measured by the msci eafe index declined  us fixed income also ended higher as measured by the barclays capital us government bond  and us corporate investment grade  indices emerging market equities and fixed income respectively gained  and  as measured by the msci em and jpm embi indices in usd outlook while in the initial aftermath of the uk referendum many risk markets seemed to ignore the result we expect that the triumph of the leave camp will have real and lasting economic and political effects in the near term we believe it may contribute to slower global economic growth and more accommodative monetary policy around the world in addition we believe that the political fallout may also contribute to bouts of higher volatility across asset markets through yearend the us and asia may be less directly affected by the political swings in europe however we have seen repercussions in these markets as well the fed has signaled that it is on hold for the near future and awaiting developments in global markets before resuming its interest rate hiking cycle our current firm view is for one  basispoint hike by yearend in japan the yen has been a beneficiary of the global flight to quality in the aftermath of the uk referendum from an investment perspective the portfolio entered the third quarter with underweights to global equities and us treasuries an overweight to us corporate and emerging market bonds

the following disclosure provides important information regarding the portfolios shareholder expense example which appears on the portfolio summary page in this semiannual report please refer to this information when reviewing the shareholder expense example for the portfolio shareholder expense example shareholders incur two types of costs  transaction costs and  ongoing costs including investment management fees distribution andor service b fees and other portfolio expenses the shareholder expense example is intended to help shareholders understand ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the portfolio and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds the shareholder expense example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period as indicated and held for the entire period through june   actual expenses the information in the table for actual performance provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in these columns together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the column entitled expenses paid during period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the information in the table for hypothetical performance  return before expenses provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the portfolios actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the portfolios actual return the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the portfolio and other funds to do so compare this  hypothetical example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of other funds please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs therefore the information for hypothetical performance  return before expenses is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds in addition if these transactional costs were included your costs would have been higher proxy voting the

is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the portfolio that have not yet occurred the following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the portfolio a valuation of investments portfolio securities and other financial instruments for which market quotations are readily available are stated at market value market value is generally determined on the basis of official closing prices last reported sales prices or if no sales or closing prices are reported on the basis of quotes obtained from a quotation reporting system established market makers or independent pricing services investments in mutual funds are valued at the net asset value nav as reported on each business day the portfolios investments are valued daily using prices supplied by an independent pricing service or brokerdealer quotations or by using the last sale or settlement price on the exchange that is the primary market for such securities or the mean between the last bid and ask quotations the market value for nasdaq global market securities and nasdaq capital market securities may also be calculated using the nasdaq official closing price instead of the last reported sales price independent pricing services use information provided by market makers or estimates of market values obtained from yield data relating to investments or securities with similar characteristics exchange traded futures are valued at the price determined by the relevant exchange the board of trustees the board has adopted procedures for valuing portfolio securities and other financial instruments in circumstances where market quotations are not readily available including in cases where available market quotations are deemed to be unreliable and has delegated primary responsibility for applying the valuation methods to the investment manager and the subadviser the trusts valuation committee was established by the board to oversee the implementation of the portfolios valuation methods and to make fair value determinations on behalf of the board as instructed by the board the subadviser monitors the continued appropriateness of methods applied and identifies to the investment manager circumstances and events that may require fair valuation the investment manager in turn determines if adjustments should be made in light of market changes events affecting the issuer or other factors if the investment manager in consultation with the subadviser determines that a valuation method may no longer be appropriate another valuation method may be selected or the valuation committee will be convened to consider the matter and take any appropriate action in accordance with procedures set forth by the board the board shall review and ratify the appropriateness of the valuation methods and these methods may be amended or supplemented from time to time by the valuation committee    table of contents notes to financial

other than the us dollar are converted to the us dollar using exchange rates obtained from pricing services as a result the nav of a portfolio may be affected by changes in the value of currencies in relation to the us dollar the value of securities traded in markets outside the united states or denominated in currencies other than the us dollar may be affected significantly on a day that the new york stock exchange nyse is closed the prices used by the portfolio to value investments may differ from the value that would be realized if the investments were sold and these differences could be

business b fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below     ●   level   quoted prices in active markets for identical investments that the portfolio has the ability to access   ●   level   valuations based on other significant observable inputs which may include but are not limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities interest rates yield curves volatilities prepayment speeds loss severities credit risks and default rates or other market corroborated inputs   ●   level   valuations based on significant unobservable inputs including the subadvisers or valuation committees own assumptions and securities whose price was determined by using a single brokers quote the valuation techniques used by the portfolio to measure fair value during the six months ended june   were intended to maximize the use of observable inputs and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs the portfolios policy is to recognize transfers between levels at the end of the reporting period an investment assets or liabilitys level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level input individually or in aggregate that is significant to the fair value measurement the objective of fair value measurement remains the same even when there is a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability and regardless of the valuation techniques used investments categorized as level  or  as of period end may have been transferred between level  and  since the prior period due to changes in the valuation method utilized in valuing the investments the inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities the following are certain inputs and techniques that the portfolio generally uses to evaluate how to classify each major category of assets and liabilities for level  and level  in accordance with us gaap equity securities common and preferred stock  equity securities traded in inactive markets are valued using inputs which include brokerdealer quotes recently executed transactions adjusted for changes in the benchmark index or evaluated price quotes received from independent pricing services that take into account the integrity of the market sector and issuer the individual characteristics of the

market value of the collateral including accrued interest thereon be sufficient in the event of default by the counterparty if the counterparty defaults under the master repo agreements and the value of the collateral declines or if the counterparty enters an insolvency proceeding realization of the collateral by the portfolio may be delayed or limited the gross value is included in the

connection with its own operations j organizational and offering costs organizational costs are expensed at the inception of the portfolio offering costs are amortized over a twelvemonth period from the commencement of the portfolio  principal risks in the normal course of business the portfolio trades financial instruments and enters into financial transactions where risk of potential loss exists due to among other things changes in the market market risk or failure of the other party to a transaction to perform counterparty risk the portfolio is also exposed to other risks such as but not limited to interest rate foreign currency and credit risks interest rate risk is the risk that fixed income securities valuations will change because of changes in interest rates during periods of rising nominal interest rates the values of fixed income instruments are generally expected to decline conversely during periods of declining nominal interest rates the values of fixed income instruments are generally expected to rise a nominal interest rate can be described as the sum of a real interest rate and an expected inflation rate fixed income securities with longer durations tend to be    table of contents notes to financial statements rcm dynamic multiasset plus vit portfolio june   unaudited continued     more sensitive to changes in interest rates usually making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations duration is used primarily as a measure of the sensitivity of a fixed income securitys market price to interest rate ie yield movements interest rate changes can be sudden and unpredictable and the portfolio may lose money as a result of movements in interest rates the portfolio may not be able to hedge against changes in interest rates or may choose not to do so for cost or other reasons in addition any hedges may not work as intended the portfolio is exposed to credit risk which is the risk of losing money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security is unable or unwilling or is perceived whether by market participants rating agencies pricing services or otherwise as unable or unwilling to make timely principal andor interest payments or to otherwise honor its obligations securities are subject to varying degrees of credit risk which are often reflected in credit ratings to the extent the portfolio directly invests in foreign currencies or in securities that trade in and receives revenues in foreign currencies or in derivatives that provide exposure to foreign currencies it will be subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the us dollar or in the case of hedging positions that the us dollar will decline in value relative to the currency being hedged currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons including economic growth inflation changes in interest rates intervention or the failure to intervene by us or foreign governments central banks or supranational entities such as the international monetary fund or the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the united states or abroad as a result the portfolios investments in foreign currencydenominated securities may reduce the returns of the portfolio the local emerging market currencies in which the portfolio may be invested may experience substantially greater volatility against the us dollar than the major convertible currencies in developed countries the portfolio is subject to elements of risk not typically associated with investments in the us due to concentrated investments in foreign issuers located in a specific country or region such concentrations will subject the portfolio to additional risks resulting from future political or economic conditions in such country or region and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency exchange restrictions affecting such country or region which could cause the securities and their markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable us companies the market values of securities may decline due to general market conditions market risk which are not specifically related to a particular company such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment they may also decline due to factors that affect a particular industry or industries such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry equity securities and equityrelated investments generally have greater market price volatility than fixed income securities although under certain market conditions fixed income securities may have comparable or greater price volatility credit ratings downgrades may also negatively affect securities held by the portfolio even when markets perform well there is no assurance that the investments held by the portfolio will increase in value along with the broader market in addition market risk includes the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt the economy on a national or global level the portfolio is exposed to counterparty risk or the risk that an institution or other entity with which the portfolio has unsettled or open transactions will default the potential loss to the portfolio could exceed the value of the financial assets recorded in the portfolios financial statements financial assets which potentially expose the portfolio to counterparty risk consist principally of cash due from counterparties and investments the subadviser seeks to minimize the portfolios counterparty risk by performing reviews of each counterparty and by minimizing concentration of counterparty risk by undertaking transactions with multiple customers and counterparties on recognized and reputable exchanges delivery of securities sold is only made once the portfolio has received a payment payment is made on a purchase once the securities have been delivered by the counterparty the trade will fail if either party fails to meet its obligation the counterparty risk associated with certain contracts may be reduced by master netting arrangements to the extent that if an event of default occurs all amounts with the counterparty are terminated and settled on a net basis the portfolios overall exposure to counterparty risk with respect to transactions subject to master netting arrangements can change substantially within a short period as it is affected by each transaction subject to the arrangement  underlying funds and other acquired funds risk the portfolio may at any time invest in affiliated and unaffiliated funds which may include certain affiliated mutual funds and etfs sponsored by aam or its subsidiaries the underlying funds and etfs mutual funds and pooled investment vehicles other than the underlying funds other acquired funds accordingly the investment performance of the portfolio depends upon a favorable allocation among the underlying funds and other acquired funds as well as the ability of the underlying funds and other acquired funds to achieve their objectives there can be no assurance that the investment objective of any underlying fund or other acquired fund will be achieved the risks associated with investing in each fund are closely related to the risks associated with the securities and other investments held by the underlying funds and other acquired funds    table of contents notes to financial statements rcm dynamic multiasset plus vit portfolio june   unaudited continued     investing in the underlying funds and other acquired funds involves certain additional expenses and tax results that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds or other acquired funds the portfolios nav will fluctuate in response to changes in the net asset values of the underlying funds and other acquired funds in which it invests the extent to which the investment performance and risks associated with portfolio correlate to those of a particular underlying fund or other acquired fund will depend upon the extent to which portfolios assets are allocated from time to time for investment in the underlying fund or other acquired fund which will vary the portfolio may invest in other investment companies during periods when it has large amounts of uninvested cash during periods when there is a shortage of attractive securities available in the market or when a subadviser believes share prices of other investment companies offer attractive values to the extent that a portfolio invests a significant portion of its assets in an underlying fund it will be particularly sensitive to the risks associated with that underlying fund  financial derivative instruments disclosure about derivatives and hedging activities requires qualitative disclosure regarding objectives and strategies for using derivatives quantitative disclosure about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivatives and disclosure about creditriskrelated contingent features in derivative agreements the disclosure requirements distinguish between derivatives which are accounted for as hedges and those that do not qualify for such accounting although the portfolio at times use derivatives for hedging purposes the portfolio reflect derivatives at fair value and recognize changes in fair value through the portfolios statement of operations and such derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment futures contracts the portfolio uses futures contracts to manage their exposure to the securities markets or the movements in interest rates and currency values a futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a financial instrument at a set price on a future date upon entering into such a contract the portfolio is required to pledge to the broker an amount of cash or securities equal to the minimum initial margin requirements of the exchange pursuant to the contracts the portfolio agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash or securities equal to the daily fluctuation in the value of the contracts such receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the portfolio as unrealized appreciation or depreciation when the contracts are closed the portfolio records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contracts at the time they were opened and the value at the time they were closed any unrealized appreciation or depreciation recorded is simultaneously reversed the use of futures transactions involves various risks

broadridge peer group hard return and trends in profitability to the investment manager of its advisory relationship with the portfolio the trustees conclusions as to the approval of the agreements were based on a comprehensive consideration of all information provided to the trustees and were not the result of any single factor some of the factors that figured particularly in the trustees deliberations are described below although individual trustees may have evaluated the information presented differently from one another giving different weights to various factors the trustees recognized that the fee arrangements for the portfolio are the result of prior review and discussion between the trustees and the investment manager that certain aspects of such arrangements may receive greater scrutiny in some years than in others and that the trustees conclusions may be based in part on their consideration of the same arrangements during the course of the year and in prior years the trustees also took into account that the investment manager had proposed the continuation of expense caps for the portfolio the trustees also considered the risk profile of the portfolio    table of contents matters relating to the trustees consideration of the investment management and portfolio management agreements unaudited continued rcm dynamic multiasset plus vit portfolio     performance information performance results for the portfolio reviewed by the trustees are discussed below the comparative performance information was prepared and provided by broadridge and was not independently verified by the trustees due to the passage of time these performance results may differ from the performance results for more recent periods including those shown elsewhere in this report the trustees reviewed among other information comparative information showing performance for portfolio shares against its broadridge performance universe for the period since inception and ending march   in reviewing the comparative performance information for the portfolio the trustees took into account that the portfolio had been in existence for less than a year and had a relatively short performance history for the portfolio performance was below median in the fifth quintile for the period since inception in addition the trustees considered matters bearing on the portfolio and its advisory arrangements at their meetings throughout the year including a review of performance data at each regular meeting as part of their review the trustees examined the ability of the investment manager and the subadviser to provide highquality investment management and other services to the portfolio among other information the trustees considered the investment philosophy and research and decision making processes of the subadviser the experience of key advisory personnel of the subadviser responsible for portfolio management of the portfolio the ability of the investment manager and the subadviser to attract and retain capable personnel and the capability of the senior management and staff of the investment manager and the subadviser in addition the trustees reviewed the quality of the investment managers and the subadvisers services with respect to regulatory compliance and ability to comply with the investment and compliance policies and procedures of the portfolio the nature extent and quality of certain administrative services the investment manager is responsible for providing to the portfolio and conditions that might affect the ability of the investment manager or the subadviser to provide high quality services to the portfolio in the future under the agreements including each organizations respective financial condition and operational stability based on the foregoing the trustees concluded that the subadvisers investment process research capabilities and philosophy were wellsuited to the portfolio given its respective investment objectives and policies and that the investment manager and the subadviser would be able to continue to meet andor meet any reasonably foreseeable obligations under each agreement fee and expense information in assessing the reasonableness of the portfolios fees under the agreements the trustees considered among other information the portfolios management fee and total expense ratio as a percentage of average daily net assets and the management fees and total expense ratios of a peer group of funds based on information provided by broadridge the trustees also noted the expense limitation agreement observed by the investment manager for the portfolio that caps the total annual expenses of the portfolio the trustees also considered among other items i the level of the portfolios subadvisory fees ii the allocation of the management fee between the investment manager and the subadviser and the services provided by the investment manager on the one hand and the subadviser on the other hand and iii that the investment manager and not the portfolio pays the subadvisory fee in comparing the portfolio to its broadridge peers with respect to expenses the trustees noted that the portfolio was not charged a separate administration fee recognizing that their management fee includes a component for administrative services while many peer funds in the broadridge category have separate advisory and administration agreements with separate fees the trustees also considered information showing the advisory fees charged by the investment manager and subadviser to other funds and accounts including institutional and separate accounts with a similar investment objective and policies to those of the portfolio in comparing these fees the trustees considered information provided by the investment manager as to the generally broader and more extensive services provided to the portfolio in comparison to institutional or separate accounts the higher demands placed on the investment managers investment personnel and trading infrastructure as a result of the daily cash inflows and outflows of the portfolio the greater entrepreneurial risk in managing mutual funds and the impact on the investment manager and expenses associated with the more extensive regulatory regime to which the portfolio is subject in comparison to institutional or separate accounts the trustees reviewed information provided by broadridge comparing the portfolios management fee and ratios of total expenses to net assets total expense ratios to those of a group of comparable funds for the most recent fiscal year ended december   the trustees noted that the broadridge data takes into account any fee reductions or expense limitations that were in effect during the    table of contents matters relating to the trustees consideration of the investment management and portfolio management agreements unaudited continued rcm dynamic multiasset plus vit portfolio     portfolios last fiscal year the fee and expense results discussed below were prepared and provided by broadridge as applicable and were not independently verified by the trustees the portfolios management fees and total expense ratios taking fee waivers andor expense limitations into account were below the median of the broadridgeselected group of comparable funds the trustees considered the estimated profitability to the investment manager of its relationship with the portfolio and determined that such profitability did not appear to be excessive the trustees considered the extent to which the investment manager and subadviser may realize economies of scale or other efficiencies in managing and supporting the portfolio the trustees took into account that as an openend investment company the portfolio intends to raise additional assets so as the assets of the portfolio grow over time certain economies of scale and other efficiencies may be realized through spreading certain fixed costs across a larger asset base or across a variety of products and services while also taking into account the expense limitation arrangements observed by the investment manager for the portfolio additionally the trustees considered socalled fallout benefits to the investment manager the subadviser and its affiliates such as reputational value derived from serving as investment manager and subadviser to the portfolio after reviewing these and other factors described herein the trustees concluded within the context of their overall conclusions regarding the agreements that they were satisfied with the investment managers and subadvisers responses and efforts relating to the investment performance of the portfolio including efforts to improve performance the trustees also concluded that the fees payable under each agreement represent reasonable compensation in light of the nature extent and quality of services provided by the investment manager or subadviser as the case may be and should be continued based on their evaluation of factors that they deemed to be material including but not limited to those factors described above the trustees including the independent trustees unanimously concluded that the continuation of the agreements with respect to the portfolio were in the interests of the portfolio and its shareholders and determined to approve such continuation    table of contents privacy policyunaudited rcm dynamic multiasset plus vit portfolio   please read this policy carefully it gives you important information about how allianz global

taking vitamin c and vitamin e supplements may help protect memory and mental decline as you age a new study has found that elderly men who took vitamin e and c supplements at least once a week over a number of years were protected from dementia and actually showed improvements in cognitive function  a catchall term including memory creativity and mental acuity although a protective effect was seen for two different types of dementia in men who took both vitamins the supplements did not appear to prevent dementia due to alzheimers disease the authors note that men who took both vitamin e and c supplements together for many years showed a substantially greater improvement suggesting that longterm use is required to improve cognitive function in late life the researchers believe that vitamin c and e may protect from brain damage because they are antioxidants and can mop up braindamaging free radical particles supplement facts premier vitamin c complex contains the following supplement

brody vitamin c  e may protect the aging brain taking vitamin c and vitamin e supplements may help protect memory and mental decline as you age a new study has found that elderly men who took vitamin e and c supplements at least once a week over a number of years were protected from dementia and actually showed improvements in cognitive function  a catchall term including memory creativity and mental acuity although a protective effect was seen for two different types of dementia in men who took both vitamins the supplements did not appear to prevent dementia due to alzheimers disease the authors note that men who took both vitamin e and c supplements together for many years showed a substantially greater improvement suggesting that longterm use is required to improve cognitive function in late life the researchers believe that vitamin c and e may protect from brain damage because they are antioxidants and can mop up braindamaging free radical particles supplement facts
