here at csx we do not comment on rumors or market speculation and we will not address questions that do not pertain to our quarterly results we appreciate your cooperation and with that let me turn the presentation over to csx corporation’s chairman president and chief executive officer michael ward michael michael j ward well thank you david and good morning everyone last evening csx reported record third quarter earnings per share of  up  increase from the  in the same period last year csx also generated record third quarter revenue of  billion up  on a  volume increase these results demonstrate csx’s ability to capitalize on the continued economic momentum that is driving broadbased growth across nearly all markets coupled with the secular growth trends in intermodal and the gas and oil markets even with the high level of demand csx’s operations have remained stable we are continuing to work with our customers to meet their current and future needs by adding crews investing in locomotives and infrastructure to increase capacity thanks for those efforts the company increased operating income by  to  million this quarter and improved its operating ratio by  basis points to  csx continues to see growth potential across the markets we are confident in our ability to continue to generate substantial value for our shareholders now i’ll turn the presentation over to clarence who will take us through the top line results in more detail clarence clarence w gooden thank you michael and good morning the underlying macroeconomy remains strong and the data and our experience suggest a positive outlook for growth the purchasing managers index came in at  in september a reading above  indicates that the manufacturing economy is expanding this is the th consecutive month the pmi index has signaled expansion at the same time the customer inventories index declined to  a reading below  indicates customer’s inventories are low and suggests continued strength in the demand for manufacturing output as a result many of the customers we serve grew at a robust pace and most of the key indicators we track point to continued expansion now let’s look at the results on the next slide starting at the left side of the chart total volume grew  to more than  million loads in the quarter with strong growth in merchandise intermodal and coal moving to the right total revenue increased  million to over  billion in the quarter reflecting overall volume growth and increased pricing across most markets merchandise and intermodal account for over three quarters of csx’s overall revenue total revenue includes  million of liquidated damages related to contract shortfalls in coal shipments which compares to  million in the third quarter of last year next the average revenue per unit was up slightly here core pricing gains and our merchandised and intermodal markets offset the impact of mix and lower coal revenue per unit finally let’s move to core pricing recall the samestore sales are defined as shipments with the same customer commodity and car type and the same origin and destination these shipments represented about  of csx’s traffic base for the quarter on this basis allin pricing was a positive  in the quarter reflecting continued rate pressure and export coal markets and the impact of fixed variable contracts in the domestic utility market where volumes are now increasing since the pricing environment for coal has become more dynamic reflecting global market conditions for exports and our fixed variable contract structure for domestic utilities and since our merchandise in intermodal markets are becoming a larger portion of our business we have again provided you with the samestore sales pricing for these two markets on a combined basis at the bottom of this panel you can see pricing for merchandise and intermodal averaged  for the quarter this pricing gain is smaller on a yearoveryear basis and essentially flat sequentially while still representing a small spread over rail inflation that said we remain confident that the value we create for our customers combined with increasing demand for our service product provides a solid foundation for growth and sustained pricing of both rail inflation now let’s look at the individual markets in more detail starting with merchandise overall merchandise revenue increased  to more than  billion in the quarter volume in the agricultural sector was up  feed grain shipments continued to benefit from the strong  harvest and ethanol shipments grew as lower corn prices resulted in higher ethanol production levels the construction sector grew  overall reflecting the ongoing recovery of housing and construction activity finally the industrial sector grew  led by strength in the energyrelated commodities including crude oil liquefied petroleum gas and frac sand moving to the next page let’s review the intermodal business intermodal revenue increased  to more than  million total volume grew  setting a new quarterly record for intermodal domestic volume was up  driven by continued highway to rail conversions and international volume was up  reflecting an economy that continues to expand total intermodal revenue per unit was flat as continued core pricing gains and higher fuel recoveries were offset by mix changes finally we continue to grow our international business by adding new service offerings and making strategic investments we anticipate opening our new terminal outside of montreal and completing expansion of our northwest ohio hub late in the fourth quarter moving to the next page let’s review the coal business coal volume increased  while revenue was essentially flat in the quarter at  million domestic coal volume increased  with growth in both northern and southern utility shipments reflecting higher natural gas prices replenishing of stockpiles and a competitive gain export coal tonnage declined  as global market conditions for both thermal and metallurgical coals remain solid the current api spot price of about  per ton remains well below the  the price level where us coals are more competitive the quinton metallurgical coal benchmark has also remained at low levels with a rate of about  per ton in the third quarter finally total revenue per unit was down  with lower export pricing fixed variable utility contracts and unfavorable domestic mix negatively impacting revenue per unit now let me wrap up with the outlook for the fourth quarter looking forward we expect that positive demand environment in the fourth quarter with stable to favorable conditions for  of our markets and unfavorable conditions for the remaining  looking at some of the key markets chemicals is favorable as we continue to capture opportunities created by the expanding domestic oil and gas industries in metals we saw production increase in the third quarter and we expect this trend to continue with demand in the automotive and energy markets being the key drivers strong intermodal growth will continue as our strategic network investments support highway to rail conversions we expect strong domestic coal volume growth in the fourth quarter as utilities continue to rebuild inventories forest products is neutral as continued strength in building products is expected to be offset by lower shipments of wood pellets automotive is neutral as slight growth in north american light vehicle production continues to be offset by modal conversions that occurred earlier this year export coal volume is expected to be significantly lower in the fourth quarter and our best estimate of  volume is now in the mid to high  million ton range overall we expect high levels of demand for our service will continue in the fourth quarter thank you and now i’ll turn the presentation over to oscar to review our operating results oscar x munoz thank you sir good morning everyone let me start with a review of our safety as it is our first and foremost priority in the third quarter the personal injury and train accident rates both increased versus last year’s near record lows while we’re disappointed that the metrics have ticked up slightly this quarter we remain focused on continuous improvement in safety we remain a leader in the nation’s safest industry and we’re committed to both community and employee safety let’s turn over to the service performance on the next slide as you can see on the left third quarter ontime originations and arrivals along with velocity and dwell were all stable sequentially while csx’s overall service performance is still below the level of our customers and we have come to expect demand on our network has remained strong as you can see on the chart on the right service levels have remained steady since the end of the first quarter and have continued to support volume growth and as importantly our cost of service is improving we are working with our customers to meet their rapidly increased demand levels but as you know resources in the rail industry take time to be put in place in that regard let me discuss the framework on the next page which we’ve been sharing with our customer to keep them updated on our service recovery efforts now while elementary the chart on page  conveys the four primary service components all of which are highly interrelated we tell our customers there’s a need to ensure not only that we have the right level of train crews but the necessary infrastructure and appropriate number of locomotives with a process that anticipates and reacts to changing business conditions let me briefly touch on each of the four areas depicted on the chart starting with trained crews we have hired about  te employees this year for a net increase of over  crews and revenue service this year we currently have  crews in training and expect to have over  by yearend hiring crews as you know takes six to nine months to find the right individuals and train them i’m happy to report that given the hiring we’re doing we’re well on our way to having the train crews we need to support both recovery and future growth turning to infrastructure this is the longest lead time area there is in the rail space in addition to the actual construction new projects can take years of planning and getting the necessary approvals from local state and federal officials the good news is that we have finished several projects and have many more underway to help improve network fluidity in chicago as well as our water level and river line routes in the northern tier additionally we’ve been steadily increasing our intermodal investment such as the expansion of our northwest ohio intermodal terminal which is nearly complete next and as you can see on the bottom of the chart the locomotive icon is colored red while we have added over  active units on a yearoveryear basis unfortunately the unanticipated rapid volume growth that we’re experiencing has exceeded the current capabilities of our locomotive fleet and is a major cause of our service challenges earlier this quarter we signed an agreement to purchase  new locomotives over the next few years with deliveries beginning early next year in  this combined with our own heavy repair program will generate the locomotives we need to enable recovery and again support future growth now because these units will not be arriving until after the first of the year we anticipate locomotives will continue to be a challenge for csx into next year lastly let me focus on the process bubble for a moment this is the area most in our control with the fastest cycle time we’re actively working to improve planning with other railroads especially in the critical chicago gateway we are nearly complete with our winter preparations and also very importantly we’ve been holding ongoing dialogue with our customers to keep them uptodate on our service recovery progress in order to better meet their continued volume growth now wrapping up on the next slide while the service is critical our team understands that safe operation is still job number one this team remains committed to safety and service and i greatly thank them for it and i’m proud to be part of it the network performance remains stable and we’ll continue working on maintaining the delicate balance of meeting increased customer demand and service recovery while costs are temporarily higher as we work through our service issues they have improved sequentially and we expect them to return to normal as fluidity is restored lastly we remain highly confident that our dedicated operating team will gradually restore service to the levels our customers have come to expect from csx so with that let me turn it over to fred for his review of the financials fredrik eliasson well thank you oscar and good morning everyone let me begin by providing a summary of our third quarter results as clarence mentioned revenue increased  versus the prior year on  higher volume driven by broadbased strength across our merchandise intermodal and coal markets expenses increased  versus last year driven primarily by higher volume which i will discuss in more detail in the coming slides operating income was  million up  or  million versus the prior year looking below the line interest expense was relatively flat to the prior year at  million in addition other income declined  million versus the prior year on two unique items first following our recent  billion debt offering we used some of the proceeds for early retirement of existing debt for which we incurred an additional expense redeeming the debt early generated a positive value of holding the proceeds in cash second we also incurred some environmental cleanup costs during the third quarter related to a nonoperating site income taxes were  million in the quarter for an effective tax rate of  overall net earnings were  million and eps was  per share up  and  respectively versus the prior year period with that let’s turn to the next slide and briefly discuss how fuel lag impacted the quarter on a yearoveryear basis the effect of the lag in our fuel surcharge program was favorable by  million this reflects  million of positive inquarter lag during the third quarter of  versus  million of negative inquarter lag for the same period in the prior year based on the current forward curve we expect the yearoveryear fuel lag impact to be slightly favorable in the fourth quarter turning to the next slide let’s review our expenses overall expenses increased  in the quarter i will talk about the top three expense items in more detail on the next slide but let me first briefly speak to the bottom two on this chart depreciation was up  to  million due to a higher net asset base going forward we are reviewing an asset light study that we normally conduct at this point in the year absent any changes we continue to expect depreciation to increase sequentially a few million dollars per quarter reflecting the ongoing investment in our business equipment rent was  up to  million driven by higher freight car rate incremental volume and longer car cycles now turning to the next slide let’s discuss our other expenses before i discuss the details of these expense categories let me first highlight the shift between our labor and mso lines during the third quarter csx fully insourced the management of its locomotive maintenance force as a result of this change labor and fringe expense increased by  million and mso expense decreased by the same amount so overall the change was expense neutral in the quarter looking ahead we expect this trend to continue given the longterm nature of this agreement and future quarter results should reflect this new baseline for labor fringe and mso expense now let me discuss the main drivers for each of expense categories beginning on the left with labor and fringe total labor and fringe increased  or  million versus last year excluding the insourcing impact labor and fringe increased  million yearoveryear of which  million was related to incremental volume and  million was inflation looking at efficiency and other labor productivity from volume absorption was offset by incremental over time and relief crew expense as we continue to incur some incremental costs related to network performance however these laborrelated costs declined sequentially from the second quarter in terms of fourth quarter expectations we expected similar level of labor inflation in the  million to  million range as well as higher yearoveryear expenses related to volume growth our ending third quarter headcount was up  versus the end of the second quarter as te employees increased to accommodate higher volume looking ahead we expect overall headcount to increase an additional  or about  employees by the end of the year versus our september level moving to the right on the slide mso expense increased  or  million versus the last year which includes  million of expense related to incremental volume and  million of inflation in addition there was a  million increase in casualty and other mso with the majority related to the resolution of claims from prior years and of course you can see the insourcing impact on mso that i mentioned earlier looking ahead to the fourth quarter we continue to expect higher yearoveryear mso expense related to inflation and volume growth finally expense – fuel expense declined  or  million versus last year as the impact of higher volume was mostly offset by favorable price and efficiency in addition we cycled an adjustment to an interline fuel receivable from the prior year which drove most of the favorability in the other category that concludes the expense review turning to the next slide i’d like to highlight our core earnings growth and incremental operating margin looking at the third quarter financial results and excluding the  million in lower liquidity damages that we recycling from the prior year the company generated  million of revenue growth that was partially offset by  million of incremental expense this netted to an increase in core operating income of  million versus the prior year or an incremental operating margin of  as we highlighted last quarter the core earnings strength of csx’s business is again more evident and this quarter’s results again underscores our positive outlook for the future now let me wrap up on the next slide first we continue to see broadbased strength across a diverse business portfolio and that strength is translating into more visible and more meaningful earnings improvement as oscar highlighted to effectively serve this growth we are executing our resource plan and investing in infrastructure locomotives and crews to return service to the superior levels that our customers expect looking at the fourth quarter we expect eps will grow at a rate roughly similar to the reported eps growth we saw here in the third quarter of course this assumes operations remain stable and volume growth remain strong albeit at a lower level than we saw in the third quarter recognizing that we’re not cycling the strong harvest from last year for the full year we continue to expect modest earnings growth as we look ahead csx still expects to achieve doubledigit eps growth in  and an operating ratio in the mids longer term with that let me turn the presentation back to michael for his closing remarks michael j ward well thank you fredrik over the past few years csx has overcome the challenge of an energy transition in america absorbing a loss of nearly  billion in coal revenue and leveraging new opportunities to sustain earnings growth csx has emerged from this transition as stronger company that strength was evident again this morning as csx delivered record third quarter earnings for its shareholders and stable service for its customers while reaffirming the company’s bright future that future is built on the continued execution of csx’s core strategy that means enhancing our ability to grow faster than the economy price above inflation make strategic investments and produce ever more efficient operations to continue delivering superior shareholder value that is what you saw drive our performance in the most recent quarter and we expect that strategy to drive our growth going forward in short we remain confidence csx will continue to deliver compelling customer value which directly translates into superior value for you our shareholders now we’ll be glad to take your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you we’ll now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from allison landry with credit suisse michael j ward good morning allison allison landry – credit suisse good morning thanks for taking my question i was wondering if you could talk about crude prices spiraling downward and maybe how worried are you about this given that a lot of your recent growth has hinged on energy markets so i was just wondering if you could maybe help us frame the risk here clarence w gooden allison this is clarence gooden obviously we have our eye on it with the crude prices this morning approaching  on west texas’ intermediate but in the nearterm we don’t see any impact on our crude business at this point in time we’ll watch those prices as they test the ceilings of what the bakken crude is but we don’t see any nearterm impact on that at this time we think it’s sustainable allison landry – credit suisse okay and is that view sort of similar for frac and ngls that you are moving clarence w gooden yes we see the same for that yes allison landry – credit suisse okay okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from rob salmon with deutsche bank clarence w gooden good morning rob robert salmon – deutsche bank hey good morning guys clarence as a followup to allison’s question you’ve done a really good job of kind of framing the export coal outlook predicated upon how the prices move are there certain price thresholds that we should be thinking about for the crude by rail where it comes more challenging based off of kind of what you see and i realize there is more moving parts given there is net backs involved but i would be curious to get your thoughts around that as well as any early comments you might have about the export coal outlook for  clarence w gooden well let me take your second question first it’s really too soon for us to give you any commentary on the export coal for  but we’ll certainly do that on our fourth quarter call on your first question i’m certainly not an expert on crude spreads here i did see a discussion this morning however by the former president and ceo of shell oil in which he said he thought it was very interesting that the opec countries may in fact be – one of the reasons they’re bringing down the price of oil is to test to see where american fracking companies would in fact start to shut down wells since nobody knew what that number was it was a closely guarded secret so your guess is as good as mine when those would start coming in but there’d obviously be some number but it’s to my knowledge we’re nowhere near close to what that number is robert salmon – deutsche bank fair enough appreciate the color operator thank you the next question is from thomas kim with goldman sachs clarence w gooden good morning thomas thomas kim – goldman sachs good morning thanks very much for taking the time here i just wanted to ask on the intermodal side first off can you give us a little bit of color in terms of where your domestic intermodal rates are versus tl presently clarence w gooden they’re running in general on the contractual side about  to  below where the truck load rates are the spot market however is much closer to what the truckload rates are we’ve been able to close that spot market in the – due to the tightening up of the truckload demand so we’re probably within  of those thomas kim – goldman sachs okay great and then just with regard to the comment on the mix shift can you help us understand what exactly it is because when we look at the mix between domestic and international they are actually – the shift has been only about  point yearonyear so i am wondering if there is more in mix and commodity or is there a mix between increase in longterm customer versus spot just if you could maybe give us a little bit more color with regard to that and then just i guess also related is there any reason why the domestic intermodal hasn’t – the share hasn’t grown more significantly just given that there has been more growth that we would have thought over the last year with regards to domestic over international clarence w gooden well in our doortodoor service product which has traditionally carried a higher rpu was roughly flat this quarter and in addition we saw pretty strong growth in what we’re traditionally backhaul lane markets and that has had a negative impact for example our umax product which moves from the east to points beyond chicago which are traditionally back haul flows has had a healthy volume growth even though it has had an rpu growth of around  that volume has still had a negative impact on the mix and the rest of the intermodal businesses as you know is managed on longterm contracts it has and has price escalators built in so it is difficult for us to in the short term to get some of those rates up thomas kim – goldman sachs all right thanks a lot operator thank you the next question is from bill greene with morgan stanley michael j ward hi bill william j greene – morgan stanley hi good morning fredrik i wanted to ask you for a little bit more color on the  commentary i think we’ve all been surprised at the volume growth so far in  and so can you talk a little bit about the confidence on that doubledigit growth rate does it suggest that the pricing outlook is superior and therefore incrementals should look better is that kind of the key to getting to double digit because i would assume volume growth would slow just given the comps but maybe you can offer some views there fredrik j eliasson well i mean as i think we said in our prepared remarks in the fourth quarter we already expect volumes to come down slightly from what we seen here over the last few quarters but we still expect a pretty robust macro environment next year and that coupled with some of these more secular things that we’re seeing in the energy environment and our intermodal trends continue to point towards a pretty healthy volume environment for  as well clearly as clarence has mentioned a little early right now to talk about what export coal is going to do but that is the wild card we’ve said that repeatedly and there is probably more downside than upside but we continue to produce pretty good results we continue to bring a fair amount to the bottom line even though we’re not operating as efficiently as we can so the fact that we are going to cycle some pretty significant headwinds we had here this year in the first quarter and even in the second quarter coupled with a good healthy top line environment gives us the confidence that we should be able to produce doubledigit earnings growth next year oscar x munoz and bill this is oscar the cost structure part that is mine we got that one that’s going to be a key focus for us next year and i think that will be a contributor factor william j greene – morgan stanley yeah that makes sense oscar in the third quarter – i think in the first half we talked about a little over  million of weather and inefficiencies due to the network challenges was there an impact that you can give us for the third quarter how much that might have cost oscar x munoz sure so you’re right it was about  million in the second quarter we estimated about  million here in the third quarter the difference was predominantly that we had less reliance on foreign horsepower here in the third quarter than we had in the second quarter as we’ve been able to ramp up additional leases and other repairs that we’ve been doing on our equipment over time it’s still running relatively high but the big delta between the second and third quarter was just that it was the locomotive costs william j greene – morgan stanley and you said one six oscar x munoz  yes william j greene – morgan stanley yeah okay thank you for the time operator thank you the next question is from ken hoexter with merrill lynch michael ward good morning ken ken hoexter – bank of america merrill lynch good morning great bottomline performance great to see can you maybe oscar address – the ontime origination and arrivals continue to remain so low and we can see the velocity improving but why are those measures and metrics stuck at kind of really reduced levels compared to the   we’ve seen in the past and what needs to turn is that just the employees and locos coming online or what else needs to happen to get the actual rails running on time oscar x munoz yeah ken great question yeah i think the public measures have always been and will continue to be sort of trailing indicators i think getting back up to the preservice recovery levels is going to take locomotives primarily i think we’ve got a lot of the crews but we need  or  more locomotives here over the next few months that would take us back to those   level that’s the biggest factor that’s why on that service framework again – it takes all of those things being interrelated but for us the red icon is power at this time ken hoexter – bank of america merrill lynch and then we can presume there is no issues with one manufacturer making them or with the new tier  or anything else in terms of getting those locos oscar x munoz well getting them is difficult right everybody is sold out there is not a single piece of power you can acquire we have gotten we have ordered  we’ll be getting our share of them with your question regarding tier  that’s being tested the western roads in particular are doing that and the one model that’s going to be coming out of one of the suppliers has actually fared well under heavy service so we’re confident that those new locomotives will do well now half of our order is new and half of our orders are the new versus old ken hoexter – bank of america merrill lynch all right and just a followup on the peer pricing is there clarence any thoughts on the decelerating peer pricing given demand is so strong why we continue to see the peer pricing metric fall it’s half a point but just why we see that downtick clarence w gooden ken that was mainly in one of our market areas i think you’re going to see very robust pricing going forward we are concentrated and focused on our pricing so in regards to the question that bill greene asked earlier pricing you’ll see going forward being very strong and very robust for us ken hoexter – bank of america merrill lynch all right i appreciate the time thanks operator thank you the next question is from chris wetherbee with citi clarence w gooden good morning chris chris wetherbee – citi investment research hey good morning thanks maybe a question on the utility coal side just curious sort of how that restocking is playing out just wanted to get a rough sense of sort of how your utilities that you serve are in terms of historical inventories or inventories relative to historical levels are we getting closer how much longer do you think this plays out clarence w gooden the north chris is almost at their target levels in fact you could say they’re at target levels the south is still building and by the fourth quarter should be at target levels chris wetherbee – citi investment research okay so it feels like there is about one more quarter or so to get prepped and then we‘ll see what the winter brings us clarence w gooden that’s right chris wetherbee – citi investment research okay and then my second question just a little bit of a bigger picture stepping back and thinking about the  or target as you stand with it now and the market as it stands today could you give us some sense of sort of what you need to see happen to get toward that target move towards that target you made great strides on or in the third quarter just want to get a rough sense of sort of how to think about sort of the puts and takes towards getting to that  and maybe a little bit of color sort of when that could potentially happen fredrik eliasson sure so obviously this is – we’ve put together two quarters now in a row below  and we have said we want to move to the  is kind of the target that we have out there and clearly the foundation for that is service excellence we need to restore service to the level that we expect from ourselves and the customers expect from us and as we do that we think three good things will happen and we’ve seen that in the past which is that we continue to price above inflation and we see that the market is tightening up and we see opportunities to accelerate our pricing two we continue to see a robust economic environment and we see now the positives of the new energy environment that should allow us to grow faster than the economy as a whole and then as we get our network velocity up to the level we expect we should also see cost coming out of the system again between those three which are really the levers we’ve been pulling for an extended period of time we see the math is pretty compelling it gets you there over time but over the last two years as you’ve seen with  million from coal coming out in terms of our top line we have stood still for a period of time as we now transition out of that period we feel the momentum is coming back again as we feel pretty good about where we’re heading now chris wetherbee – citi investment research so natural progression over the next couple years i guess michael j ward yes chris wetherbee – citi investment research okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from tom wadewitz with ubs michael j ward good morning tom thomas wadewitz – ubs investment research hi good morning wanted to ask clarence a little bit about how much visibility you have to pricing at this point i would think that with some of the multiyear contracts that would be expiring next year you probably would have been in negotiations at this point maybe you have some of those deals signed already so can you give us a flavor of what you are seeing for pricing for  just in terms of either the multiyear contracts or other business and perhaps also what – how much has already been repriced for  clarence w gooden we are well along in our pricing for  i would tell you that in excess of  of our contracts that we have to renew for  have been repriced it’s looking very good that is why i made the statement earlier that prices were going up for  i felt very positive about what ’s pricing is looking like it will be much more robust than you’ve seen probably in the last three to four years for csx thomas wadewitz – ubs investment research so when we think about that – what more robust means does that mean a percentage point higher does that mean more than that could it be  or  percentage points higher than the pricing you have seen in the last couple years clarence w gooden it means significantly improved thomas wadewitz – ubs investment research okay michael j ward welcome back tom thomas wadewitz – ubs investment research i don’t know if that counts as my second or not i will try to – oscar do you have a quick thought on the timing of the locomotives coming up you said  i think is for multiple years you need  to  more but when do you get  to  more is that first half next year or oscar x munoz yeah thanks so yes the early part of next year we’ll get  new thomas wadewitz – ubs investment research okay oscar x munoz and then we are hoping for early delivery of a couple hundred of a – of the second hundred later in the year but we also have our internal what we call heavy repair process that should deliver roughly between  and  over that same between now and the middle part of next year so we’ve another outlet just other than the purchases it is just timing thomas wadewitz – ubs investment research okay that’s great i appreciate the time thank you operator thank you the next question is from cherilyn radbourne with td securities michael j ward good morning cherilyn cherilyn radbourne – td securities thanks very much good morning my question relates to chicago it is my understanding the rails have agreed to a series of protocols that will be triggered automatically if certain thresholds are tripped this winter and i was just wondering if you could give us a bit of color on how that will work and how you think it will improve the industry’s recoverability oscar x munoz yes cherilyn this is oscar yes certainly there is a broader set of issues and a very complex environment right kind of a spider network six class i’s heavy commuter and passenger rail on the plays so those require a lot of coordination what is called the ctco which is in essence the terminal operating team that is represented by most of the railroads it has been a coordinating factor there and has done a pretty good job remember we forget that chicago just got slammed with a huge amount of volume which has created a little bit attention so knowing that knowing that another winter is coming and that heavy volumes continue we have been working across most of the industry to sort of get ctco to act more like a single terminal we’re going to  operations during the period a lot more engagement between all levels and most of the railroads again and then importantly to your question improve the informational planning tools because for a while there was kind of word of mouth i called you and said i was in trouble and then you tried to fix it or you didn’t see that problem and so rather than taking the human aspect of that let’s put it in a system put it in a scorecard if you will and then that will drive what we call an alert status that will increase the level of interaction and coordination so it’s a combination of people communicating more using tools to get facts and data so that we are not guessing and then really there is kind of a great level of trust desire and capability for everyone to work together there so it is a broad complex environment and we are focused on getting that done for the next few months cherilyn radbourne – td securities that’s great and that’s all from me thank you operator thank you the next question is from david vernon with bernstein michael j ward good morning david david s vernon – sanford c bernstein  co llc good morning thanks for taking the question so fredrik as you think about the incremental margin performance going forward what do you think is the right sort of range we should be looking at into  it seems like the volume driven leverage is having a good effect and if clarence is right you’re going to get more pricing should we be actually expecting the incremental margin performance to step up next year fredrick j eliasson we’ve said that in order to get to our mids target that we need to have incremental margins above  this quarter depending on how you look at it somewhere between  to  and i think that is a good place to be as  as you think about  specifically you’re right we’re going to have i think an improved pricing environment but you’re also going to have a period of time where we are going to have to essentially over resource slightly in order to get the velocity of our network up and running so there are some puts and takes there but you clearly have to be in the  to  range longterm in order to get to the place where we need to get to david s vernon – sanford c bernstein  co llc and then maybe just as a followup michael we are talking a lot about the tightness of the rail infrastructure and i would love to get your perspective on an industry issue which would be not specific to any type of specific deal but do you think that consolidation across the larger class i’s could actually improve the capacity in the network in a way that would not be achievable without further consolidation or do think that that it is less of a reality going forward michael j ward i think what we see out there david is that all the railroads are increasing their capacity similar to what we are doing and i think those will produce the capacity needed to move america’s freight david s vernon – sanford c bernstein  co llc so you don’t – we wouldn’t see an extra step up in efficiency through consolidation across some of the class i’s michael j ward you might actually see a step back as you know in the past mergers there have been severe service disruptions after one of those transactions david s vernon – sanford c bernstein  co llc great thanks very much for the commentary operator thank you the next question is from the john larkin with stifel nicolaus john g larkin – stifel nicolaus  co inc hi good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my question clarence w gooden good morning john john g larkin – stifel nicolaus  co inc just wanted to bore in a little bit more deeply on the  million that was the cited cost of the congestion in the third quarter for the company quite a bit down from where it was in the second quarter but that strikes me as being a relatively low number given the extent and farreaching nature of the congestion so as you resource up by adding more people add all these locomotives and so forth presumably that’s going to cost more on the other hand than the cost of congestion is costing you presently is that going to provide a little bit of a margin headwind over the next say two to four quarters as you go forward fredrik eliasson i think you are pulling on one of the reasons why we are not putting that explicit number into our earnings report at this point because the calculation itself becomes more complicated as you start to ramp up additional hiring and so forth but if you look at where were again in the third quarter while we’ve had some additional people in training the big driver really was the difference in terms of how we’ve sourced our locomotives for the quarter and so it has come down because it is a lot cheaper to get our leases the use leased locomotives versus the foreign horsepower and as you think about the next couple of quarters to your point there will be incremental cost that will come in as we bring on additional locomotives as we bring on additional maintenance for those and additional hiring that we are doing so i think that’s a fair point michael j ward but then again all those resources again remember investment equals better service and service equals better volume and margins and that is the reason why we do all this and i think other than just bringing on equipment our process we are spending a little bit better again the indicators you see out there are trailing and you will be to see more of the financial better financial impact here over the next couple of quarters john g larkin – stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you for the answer just maybe as a followon a while ago you shifted to the fixed and variable cost pricing approach for utility coal contracts volume has spiked as utilities have scrambled to sort of replenish their inventories and stockpiles has the fixed and variable pricing model worked the way you thought it would and was one of the reasons why you’re able to pick up a little competitive market share that you touched on just briefly during your formal comments clarence w gooden john this is clarence one it has worked the way we expected it to work and two it is not the reason we made a competitive pick up john g larkin – stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from jeff kauffman with buckingham research michael j ward good morning jeff jeffrey kauffman – buckingham research hey good morning guys thanks for taking my question and congratulations two questions one financial and then one a followup to the system fluidity question fredrik how have these changes in investments affected your capital budget thoughts for  and  and can you address the drag on operating cash flow from the reversal of bonus depreciation how much is that weighing on operating cash flow and will that change as we get into  fredrik eliasson sure in terms of capital i think we have a better idea in the fourth quarter but clearly because of the locomotives we’re going to be purchasing next year we’re probably looking at the higher end of the  to  probably around  realistically in terms of the cash flow just ask me that question again jeffrey kauffman – buckingham research well a bonus depreciation reversed and that’s been a drag i thought of about  million to  million on operating cash flow and i was just wondering if we’re going to start to mitigate that in the next year or two and what that drag is likely to be fredrik eliasson sure so next year i think will be the height of that drag we’ve started seeing a little bit here in this year but next year essentially our cash taxes will be almost at the statutory rate so   there won’t be many opportunities to defer taxes next year because of the fact that we’ve enjoyed that bonus depreciation for so many years but as you move into  you will start building up some of that depreciable base again now all of this assumes that bonus depreciation will not be extended which there is still some talk about but right now it looks like about  million or so  million of impact on our cash flow yearoveryear just from the fact that bonus depreciation is going away in  michael j ward this is michael i’d just add when i go to dc i think the general sentiment is they probably will do the tax extenders before the end of the year jeffrey kauffman – buckingham research okay and then mike a thought question a lot of people that invest in the stock today weren’t around in the s when we had the service issues and that led to the stb’s merger moratorium and then the new rules i heard your answer to the earlier question that consolidation would probably muck up the system but in terms of the concept of consolidation there was a reason the stb made it tougher do you think in this environment when service across the industry is struggling that the argument can be made that service would be better as a result of consolidation or that any large consolidation could even be likely in this environment michael j ward well i think all this is very speculative but as you know the stb is very concerned about the service levels being produced by the industry with this surge of business and it even asked for new reports on a weekly basis to monitor that so i might speculate they would be very cautious about this because in the past they have created disruptions and the industry is already somewhat slowdown by this tremendous growth in the volumes jeffrey kauffman – buckingham research so you would argue that the regulators would be very skeptical in this environment anyway michael j ward that would be my speculation but you’d probably be better to ask them jeffrey kauffman – buckingham research okay very good mike thanks for your view operator thank you the next question is from scott group with wolfe research michael j ward good morning scott scott group – wolfe research hey good morning guys fredrik if we take out the liquidated damages this quarter and a year ago you still saw a pretty big increase in other railway revenue can you give us some color on what that was and if that is sustainable or not how we should model that going forward fredrik j eliasson yes if you look at where we are on other revenue i think there is couple other drivers if you look at a yearoveryear clearly we are seeing a little bit of higher incidental revenue predominantly in intermodal because of the tight capacity environment that we find ourselves in we see some of the subsidiary railroads have done a little bit better than they did a yearago and then last year was a little bit depressed because of some of the revenue adjustments that we had so that kind of explain it so i would say that this quarter was a pretty good run rate i think historically i have said  million to  million is probably a good place to be we were slightly above that here this quarter but somewhere around  million to  million is probably a good place to be in other revenue excluding any liquidated damages scott group – wolfe research that is great and then the guidance for next year if i remember when you first laid it out for us there was this assumption that coal would stabilize and now you don’t add that caveat as much about coal stabilizing so do you think you need coal to be flat next year or is there enough going on in pricing and merchandise growth where you can still get to the doubledigit earnings growth next year even if coal gets worse next year fredrik j eliasson i think we’re trying to stay away from any specific market and try to predict what it will do because as we try to do that in the past we found ourselves that we usually are wrong either good or bad for that matter and so we try to stay at a high level as we look at next year we still feel that doubledigit is the right place to be but clearly there are lots of pluses and minuses we got the fact that the macro environment as i said earlier is positive we’ve got a tightening capacity environment that should be helpful in the pricing side but then you do have export coal and you do have the fact that we need to see the cost coming out of the system as shortterm over resource but then see the cost coming out and then the thing that you don’t know what is going to happen is obviously weather we just don’t know the impact on weather both in terms of utility coal stockpiles and we don’t know whether in terms of the impact of our network performance so take all that together and when we add that and we’ll look at it and we still say that doubledigit is the right place to be scott group – wolfe research okay thank you guys operator thank you the next question is from jason seidl with cowen michael j ward good morning jason matt elkott – cowen and company good morning this is actually matt elkott for jason thank you for taking our question i want to go back to the locomotive topic my question is assuming current freight demand levels when you guys start receiving the new locomotives is the focus going to be on moving more freight or is it moving similar freight levels more efficiently michael j ward yes and yes i think it’s an interesting question but no absolutely i mean i think there is – whatever pentup demand in customers that we have some areas where we can easily use more power will generate more business but also importantly to sort of turbocharge our system to spin more rapidly so it will be useful for both of those areas matt elkott – cowen and company okay and just a quick followup on the export coal topic have you guys had to do more on the rate front in order to keep producers competitive with your fixed variable structure clarence w gooden matt this is clarence gooden first we don’t have fixed variable rates in the export coal but to answer your question i think you were driving at we said earlier on last quarter’s call and to reiterate on this one we are at the bottom on the export rates so we’re doing nothing we are as low as we can go everything from here forward is up matt elkott – cowen and company okay great thank you very much operator thank you the next question is from ben hartford with robert w baird michael j ward good morning ben benjamin hartford – robert w baird  co good morning guys i guess this is for oscar i just want to get a little bit more specific in terms of service expectations you had talked about gradual improvement and i think fredrik had talked about returning to service levels that you and your customers expect i’m just wondering more quantitatively what does that mean do you think that – if we use the high watermark of train velocity for let’s say it was  is it reasonable to expect that you can get back to those levels the cycle and we can define a cycle for as long as we need to i mean  can train speed velocity get back to  levels is that a realistic target do you think that – have you seen enough to think that surpassing those levels is unreasonable as well i’m just trying to get a perspective on how quickly and how fully we should expect service to be restored oscar munoz i think to reiterate what was said before it is a gradual and not linear as we go into really the first half of  i think after that fact i think – again these things being trailing indicators you’ll begin to see them markedly increase and yes to previous levels and not necessarily static of that i think as we spend more – we had two record years before this particular issue i think it’s easy to forget that but i think once we get past this really this power resource and again our volume sort of begins to stabilize as opposed to the surges that we’ve had i think it’s important i’ll tell you the confidence that i have from seeing all this just in this quarter alone july we had about  gtm growth and that’s a month where everyone takes off for vacation in our employee workforce in the union and we struggled with that i mean that was a power and crew issue in our business the ability to recover is critical and the fact that in this quarter you’re seeing the results that we have given the fact that a good four to six weeks was really a struggle period i think sort of gives me the confidence that our recoverability process is there even with limited resources so as we get more i think we’ll improve again gradually but not necessarily linear benjamin j hartford – robert w baird  co okay and then i guess just a followon on that point in terms of the employee count it did growth on a yearoveryear basis did accelerate modestly through the quarter is there an idea when that growth rate will peak and then begin to decelerate clarence w gooden i think we expect by the end of this year to be up about  and i think you’ll see a slight increase in the first quarter as well but it is nothing significant the predominance of our hiring right now is in the te ranks and some on the support side and the mechanical side but it is not a significant increase benjamin j hartford – robert w baird  co okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from keith schoonmaker with morningstar clarence w gooden good morning keith schoonmaker – morningstar inc yes kind of a question also related to crewing and labor longerterm question what portion of td labor works on hourly contracts now and do you see moving to hourly based compensation as beneficial for productivity and quality of life fredrik eliasson i don’t think in terms of our te folks we have any hourly workforce i think that obviously that could be a benefit the question is ultimately what you have to do in order to make that work economically with the unions as you do go through those negotiations keith schoonmaker – morningstar inc maybe fredrik i could switch to a capex question in light of the locomotive orders in your remarks that around  will be invested next year in capex there’s been a big slug of capex with ptc and maybe can you give us a quick update on where the spending is this year and next and do you expect that capex would remain still in the  or  range even after ptc is fully invested at least for the heavy capital portion fredrik eliasson yes so ptc is above our core capital guidance so that’s  to  – around  next year excludes ptc if you look at ptc in itself we are spending about  million this year and by the end of this year we will spend about  billion we’ve said that cost is approximately  billion in total at least and we will probably spend somewhere in the neighborhood of the same amount we’re spending this year next year and then it will start coming down after that keith schoonmaker – morningstar inc okay great thank you operator thank you the next question is from walter spracklin with rbc michael j ward good morning walter walter spracklin – rbc capital markets thanks very much good morning everyone so two questions here one for i guess clarence one for oscar and clarence just really a clarification on your fourth quarter outlook in particular for domestic coal and ag given the change in compares going into the fourth quarter  they’re quite substantial i mean you did  million tons in fourth quarter of  but you are running at a  million run rate this year to say that it’s favorable i mean it would have to be up  to  to maintain the  million run rate so are you indicating that we should look at some kind of seasonal drop in the fourth quarter or do we run it at that kind of  million clips that you’ve been experiencing this year even though it means up   year over year clarence w gooden you’re talking about coal walter spracklin – rbc capital markets utility coal domestic utility yes clarence w gooden oh domestic utility coal walter spracklin – rbc capital markets i mean you’re  million fourth quarter  but  million last quarter so i mean if we are favorable yes up yearoveryear you’d have to be really up  to  to maintain  million tons just curious if that’s what you are guiding are you guiding kind of continued  million or are we looking at a rather substantial downtick given the seasonal nature of the fourth quarter if seasonal at all clarence w gooden well i’m not looking at it on my sheet here in terms of tons i was looking at it in terms of percentages but i’m guiding you to strong a very strong fourth quarter in coal on a yearoveryear basis walter spracklin – rbc capital markets right okay clarence w gooden utility coal walter spracklin – rbc capital markets utility coal okay and i guess the same question kind of is for ag right except the flipside you had a very strong fourth quarter last year  carloads this year you’re – i mean this quarter you’re  so flat would mean a significant downturn in the ag just curious if you are guiding us here relative to third quarter or relative to last year’s fourth quarter michael j ward relative to the last year’s fourth quarter walter spracklin – rbc capital markets okay all right oscar just a followup on the congestion side you indicated that there are lots of opportunities that you have internally all the railroads have internally to increasing capacity through your own strategies at what point does that get exhausted in other words when you’ve exhausted a good degree of your own capacity expansion issues or initiatives where does the next pinch point come up oscar x munoz michael let me tackle that i think what we find is we have a fair amount of ability to continue to expand a fair amount of our network is single track we can add a second track to that in fact a long passing siding and making it double track so we have the ability on our line of road to incrementally add capacity and we are in the areas that are growing so i think the horizon with which railroads can continue to increase their capacity on their own i think is fairly longterm walter spracklin – rbc capital markets okay so you are saying the next pinch point several pinch points are all kind of inter – or intracompany not necessarily between interchange points of chicago or with your supply chain partners anything like that michael j ward well as oscar said earlier chicago is complex and it is always going to be complex and we’re working cooperatively to increase the throughput there but i think your categorization and most of the needs to create capacity are internal to the existing individual railroads walter spracklin – rbc capital markets okay thank you very much operator thank you the next question is from justin long with stephens michael j ward good morning justin justin long – stephens inc good morning thanks for taking my questions first one i wanted to ask was on intermodal margins you’ve talked over the last few quarters or so about how they’ve caught up to other commodity groups with the exception of coal and chemicals but as you look out over the next several years and think about the opportunity to get price and also build density do you think that intermodal margins can be significantly better than the noncoal nonchemicals businesses michael j ward well certainly intermodal margins are going up they’re going up for a couple of reasons the trains are getting longer the double stack clearances are obviously helping getting more density on the trains the efficiencies that we have in the newer and more modern terminals with the automation that made the margins better and frankly the price increases that we are getting in the marketplace now both in our international business and in our domestic business has got a long way towards improving those margins so i think you’ll see margin improvement in the intermodal marketplace as we move forward justin long – stephens inc okay and second question i wanted to ask – i know there is several intermodal terminal projects on the network you mentioned montreal the expansion at northwest ohio in the prepared comments but is there any way you could quantify how much capacity the current intermodal terminal projects that are underway will add your network michael j ward well i don’t have those numbers right in front of me but we can make them available to you justin long – stephens inc okay great i will just followup on that i appreciate the time michael j ward okay operator thank you and our final question today is from cleo zagrean with macquarie capital michael j ward good morning cleo cleo zagrean – macquarie capital thank you very much for taking my question good morning my first question is about the outlook for rates on coal you have already stated that you see the export rates only going up from here in terms of your stance what do you – where do think we should see coal rates all add up to when we also consider the impact of fixed variable contracts on the domestic front and any mix issues michael j ward well i think clarence – this is michael i think clarence actually said that the export rates will not go down anymore i think they won’t go up unless we see a change in the world marketplace so he was not saying they’re going to go up he was saying they would not go down anymore on the domestic side clarence maybe you could address what you are seeing there clarence w gooden on the fixed variable obviously as the tonnage goes up on that part of the fixed variable and about a third of our contracts are under fixed variable the average rpu will go down as the volume goes up if the volume stays flat next year then you will see the rates will stay the same if the volume goes down then the rpu will go up next year michael j ward but your base pricing is going up clarence w gooden but the base pricing itself is going up cleo zagrean – macquarie capital thank you and my second question was with regards to eps guidance prior to today i think as of last quarter or even the most recent conference you were saying that you expect to return to doubledigit eps growth beginning in  and i would have taken that to mean that’s the beginning of a series of years now you are saying you expect doubledigit growth in  should we take this to mean any kind of change in longterm guidance for eps beyond  and any other comment you would like to make for beyond  i would greatly appreciate it thank you fredrik j eliasson no i think that overall our guidance has been  i think we tried to stay away from longerterm guidance than that because of the fact that it’s hard to predict but our overall arching goal is to getting our operating margins is down to the mids and that’s the longerterm guidance that we have but so there’s no change in guidance from that perspective cleo zagrean – macquarie capital thank you very much michael j ward thank you thank you everyone we’ll see you again next quarter operator thank you this concludes today’s teleconference thank you for your participation in
