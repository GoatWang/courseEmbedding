james financial  services and products  raymond james trust na  creating a legacy of giving our company personal investing institutional  corporate advisor opportunities account login creating a legacy of giving is a private foundation or a donoradvised fund the best alternative when people think of leaving a legacy many first consider the path of creating a private foundation private foundations bring with them a certain level of prestige and provide you with total and private control but there are costs associated with that autonomy including administrative burdens that could be reallocated into other charitable means for many a donoradvised fund is an attractive alternative with this option you retain a strong influence on how your charitable gifts are used but free yourself from significant costs a private foundation requires more money time legal assistance and administration to establish and maintain compared to a donoradvised fund which is a relatively flexible strategy what is a donoradvised fund a donoradvised fund or daf is a type of charitable fund that is administered by a public charity and can be established with as little as  one such organization is the raymond james charitable endowment fund rjcef which receives donations from individuals and other entities and then donates these funds to the appropriate charitable recipients per the donor’s wishes both a private foundation and a daf allow you to choose what charities you want to assist at a later date in addition they both can be named to honor you personally and like a private foundation a daf is immediately deductible for federal income tax subject to applicable restrictions estate and gift purposes upon acceptance from the rjcef   as with a private foundation a daf gives you the flexibility to assign the fund allocation to your children family or friends appointed to a donoradvised fund may recommend how donations are to be invested within the fund identify the charities that will ultimately receive grants from the fund specify how much will be given determine who will make the above decisions instead of or as a successor to themselves the daf also provides key tax advantages such as while both strategies offer immediate tax deductions donoradvised deductions are more generous you can deduct cash contributions to a fund totaling up to  of your adjusted gross income each year the limit for donations to a private foundation is  you can also deduct up to  of your adjusted gross income for donations to a fund of longterm securities that have appreciated in value since you bought them for a private foundation the limit for such donations is  with a private foundation you are required to pay a  excise tax on investment income annually with a donoradvised fund however there is no tax on investment income choosing the path that fits is a daf right for you or should you pursue the private foundation path instead if you would like to explore either option for your charitable giving strategy be sure to work closely with your financial advisor not only can they help you reach your charitable giving goals they can also help you develop a strategy – working alongside your cpa or tax professional – that best integrates into your overall financial plan no matter which route you choose supporting deserving organizations can create positive changes in people’s lives and communities for years to come but remember for any successful financial plan it’s important to establish your personal goals for both the short and long term early in the process a few steps taken today can go a long way toward helping your charity tomorrow please note changes in tax laws or regulations may occur at any time and could substantially impact your situation you should discuss any tax or legal matters with the appropriate professional getting started individual solutions market commentary and research services and products raymond james

trusts few people understand the terminology and technicalities of trusts until they discover they need one  and by then it may be too late use this list of frequently asked questions and their answers to help you better understand the reasons for trusts and the process involved in establishing them what is a trust a trust is a legal agreement between two parties the person who creates the trust and the person institution or independent trust company responsible for administering the trust the trustee the trustee manages the assets placed in the trust for the benefit of a third party the beneficiary who needs a trust not everyone needs a trust but most people should consider one trusts aren’t just for the affluent setting up a trust is an excellent way to control what happens to your estate regardless of its size to possibly reduce estate taxes and protect against the expense and aggravation of probate more than two million us taxpayers have established trusts those who benefit most are married couples with net estates exceeding  million and single people with net estates exceeding  million however under the current tax law these amounts will increase over the next several years the net value of an estate can be determined by adding the market value of all assets including real estate personal property businesses bank accounts investments iras or other retirement benefits and life insurance then subtracting liabilities unlike wills trusts are not subject to probate and therefore allow you to keep your affairs private will or trust which is best most people need both a big advantage of a trust is that it is generally the best strategy to avoid probate and protect financial privacy wills must be validated by probate court a lengthy and expensive process that can take six months to two years and in some cases even longer probating a will may involve attorney’s fees executor’s commissions administrative and other court costs unlike wills trusts are not subject to probate and therefore enable you to keep your affairs private and minimize settlement costs and estate taxes why set up a trust there are many reasons to set up trusts married couples often realign the ownership of their assets to save substantial federal estate taxes and pass more on to their heirs rather than owning assets jointly they choose to own assets individually so that they can each take full advantage of the increasing unified credit amount preserving each spouse’s unified credit can save hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes if the time comes that you are no longer able to handle your own affairs trusts can ensure that there will be someone who is experienced and objective to “mind the store” if there is a serious illness or disability a trust ensures that a plan is in place to take care of your needs and those of your loved ones when the trust is managed by a fullservice trust company other professional services can be provided such as bill paying business owners can use trusts to save on estate taxes when passing along businesses to heirs trusts are also useful for blended families with spouses or children from previous marriages the trust can spell out exactly how marriage affects the inheritance of children or grandchildren from a first marriage naming an independent trust company removes the emotional element often associated with friends or family members who sets up a trust usually attorneys draft trusts what about fees generally fees for trust services are spelled out in the trust document under normal circumstances they are calculated annually based on the level of responsibility assumed by the trustee and the value of the assets in the trust fees are charged quarterly or monthly and a portion may be taxdeductible how are trust assets invested ultimately it is the purpose of the trust that determines how the assets are invested and it is the responsibility of the trustee to see that the purpose is carried out often the person who creates the trust will name a professional investment manager to work with the trustee and make investment recommendations based on the goals of the trust the needs of the beneficiaries and the time horizon is a trust right for you even people of moderate means may be subject to estate taxes which could be significantly higher than income taxes but saving on taxes isn’t the only reason for trusts some families want to plan for longterm care or education for their children or grandchildren others want to provide for a favorite charity one thing is certain if a trust is needed the time to plan for it is now how do you choose a trustee many people prefer to name an independent trust company to handle their affairs trustees who don’t deal with trusts on a regular basis can be overwhelmed by the duties required of them also naming an independent trust company removes the emotional element often associated with friends or family members and assures that your wishes are fulfilled exactly as they are spelled out in the trust why choose raymond james trust na there are several advantages to naming raymond james trust as trustee unlike other providers of
