items within the miranda warning that law enforcement are obliged to inform suspects during the arrest process read  you have the right to speak to an attorney  if you cannot afford an attorney one

thousands of germans just because he created employment doesn’t mean he was doing something good june   at  am bev says httpwwwnakedcapitalismcommarkamestheleftsbigsellouthowtheacluandhumanrightsgroupsquietlyexterminatedlaborrightshtml june   mark ames the left’s big sellout – how the aclu and human rights groups quietly exterminated labor rights by mark ames the author of going postal rage murder and rebellion from reagan’s workplaces to clinton’s columbine cross posted from the daily banter progressive intellectuals have been acting very bipolar towards labor lately characterized by wild mood swings ranging from the “we’re sorry we abandoned labor how could we” sentiment during last year’s wisconsin uprising against koch waterboy scott walker to the recent “labor is deadit’s all labor’s fault” snarling after the recall vote against gov walker failed snip puzzled i called alex edwards amnesty’s media relations guy in washington dc to ask him why labor unions didn’t rate important enough as a “topic” on amnesty’s “list of topics” edwards was confused claimed that he was totally unaware that there was a “list of topics” on amnesty’s home page and promised to get back to me i haven’t heard back from him snip on the advice of an old friend jan frel i read an excellent book on the human rights industry james peck’s ideal illusions which helps answer why labor rights have been airbrushed out of the language of human rights it wasn’t always this way economic rights and workplace rights were for decades at the very heart of the human rights movement this was officially enshrined in  when the united nations adopted a point “universal declaration of human rights” putting labor rights and economic equality rights alongside those we’re more familiar with today like freedom of expression due process religion and so on but somehow labor rights and economic justice have been effectively amputated from the human rights agenda and forgotten about in tandem with the american left’s abandonment of labor in peck’s history human rights watch stands out as a force for rank neoliberalism a major player in the exterminationbyomission of labor rights and economic equality rights from the language of human rights how this happened sheds at least a bit more light on how the left abandoned labor snip neier goes further explicitly rejecting the universal declaration of human rights because nine of its  articles focus on economic rights as human rights neier objects to that singling out for censure “such economic issues as a right to work to social security and to an adequate standard of living” the human rights article on “a right to work” that neier dismisses as “authoritarian” is article  and it reads “article   everyone has the right to work to free choice of employment to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment  everyone without any discrimination has the right to equal pay for equal work  everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity and supplemented if necessary by other means of social protection  everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests” it’s interesting that neier rejects article  the article on labor which he mislabels as “a right to work” because back in the s when neier was executive director of the aclu he supported big business’s “right to work” antilabor laws against the rest of the left and the aclu which at the time still supported labor rights as civil rights the socalled “right to work” laws are grossly misnamed—they’re really laws designed to bust unions by making it even more difficult for them to organize worker power against the overwhelming power of the corporation it was corporate pr flaks hired to deceive and conceal the real purpose of those laws who came up with the false name “right to work” laws fred koch father of charles and david koch and one of the founders of the john birch society got his start in rightwing politics as a leader of the “right to work” movement in kansas in the mids less than twenty years after fred koch fought to destroy labor rights through “right to work” laws the executive director of the aclu aryeh neier—the same aryeh neier who later led human rights watch— colluded with william buckley to push the aclu rightward against labor by getting the aclu to represent big business and “right to work” laws under the guise of “protecting free speech”—the same bullshit pretense always used by lawyers and advocates to help big business crush labor and democracy this “free speech” pretense is the basis on which the aclu currently supports the citizens united decision which effectively legalized the transformation of america into an oligarchy july   at  pm sickofitinca says i am so happy to get these product updates this way i know what to buy i will always support the person being boycotted because i believe that the people doing the boycotting are unamerican july   at  pm wilmoth nichols says i am very glad to have this list fortunately i have not been buying them anyway i guess we truly “have the best government money can buy” july   at  am henry says all these rightwing nuts claiming they’ll buy these products are full of it right wingers have no loyalty only greed they’ll buy whatever’s cheapest whatever is on sale and then wave the flag and call it “the american way” july   at  am shawn oehlke says i believe we could eliminate all of this rancor back and forth about what business entity owns what politician with some simple rules for politicians  any politician who feels it necessary to legislatively assist a corporate entity while in office may never work for that entity it’s subsidiaries or individuals with a vested corporate position within the corporate entity or it’s subsidiaries   any lawyer who feels the calling to public service within a legislative branch must surrender their law license forever if and when heshe is elected to that office these two rules if enacted and enforced would bring only those people who are truly interested in the honorable position of public service july   at  pm rants in my pants chickfila chickens out

the state and its people are like michigan early victims of the enslavement of the states–by alec the corporate bullies gathered by kochs– that is progressing efficiently in  states so far wisconsin is one of  states where alec owns all three branches of state government what is needed is to support the industries that are not koch and their destructive buddies to take whatever political action is possible to undermine koch rule and not let them piece by piece become dictators of the states and their goal the country the best thing we can do is support every company and every government that

has generated enough demand to cause problems for the developer forbes reported on tuesday “the workload is a bit overwhelming now” said yearold ivan pardo the developer behind buycott “our android app was just recently released and the surge of new users today has highlighted a serious bug on certain devices that needs to be fixed immediately so all other development tasks i was working on get put on hold until i can get this bug fixed” pardo who has been designing the app over the past  months said there is no partisanship behind buycott which provides users with the ownership background of products by scanning their barcode the app also allows users to take part in online campaigns that boycott or alternatively highlight companies that support their political viewpoints buycott is also asking users to help keep its database updated by sharing products not yet recognized by the app ……… the above article should also sharply apply to the following and other related articles

countries they are republicans and they are using their money to buy the congressmans and senators and they want to buy the white house if they get their way in  america is cook for the rest of us a little over half of america need to listen to what these people are saying when they speak president obama say raise the minimum wage to hour and republican leaders say he has a wrong policy president obama say give me money to fix the bridges and roads and the house and senate say no “they need to cut taxes for the kochs and other billionaires and the other  of america be dam where i live the express way is very bobbies and hard riding on it when the republican leadership say president obama have wrong policy code word for racism because what is wrong with raising the minimum wage and fixing our roads the republican has control of both the congress and senate since january and before that they had control of the congress and all they did was try to take away health care form the poor and anything that would help americans make a good living and move up the ladder each congressman get paid hour and we the taxpayer for them and their family health care so since  all congress have done is work very little under john boehner the speaker of congress and went home to rest when they was at work all they did was bring bills to the floor and voted on to repeal obamacare they voted  time for this and they only work two week a month and they went home john boehner and congress shut down our government because they could not repeal obamacare the affordable care act costing our government  billion dollars for that shut down in the late  hundred the republican party was the whig party they fell in  because they was known as the no nothing party now they are known as the

figuratively a black box koch touts only one topline financial figure  billion in annual revenue as estimated by forbes by that metric it is larger than ibm honda or hewlettpackard and is americas secondlargest private company after agribusiness colossus cargill the companys stock response to inquiries from reporters we are privately held and dont disclose this information but koch industries is not entirely opaque the companys troubled legal history – including a trail of congressional investigations department of justice consent decrees civil lawsuits and felony convictions – augmented by internal company documents leaked state department cables freedom of information disclosures and company whistle­blowers combine to cast an unwelcome spotlight on the toxic empire whose profits

target lowwage workers minority voters and unions for koch this license to pollute amounts to a perverse hidden subsidy the cost is borne by communities in cities like port arthur texas where a kochowned facility produces as much as  billion pounds of petrochemicals every year in march koch signed a consent decree with the department of justice requiring it to spend more than  million to bring this plant into compliance with the clean air act the toxic history of koch industries is not limited to physical pollution it also extends to the companys business practices which have been the target of numerous federal investigations resulting in several indictments and convictions as well as a whole host of fines and penalties and in one of the great ironies of the obama years the presidents financialregulatory reform seems to benefit koch industries the company is expanding its highflying trading empire precisely as wall street banks – facing tough new restrictions which koch has largely escaped – are backing away from commodities speculation it is often said that the koch brothers are in the oil business thats true as far as it goes – but koch industries is not a major oil producer instead the company has woven itself into every nook of the vast industrial web that transforms raw fossil fuels into usable goods kochowned businesses trade transport refine and process fossil fuels moving them across the world and up the value chain until they become things we forgot began with hydrocarbons fertilizers lycra the innards of our smartphones the company controls at least four oil refineries six ethanol plants a naturalgasfired power plant and  miles of pipeline until recently koch refined roughly five percent of the oil burned in america that percentage is down after it shuttered its barrelperday refinery in north pole alaska owing in part to the discovery that a toxic solvent had leaked from the facility fouling the towns groundwater from the fossil fuels it refines koch also produces billions of pounds of petrochemicals which in turn become the feedstock for other koch businesses in a journey across koch industries what enters as a barrel of west

producer even as its endangering americas groundwater in  a koch subsidiary opened a pipeline capable of carrying  barrels a day of fracked crude from south texas to corpus christi where the company owns a refinery complex and it has announced plans to further expand its texas pipeline operations in a recent acquisition koch bought fracchem a top provider of hydraulic fracturing chemicals to

most carbonpolluting – oil deposits in north america the tar sands of alberta the companys pine bend refinery near st paul minnesota processes nearly a quarter of the canadian bitumen exported to the

is injuring people and harming the environment in the process the koch familys lucrative blend of pollution speculation lawbending and selfrighteousness stretches back to the early th century when charles father first entered the oil business fred c koch was born in  in quanah texas – a sunbaked patch of prairie across the red river from oklahoma fred was the second son of hotze harry koch a dutch immigrant who – as recalled in koch literature – ran a modest newspaper business amid the dusty poverty of quanah in the family legend fred koch emerged from the nothing of the texas range to found an empire but like many stories the company likes to tell about itself this piece of koch­lore takes liberties with the truth fred was not a simple country boy and his father was not just a smalltown publisher harry koch was also a local railroad baron who used his newspaper to promote the quanah acme  pacific railways a director and founding shareholder of the company harry sought to build a rail line across texas to el paso he hoped to turn quanah into the most important railroad center in northwest texas and a metropolitan city of first rank he may not have fulfilled those ambitions but harry did build up what one friend called a handsome pile of dinero harry was not just the financial springboard for the koch dynasty he was also its wellspring of farright politics harry editorialized against fiat money demanded hangings for habitual criminals and blasted social security as inviting sloth at the depths of the depression he demanded that elected officials in washington should stop trying to fix the economy business he wrote has always found a way to overcome various recessions in the companys telling young fred was an innovator whose inventions helped revolutionize the oil industry but there is much more to this story in its early days refining oil was a dirty and wasteful practice but around  universal oil products introduced a clean and hugely profitable way to crack heavy crude breaking it down under heat and heavy pressure to boost gasoline yields in  fred who earned a degree in chemical engineering from mit partnered with a former universal engineer named lewis winkler and designed a near carbon copy of the universal cracking apparatus – making only tiny unpatentable tweaks relying on family connections fred soon landed his first client – an oklahoma refinery owned by his maternal uncle lb simmons in a flash winklerkoch engineering co had contracts to install its knockoff cracking equipment all over the heartland undercutting universal by charging a onetime fee rather than ongoing royalties it was a boom business that is until universal sued in  accusing winkler­koch of stealing its intellectual property with his domestic business tied up in court fred started looking for partners abroad and was soon doing business in the soviet union where leader joseph stalin had just launched his first five year plan stalin sought to fund his countrys industrialization by selling oil into the lucrative european export market but the soviet unions reserves were notoriously hard to refine the ussr needed cracking technology and the oil directorate of the supreme council of the national economy took a shining to winklerkoch – primarily because kochs oilindustry competitors were reluctant to do business with totalitarian communists outside its london offices protesters gather pwolmuthreport digitalreare between  and  winklerkoch built  cracking units for the soviets although stalins evil was no secret it wasnt until fred visited the soviet union that these dealings seemed to affect his conscience i went to the ussr in  and found it a land of hunger misery and terror he would later write even so he agreed to give the soviets the engineering knowhow they would need to keep building more back home fred was busy building a life of baronial splendor he met his wife mary the wellesleyeducated daughter of a kansas city surgeon on a polo field and soon bought  acres across from the wichita country club where they built a tudor­style mansion as chronicled in sons of wichita daniel schulmans investigation of the koch dynasty the compound was quickly bursting with princes frederick arrived in  followed by charles in  and twins david and bill in  fred koch lorded over his domain my mother was afraid of my father said bill as were the four boys especially firstborn frederick an artistic kid with a talent for the theater father wanted to make all his boys into men and freddie couldnt relate to that regime charles recalled frederick got shipped east to boarding school and was all but disappeared from wichita with frederick gone charles forged a deep alliance with david the more athletic and assertive of the young twins i was closer with david because he was better at everything charles has said fred kochs legal battle with universal would drag on for nearly a quartercentury in  a lower court ruled that winklerkoch had infringed on universals technology but that judgment would be vacated after it came out in  that universal had bought off one of the judges­ handling the appeal a year later the supreme court decided that freds cracker by virtue of small technical differences did not violate the universal patent fred countersued on antitrust grounds arguing that universal had wielded patents anticompetitively hed win a  million settlement in  around that time fred had built a domestic oil empire under a new company eventually called rock island oil  refining transporting crude from wellheads to refineries by truck or by pipe in those later years fred also became a major benefactor and board member of the john birch society the rabidly anticommunist organization founded in  by candy magnate and virulent racist robert welch bircher publications warned that the red endgame was the creation of the negro soviet­ republic in the deep south in his own writing fred described integration as a red plot to enslave both the white and black man like his father charles koch attended mit after he graduated in  with two masters degrees in engineering his father issued an ultimatum come back to wichita or ill sell the business papa laid it on the line recalled david so charles returned home immersing himself in his fathers world – not simply joining the john birch society but also opening a bircher bookstore the birchers had high hopes for young charles as koch family friend robert love wrote in a letter to welch charles koch can if he desires finance a large operation however he must continually be brought along but charles was already falling under the sway of a charismatic radio personality named robert lefevre founder of the freedom school a whitesonly­ libertarian boot camp in the foothills above colorado springs colorado lefevre preached a form of anarchic capitalism in which the individual should be freed from almost all government power charles soon had to make a choice while the birchers supported the vietnam war his new guru was a pacifist who equated militarism with outofcontrol state power lefevres stark influence on kochs thinking is crystallized in a manifesto charles wrote for the libertarian review in the s recently unearthed by schulman titled the business community resisting regulation charles lays out principles that gird todays tea party movement referring to regulation as totalitarian the yearold charles claimed business leaders had been hoodwinked by the notion that regulation is in the public interest he advocated the barest possible obedience to regulation and implored do not cooperate voluntarily instead resist whenever and to whatever extent you legally can in the name of justice after his father died in  charles now in command of the family business renamed it koch industries it had grown into one of the  largest privately owned firms in the country buying and selling some  million barrels of oil a year and operating  miles of pipeline a blackdiamond skier and whitewater kayaker charles ran the business with an adrenaline junkies aggressiveness the company would build pipelines to promising oil fields without a contract from the producers and park tanker trucks beside wildcatters wells waiting for the first drops of crude to flow our willingness to move quickly absorb more risk charles would write enabled us to become the leading crudeoil­gathering company charles also reconnected with one of his fathers earliest insights theres big money in dirty oil in the late s fred koch had bought a minority stake in a minnesota refinery that processed heavy canadian crude we could run the lousiest crude in the world said his business partner j howard marshall ii – the future mr anna nicole smith sensing an opportunity for huge profits charles struck a deal to convert marshalls ownership stake in the refinery into stock in koch industries suddenly the majority owner the company soon bought the rest of the refinery outright almost from the beginning koch industries risktaking crossed over into recklessness the opec oil embargo hit the company hard koch had made a deal giving the company the right to buy a large share of qatars export crude at the time koch owned five supertankers and had chartered many others when the embargo hit koch had upward of half a billion dollars in exposure to tankers and couldnt deliver opec oil to the us market creating what charles has called large losses soon koch industries was caught overcharging american customers the ford administration in the summer of  compelled koch to pay out more than  million in rebates and future price reductions koch industries manipulations were about to get more audacious in the late s the federal government parceled out exploration tracts using a lottery in which anyone could score a year lease at just  an acre – a game of chance that gave wildcat prospectors the same shot as the biggest players koch didnt like these odds so it enlisted scores of frontmen to bid on its behalf in the event they won the lottery they would turn over their leases to the company in  koch industries pleaded guilty to five felonies in federal court including conspiracy to commit fraud the koch family mids wichita state university libraries with republicans and democrats united in regulating the oil business charles had begun throwing his wealth behind the upstart libertarian party seeking to transform it into a viable third party over the years he would spend millions propping up a league of affiliated think tanks and front groups – a network of libertarians that became known as the kochtopus charles even convinced david to stand as the libertarian partys vicepresidential candidate in  – a clever maneuver that allowed david to lavish unlimited money on his own ticket the kochfunded  platform was nakedly in the brothers selfinterest – slashing federal regulatory agencies offering a  percent tax break to top earners ending the cruel and unfair estate tax and abolishing a  billion windfall profits tax on the oil industry the words of libertarian presidential candidate ed clarks convention speech in los angeles ring across the decades were sick of taxes he declared were ready to have a very big tea party in a very real sense the modern republican party was on the ballot that year – and it was running against ronald reagan charles management style and infatuation with farright politics were endangering his grip on the company bill believed his brothers political spending was bad for business pretty soon we would get the reputation that the company and the kochs were crazy he said in late  with fredericks backing bill launched an unsuccessful battle for control of koch industries aiming to take the company public three years later charles and david bought out their brothers for  billion but the speed with which koch industries paid off the buyout debt left bill convinced but never quite able to prove hed been defrauded he would spend the next  years suing his brothers calling them the biggest crooks in the oil industry bill also shared these concerns with the federal government thanks in part to his efforts in  a senate committee investigating koch business with native americans would describe koch oil tactics as grand larceny in the late s koch was the largest purchaser of oil from american tribes senate investigators suspected the company was making off with more crude from tribal oil fields than it measured and paid for they set up a sting sending an fbi agent to coordinate stakeouts of eight remote leases six of them were koch operations and the agents reported oil theft at all of them one of kochs gaugers would refer to this as volume enhancement but in sworn testimony before a texas jury phillip dubose a former koch pipeline manager offered a more succinct definition stealing the senate committee concluded that over the course of three years koch pilfered  million in native oil in  the value of that stolen oil accounted for nearly a quarter of the companys crudeoil profits i dont know how the company could have figures like that the fbi agent testified and not have top management know that theft was going on in his own testimony charles offered that taking oil readings is a very uncertain art and that his employees arent rocket scientists kochs top lawyer would later paint the company as a victim of senate mccarthyism by this time the kochs had soured on the libertarian party concluding that control of a small party would never give them the muscle they sought in the nations capital now they would spend millions in efforts to influence – and ultimately take over – the gop the work began close to home the kochs had become dedicated patrons of sen bob dole of kansas who ran interference for koch industries in washington on the senate floor in march  dole gloatingly cautioned against a rush to judgment against koch citing very real concerns about some of the evidence on which the special committee was basing its findings a grand jury investigated the claims but disbanded in  without issuing indictments arizona sen dennis deconcini was surprised and disappointed at the decision to drop the case our investigation was some of the finest work the senate has ever done he said there was an overwhelming case against koch but koch did not avoid all punishment under the false claims act which allows private citizens to file lawsuits on behalf of the government bill sued the company accusing it of defrauding the feds of royalty income on its volume­enhanced purchases of native oil a jury concluded koch had submitted more than  false claims exposing koch to some  million in penalties koch later settled paying  million self­interest continued to define koch industries adventures in public policy in the early s in a highprofile initiative of the firstterm clinton white house the administration was pushing for a levy on the heat content of fuels known as the btu tax it was the earliest attempt by the federal government to recoup damages from climate polluters but koch industries could not stand losing its most valuable subsidy the public policy that allowed it to treat the atmosphere as an open sewer richard fink head of koch companys public sector and the longtime mastermind of the koch brothers political empire confessed to the wichita eagle in  that koch could not compete if it actually had to pay for the damage it did to the environment our belief is that the tax over time may have destroyed our business to fight this threat the kochs funded a grassroots uprising – one that foreshadowed the emergence decades later of the tea party the effort was run through citizens for a sound economy to which the brothers had spent a decade giving nearly  million to create what david koch called a sales force to communicate the brothers political agenda through town hall meetings and antitax rallies designed to look like spontaneous demonstrations in  david koch bragged that cses campaign played a key role in defeating the administrations plans for a huge and cumbersome btu tax despite the companys increasingly sophisticated political and publicrelations operations charles philosophy of regulatory resistance was about to bite koch industries – in the form of record civil and criminal financial penalties imposed by the environmental protection agency koch entered the s on a pipelinebuying spree by  its network measured  miles according to sworn testimony from former koch employees the company operated its pipelines with almost complete disregard for maintenance as koch employees understood it this was in keeping with their ceos trademarked business philosophy market­based management for charles mbm – first communicated to employees in  – was an attempt to distill the business practices that had grown koch into one of the largest oil businesses in the world to incentivize workers koch gives employees bonuses that correlate to the value they create for the company salary is viewed only as an advance on compensation for value koch wrote and compensation has an unlimited upside to prevent the stagnation that can often bog down big enterprises koch was also determined to incentivize risktaking under mbm koch industries books opportunity costs – profits foregone from a missed opportunity – as though they were actual losses on the balance sheet koch employees who play it safe in other words cant strike it rich on paper mbm sounds innovative and exciting but in kochs hyperaggressive corporate culture it contributed to a series of environmental disasters applying mbm to pipeline maintenance koch employees calculated that the opportunity cost of shutting down equipment to ensure its safety was greater than the profit potential of pushing aging pipe to its limits the fact that preventive pipeline maintenance is required by law didnt always seem to register dubose a year koch veteran who oversaw pipeline areas in louisiana would testify about the companys lax attitude toward maintenance it was a question of money it would take away from our profit margin the testimony of another pipeline manager would echo that of dubose basically the philosophy was if it aint broke dont work on it when small spills occurred dubose testified the company would cover them up he recalled incidents in which the company would use the churn of a tugboats engine to break up waterborne spills and just kind of wash that thing on down down the river on land dubose said they might pump it the leaked oil off into a drum then take a shovel and just turn the earth over when larger spills were reported to authorities the volume of the discharges was habitually lowballed according to dubose managers pressured employees to falsify pipelinemaintenance records filed with federal authorities in a sworn affidavit pipeline worker bobby conner recalled arguments with his manager over conners refusal to file false reports he would always respond with anger conner said and tell me that i did not know how to be a koch employee conner was fired and later settled a wrongfultermination suit with koch gateway pipeline dubose testified that charles was not in the dark about the companys operations he was in complete control dubose said he was the one that was linedriving this marketbased management at meetings before the worst spill from this time koch employees had raised concerns about the integrity of a sera pipeline in south texas but the company not only kept the line in service it increased the pressure to move more volume when a valve snapped shut in  the brittle pipeline exploded more than  gallons of crude spewed into gum hollow creek fouling surrounding marshlands and both nueces and corpus christi bays with a mile oil slick by  the epa had seen enough it sued koch for gross violations of the clean water act from  through  the companys pipelines spilled  million gallons of crude and petroleum products internal koch records showed that its pipelines were in such poor condition that it would require  million in repairs to bring them up to industry standard ultimately state and federal agencies forced koch to pay a  million civil penalty – then the largest in the history of us environmental law – for  spills across six states carol browner the former epa administrator said of koch they simply did not believe the law applied to them this was not just partisan rancor texas attorney general john cornyn the future republican senator had joined the epa in bringing suit against koch this settlement and penalty warn polluters that they cannot treat oil spills simply as the cost of doing business cornyn said the kochs seem to have no hard feelings toward their onetime tormentor a lobbyist for koch was the numbertwo bundler for cornyns primary campaign this year koch wasnt just cutting corners on its pipelines it was also violating federal environmental law in other corners of the empire through much of the s at its pine bend refinery in minnesota koch spilled up to  gallons of jet fuel into wetlands near the mississippi river indeed the company was treating the mississippi as a sewer illegally dumping ammonialaced wastewater into the river – even increasing its discharges on weekends when it knew it wasnt being monitored koch petroleum group eventually pleaded guilty to negligent discharge of a harmful quantity of oil and negligent violation of the clean water act was ordered to pay a  million fine and  million in remediation costs and received three years probation this facility had already been declared a superfund site in  in  koch was hit with a count indictment over claims it violated the clean air act by venting massive quantities of benzene at a refinery in corpus christi – and then attempted to cover it up according to the indictment koch filed documents with texas regulators indicating releases of just  metric tons of benzene for  – onetenth of what was allowed under the law but the government alleged that koch had been informed its true emissions that year measured  metric tons or  times the legal limit charles koch larry w smith  polaris by the time the case came to trial however george w bush was in office and the indictment had been significantly pared down – koch faced charges on only seven counts the justice department settled in what many perceived to be a sweetheart deal and koch pleaded guilty to a single felony count for covering up the fact that it had disconnected a key pollutioncontrol device and did not measure the resulting benzene emissions – receiving five years probation despite skirting stiffer criminal prosecution koch was handed  million in fines and reparations – another historic judgment on the day before danielle smalley was to leave for college she and her friend jason stone were hanging out in her familys mobile home seventeen years old with long chestnut hair danielle began to feel nauseated dad she said we smell gas it was  in the afternoon on august th  near lively texas some  miles southeast of dallas the smalleys were too poor to own a telephone so the teens jumped into her dads  chevy pickup to alert the authorities as they drove away the truck stalled where the driveway crossed a dry creek bed danielle cranked the ignition and a fireball engulfed the truck you see two children burned to death in front of you – you never forget that danielles father danny would later tell reporters unknown to the smalleys a decrepit koch pipeline carrying liquid butane – literally lighter fluid – ran through their subdivision it had ruptured filling the creek bed with vapor and the spark from the pickups ignition had set off a bomb federal investigators documented both severe corrosion and mechanical damage in the pipeline a national transportation safety board report would cite the failure of koch pipeline company lp to adequately protect its pipeline from corrosion installed in the early eighties the pipeline had been out of commission for three years when koch decided to start it up again in  a waterpressure test had blown the pipe open an inspection of just a few dozen miles of pipe near the smal­ley home found  corrosion defects the industrys term of art for a pipeline in this condition is swiss cheese according to the testimony of an expert witness – essentially the pipeline is gone koch repaired only  of the defects – enough to allow the pipeline to withstand another pressure check – and began running explosive fluid down the line at high pressure in january  a month later employees discovered that a key anti­corrosion system had malfunctioned but it was never fixed charles koch had made it clear to managers that they were expected to slash costs and boost profits in a sternly worded memo that april charles had ordered his top managers to cut expenditures by  percent through the elimination of waste im sure there is much more waste than that in order to increase pretax earnings by  million a year the smalley trial underscored something bill koch had said about the way his brothers ran the company koch industries has a philosophy that profits are above everything else a former koch manager kenoth whitstine testified to incidents in which koch industries placed profits over public safety as one supervisor had told him regulatory fines usually didnt amount to much and besides the company had a stable full of lawyers in wichita that handled those situations when whitstine told another manager he was concerned that unsafe pipelines could cause a deadly accident this manager said that it was more profitable for the company to risk litigation than to repair faulty equipment the company could pay off a lawsuit from an incident and still be money ahead he said describing the principles of mbm to a t at trial danny smalley asked for a judgment large enough to make the billionaires feel pain let koch take their child out there and put their children on the pipeline open it up and let one of them die he told the jury and then tell me what thats worth the jury was emphatic awarding smalley  million – then the largest wrongfuldeath judgment in american legal history he later settled with koch for an undisclosed sum and now runs a pipelinesafety foundation in his daughters name he declined to comment for this story it upsets him too much says an associate the official koch line is that scandals that caused the company millions in fines judgments and penalties prompted a change in charles attitude of regulatory resistance in his  book the science of success he begrudgingly acknowledges his companys recklessness while business was becoming increasingly regulated he reflects we kept thinking and acting as if we lived in a pure market economy the reality was far different charles has since committed koch industries to obeying federal regulations even when faced with laws we think are counterproductive he writes we must first comply underscoring just how out of bounds koch had ventured in its corporate culture charles admits that it required a monumental undertaking to integrate compliance into every aspect of the company in  koch petroleum group entered into an agreement with the epa and the justice department to spend  million at three refineries to bring them into compliance with the clean air act after hitting koch with a  million penalty the epa granted the company a clean slate for certain past violations then george w bush entered the white house in  his campaign fattened with koch money charles koch may decry cronyism as nothing more than welfare for the rich and powerful but he put his company to work hand in glove with the bush white house correspondence contacts and visits among koch industries representatives and the bush white house generated nearly  pages of records according to a rolling stone foia request of the george w bush presidential library in  the administration installed a fiercely antiregulatory academic susan dudley who hailed from the kochfunded mercatus center at george mason university as its top regulatory official today koch points to awards it has won for safety and environmental excellence koch companies have a strong record of compliance holden kochs top lawyer tells rolling stone in the distant past when we failed to meet these standards we took steps to ensure that we were building a culture of  percent compliance with  percent of our employees complying  percent to reduce its liability koch has also unwound its pipeline business from  miles in the late s to about  miles of the much smaller operation he adds kochs pipeline practice and operations today are the best in the industry but even as compliance began to improve among its industrial operations the company aggressively expanded its trading activities into the wild west frontier of risky financial instruments in  the commodity futures modernization act had exempted many of these products from regulation and koch industries was among the key players shaping that law koch joined up with enron bp mobil and j aron – a division of goldman sachs then run by lloyd blankfein – in a collaboration called the energy group this corporate alliance fought to prohibit the federal government from policing oil and gas derivatives the importance of derivatives for the energy group companies    cannot be overestimated the groups lawyer wrote to the commodity futures trading commission in  the success of this business can be completely undermined by    a costly regulatory regime that has no place in the energy industry koch had long specialized in overthecounter or otc trades – private unregulated contracts not disclosed on any centralized exchange in its own letter to the cftc koch identified itself as a major participant in the otc derivatives market adding that the company not only offered riskmanagement tools for its customers but also traded for its own account making the case for what would be known as the enron loophole koch argued that any big firms desire to maintain a good reputation would prevent widespread abuses in the otc derivatives market a darkly hilarious claim given what would become not only of enron but also bear stearns lehman brothers and aig the enron loophole became law in december  – pushed along by texas sen phil gramm giving the energy group exactly what it wanted it completely exempted energy futures from regulation says michael greenberger a former director of trading and markets at the cftc it wasnt a matter of regulators not enforcing manipulation or excessive speculation limits – this market wasnt covered at all by law before its spectacular collapse enron would use this loophole in  to help engineer an energy crisis in california artificially constraining the supply of natural gas and power generation causing price spikes and rolling blackouts this blatant and criminal market manipulation has become part of the legend of enron but koch was caught up in the debacle the cftc would charge that a partnership between koch and the utility entergy had at the height of the california crisis reported fake naturalgas trades to reporting firms and also knowingly reported false prices andor volumes on real trades one of  companies punished for such schemes entergykoch avoided prosecution by paying a  million fine as part of a  settlement with the cftc in which it did not admit guilt to the commissions charges but is barred from maintaining its innocence david koch alexis c glenn landov trading which had long been peripheral to the companys core businesses soon took center stage in  the company launched a subsidiary koch supply  trading kst got off to a rocky start a series of bad trades writes a koch insider boiled over in early  when a large sure bet crudeoil trade went south resulting in a quick multimillion loss but koch traders quickly adjusted to the reality that energy markets were no longer ruled just by supply and demand – but by rich speculators trying to game the market revamping its strategy koch industries soon began bragging of record profits from  to  kst trading volumes exploded – up  percent by  kst ranked among the worlds topfive oil traders and by  the company billed itself as one of the leading quantitative traders – though holden now says its no longer in this business since koch industries aggressively expanded into high finance the net worth of each brother has also exploded – from roughly  billion in  to more than  billion today in that period the company embarked on a corporate buying spree that has taken it well beyond petroleum in  koch purchased georgia pacific for  billion giving the company a familiar expansive grip on the industrial web that transforms southern pine into consumer goods – from plywood sold at home depot to brandname products like dixie cups and angel soft toilet paper in  koch leapt into high technology with the  billion acquisition of molex a manufacturer of more than  electronics components and a top supplier to smartphone makers including apple koch supply  trading makes money both from physical trades that move oil and commodities across oceans as well as in paper trades involving nothing more than highstakes bets and cash in paper trading kochs products extend far beyond simple oil futures koch pioneered for sale to hedge funds volatility swaps in which the actual price of crude is irrelevant and what matters is only the magnitude of daily fluctuations in prices steve mawer until recently the president of kst described parts of his trading operation as blackbox stuff like a casino that bets at its own craps table koch engages in proprietary trading – speculating for the companys own bottom line were like a hedge fund and a dealer at the same time bragged ilia bouchouev head of kochs derivatives trading in  we can both make markets and speculate the companys many tentacles in the physical oil business give koch rich insight into market conditions and disruptions that can inform its speculative bets when oil prices spiked to record heights in  koch was a major player in the speculative markets according to documents leaked by vermont sen bernie sanders with trading volumes rivaling wall street giants like citibank koch rode a traderdriven frenzy – detached from actual supply and demand – that drove prices above  a barrel in july  battering a global economy about to enter a free fall only koch knows how much money koch reaped during this price spike but as a proxy consider the  million koch and its subsidiaries spent lobbying congress in  – before then its biggest annual lobbying expense had been  million – seeking to derail a raft of consumerprotection bills including the federal price gouging prevention act the stop excessive energy speculation act of  the prevent unfair manipulation of prices act of  and the close the enron loophole act in comments to the federal trade commission koch lobbyists defended the companys right to rack up fantastic profits at the expense of american consumers a mere attempt to maximize profits cannot constitute market manipulation they wrote adding baldly excessive profits in the face of shortages are desirable when the global economy crashed in  so did oil prices by december crude was trading more than  lower per barrel than it had just months earlier – around  at the same time oil traders anticipated that prices would eventually rebound futures contracts for delivery of oil in december  were trading at nearly  per barrel when future delivery is more valuable than present inventory the market is said to be in contango koch exploited the contango market to the hilt the company leased nine supertankers and filled them with cutrate crude and parked them quietly offshore in the gulf of mexico banking virtually riskfree profits by selling contracts for future delivery all in koch took about  million barrels of oil off the market putting itself in a position to bet on price disruptions the company itself was creating thanks to these kinds of trading efforts koch could boast in a  review that the performance of koch supply  trading actually grew stronger last year as the global economy worsened the cost for those riskfree profits was paid by consumers at the pump estimates pegged the cost of the contango trade by koch and others at up to  cents a gallon artificially constraining oil supplies is not the only source of dark unregulated profit for koch industries in the years after george w bush branded iran a member of the axis of evil the koch brothers profited from trade with the state sponsor of terror and reckless wouldbe nuclear power for decades us companies have been forbidden from doing business with the ayatollahs but koch industries exploited a loophole in  sanctions that made it possible for foreign subsidiaries of us companies to do some business in iran in the ensuing years according to bloomberg markets the german and italian arms of kochglitsch a koch subsidiary that makes equipment for oil fields and refineries won lucrative contracts to supply irans zagros plant the largest methanol plant in the world and thanks in part to koch methanol is now one of irans leading nonoil exports every single chance they had to do business with iran or anyone else they did said koch whistleblower george bentu having signed on to work for a company that lists integrity as its top value bentu added you feel totally betrayed everything koch stood for was a lie koch reportedly kept trading with tehran until  – after the regime was exposed for supplying ieds to iraqi insurgents killing us troops according to lawyer holden koch has since decided that none of its subsidiaries would engage in trade involving iran even where such trade is permissible under us law these days kochs most disquieting foreign dealings are in canada where the company has massive investments in dirty tar sands the companys  million acres of leases in northern alberta contain reserves of economically recoverable oil numbering in the billions of barrels with these massive leaseholdings koch is poised to continue profiting from canadian crude whether or not the keystone xl pipeline gains approval says andrew leach an energy and environmental economist at the business school of the university of alberta counterintuitively approval of keystone xl could actually harm one of kochs most profitable businesses – its pine bend refinery in minnesota because tarsands crude presently has no easy outlet to the global market theres a glut of canadian oil in the midcontinent and kochs refinery is a beneficiary of this oversupply the resulting discount can exceed  a barrel compared to conventional crude if it is ever built the keystone xl pipeline will provide a link to gulf coast refineries – and thus the global export market which would erase much of that discount and eat into company profit margins leach says koch industries tarsands leaseholdings have them hedged against the potential approval of keystone xl the pipeline would increase the value of canadian tarsands deposits overnight koch could then profit handsomely by flipping its leases to more established producers optimizing asset value through trading koch literature says of these and other holdings is a key company strategy the one truly bad outcome for koch would be if keystone xl were to be defeated as many environmentalists believe it must be if the signal that sends is that no new pipelines will be built across the us border for carrying oilsands product leach says thats going to have an impact not just on koch leases but on everybodys asset value in oil sands ironically whats best for kochs tarsands interests is what the obama administration is currently delivering theyre actually ahead if keystone xl gets delayed a while but hangs around as something that still might happen leach says the doddfrank bill was supposed to put an end to economy­endangering speculation in the  trillion global derivatives market but koch has managed to defend – and even expand – its turf trading in largely unregulated derivatives once dubbed financial weapons of mass destruction by billionaire warren buffett in theory the enron loophole is no longer open – the government now has the power to police manipulation in the market for energy derivatives but the obama administration has not yet been able to come up with new rules that actually do so in  the cftc mandated position limits on derivative trades of oil and other commodities these would have blocked any single speculator from owning futures contracts representing more than a quarter of the physical market – reducing the danger of manipulation as part of the international swaps and derivatives association which also reps many wall street giants including goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase koch fought these new restrictions isda sued to block the position limits – and won in court in september  two years later cftc is still spinning its wheels on a replacement industry traders like koch are greenberger says essentially able to operate as though the enron loophole were still in effect koch is also reaping the benefits from doddfranks impacts on wall street the socalled volcker rule implemented at the end of last year bans investment banks from proprietary trading – investing on their own behalf in securities and derivatives as a result many wall street banks are unloading their commoditiestrading units but volcker does not apply to nonbank traders like koch theyre now able to pick up clients who might previously have traded with jpmorgan in its marketing materials for its trading operations koch boasts to potential clients that it can provide physical and financial market liquidity at times when others pull back koch also likely benefits from loopholes that exempt the company from posting collateral for derivatives trades and allow it to continue trading swaps without posting the transactions to a transparent electronic exchange though competitors like bp and cargill have registered with the cftc as swaps dealers – subjecting their trades to tightened regulation – koch conspicuously has not koch is compliant with all cftc regulations including those relating to swaps dealers says holden the koch lawyer that a massive company with such a troubling record as koch industries remains unfettered by financial regulation should strike fear in the heart of anyone with a stake in the health of the american economy though koch has cultivated a reputation as an economically conservative company it has long flirted with danger and that it has not suffered a catastrophic loss in the past  years would seem to be as much about luck as about skillful management the kochs have brushed up against some of the major debacles of the crisis years in  as the economy began to teeter koch was gearing up to plunge into the market for credit default swaps even creating an affiliate koch financial products for that express purpose kfp secured a aaa rating from moodys and reportedly sought to buy up toxic assets at the center of the financial crisis at up to times leverage ultimately koch industries survived the experiment without losing its shirt more recently koch was exposed to the fiasco at mf global the disgraced brokerage firm run by former new jersey gov jon corzine that improperly dipped into customer accounts to finance reckless bets on european debt koch one of mf globals top clients reportedly told trading partners it was switching accounts about a month before the brokerage declared bankruptcy – then the eighthlargest in us history koch says the decision to pull its funds from mf global was made more than a year before while mfs smallfry clients had to pick at the carcass of corzines company to recoup their assets koch was already swimming free and clear because its private no one outside of koch industries knows how much risk koch is taking – or whether it could conceivably create systemic risk a concern raised in  by the head of the futures industry association but this much is for certain because of the loopholes in financialregulatory reform the next company to put the american economy at risk may not be a wall street bank but a trading giant like koch in  gary gensler then cftc chair railed against the very loopholes koch appears to be exploiting raising the specter of aig aig had this massive risk built up in its derivatives just because it called itself an insurance company rather than a bank gensler said when congress adopted doddfrank gensler added it never intended to exempt financial heavy hitters just because somebody calls themselves an insurance in the science of success charles koch highlights the problems created when property owners dont benefit from all the value they create and dont bear the full cost from whatever value they destroy he is particularly concerned about the tragedy of the commons in which shared resources are abused because theres no individual accountability the biggest problems in society he writes have occurred in those areas thought to be best controlled in common the atmosphere bodies of water air    but in the real world koch industries has used its political might to beat back the very marketbased mechanisms – including a capandtrade market for carbon pollution – needed to create the ownership rights for pollution that charles says would improve the functioning of capitalism in fact it appears the very essence of the koch business model is to exploit breakdowns in the free market koch has profited precisely by dumping billions of pounds of pollutants into our waters and skies – essentially for free it racks up enormous profits from speculative trades lacking economic value that drive up costs for consumers and create risks for our economy the koch brothers get richer as the costs of what koch destroys are foisted on the rest of us – in the form of ill health foul water and a climate crisis that threatens life as we know it on this planet now nearing  – owning a large chunk of the alberta tar sands and using his billions to transform the modern republican party into a protection racket for koch industries profits – charles koch is not about to see the light nor does the ceo of one of americas most toxic firms have any notion of slowing down he has made it clear that he has no retirement plans im going to ride my bicycle till i fall off update koch industries responds to
