than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy the market value of securities of global timber companies may be affected by numerous factors including events occurring in nature and international politics the volume and value of timber that can be harvested from timberlands may be limited by natural disasters and other events in periods of poor logging

performance potential of the fund over varying market conditions or economic cycles risk considerations investors should consider the following risk factors and special considerations associated with investing in the fund which may cause you to lose money including the entire principal amount that you invest equity risk the value of the equity securities held by the fund will fall due to general market and economic conditions perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers of securities held by the fund participate or factors relating to specific companies in which the fund invests for example an adverse event such as an unfavorable earnings report may depress the value of equity securities of an issuer held by the fund the price of common stock of an issuer may be particularly sensitive to general movements in the stock market or a drop in the stock market may depress the price of most or all of the common stocks and other equity securities held by the fund in addition common stock of an issuer in the fund’s portfolio may decline in price if the issuer fails to make anticipated dividend payments because the issuer of the security experiences a decline in its financial condition common stock is subordinated to preferred stocks bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater dividend risk than preferred stocks or debt instruments of such issuers in addition while broad market measures of common stocks have historically generated higher average returns than fixed income securities common stocks have also experienced significantly more volatility in those returns energy sector risk the profitability of companies in the energy sector is related to worldwide energy prices exploration and production spending such companies also are subject to risks of changes in exchange rates government regulation world events depletion of resources and economic conditions as well as market economic and political risks of the countries where energy companies are located or do business oil and gas exploration and production can be significantly affected by natural disasters oil exploration and production companies may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates interest rates government regulation world events and economic conditions oil exploration and production companies may be at risk for environmental damage claims foreign investment risk the fund’s investments in nonus issuers may involve unique risks compared to investing in securities of us issuers including less market liquidity generally greater market volatility than us securities and less complete financial information than for us issuers in addition adverse political economic or social developments could undermine the value of the fund’s investments or prevent the fund from realizing the full value of its investments financial reporting standards for companies based in foreign markets differ from those in the united states finally the value of the currency of the country in which the fund has invested could decline relative to the value of the us dollar which may affect the value of the investment to us investors the fund will not enter into transactions to hedge against declines in the value of the fund’s assets that are denominated in a foreign currency canadian risk as the fund invests in canadian royalty trusts and stocks listed on the tsx the fund is subject to the following risks commodity exposure risk the canadian economy is very dependent on the demand for and supply and price of natural resources the canadian market is relatively concentrated in issuers involved in the production and distribution of natural resources there is a risk that any changes in these sectors could have an adverse impact on the canadian economy reliance on exports risk the canadian economy is dependent on the economies of the united states as a key trading partner reduction in spending on canadian products and services or changes in the us economy may cause an impact in the canadian economy canadian royalty trust risk investing in canadian royalty trusts is subject to the following risks lack of diversification the royalty trusts in which the fund invests are heavily invested in oil and gas potential sacrifice of growth potential growth may be sacrificed because revenue is passed on to a royalty trust’s unit holders such as the fund rather than reinvested in the business no guarantees royalty trusts generally do not guarantee minimum distributions or even return of capital if the assets underlying a royalty trust do not perform as expected the royalty trust may reduce or even eliminate distributions the declaration of such distributions generally depends upon various factors including the operating performance and financial condition of the royalty trust and general economic conditions potential for tax recharacterization or changes under amendments to the income tax act canada passed in  the “sift rules” certain trusts defined as “sift trusts” are taxable on certain income and gains on a basis similar to that which applies to a corporation with the result that tax efficiencies formerly available in respect of an investment in the trust may cease to be available a royalty trust may be a sift trust in addition as a result of the sift rules some trusts may undertake reorganization transactions the costs of which may affect the return earned on an investment in the trust after any such conversion tax efficiencies that were formerly available in respect of an investment in the trust may cease to be available accordingly the sift rules have had and may continue to have an effect on the trading price of investments in royalty trusts and consequently could impact the value of shares of the fund us economic risk the canadian economy may be significantly affected by the us economy given that the united states is canada’s largest trading partner and foreign investor since the implementation of the north american free trade agreement nafta in  total twoway merchandise trade between the united states and canada has more than doubled to further this relationship all three nafta countries entered into the security and prosperity partnership of north america in march  which addressed economic and security related issues the new agreement may further affect canada’s dependency on the us economy structural risk political risk in addition past periodic demands by the province of quebec for sovereignty have significantly affected equity valuations and foreign currency movements in the canadian market in addition the funds are subject to small and mediumsized company risk noncorrelation risk passive management risk issuerspecific changes and nondiversified fund risk please read the prospectus for more detailed regarding these and other risks fund data is
