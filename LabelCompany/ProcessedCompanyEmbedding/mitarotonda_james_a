under yearold chief executive james marlenjames mitarotonda who heads hedge fund barington group wants a seat on amerons board — and he wants marlen out even before the ceos scheduled retirement in the fight has gotten ugly and personal mitarotonda  says marlens primary achievement in  years at amerons helm has been creating wealth for himself and his familybarington revealed in january that ameron had over the years employed all three of marlens sons understandably raising questions about nepotism that may not be unusual for a familyheld firm but publicly traded companies are held to a different standardamerons board of directors has come back at mitarotonda with hammer and tongs saying he lacks the integrity and ethics we want in ameron directors and that barington has been abandoned by the majority of its investors and employeessince the early s activist investors in the mold of mitarotonda have been the bane of ceos and corporate directors the activists rallying cry is shareholder value — usually meaning that they believe the stock price could be a lot higher if the business was managed effectivelyat their worst activists just pick a fight in pursuit of a quick payoff at their best they can shine a harsh light on serious abuses in executive compensation and corporate governance that penalize shareholdersameron isnt a wellknown name on wall street the company

barington to agitate for change at companies including autoparts retailer pep boys and plastics maker a schulman inc barington took a stake in ameron in december barington wont disclose how much money it manages overall but acknowledges that the amount has shrunk since  as some investors have cashed out nonetheless the fund claims that it has earned an average of  a year since  while the standard  poors  index returned a scant  a yeara year ago mitarotonda petitioned ameron to be nominated to its board he was rejectedin march  the investor sent a fivepage letter to marlen with ideas for realizing what mitarotonda said was the vast value potential of ameron his list included getting rid of noncore businesses such as a stake in a steel minimill giving excess cash to shareholders and significantly reducing executive compensationmitarotonda who declined to be interviewed has continued to press ameron on compensation and other issues over the last year in january he decided to launch a proxy fight — putting it up to shareholders to decide whether his ideas and his  stake in the firm should merit a seat on the boardmarlen expresses astonishment that mitarotonda would target ameron i would agree very much that hedge funds serve a purpose to be activists making sure management is on top of things and producing good results marlen said in an interview but given amerons stock performance he said mitarotonda has chosen the wrong company to go afteramerons stock at  on friday has returned  a year on average counting dividends paid since marlen took over in  handily beating the  total return of the sp but in materials sent to ameron shareholders barington contends that the companys stock has consistently lagged behind the average performance of its peer group over the last three five  and  years as well as since marlen took over — an assertion that ameron disputesthats where mitarotonda has tried to stir shareholders ire suggesting that they arent getting what theyre paying for from  to  according to barington ameron paid marlen a total of  million far exceeding the million average compensation of ceos of  peer companiesmarlen says that isnt a fair
