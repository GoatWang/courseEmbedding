business our portfolio performance and financing activities as well as comments on our outlook and dividend listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties

not limited to ffo and normalized ffo definitions of these nongaap measures as well as reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures are included in the quarterly supplemental package which is available at our website at wwwarmadahofflercom i’d now like to turn the call over to our chief executive officer lou haddad lou louis haddad thanks mike good morning and thank you for joining us today this morning we once again reported quarterly results at the higher end of our expected range with normalized ffo of  per share and once again we have raised our guidance range for  and expect to close the year between  to  later in the call mike will discuss our quarterly results and  guidance in greater detail but first i will provide some comments on our overall corporate strategy as well as an update on our development pipeline since our founding nearly four decades ago our goal has been consistent to build a portfolio of the highest quality real estate through conservative selective development complemented by strategic acquisitions and dispositions as market dynamics change over time our strategy to achieve this goal will continue to evolve but our key advantage of being a diversified and vertically integrated organization and our ability to quickly assess react and adapt to changing market conditions in order to capitalize on opportunities as they present themselves a good example of this is what we are seeing on the development front over the past several months we have observed a notable tightening in commercial construction lending with loan dollars decreasing and equity requirements on the rise thus leading private developers in need of greater equity sources to our doorstep for potential partners we as the lead developer and controlling interest holder provide substantial advantages in addition to providing equity the strength of our balance sheet and the ability to obtain construction financing over  years of real estate development construction and asset management expertise and our inhouse general contracting company to provide tight control over both cost and schedule in partnering with highquality private developers that have local market knowledge who have already invested the time energy and resources in teeing up a project whether it be through site selection and acquisition loaning permitting or architectural we can significantly shorten the overall development process and therefore expand our development pipeline without significantly increasing our expenditure of internal resources as a result we continue to see a robust level of deal flow for projects that meet all of our development criteria class a assets high barrier to entry locations secondary and tertiary markets in the midatlantic and southeastern united states wholesale to retail profit margins of  or more in addition to sourcing new development projects we continue to evaluate several promising new joint venture opportunities across all product types office retail and multifamily in our target markets a perfect example of such is harding place our  joint venture with southern apartment group that we announced this past quarter harding place is a class a multifamily project in midtown charlotte the site provides residents with convenient access to the greenway as well as downtown charlotte and is strategically located in close proximity to the carolinas medical center one of the largest employers in the city the charlotte msa is a target market for our company and we are pleased to have teamed with local partners that have more than  years of combined experience developing real estate in this market with our construction company fully engaged we expect to deliver harding place in  turing to the remaining projects in our development pipeline this past quarter we delivered both lightfoot marketplace and johns hopkins village the initial performance from both assets has been solid and we expect to ride this momentum through eventual full stabilization last week we officially broke ground on the next phase of the town center of virginia beach representing the latest chapter in our successful multidecade publicprivate partnership with the city we expect to deliver this next phase of town center in  as progress continues as expected on point street apartments in baltimore’s inner harbor one city center in downtown durham and the residences at annapolis junction town center with construction well underway at each site if you check page  of our supplemental you will see that our current development pipeline includes well over  million worth of projects given our historical profit spreads we believe these projects when delivered and stabilized will yield significant value to our shareholders this value creation may manifest itself in a combination of ways including total and per share ffo growth monetization through dispositions nav growth or multiple expansion we believe the result is organic profitable growth that could lead to a lower cost of equity for future opportunities our expectation is that  will be a year of significant value creation as we continue to build towards deliveries in  and beyond and we would expect significant bottomline growth that i just discussed to naturally follow that timeline while we have been able to grow per share earnings by nearly  annually over the last couple of years the timing of these deliveries suggest a somewhat slower growth trajectory over the shortterm moving from our development pipeline to acquisitions and dispositions this quarter we completed our planned disposition of the oyster point office building in newport news virginia the oyster point building was one of the oldest assets in our portfolio and one that faced stiff competition in this submarket we are currently under contract to redeploy our proceeds from this building into a stabilized grocery anchored retail center in the charlotte market we expect to close on that acquisition in the next few weeks and look forward to providing further details after closing you may have also seen that last month we issued  million shares of common stock in a off market acquisition of a stabilized retail asset our sixth transaction involving either stock or op units we acquired the property in an all stock transaction from a seller who now holds a significant equity position in our company we believe the acquired property is a logical and strategic addition to our portfolio with tremendous potential upside related to redevelopment opportunity and i look forward to sharing more details with you at the appropriate time whether it is through selective development redevelopment or strategic acquisitions and dispositions the management team at armada hoffler remains committed to making the right real estate decisions in order to grow our portfolio create value and return that value to our shareholders to that end our current payout ratio suggest that we have more than enough room to make powerful recommendations to our board regarding our dividend with that i’ll turn the call over to mike for further details michael o’hara thanks lou today i want to cover the highlights of the quarter thoughts on our balance sheet and additional details on our  guidance this morning we reported ffo of  per share and normalized ffo of  per share which was at the high end of our expectations our core portfolio construction company and the two new development projects recently placed in service delivered excellent results i also want to point out that our affo is exhibiting solid growth this year as well the dividend payout ratio is  yeartodate even as the share count has grown significantly this year this payout ratio is well within our corporate goal of  or less we believe a well covered dividend gives us flexibility going forward occupancy increased this quarter as did same store noi which increased for the ninth consecutive quarter same store noi growth was a positive  and  on a cash basis however we do not believe this to be a meaningful metric at this time due to the volume of asset recycling and newly delivered development projects only  yeartodate and  of the current quarter total noi are included in the same store calculation at the end of the quarter our core operating portfolio occupancy rose to  with office at  retail at  and multifamily at  on the construction front we reported a segment gross profit in the third quarter of  million on revenue of  million at the end of the quarter the company had a thirdparty construction backlog of  million which will sustain this part of our business for the foreseeable future and should translate into profits at the higher end of our historical range now turning to the balance sheet we continue to take actions to enhance flexibility and strengthen our balance sheet including refinancing upcoming loan maturities hedging our interest rate exposure and continuing the use of our atm program we used the atm program last quarter to raise  million of gross proceeds at an average price at  per share we believe the atm program is the most efficient manner for us to fund our growth and development activities if the stock continues to trade at recent levels we will continue to be opportunistic with the atm program during the quarter we sold kroger junction the second of the five noncore properties from the january portfolio acquisition combined with the previous willowbrook commons sale these two assets sold for  million as previously discussed these proceeds will be used for balance sheet purposes we are evaluating the remaining assets for upside redevelopment potential and possible retention at the end of the quarter we had total outstanding debt of  million including  million outstanding under the  million revolving credit facility we continue to work in refinancing the  and  debt hat maturities during the quarter we closed on the refinance of the town center  maturity this new one is for five years  million floating at libor plus  the new loan amount is  million more than the prior loan we also closed on the refinance of  main street and encore apartments the new loan is a fiveyear loan at the amount of  million with a fixed rate of  after these refinancings there are four remaining  debt maturities totaling  million the largest of these is a  million cmbs loan secured by the hanbury village center that matures in october  the center has high occupancy and is anchored by indiscernible with strong sales thus we expect strong competition among lenders as we continue to evaluate our exposure to potentially higher interest rates we have put in place strategies that include the mix of fixed rate debt and interest rate caps with the combination of the refinancing this quarter and interest rate cap we bought last quarter  of our debt was fixed or hedged now let me walk you through the full  guidance that we updated this morning we expect  normalized ffo in the range of  to  per share this updated  guidance is predicated on the following assumptions total noi in the  million to  million range thirdparty constructioncompany gross profit in the  million to  million range general administrative expenses in the  million to  million range interest income for our mezzanine financing program in the  million to  million range as of september  the aggregate loan balance of these mezzanine loans was  million interest rate expense in the  million to  million range and  million weighted average shares and op units outstanding which include the stock issued as part of the october retail acquisition this guidance excludes any impact from future acquisitions asset sales and other capital markets activity with the exception of continuing opportunistic sales under the atm program the increase in guidance is attributable to several positive factors construction is having another strong year portfolio occupancy is increasing and the two recently delivered development projects are exceeding expectation i’ll now turn the call back to lou louis haddad thank you mike thank you for your time this morning and your interest in armada hoffler operator we would like to begin the questionandanswer session questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of dave rodgers with robert w baird please proceed with your question david rodgers hi good morning guys i wanted to ask i guess quickly about the acquisition that you referred to for october and you issued – i think was s it doesnt sound like youre ready to fully talk about it but it sounds like given that youve already issued the shares and talked about the acquisition having closed in october that maybe we can get a little bit more detail on that before you are fully ready to announce it louis haddad dave thanks for the question there is not much detail that we want to talk about at this time it is a stable center and i believe that the noi is in our projections for  we have got some very sensitive negotiations going on right now with regard to redevelopment opportunities there i look forward to sharing more detail as soon as possible but i cant do it quite yet david rodgers okay thanks for that detail at least i would say maybe lou another question on the development side it sounds like you have more joint venture opportunities how does the  equityowned pipeline look it sounds like you are kind of maybe leaning more to joint ventures but i guess correct me if i am wrong how are you thinking about putting capital to work here through new development louis haddad well as i said on the call activity is extremely robust right now both from our own sourcing as well as jv we are basically blind to the source at this point in time we are basically cherrypicking the opportunity whether they come from outside with developers that we know or we have sourced them internally david rodgers okay in terms of maybe the financing plan mike you kind of referenced paying off some of the secured debt that you have it didn’t sound like you have a plan of financing those assets and so those maybe just go into an unencumbered pool is that correct is that how you are thinking about it michael o’hara good morning dave we still have time to come up with that but right now we are thinking about just keeping the credit facility in its current place right now it is  million with  million on a revolver and kind of been doing what we have been doing here in the past maybe we will look at that one at a floating rate debt on that one so at some point in time if we wanted to monetize it and sell it we will pay it off and add it to the indiscernible for the credit facility we could do that david rodgers okay and maybe last question i think the only area that you really have any meaningful amount of speculative development underway would be town center and then a couple of different maryland apartment buildings but all kind of on the residential side can you talk about kind of the demand in each of those markets and kind of how you are feeling today about each one of those projects even though you are just getting underway but how you kind of see the underlying fundamentals for those assets michael o’hara great question dave i dont want to take all of our time i cant tell you how excited we are about the maryland property every scrap of news that comes in on what is going on in those markets is more and more positive at the end of indiscernible apartments in lesser locations than our point street apartments are leasing at unbelievable rates and unbelievable speed so we just cant wait to get that up and the same is happening at indiscernible we feel really good about the choices that we have made and we look forward to getting those completed and leased up as soon as possible david rodgers okay great thanks guys michael o’hara thanks dave operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john guinee with stifel please proceed with your question john guinee great okay thank you a couple of comments i cant remember at the ipo what the status was of your virginia beach town center highrise but it is sitting at about  lease is there just no demand for that location anymore or is there a favored submarket that is more in vogue in your part of the world that is one question and then the second question is you are buying a bunch of commodity grocery anchored retail remind us again what you like about those assets michael o’hara sure thanks john first on your first question i was hoping that someone would ask that question with regard to the town center at virginia beach first let me say as i said before on previous conference calls that new highrise that we put up was designed to give us some flexibility and some vacant space due to the fact that for nearly a decade we essentially had zero space at town center so we programmed in an extra  square feet in order to soak up that demand secondly as i have said before rents at town center are a solid  above the surrounding market and perhaps  above the entire msa and as such a vast majority of companies are not going to pay the price to come here so it takes a special user to want to pay for that rent thirdly what i am happy about and glad that you asked the question for is that we have seen a noticeable uptick in activity over the last quarter in fact it has had probably more activity on the office side than we have seen in the last couple of years i hope that is indicative of what might be brewing in the economy but i know it is indicative of what is happening here we look forward to – we are in lease negotiations on four different tenants that would substantially take up the remaining space in town center of course it is not done until it is done so we look forward to updating you on that with regard to your second question i am not sure that i would refer to our acquisition as commoditybased retail of course it depends on your definition of that if all that we were looking at was the credit of the anchor and the term of the leases then i might agree with you that those could be characterized as runofthemill centers what we look for is well located stores with high volume sales again as i have said in the past over nearly  years now we are seeing that while there isn’t any real estate that is completely bulletproof grocery anchored centers with high sales stay full that has been our strategy for a long long time it is going to continue to be our strategy that will resolve itself even further in the coming year as you know john we are not a fan calling on to suburban office we are not a fan of garden variety multifamily those things have their ups and downs and thats why see us weed them out of the portfolio at opportune times but groceryanchored high sales by stores stand that test of time john guinee great thank you operator thank you our next question come from the line of rob stevenson with janney montgomery scott please proceed with your question robert stevenson good morning guys lou look at the development page i get a  at the supplemental on the stuff  that either delivery not stabilized or still under development or in the midst and the jvs and everything whats the sort of blended stabilized yield that youre expecting on that capital deployment today louis haddad thanks robert thats a good question as you know theres a couple of different product type scenarios so im not quite sure of the mix but were as the quality of the product increases obviously the returns decrease what were focusing on is the significant spread and we told you that we anchored  between wholesale and retail right now that pipeline has waved toward multifamily which obviously drags you into the lower end of the scale for instance on harbor point were seeing cap rates there in baltimore transaction believe it or not in the low fives even though one a couple of months ago in the high fours and were well north of  over that but as a blended average the more multifamily that were going to have in the pipeline to more and skew down into the seven as opposed to when we have more office in retail in that pipeline which has skewed into the eight so but it’s a fairly type range and again we had to be mindful of as our cost of capital and so what you may see as weve alluded to a number of time is that some of those might be monetized rather than brought on board in order to reset benefit that we may not get paid for in this offering as everybody on the phone knows as the largest shareholder we have to look through that lens before we just add things to our portfolio because we like them robert stevenson okay and then where are you guys in terms of current occupancy at hopkins village i think it was basically  or so at september th has that moved up since then and the how should we be thinking about this asset going forward is this more like a student housing asset where if you miss this semester youre stuck with all lower occupancy for a period of time or is this just typical market rate apartments where you could continue to build even once the semester starts louis haddad yes great question i appreciate that gives us an opportunity to make sure everybody has a good understanding on the phone that project is a venture with john hopkins university and its purpose is for junior and senior housing the occupancy is hanging right around there it hasn’t grown appreciably after the start of the semester we wouldn’t expect that its going to grow appreciably other than the retail rents all coming online and till we have a pickup in january but i wouldn’t expect as we said on our last call i wouldn’t expect full stabilization until late next summer robert stevenson okay and then just lastly how should we be thinking about this positions over the next six months to a year call it mean theres not much left in the office portfolio the harvest i know that some of the stuff was recently delivered so you got reit full around that may what is there stuff in the portfolio at this point where youre looking at it thing the time to monetize it next six to nine months or year or we basically looking at equity funding for  largely coming to the atm louis haddad okay another great question there are a few things in our portfolio were looking at strongly as weve alluded to before that is we have two state office buildings in the portfolio that frankly will be monetized to the appropriate time we also some of our centers kind of go on back to johns question some of our older centers are performing well but what were seeing out in the marketplace still is a compression on cap rates in what we consider to be maybe not commodity retail but not the all starts in our portfolio so you could see us recycle some of those older centers in the coming year robert stevenson okay i appreciate it guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of will crow with raymond james financials please proceed with your question william crow hey good morning guys  louis haddad hi will william crow a couple of questions first of all opposite end of guinee’s question earlier you’re selling office to buy the retail i would point it why is that you want to get off square feet of office and we’re waiting a lot more reports about suburban office starting to help perform kind of thesis on that louis haddad sure i appreciate that again it’s really kind of hard knock remember our market we’re dealing in secondary market secondary market lands is not at a premium when you have an office you really essentially have – speaking in broad generality here what we’ve seen over a three and a half decade is that you don’t have much of a barrier to answer and while we’re really pleased with a tenant year leases that we get at the outset we’ve seen that once those things rollover it’s very difficult to maintain the rent and even if you can maintain the rent you got a huge outweigh of ti in order to attract that new tenant and you’re at risk because it’s fairly easy again in secondary market for someone that’s through out of the building next door and draw your tenant so it’s been our experience over a long long period of time that those things have their greatest value essential that they like to deliver that’s works for us a very long time i would not want to get caught up in believing that there is significant upside in assets in suburban market william crow i appreciate the answer one final question for me you talked about the construction lender – lending environment tightening that might be touched on last quarter as well is there any difference between you three asset classes or reached away as far the availability in cost of money michael o’hara recently he was gone out on the multifamily we haven’t gone out recently on the retail and office but the feedback i’m hearing is that it’s striking up across all the product item including pcre regs that are coming through are really changing the capital requirements for the banks so they’re changing their pricing and the cost around that william crow great thank you guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of craig kucera with wunderlich please proceed with your question craig kucera hi good morning guys it’s a follow up on the last question i know you mentioned that you’re tightening up across the board that are you seeing any difference in the type of projects that are coming to market maybe a little bit more peer play multifamily or retail but may be last mix piece because it’s more moving parts little profit for the banks that maybe underway louis haddad i wouldn’t say that craig we’ve seen vendors are significantly vary of multifamily across the board as you all know there has been a huge boom in multifamily construction and so a lot of these guys regardless of how good the project is simply have portfolio of construction loans on other projects in a particular market i think that combined with the high risk loans that the regulators are basically poising on the banks with regard to the real estate funding has led them to bring loan dollars into the  range where in a couple of years ago we said multifamily then you will look at  well overall i think that’s really good for the market and the economy and i guess the right thing for the wrong reason if you will because it will cause things to slow down in some of these projects that really shouldn’t get build perhaps it won’t but in the meantime for the beneficiary a lot of people putting in their project their way michael o’hara craig let me just also add when we’re talking about this we’re talking about construction loans and not the stabilized assets this is the different lending environment stabilized versus construction eric smith i would add one more comment to that the topic on another question that’s another benefit that we’re enjoying from having the local – specific developers brining a development opportunity on the jv development platform side is that it will mention we can share – the best of those opportunities throughout and to the extent that construction lenders only have room for one or few remaining projects to take to sub markets where we’re able to take advantage in some cases that our development partner has done locally and see that opportunity in that marketplace which allows us in what is increasingly competitive construction loan environment to be able to secure those construction loans albeit maybe a lower lcc that we’ve been seeing in the past of money assets those construction dollars because of those attractive opportunities craig kucera got it well and following up on that are you  if someones put in two three years into a project are you seeing any opportunities where there may be some distress maybe developers have been caught midstream and a little bit surprised and now has maybe over extended themselves and maybe you can get an even better deals than he might normally be able to get louis haddad thats definitely happening out there if we were wed be think about it if he started working in  to bring a project to bear to  then you definitely had a different expectation when he started so yes and again we want to be opportunistic without being piggish if you will this company was built on relationship we guess per shot that allow these project because of our longevity and the fairness with what we treat people so youre not going to see or rate a partner over the call but at the same time obviously it puts us in a very good position to make a very good deal craig kucera got it thanks guys louis haddad thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of laura engel with stonegate capital partners please proceed with your question laura engel good morning what that is on the town center next phase is under development if you could tell us i know as this anchored tenants not yet announced if you could tell us a little bit about how that mix of tenants compares to what is already there how the preleasing compares to what youve seen historically and then maybe i guess any kind of lessons learnt having been there for a while and really done the majority of the development whats going to bring the most success in getting that property online and what you think as far as anything of the stabilization rates compared to historical rates louis haddad sure and thanks for the question when you guys want to start talk about town center if you guys keep nudging me they want me to shut up because i get really excited about what were doing there the anchor that have be reticent to make announcements yet basically want to be much closer to the store opening before they unveil but i can tell you its the same type of lifestyle center and that weve endeavored to attract the anthropologie in west elm brooks brothers of the world so youll see that its been that same yoke well known international name i tell you its brought this whole project has brought a tremendous amount of excitement at town center from a standpoint of how quickly it is going to stabilize its right in the  for those of you are somewhat familiar with town center its right in the centre of town center as opposed on the periphery its right next to the public place that had become a gathering place for the townspeople and so its going to be highly visible highly desirable and weve had some great absorption rates on our retail and our apartment todate the encore apartments are already in the highs and i expect theres a waiting list for the type of apartments that were building on this block so i expect thats going to stabilize very quickly were also we got where while we have a couple of leases with the people i just mentioned were in loi negotiations especially for the rest of the state there is going to be some rework involved i guess something else we want to get out there were going to have to move some tenants around and the retail under the cosmopolitan apartments to make room for some other cotenants that we really want were going to be moving a couple of the local shop and when we put together our  guidance our expectation is much like when we built   that were going to see some loss of occupancy in the cosmopolitan while that construction is going on when at least those are in full swing but again temporary glitches for a much greater good laura engel very well and my other questions have been answered so will hop back in the queue but appreciate all the given information and congrats from the successful quarter louis haddad thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of paul puryear with raymond james financial please proceed with your question paul puryear hey good morning wed really like to get some more color on your construction company the profitability there and i would assume youre getting cost pressure if you could comment on that and are you able just to pass that through louis haddad yes great question paul i appreciate it may i tell you guys will make me talk forever here some of you know i came up through that that company is still near and dear to my heart paul were not seeing any pressure on the profitability on that company essentially because of the way we do business this is much different than traditional construction our guys are not out there trying to be the low bid on a project our people get hired to help an owner develop a project when he hires an architect and he hires a contractor and watch those two together to ultimately come up with the best product he can for a reasonable price in a very short timeframe therefore we are not  is not incumbent upon us to put a hard number on the project and till essentially we have the entire thing subcontracted so long answer to a short question essentially everything is pass through now its still the construction business and theres still some risk obviously you can have subcontractors go out on here in the middle of our project so we have an extremely well oiled wedding machine to keep that to a minimum as mike mentioned that backlog is well over a couple of  million for the third or fourth year in a row we our expectation as of  is going to once again be at the higher end of the range and it also it begs the question why not expand it well its not really expandable we really like the idea of that company bring in  million  million every year that kind of work that it gets it gets from a couple of handfuls of client that understand the value of hiring an contractor upfront because that’s where the money is saved through the design process but it doesnt scale up well and frankly we have as much benefit in having those guys work for us in controlling our cost of schedule as well as involved in these joint ventures as weve said before this makes any lending program that we have wouldn’t have it if we didn’t have our construction company on site basically monitoring the process in prosecuting the construction so its a multiheaded monster for us that happens to be very lucrative on this side paul puryear thanks for that and in the cost pressure louis haddad were seeing a lot of cost pressure across the board in a number of different market i tell you it’s kind of interesting to look at as you wonder why in a flat economy and where commodity prices have essentially gone down for the last several years why are we to begin a cost pressure and the biggest reason that we see is that there is a dearth of subcontractors out there to do complex high rise type work a lot of them went away in the great recession and they largely have not come back youve seen a few articles in the wall street journal talking about how difficult it is to get glass on high rise it say that’s really a manpower thing and so not sure when that results itself so for our third party clients they know whats going on and can react accordingly for our development business its kind of interesting again as you guys know we don’t throw up buildings and help to lease them we do projects with cities and with wellheeled anchor tenants and basically it becomes back to a pass through and when were doing a public private partnership we do our forecasting on with what costs are going to be that basically just means there needs to be more participation from the city or the university or wherever our public partner is the same thing when we get a or when we get an engagement from one of our grocery anchors asked us to go somewhere and build a building for them they understand what that price is going to be so while wed rather not see a rising prices but were well equipped to take there ever eric smith paul this is eric i would add one thing to louiss comments the other thing that we obviously don’t know the answer to but were discussing and keeping eye on is as how that cost pressure out there on the construction cost side might manifest itself in the context of the construction lender pull back were seeing and that impact on your number of deals that get done so were keeping eye on that and obviously its very gets to party paul puryear yes sounds like somebody needs to raise the raft eric smith exactly paul puryear going back to the discussion on leasing at virginia beach office last quarter i think you commented that b rents b space in norfolk was filling could you just give us some more color on that the rate that its filling how much lease rates are going up and how that effects the leasing at virginia beach and i guess is part of that are you holding rate at virginia beach louis haddad great question paul were seeing some great success in downtown norfolk because of late in an axis very recently reported that the companies that have chosen to relocate in some of those older buildings that we talked about have brought in over  jobs over the last  months as a matter of fact theyre setting up training stations that a lot of these people allow the locals to be able to get those job as opposed to the people coming in from the area and possibly some of that as well so its a great benefit for the region to have those buildings full there is also been one of the major high rises in downtown that is off course you want to say its like  years old is now being converted into multifamily so its another few  square feet thats taken off the market so again we applaud their success were hopeful that there are going to be a one end of the light rail line thats going to come to the town center that in any respect its good for the region in terms of what it does in for our rent its not much one way or another we are holding rate the lease that we did we off to that last quarter in   was a   rent the four tenants that were talking with now that i mentioned are all going to be in the highs so were not budging if you think about it we cant it would not be wise for us to try and dive and fill these buildings not when you have another  square feet that ultimately is going to roll over and then indiscernible with you the  tenants here enjoy the exclusivity that weve been able to maintain so were going to stay that with that like i said activity has been robust i look forward to having significant increases in occupancy over the next couple of quarters long answer to a short question i hope i called it all does that catch you paul puryear yes you did except for the rate of increase in b rents if you have a number that would be helpful louis haddad yes i don’t have the number i would tell you that those b rents are still b low youd say for instance there one of the prices that they got was a big commitment from adp which i think is around  jobs  some  square feet the city had to kick in significant money to help there was a huge economic development department list where they competed with a number of competing cities in order to get that so i wouldn’t think and got down speculating and i shouldn’t i wouldn’t think that there was any material increase in what happened now you would imagine with the successes that they’ve had i mean theyre well supplying demand the remaining space thats been downtown norfolk you would imaging youd be able to start getting a bit of a premium and those rents will start to creep up paul puryear yes im sure we can drag it down thank you good color operator thank you our final question comes from the line of john guinee with stifel please proceed with your question john guinee great quick followup refresh on memory as to when you raised the dividend last and by how much and then the second question is if you look at your guidance that implies a  to  fourth quarter ffo i think and that seems like a little stint if you raise your dividend a penny about the same time youre ffo is only  or  can you walk us through those two issues louis haddad yes im sorry now ill turn it over to mike so for the last two years we raised the dividend by coincidently  at the in the first quarter of the subsequent year so that was in i want to say february of  as well as february of  mike michael o’hara yes john on some of the guidance so yeartodate we are at  at normalized and our range was up with  surely were not showing the same run rate as in the past quarter apart of that is the effect of using the atm this past year as it been talked about weve ramped out up quite a bit and raised this  million on the atm that ill think we need to go a share count going up its going to bring down rth quarter earnings a little bit john guinee okay michael o’hara thank you louis haddad remember in that past quarter we had  million on the atm and you have  million shares go out with all as well for this property that were looking for to talking with you about so that obviously had a bit of delusion but as mike said weve had strong a ffo growth this year we expect that to continue and so we feel real good about that dividend coverage john guinee right thank you very much operator there are no further question at this time i would like to turn the call back over to mr haddad for any closing comments louis haddad guys
