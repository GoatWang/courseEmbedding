declined significantly over  during that time frame we believe that a business combination with psid at this time would result in superior benefits for diga stockholders and that such benefits can be achieved more completely and quickly than under your continued reorganization plans and with a higher degree of certainty a business combination with psid now creates certain value for diga stockholders as further outlined below and eliminates the risks associated with your ongoing reorganization your continued nasdaqlisting issues and todays volatile business and market environment we believe that our proposal is superior to any other alternative available to diga and its stockholders subject to customary conditions and based on our review of publicly available information relating to diga we are prepared to make an offer of  per share of diga a  premium above the closing of digas common stock based on a  day average for the period ending on september   and translates to an exchange ratio of  shares of psid for every outstanding share of diga we are committed to pursuing our proposal because of the significant opportunities that it will create for psid as well as for all stockholders of diga our proposal is based on the following key elements  compelling valuation as shown above we are valuing diga at a substantial premium to the recent and current stock price  stock for stock exchange our proposal is to acquire all of the outstanding shares in diga in exchange for shares of psid thereby providing diga stockholders with improved liquidity a premium of  and an implied additional premium to psids current price per share  improved balance sheet the resulting combined company will have a stronger balance sheet than diga psids form q for the period ended june   reflects cash of  million and no debt  ready to proceed due to the complementary nature of diga and psids business and based on the work we have already performed and the resources we have committed we are in a position to proceed with the proposed combination on an expeditious basis  operational efficiencies eliminating redundant infrastructure and duplicative operating costs will improve the financial performance of the combined entity  attractive longterm solution for all stockholders under the proposed transaction diga can focus on longterm value creation within a better positioned organization we believe that the management and employees of diga are important to both the integration of our businesses and the achievement of future success we plan to continue to invest in the people at diga and therefore anticipate that there will be attractive career opportunities for employees of diga at the combined company customers will benefit as the combined company will have an improved technology platform and will be able to offer an expanded range of products and services to customers we also believe that this investment can significantly enhance the value of psid which in turn will benefit diga stockholders in the following ways  diga brings a significant revenue stream approximately m  diga has complementary rfid and other identification technologies that can open new markets for psids product portfolio  a reunion of the key intellectual property that will create opportunities in both the human and animal markets  eliminating redundant infrastructure and duplicative operating costs will improve the financial performance of the combined entity we have a high regard for digas management team and believe that the management talent resident in our

respective businesses and the best way to combine our management talent to successfully lead the combined company we are prepared to meet with you and your management team at your earliest convenience

biological command ecbc our business molecular diagnostics positiveid develops biological detection and diagnostics systems including its mband and firefly dx technologies the company began developing complex microfluidic systems to perform sample processing and purification for the defense advanced projects agency darpa it then developed a similar system including a thermal cycler for polymerase chain reaction pcr analysis for the us armys edgewood chemical and biological command ecbc positiveids microfluidic technology replaces robotics and manual processes used in existing systems with integrated microfluidics in a closed automated system which reduces cost increases reliability and enhances the effectiveness of sample processing positiveid is focused primarily on its mband airborne biotthreat detector which was developed under contract with the us department of homeland security dhs science  technology directorate and its firefly dx system which is designed to deliver molecular diagnostic results from a sample in less than  minutes at the pointofneed using a portable handheld system the companys mband detection system continuously and autonomously analyzes air samples for the detection of pathogenic bacteria viruses and toxins for up to  days results from individual mband instruments are reported via a secure wireless network in real time to give an accurate and uptodate status of field conditions mband performs high specificity detection for up to six organisms on the centers for disease controls category a and b select agents list the goal of the companys firefly dx is to enable accurate diagnostics leading to more rapid and effective treatment than what is currently available with existing systems firefly is being developed further for a broad range of biological detection situations for applications including military agricultural and healthcare the system has already demonstrated the ability to detect and identify other common pathogens and diseases such as various strains of influenza e coli methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and human papilloma virus hpv infrared thermometry the caregiver� thermometer by thermomedics inc

medical dental and health laboratories and clinics mobile cellular phone vehicles infrared testing and many other applications we also provide mobile analytical triage centers to insulate central labs from pandemic outbreaks applications the company’s core technology is used for airborne pathogen detection rapid biological diagnostics and sample preparation applications the biodetection market has seen significant growth over the past decade due to incidents involving anthrax ricin sars various strains of influenza ebola and other biological weapons these events have confirmed that threats of infectious disease and bioterrorism are persistent and real with expansive foreign troop deployment increasing domestic populations and the need for a stable supportive agricultural infrastructure the availability of effective molecular screening technologies is of growing importance whether natural or manmade an invasive disease outbreak without proper monitoring or detection and thus resulting in reduced countermeasure effectiveness can significantly affect the health and commercial stability of livestock or human populations on a large scale to this end many biological and chemicalbased methodologies exist to detect a wide range of potential pathogenic threats unfortunately currently available technologies are still costly labor intensive and often limited to laboratoryclinical settings thus falling short of truly effective pointofneed or timely sitespecific monitoring positiveid offers solutions for biothreat detection in the field whether indoors or outdoors at the point
