international history of atricure since the founding and incorporation of atricure the commitment to innovation has been relentless   michael hooven and his wife sue spies cofounded enable medical corporation enable medical’s first product was a pair of radiofrequency energized surgical scissors designed to harvest saphenous veins in cardiac bypass procedures ima harvesting and general surgical applications  in november atricure was established as an independent business focused on atrial fibrillation enable medical provided contract development and manufacturing services to atricure  the atricure bipolar ablation system was made commercially available in the us for the ablation of soft tissues  the journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery published the first article on atricure deviceschronic transmural atrial ablation by using bipolar radiofrequency energy on the beating heart the article was authored by sunil m prasad md hersh s maniar md richard b schuessler phd and ralph j damiano jr md  on august   atricure became a publicly traded company on the nasdaq stock exchange prior to atricures initial public offering atricure acquired enable medical and all of its personnel facilities and other assets atricure opened its european office in the netherlands  atricure entered the cryosurgical market when it acquired the frigitronics cryogenic product line from coopersurgical inc atricure launched the exclude trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the atriclip laa exclusion system for occluding the left atrial appendage  the isolator coolrail linear pen was made commercially available in the us for ablation of cardiac tissue with radiofrequency energy during cardiac surgery the first patient was enrolled in the ablate study the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the atricure bipolar system in performing pulmonary vein isolations and the atrial “connecting lesions” of the maze procedure  atricure’s cryoice and cryo cryoablation probes were made commercially available in the us for the cryosurgical treatment of cardiac arrhythmias   the atriclip laa exclusion system was made commercially available in the us for the occlusion of the left atrial appendage under direct visualization in conjunction with other open cardiac surgical procedures the first patient was enrolled in atricure’s deep af feasibility study the study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of a dual epicardial and endocardial ablation procedure for patients presenting with persistent atrial fibrillation or longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation  following successful completion of the ablate study atricure’s isolator synergy ablation system became the first device approved by fda for the treatment of persistent or longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation  atricure partnered with dr james l cox and launched the maze iv training program in the united states to educate healthcare providers on the safe and effective use of the atricure isolator synergy system in the treatment of nonparoxysmal forms of atrial fibrillation  atricure expanded the maze iv training program to europe  a milestone was reached as atricure surpassed  ablations and over  patients treated the minneapolis office was also opened atricure acquired endoscopic technologies inc estech which expanded atricures product portfolio with the addition of the fusion surgical ablation system and a comprehensive suite of cardiac surgery instruments as a result atricure opened the san ramon office  launched the availability of its cryoice cryo ablation probe cryo to provide cryoanalgesia for temporary pain management atricure’s cryoice is the first cryoablation probe made commercially available in the us for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and for the temporary ablation of peripheral nerves to block pain a milestone in laa management is reached with more than  patients worldwide having been treated with atriclip laa exclusion system atricure acquired ncontact surgical llc a privately held developer of innovative cardiac ablation solutions on november   the cincinnati headquarters opened its newly built facility in mason ohio atricure announces first patient enrolled in international afib clinical study combined endoscopic epicardial and percutaneous endocardial ablation versus repeated catheter ablation in persistent and longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation ceaseaf first patient enrolled in atlas clinical study this observational study explores the use of the atriclip device to decrease complications associated with postoperative afib poaf by targeting specific cardiac surgery patient populations at the highest risk of developing poaf the cryoform cryoablation probe was made commercially available in the us this probe offers increased probe flexibility to adapt to a variety of surgical ablation procedures a new atriclip device called the atriclip pro was made commercially available in the us and european markets this new device has increased functionality that enhances the capability of occluding the left atrial appendage in minimallyinvasive cardiac surgeries gained approval for the atriclip products and cryoice platform in japan first patient enrolled in the frost trial this clinical study examines the cryoice cryoablation probe cryo for pain management in post thoracic procedures via intercostal cryoanalgesia sts  clinical practice guidelines for surgical treatment of afib changed surgical ablation at the time of structural heart surgery from a class ii to a class i recommendation the recommendations have gone from it is “reasonable” to do an ablation in afib patients undergoing major types of structural heart surgery to it is “recommended” to do an ablation  a milestone was reached as atricure surpassed  atriclip laa exclusion system devices sold worldwide rf ablation pacing and sensing
