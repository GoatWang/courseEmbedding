protesters proposal is denied where record shows allegations are without merit or that alleged evaluation errors did not result in competitive prejudice to protester decision l communications westwood corporation protests the award of contracts to engineered electric company dba fermont and onan corporation dba cummins power generation under request for proposals rfp no wptra issued by the department of the army to acquire electrical generator sets l argues that the agency misevaluated proposals failed to engage in meaningful discussions and made an unreasonable award decision we deny the protest background the rfp contemplated award of up to three indefinitedelivery indefinitequantity contracts to design build and furnish to the army a new set of generators variously sized and configured and ranging from  to  kilowatts kw the rfp contemplated performance in three phases during phase i to last approximately months the contractors will develop prototype generators complete a maintenance demonstration conduct limited testing and provide limited logistics data at the conclusion of phase i the army will select one of the contractors to continue performance of the remainder of the contract during phase ii approximately  months the contractor will engage in further developmental and operational testing perform a logistics demonstration and develop additional logistics data during phase iii approximately  months the contractor will engage in production of the generators and associated documentation such as technical manuals phases i and ii are to be performed on a costplusfixedfee basis while phase iii is to be performed on a fixedprice basis the solicitation provided for the award of contracts to the firms submitting proposals deemed to offer the best value to the government considering costprice and noncostprice factors as follows technical integrated logistics support ils equal in importance performance risk slightly less important than the technical and ils factors individually costprice slightly less important than performance risk and small business participation plan slightly less important than costprice the subfactors for the technical factor in descending order of importance were key operational performance parameters specific design characteristics design concept capabilities plans personnel and facilities and configuration management the subfactors for the ils factor all equal in weight were supportability analysis logistics support maintenance planning and technical publications for the noncostprice considerations the proposals were assigned adjectival ratings of outstanding good acceptable susceptible of being found acceptable or unacceptable and for the performance risk factor low moderate or high risk the costprice evaluation is not at issue in the protest the army received numerous proposals and after establishing a competitive range comprised of four proposals engaged in discussions and solicited and received final proposal revisions fpr the agency evaluated the fprs and assigned the following ratings to the proposals factor subfactor onan fermont l offeror a technical good outstanding acceptable acceptable key operational performance parameters good good acceptable acceptable specific design characteristics outstanding outstanding good good design concept outstanding outstanding good good capabilities plans personnel and facilities good outstanding good good configuration management and product drawings acceptable acceptable acceptable acceptable ils good outstanding good outstanding supportability analysis outstanding outstanding good good logistics support good outstanding good outstanding maintenance planning good outstanding good outstanding technical publications outstanding good outstanding outstanding performance risk low risk low risk moderate risk low risk costprice     small business good outstanding outstanding acceptable agency report ar exh  at  on the basis of these evaluation results the agency made awards to onan and fermont finding that those two firms proposals offered the best value to the government abandoned and untimely issues in its initial letter of protest l made a large number of assertions relating to the agencys evaluation of its proposal in particular l alleged that the agency unreasonably failed to assign an additional  strengths to its proposal under the technical factor  and an additional  strengths under the ils evaluation factor  the agency provided a detailed report in response to the protest that specifically addressed each of ls numerous arguments in its comments responding to the report l makes no mention of either the overwhelming majority of its initial assertions under the technical factor or of any of its assertions relating to the ils factor where as here an agency provides a detailed response to a protesters assertions and the protester either does not respond to the agencys position or provides a response that merely references or restates the original allegation without substantively rebutting the agencys position we deem the initiallyraised arguments abandoned citrus college kei pearson inc  b et al  apr    cpd  at  n thus except as specifically discussed below we find that l has abandoned its assertions relating to the agencys evaluation of its proposal under the technical and ils factors in a similar vein l initially argued that the agency evaluated the performance risk under its and fermonts proposals in a disparate manner specifically l asserted that the agency unreasonably assigned its proposal a moderate risk rating because of performance problems occurring under its prior generator contracts while rating fermonts proposal low risk notwithstanding that fermont had experienced performance problems under one of its prior contracts for generators in support of its allegation l asserted that the agency listed on a website some  problems associated with fermonts  kw generators the agency responded to ls assertion specifically noting that the problems under fermonts contract had been resolved without excessive government involvement and noting as well that the cognizant contracting official who completed the past performance questionnaire assigned fermont scores of at least acceptable in every area in contrast the agency took the position in its report that there had been a need for excessive government involvement in resolving the performance problems under ls contracts and that the cognizant contracting officials had not given l acceptable ratings on its past performance questionnaires in its comments responding to the agencys report l did no more than restate its initial protest argumentthat the agency unreasonably failed to assign the fermont proposal a moderate risk rating because of the alleged  problems with fermonts kw generators l neither mentions nor rebuts the agencys position that the different ratings were warranted because the problems with the fermont contract were resolved without excessive government involvement and fermont received at least acceptable ratings for that contracts past performance questionnaire given that l merely restated its initial protest argument without substantively responding to the agencys position we deem this aspect of ls protest abandoned as well citrus college kei pearson inc  supra in its comments responding to the agency report l asserted for the first time that the agency had evaluated its and onans proposals in a disparate manner and also afforded onan more detailed discussions than those provided to l l maintains that it could have improved its proposal had it been given similarly detailed discussions and that this disparate treatment evidences bias on the part of the agency our bid protest regulations  cfr a  require that protests be filed within  days of when the protester knew or should have known the basis for protest the agency filed its report responding to the protestwhich contained the information on which ls additional arguments are basedon november   ls comments responding to the report which included the new assertions were not submitted until december  that is  days after the report was submitted  since l did not raise its new assertions within  days of its receipt of the report this aspect of the protest is untimely and will not be considered  evaluation of the l technical proposal l asserts the agency misevaluated its proposal in several respects in reviewing protests relating to the propriety of an agencys evaluation our office does not reevaluate proposals our review is limited to considering whether the agencys evaluation is reasonable and consistent with the solicitations evaluation scheme as well as applicable statutes and regulations joint mgmt  tech servs  b b sept    cpd  at  as discussed below we find that the evaluation here was unobjectionable digital control system l asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to assign its proposal strengths under the key operational performance parameters and specific design characteristics subfactors based on its proposed digital control system also referred to in the record as its computer interface modulecontrol system cimcs according to the protester it offered the only fieldproven generator control system among the competitors and further its cimcs offers superior performance in terms of survivability against adverse environmental factors such as high humidity salt fog spray and electromagnetic interference the agency responds that contrary to the protesters assertion its proposed cimcs is not field proven because the offered cimcs is a substantially redesigned version of ls earlier computer interface module cim the agency maintains that because of this significant redesign there was no basis to give evaluation weight to reliability information relating to the earlier model the agency further notes that in fact the l proposal was assigned a minor strength under the specific design characteristics subfactor for the quality of its response to the solicitations survivability requirements that is the generators ability to function in adverse environmental conditions we have no basis to object to the evaluation in this area as noted by the army the record shows that ls cimcs is in fact a significantly redesigned version of its earlier cim the new version differs from the older version in that deleted ar exh  vol ii design concept at  l maintains that these changes do not result in a significantly different configuration for the cimcs however the agency has sufficiently established that the changes are extensive enough that it reasonably could discount reliability data associated with the earlier cim model and conclude that the currentlyproposed cimcs is not field tested the record also shows that the agency gave ls proposal two minor strengths for meeting the rfps survivability requirements in particular the agencys final evaluation materials provide the proposal provides a thorough discussion about the material properties required to allow the set to operate in environments with extreme humidity this information enhances the merit of the proposal and increases the probability of successful performance of the contract     the proposal addressed all of the survivability requirements in great detail the proposal described the design approach the offeror is using to meet the requirements the discussion was very detailed and this information enhances the merit of the proposal and increases the probability of successful performance of the contract     ar exh  appendix a at  while the protester essentially disagrees with the weight that this favorable finding was given in the technical evaluationthat is it believes its proposal should have received major rather than minor strengths for its cimcs componentsuch disagreement without more does not provide a basis for our office to object to the agencys evaluation kathryn huddleston  assocs ltd  b july    cpd  at  we conclude that the evaluation in this area was reasonable generator weight l asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to credit its proposal with a strength for proposing generators that were lighter than the rfpspecified required weights and also unreasonably penalized its proposal for not meeting objective weights lower than the required weights but objectives of the agency in this latter regard l asserts that since the objective weights were not specified in the rfp penalizing it for failing to meet those weights was tantamount to applying an unstated requirement this aspect of ls protest is without merit as for the required weights the record shows that the evaluators did not credit ls proposal with a strength because the firms proposed generators were deleted the agency nonetheless did specifically note that the proposed generators were deleted the required weights ar exh  appendix a at the source selection plan defines a major strength as an aspect of a proposal that appreciably enhances the merit of the proposal ar exh  revision  at  the agency could reasonably conclude that this relatively minor advantage did not warrant being rated a strength as for the objective weights there is no indication in the record that ls proposal was penalized for failing to meet those weights there is no mention in the evaluation materials of ls failing to meet the objective weights  accordingly we find that this aspect of the evaluation was unobjectionable deleted l asserts that the agency improperly failed to assign a strength to its proposal for offering deleted generator models according to the protester only the deleted will meet all of the other requirements in terms of weight size noise levels reliability and paralleling of the rfp for deleted generators l also asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to assign a strength to its proposal for offering an deleted a component that allows power to be delivered by the generators during times when short circuits occur l maintains that the deleted exceeds the requirements of the rfp because it can deliver short circuit current for deleted and in the deleted models provides redundancy and increased reliability because the deleted can deliver power when there is a failure of the deleted the agency responds that with respect to ls proposed deleted there was no basis to assign a strength to the proposal merely because the proposed generators meet the requirements of the solicitation and ls use of the deleted is simply one method of meeting the rfps requirements for short circuit current availability as for the ability of the deleted to deleted the agency states that this was not a requirement of the rfp and does not provide a benefit to the agency in any case because it does not use deleted and therefore does not need to have a deleted finally the agency states that it did not assess the reliability of individual system components such as the deleted in the evaluation but rather evaluated the overall reliability of the generators it properly did not assign an individual strength to the l proposal based on the allegedly enhanced reliability of the generators solely because they incorporate the deleted the evaluation in this area was unobjectionable as the protester concedes the proposed deleted simply meet all of the requirements of the rfp for generators of that size there thus is no basis to find that the agency was unreasonable in not assigning a strength to the l proposal based on the deleted similarly there is no basis to find unreasonable the agencys failure to assign a strength to the l proposal for offering the deleted on its generators all generators were required to include a method for providing current during short circuits and the deleted is simply one method for meeting that requirement moreover the capability of the l generators deleted to provide short circuit current for purposes of deletedwas not required by the rfp and since the agency does otherwise require this feature there was no basis to assign the proposal a strength finally there was nothing in the solicitation to indicate that the agency would evaluate the reliability of individual system components and the protester has neither alleged nor shown that the agency otherwise failed to reasonably evaluate its proposed generator systems reliability performance risk l asserts that the agency improperly assigned the firms proposal a moderate performance risk rating and unreasonably failed to elicit information during discussions that could have resulted in its proposal receiving a low risk rating according to the protester the agency relied on incorrect information relating to the firms performance of prior generator contracts to find that its proposal represented a moderate performance risk l also maintains that in assigning l a moderate risk rating the agency improperly penalized it for failing to provide information relating to the identity of one of its subcontractors according to l this information was neither required by the rfp nor elicited during discussions we need not resolve these arguments since the record establishes that there was no prejudice to l arising from the alleged errors in this connection prejudice is an essential element of every viable protest and where none is shown or is otherwise evident we will not sustain a protest even where the agencys actions may arguably have been improper joint mgmt and tech servs  supra  at  even if we assume that ls proposal should have been assigned a low performance risk rating there is no basis to conclude that the firm would have been in line for award ahead of either of the two awardees onans proposal was rated superior to ls under the technical factor good versus acceptable and equal under the ils factor although ls proposal was rated superior to onans under the small business participation factor outstanding versus good since that was the least important factor and onans costprice was significantly lower there is no reason to believe that there is a reasonable possibility that the agency would have selected ls proposal for award even with a low performance risk rating as for fermont although its proposed costprice was slightly higher than ls its proposal was rated superior to ls under the two most important factorstechnical outstanding versus acceptable and ils outstanding versus goodand was rated equal under the small business participation factor we conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the agency would have made award to l instead of fermont even if it had received a low performance risk rating the protest is denied anthony h gamboa general counsel  specifically l alleged that the agency unreasonably failed to assign  strengths under the key operational performance parameters subfactor  strengths under the specific design characteristics subfactor  strengths under the design concept subfactor  strengths under the capabilities plans personnel and facilities subfactor and  strengths under the configuration management and product drawings subfactor  specifically l alleged that the agency unreasonably failed to assign three strengths under the supportability analysis subfactor three strengths under the logistics subfactor and two strengths under the technical publications subfactor  during the development of the protest record our office granted an extension for the submission of comments responding to the report due to misdelivery of a portion of onans copy of the report to counsel for l in granting this extension we specifically advised protesters counsel that the extension of time for submitting comments did not extend the deadline for filing any supplemental bases for protest  in an unsolicited letter submitted after the parties tendered their comments responding to a supplemental report filed by the agency l suggests that these supplemental assertions are timely because they are simply additional examples of its original assertion that the agency engaged in disparate treatment of the offerors we disagree ls initial protest made no mention of the agencys evaluation of the onan proposal or of the allegedly disparate conduct of discussions these assertions appear for the first time in ls comments which as noted were filed  days after the agency provided l its report l did allege disparate evaluation of its proposal as compared to the evaluation of fermonts proposal for performance risk as noted above however l abandoned that assertion a general allegation in an initial protest does not render timely subsequently identified specific examples of the general allegation dismas
