anomaly edition charlie the choochoo the true first printing anomaly edition   we have discovered that the very “first” printing of charlie the choochoo by stephen king under his pseudonym beryl evans was inadvertently printed without the simon  schuster information on the back and without a upc for a short print run a upc sticker was applied to correct this but the simon  schuster information was left off we also discovered that the printing of the interior also has a different printing numbered line the printing numbers shows as thus           the copyright page features isbn   this does not correspond to the us or uk edition both feature different isbns looking this isbn up the master list has no information applied to it the copyright page in this edition is slightly shorter and very different than the regular first edition it begins that it was printed for great britain in  and then states it was printed for the us in  again different than the regular first printing   this anomaly edition was obviously a mistake and they stopped the presses to correct this error after correcting this mistake the publisher continued the printing of the first print run this updated first printing still show a first but the line now reads           which is the back and forth numbered line version the upc and simon  schuster publisher information placed in the bottom right and left corners on the back as it was supposed to appear with this information we’ve only discovered there are a handful of these but we’ll probably never know the exact quantity this means both the interior and the cover were printed independently of other editions with these anomalies making this the true first printing the first printing of this book is just over  copies this would include the anomaly printing according to my publisher source direct from simon and schuster again no information of how many anomaly copies were printed before they caught the mistake but it couldnt have been many as i publish this in early december the publisher informed us that charlie the choochoo has just gone into a third printing title page  fourth edition information the title page of this book reads fourth edition  this is a tongueincheek nod an inside joke from stephen king and the publisher making this edition appear to be a reprint from an older release decades ago even the pages and the book have been made to have an antique look to it it indeed is not a fourth edition it is a first edition the only edition printed and a first printing as long as the copyright page begins with a  in the number line see above please note that it can be a first edition with later printings which begin with the lowest number on the line as in   this would be a second printing etc if you reprint a book maybe a new cover a new introduction etc then this would constitue a second edition but would still have a first printing like any new print run however the current edition is the only version ever published

resisted releasing it on a larger scale finally in the late s bowing to pressure from his publishers and fans who were searching for the books at this point fewer than  of his millions of readers

main article richard bachman in the late s and early s king published a handful of short novels—rage  the long walk  roadwork  the running man  and thinner —under the pseudonym richard bachman the idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident an alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year he picked up the name from the hard rock band bachmanturner overdrive of which he is a fan richard bachman was exposed as kings pseudonym by a persistent washington dc bookstore clerk steve brown who noticed similarities between the works and later located publishers records at the library of congress that named king as the author of one of bachmans novels this

produced an artists book with designer barbara kruger my pretty pony  published in a limited edition of  by the library fellows of the whitney museum of american art alfred a knopf later released it in a general trade edition in  analysis writing style kings formula for learning to write well is read and write four to six hours a day if you cannot find the time for that you cant expect to become a good writer he sets out each day with a quota of  words and will not stop writing until it is met he also has a simple definition for talent in writing if you wrote something for which someone sent you a check if you cashed the check and it didnt bounce and if you then paid the light bill with the money i consider you talented shortly after his accident king wrote the first draft of the book dreamcatcher with a notebook and a waterman fountain pen which he called the worlds finest word processor when asked why he writes king responds the answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else i was made to do i was made to write stories and i love to write stories thats why i do it i really cant imagine doing anything else and i cant imagine not doing what i do he is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question why do you assume i have a choice king usually begins the story creation process by imagining a what if scenario such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in colorado king often uses authors as characters or includes mention of fictional books in his stories novellas and novels such as paul sheldon who is the main character in misery adult bill denbrough in it ben mears in salems lot and jack torrance in the shining he has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including himself as a character in the dark tower series from wolves of the calla onwards see also list of fictional books in the works of stephen king for a complete list in september  it was announced he would serve as a writer for fangoria influences king has called richard matheson the author who influenced me most as a writer in a current edition of mathesons the shrinking man king is quoted a horror story if there ever was onea great adventure story—it is certainly one of that select handful that i have given to people envying them the experience of the first reading ray bradbury is another influence with king himself stating without ray bradbury there is no stephen king king refers to h p lovecraft several times in danse macabre gramma a short story made into a film in the s anthology horror show the new twilight zone mentions lovecrafts notorious fictional creation necronomicon also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein i know what you need from the  collection night shift and salems lot also mention the tome despite this in on writing king is critical of lovecrafts dialoguewriting skills using passages from the colour out of space as particularly poor examples– there are also several examples of kings referring to lovecraftian characters and settings in his work such as nyarlathotep and yogsothoth king acknowledges the influence of bram stoker particularly on his novel salems lot which he envisioned as a retelling of dracula its related short story jerusalems lot is reminiscent of stokers the lair of the white wormcitation needed he also gives joseph payne brennan credit for being one of his inspirations joseph payne brennan is one of the most effective writers in the horror genre and he is certainly one of the writers i have patterned my own career upon one of the writers whom i studied and with whom i kept school king has also referenced author shirley jackson salems lot opens with a quotation from jacksons the haunting of hill house and a character in wolves of the calla references the jackson book we have always lived in the castle kings book  mentions the jackson story the summer people king is a fan of john d macdonald and dedicated the novella sun dog to macdonald saying i miss you old friend for his part macdonald wrote an admiring preface to night shift and even had his famous character travis mcgee reading cujo in one of the last mcgee novels and pet sematary in the last mcgee novel the lonely silver rain in  kings philtrum press published don robertsons novel the ideal genuine man in his forenote to the novel king wrote don robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to become a novelist the other two being richard matheson and john d macdonald robert a heinleins book the door into summer is repeatedly mentioned in kings wolves of the calla as are several other works wolves of the calla is the king work in which the dark tower begins to follow a metafictional path in an interview with king published in the usa weekend in march  the author stated people look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource i do elmore leonard every day i wake up and—not to be morbid or anything although morbid is my life to a degree—dont see his obituary in the paper i think to myself great hes probably working somewhere hes gonna produce another book and ill have another book to read because when hes gone theres nobody else king partly dedicated his book cell to film director george romero and wrote an essay for the elite dvd version of night of the living dead his favorite books are in order the golden argosy adventures of huckleberry finn the satanic verses mcteague lord of the flies bleak house nineteen eightyfour the raj quartet light in august and blood meridian critical response although critical reaction to kings work has been mostly positive he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers science fiction editors john clute and peter nichols offer a largely favorable appraisal of king noting his pungent prose sharp ear for dialogue disarmingly laidback frank style along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty especially to children all of which rank him among the more distinguished popular writers in his book the philosophy of horror  noël carroll discusses kings work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction analyzing both the narrative structure of kings fiction and kings nonfiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing carroll writes that for king the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and therefore affirmed in his analysis of post–world war ii horror fiction the modern weird tale  critic s t joshi devotes a chapter to kings work joshi argues that kings bestknown works his supernatural novels are his worst describing them as mostly bloated illogical maudlin and prone to deus ex machina endings despite these criticisms joshi argues that since geralds game  king has been tempering the worst of his writing faults producing books that are leaner more believable and generally better written joshi suggests that kings strengths as a writer include the accessible everyman quality of his prose and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence joshi cites two early nonsupernatural novels—rage  and the running man —as kings best suggesting both are riveting and wellconstructed suspense thrillers with believable characters in  king won an o henry award for his short story the man in the black suit in his short story collection a century of great suspense stories editor jeffery deaver noted that king singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up while there were many good bestselling writers before him king more than anybody since john d macdonald brought reality to genre novels he has often remarked that salems lot was peyton place meets dracula and so it was the rich characterization the careful and caring social eye the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again before king many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious bluepenciled by their editors ‘stuff like that gets in the way of the story they were told well its stuff like that that has made king so popular and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing he is a master of masters in  king was honored by the national book awards with a lifetime achievement award the medal of distinguished contribution to american letters some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award richard snyder the former ceo of simon  schuster described kings work as nonliterature and critic harold bloom denounced the choice the decision to give the national book foundations annual award for distinguished contribution to stephen king is extraordinary another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life ive described king in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls but perhaps even that is too kind he shares nothing with edgar allan poe what he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentencebysentence paragraphbyparagraph bookbybook basis however others came to kings defense such as writer orson scott card who responded let me assure you that kings work most definitely is literature because it was written to be published and is read with admiration what snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academicliterary elite king himself later stated harold bloom never pissed me off because there are critics out there and hes one of them who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of intellectual prowess he might be able to say that mark twain is a great writer but its impossible for him to say that theres a direct line of descent from say nathaniel hawthorne to jim thompson because he doesnt read guys like thompson he just thinks i never read him but i know hes terrible in roger eberts review of the  movie secret window he stated a lot of people were outraged that king was honored at the national book awards as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously but after finding that his book on writing had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since strunk and whites the elements of style i have gotten over my own snobbery in  kings

said the driver was not speeding reckless or drinking in his book on writing king states he was heading north walking against the traffic shortly before the accident took place a woman in a car also heading north passed first king and then the light blue dodge van the van was looping from one side of the road to the other and the woman told her passenger she hoped that guy in the van doesnt hit him king was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family but was in considerable pain the author was first transported to northern cumberland hospital in bridgton and then flown by helicopter to central maine medical center cmmc in lewiston his injuries—a collapsed right lung multiple fractures of his right leg scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at cmmc until july  his leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator after five operations in ten days and physical therapy king resumed work on on writing in july though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about forty minutes before the pain became unbearable kings lawyer and two others purchased smiths van for  reportedly to prevent it from appearing on ebay the van was later crushed at a junkyard much to kings disappointment as he fantasized about smashing it up king later mentioned during an interview with fresh airs terry gross that he wanted the vehicle destroyed at a charity event in which individuals would donate money for an opportunity to smash it with a sledgehammer during this time tabitha king was inspired to redesign his studio king visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away what he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died providing a seed for his novel liseys story  in  king announced he would stop writing apparently motivated in part by frustration with his injuries which had made sitting uncomfortable and reduced his stamina he has since resumed writing but states on his website im writing but im writing at a much slower pace than previously and i think that if i come up with something really really good i would be perfectly willing to publish it because that still feels like the final act of the creative process publishing it so people can read it and you can get feedback and people can talk about it with each other and with you the writer but the force of my invention has slowed down a lot over the years and thats as it should be political activism in april  king spoke out against hb  a bill pending in the massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of  although king stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby he criticized the proposed law which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture and to act as surrogate parents to others children which he asserted is usually disastrous and undemocratic he also saw the law as inconsistent as it would forbid a yearold legally able to see hostel part ii from buying or renting grand theft auto san andreas which is violent but less graphic while conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games king also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society which would not be lessened by such a law and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games king argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor and the easy availability of guns which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence regarding video games he later stated that he enjoys playing light gun shooter arcade games such as time crisis a controversy emerged on may   when noel sheppard posted a clip of king at a library of congress reading event on the website newsbusters king talking to highschool students had said if you can read you can walk into a job later on if you dont then youve got the army iraq i dont know something like that the comment was described by the blog as another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military and likened to john kerrys similar remark from  king responded later that day saying that a rightwingblog would impugn my patriotism because i said children should learn to read and could get better jobs by doing so is beneath contempti live in a national guard town and i support our troops but i dont support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise king again defended his comment in an interview with the bangor daily news on may  saying im not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school so they have more options those that dont agree with what im saying im not going to change their minds king later expressed regret for the remark saying that he misspoke he characterized the comment as originating from a brain cramp and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in saying that during the vietnam war serving in the military was a great career for some and for others a sacrifice of two years of ones life king added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism kings website states

what i said  lepage further told king that he should make me the villain of your next book and i won’t charge you royalties the attention garnered by the lepage criticism has led to efforts to

launched a petition drive to encourage king to run his spokeswoman posted to baldaccis facebook comment that he would likely decline to run and king himself stated he would not run or serve on march

the gunslinger each chapter was named for the story previously published in magazine form king dedicated the hardcover edition to his editor at fsf ed ferman who took a chance on these stories the original print run was only  copies which was by this time a comparatively low run for a first printing of a king novel in hardcover his  novel firestarter had an initial print run in trade hardcover of  copies and his  novel christine had a trade hardcover print run of  copies both by the much larger publisher viking the gunslingers initial release was not highly publicized and only specialty sciencefiction and related bookstores carried it on their shelves the book was generally unavailable in the larger chain stores except by special order rumors spread among avid fans that there was a king book out that few readers knew about let alone had actually read when the initial  copies sold out grant printed another  copies in  but these runs were still far short of the growing demand among fans for this book both the first and second printings of the gunslinger garner premium prices on the collectible book market notably among avid readers and collectors of stephen king horror

which roland draws three people from thcentury united states into his world through magical doors grant published the drawing of the three with illustrations by phil hale in a slightly larger run of  copies which was still well below kings typical initial hardcover print run of a new book it published in  had an initial print run of  copies kings largest to dateclarification needed king had believed that the dark tower books would be of interest to only a select group of his fans and he had resisted releasing it on a larger scale finally in the late s bowing to pressure from his publishers and fans who were searching for the books at this point fewer than  of his millions of readers would have been able to own any of the dark tower books king agreed to release the gunslinger and all subsequent dark tower books in trade paperback and massmarket formatscitation needed in the early s king revised the original book the gunslinger because he felt the voice and imagery of the original stories of the late s did not seem to fit the voice of the final installment of  king felt the style of the work had markedly changed during the intervening  years the revised version was published in  by his former hardcover publisher viking grant published its hardcover limited edition of the revised version of the gunslinger along with a prequel story set in the dark tower world called the little sisters of eluria originally published in  in the collection legends short novels by the masters of modern fantasy in  adaptations in october  king signed a deal with marvel comics

new york comic book store to promote it the work had sold over  copies by march  the success of the gunslinger born led to an ongoing miniseries published by marvel with furth and david continuing to collaborate featuring both adapted material from the dark tower books and new material approved by king it also led to a second series of king adaptations in the same format serializing the events of the stand although the hollywood reporter announced in february  that plans were underway for lost cocreator j j abrams to do an adaptation of kings epic dark tower series abrams stated in a november  interview with mtv that he would not be adapting the series akiva goldsman ron howard nikolaj arcel and brian grazer produced a feature film based on the dark tower series with nikolaj arcel as the director while howard slated as the producer with an upcoming release date of july   pseudonyms main article richard bachman in the late s and early s king published a handful of short novels—rage  the long walk  roadwork  the running man  and thinner —under the pseudonym richard bachman the idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident an alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year he picked up the name from the hard rock band bachmanturner overdrive of which he is a fan richard bachman was exposed as kings pseudonym by a persistent washington dc bookstore clerk steve brown who noticed similarities between the works and later located publishers records at the library of congress that named king as the author of one of bachmans novels this led to a press release heralding bachmans death—supposedly from cancer of the pseudonym king dedicated his  book the dark half about a pseudonym turning on a writer to the deceased richard bachman and in  when the stephen king novel desperation was released the companion novel the regulators carried

fellows of the whitney museum of american art alfred a knopf later released it in a general trade edition in  analysis writing style kings formula for learning to write well is read and write four to six hours a day if you cannot find the time for that you cant expect to become a good writer he sets out each day with a quota of  words and will not stop writing until it is met he also has a simple definition for talent in writing if you wrote something for which someone sent you a check if you cashed the check and it didnt bounce and if you then paid the light bill with the money i consider you talented shortly after his accident king wrote the first draft of the book dreamcatcher with a notebook and a waterman fountain pen which he called the worlds finest word processor when asked why he writes king responds the answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else i was made to do i was made to write stories and i love to write stories thats why i do it i really cant imagine doing anything else and i cant imagine not doing what i do he is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question why do you assume i have a choice king usually begins the story creation process by imagining a what if scenario such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in colorado king often uses authors as characters or includes mention of fictional books in his stories novellas and novels such as paul sheldon who is the main character in misery adult bill denbrough in it ben mears in salems lot and jack torrance in the shining he has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including himself as a character in the dark tower series from wolves of the calla onwards see also list of fictional books in the works of stephen king for a complete list in september  it was announced he would serve as a writer for fangoria influences king has called richard matheson the author who influenced me most as a writer in a current edition of mathesons the shrinking man king is quoted a horror story if there ever was onea great adventure story—it is certainly one of that select handful that i have given to people envying them the experience of the first reading ray bradbury is another influence with king himself stating without ray bradbury there is no stephen king king refers to h p lovecraft several times in danse macabre gramma a short story made into a film in the s anthology horror show the new twilight zone mentions lovecrafts notorious fictional creation necronomicon also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein i know what you need from the  collection night shift and salems lot also mention the tome despite this in on writing king is critical of lovecrafts dialoguewriting skills using passages from the colour out of space as particularly poor examples– there are also several examples of kings referring to lovecraftian characters and settings in his work such as nyarlathotep and yogsothoth king acknowledges the influence of bram stoker particularly on his novel salems lot which he envisioned as a retelling of dracula its related short story jerusalems lot is reminiscent of stokers the lair of the white wormcitation needed he also gives joseph payne brennan credit for being one of his inspirations joseph payne brennan is one of the most effective writers in the horror genre and he is certainly one of the writers i have patterned my own career upon one of the writers whom i studied and with whom i kept school king has also referenced author shirley jackson salems lot opens with a quotation from jacksons the haunting of hill house and a character in wolves of the calla references the jackson book we have always lived in the castle kings book  mentions the jackson story the summer people king is a fan of john d macdonald and dedicated the novella sun dog to macdonald saying i miss you old friend for his part macdonald wrote an admiring preface to night shift and even had his famous character travis mcgee reading cujo in one of the last mcgee novels and pet sematary in the last mcgee novel the lonely silver rain in  kings philtrum press published don robertsons novel the ideal genuine man in his forenote to the novel king wrote don robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to become a novelist the other two being richard matheson and john d macdonald robert a heinleins book the door into summer is repeatedly mentioned in kings wolves of the calla as are several other works wolves of the calla is the king work in which the dark tower begins to follow a metafictional path in an interview with king published in the usa weekend in march  the author stated people look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource i do elmore leonard every day i wake up and—not to be morbid or anything although morbid is my life to a degree—dont see his obituary in the paper i think to myself great hes probably working somewhere hes gonna produce another book and ill have another book to read because when hes gone theres nobody else king partly dedicated his book cell to film director george romero and wrote an essay for the elite dvd version of night of the living dead his favorite books are in order the golden argosy adventures of huckleberry finn the satanic verses mcteague lord of the flies bleak house nineteen eightyfour the raj quartet light in august and blood meridian critical response although critical reaction to kings work has been mostly positive he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers science fiction editors john clute and peter nichols offer a largely favorable appraisal of king noting his pungent prose sharp ear for dialogue disarmingly laidback frank style along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty especially to children all of which rank him among the more distinguished popular writers in his book the philosophy of horror  noël carroll discusses kings work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction analyzing both the narrative structure of kings fiction and kings nonfiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing carroll writes that for king the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and therefore affirmed in his analysis of post–world war ii horror fiction the modern weird tale  critic s t joshi devotes a chapter to kings work joshi argues that kings bestknown works his supernatural novels are his worst describing them as mostly bloated illogical maudlin and prone to deus ex machina endings despite these criticisms joshi argues that since geralds game  king has been tempering the worst of his writing faults producing books that are leaner more believable and generally better written joshi suggests that kings strengths as a writer include the accessible everyman quality of his prose and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence joshi cites two early nonsupernatural novels—rage  and the running man —as kings best suggesting both are riveting and wellconstructed suspense thrillers with believable characters in  king won an o henry award for his short story the man in the black suit in his short story collection a century of great suspense stories editor jeffery deaver noted that king singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up while there were many good bestselling writers before him king more than anybody since john d macdonald brought reality to genre novels he has often remarked that salems lot was peyton place meets dracula and so it was the rich characterization the careful and caring social eye the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again before king many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious bluepenciled by their editors ‘stuff like that gets in the way of the story they were told well its stuff like that that has made king so popular and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing he is a master of masters in  king was honored by the national book awards with a lifetime achievement award the medal of distinguished contribution to american letters some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award richard snyder the former ceo of simon  schuster described kings work as nonliterature and critic harold bloom denounced the choice the decision to give the national book foundations annual award for distinguished contribution to stephen king is extraordinary another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life ive described king in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls but perhaps even that is too kind he shares nothing with edgar allan poe what he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentencebysentence paragraphbyparagraph bookbybook basis however others came to kings defense such as writer orson scott card who responded let me assure you that kings work most definitely is literature because it was written to be published and is read with admiration what snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academicliterary elite king himself later stated harold bloom never pissed me off because there are critics out there and hes one of them who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of intellectual prowess he might be able to say that mark twain is a great writer but its impossible for him to say that theres a direct line of descent from say nathaniel hawthorne to jim thompson because he doesnt read guys like thompson he just thinks i never read him but i know hes terrible in roger eberts review of the  movie secret window he stated a lot of people were outraged that king was honored at the national book awards as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously but after finding that his book on writing had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since strunk and whites the elements of style i have gotten over my own snobbery in  kings book on writing was ranked st on entertainment weekly list of the new classics the  best reads from  to  appearances and adaptations in other

by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan struck king who landed in a depression in the ground about  feet  meters from the pavement of route  according to oxford county sheriff deputy matt baker king was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding reckless or drinking in his book on writing king states he was heading north walking against the traffic shortly before the accident took place a woman in a car also heading north passed first king and then the light blue dodge van the van was looping from one side of the road to the other and the woman told her passenger she hoped that guy in the van doesnt hit him king was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family but was in considerable pain the author was first transported to northern cumberland hospital in bridgton and then flown by helicopter to central maine medical center cmmc in lewiston his injuries—a collapsed right lung multiple fractures of his right leg scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at cmmc until july  his leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator after five operations in ten days and physical therapy king resumed work on on writing in july though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about forty minutes before the pain became unbearable kings lawyer and two others purchased smiths van for  reportedly to prevent it from appearing on ebay the van was later crushed at a junkyard much to kings disappointment as he fantasized about smashing it up king later mentioned during an interview with fresh airs terry gross that he wanted the vehicle destroyed at a charity event in which individuals would donate money for an opportunity to smash it with a sledgehammer during this time tabitha king was inspired to redesign his studio king visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away what he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died providing a seed for his novel liseys story  in  king announced he would stop writing apparently motivated in part by frustration with his injuries which had made sitting uncomfortable and reduced his stamina he has since resumed writing but states on his website im writing but im writing at a much slower pace than previously and i think that if i come up with something really really good i would be perfectly willing to publish it because that still feels like the final act of the creative process publishing it so people can read it and you can get feedback and people can talk about it with each other and with you the writer but the force of my invention has slowed down a lot over the years and thats as it should be political activism in april  king spoke out against hb  a bill pending in the massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of  although king stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby he criticized the proposed law which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture and to act as surrogate parents to others children which he asserted is usually disastrous and undemocratic he also saw the law as inconsistent as it would forbid a yearold legally able to see hostel part ii from buying or renting grand theft auto san andreas which is violent but less graphic while conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games king also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society which would not be lessened by such a law and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games king argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor and the easy availability of guns which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence regarding video games he later stated that he enjoys playing light gun shooter arcade games such as time crisis a controversy emerged on may   when noel sheppard posted a clip of king at a library of congress reading event on the website newsbusters king talking to highschool students had said if you can read you can walk into a job later on if you dont then youve got the army iraq i dont know something like that the comment was described by the blog as another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military and likened to john kerrys similar remark from  king responded later that day saying that a rightwingblog would impugn my patriotism because i said children should learn to read and could get better jobs by doing so is beneath contempti live in a national guard town and i support our troops but i dont support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise king again defended his comment in an interview with the bangor daily news on may  saying im not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school so they have more options those that dont agree with what im saying im not going to change their minds king later expressed regret for the remark saying that he misspoke he characterized the comment as originating from a brain cramp and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in saying that during the vietnam war serving in the military was a great career for some and for others a sacrifice of two years of ones life king added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism kings website states that he is a supporter of the democratic party during the  presidential election king voiced his support for democratic candidate barack obama king was quoted as calling conservative commentator glenn beck satans mentally challenged younger brother on march   king spoke at a political rally in sarasota aimed against governor rick scott rfl voicing his opposition to the tea party movement on april   king published an article in the daily beast calling for rich americans including himself to pay more taxes

temperament of a yearold maine politics king endorsed shenna bellows in the  us senate election for the seat currently held by republican susan collins king is a public critic of paul lepage the republican governor of maine and has referred to lepage as one of the three stooges along with florida governor rick scott and wisconsin governor scott walker he was critical of lepage for incorrectly suggesting in a weekly radio address on march   that king avoided paying maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year the statement was later corrected by the governors office but no apology was issued king said lepage was full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green  and demanded that lepage man up and apologize lepage declined to apologize to king stating i never said stephen king did not pay income taxes what i said was stephen kings not in maine right now thats what i said  lepage further told king that he should make me the villain of your next book and i won’t charge you royalties the attention garnered by the lepage criticism has led to efforts to encourage king to run for governor of maine in  bangor city councilor joe baldacci posted on his facebook page that he was starting a draft stephen king effort and democratic state rep diane russell launched a petition drive to encourage king to run his spokeswoman posted to baldaccis facebook comment that he would likely decline to run and king himself stated he would not run or serve on march  while still criticizing what he said was the laziness that made him mad about not checking his tax payments and that lepage had a problem finding a comfortable pair of bigboy pants king sent a tweet on june   stating that lepage is a terrible embarrassment to the state i live in and love if he wont govern he should resign he later clarified that he was not calling on lepage to resign but to go to work or go back home on august   king sent another tweet about lepage calling him a bigot a homophobe and a

the man in black in an alternatereality universe that is a cross between j r r tolkiens middleearth and the american wild west as depicted by clint eastwood and sergio leone in their spaghetti westerns the first of these stories the dark tower the gunslinger was initially published in five installments by the magazine of fantasy  science fiction under the editorship of edward l ferman from  to  the gunslinger was continued as an eightbook epic series called the dark tower which books king wrote and published infrequently over four decades in  the fantasy smallpress donald m grant known for publishing the entire canon of robert e howard printed these stories for the first time together in hardcover form with color and blackandwhite illustrations by fantasy artist michael whelan as the gunslinger each chapter was named for the story previously published in magazine form king dedicated the hardcover edition to his editor at fsf ed ferman who took a chance on these stories the original print run was only  copies which was by this time a comparatively low run for a first printing of a king novel in hardcover his  novel firestarter had an initial print run in trade hardcover of  copies and his  novel christine had a trade hardcover print run of  copies both by the much larger publisher viking the gunslingers initial release was not highly publicized and only specialty sciencefiction and related bookstores carried it on their shelves the book was generally unavailable in the larger chain stores except by special order rumors spread among avid fans that there was a king book out that few readers knew about let alone had actually read when the initial  copies sold out grant printed another  copies in  but these runs were still far short of the growing demand among fans for this book both the first and second printings of the gunslinger garner premium prices on the collectible book market notably among avid readers and collectors of stephen king horror literature fantasy literature and american western literature and fans of michael whelans artworkcitation needed in  king released the second installment the dark tower ii the drawing of the three in which roland draws three people from thcentury united states into his world through magical doors grant published the drawing of the three with illustrations by phil hale in a slightly larger run of  copies which was still well below kings typical initial hardcover print run of a new book it published in  had an initial print run of  copies kings largest to dateclarification needed king had believed that the dark tower books would be of interest to only a select group of his fans and he had resisted releasing it on a larger scale finally in the late s bowing to pressure from his publishers and fans who were searching for the books at this point fewer than  of his millions of readers would have been able to own any of the dark tower books king agreed to release the gunslinger and all subsequent dark tower books in trade paperback and massmarket formatscitation needed in the early s king revised the original book the gunslinger because he felt the voice and imagery of the original stories of the late s did not seem to fit the voice of the final installment of  king felt the style of the work had markedly changed during the intervening  years the revised version was published in  by his former hardcover publisher viking grant published its hardcover limited edition of the revised version of the gunslinger along with a prequel story set in the dark tower world called the little sisters of eluria originally published in  in the collection legends short novels by the masters of modern fantasy in  adaptations in october  king signed a deal with marvel comics to publish a sevenissue limited series spinoff of the series called the gunslinger born the series which focuses on a young roland deschain was plotted by robin furth with dialogue by peter david and illustrated by eisner awardwinning artist jae lee the first issue was published on february   and king david lee and marvel editorinchief joe quesada appeared at a midnight signing at a times square new york comic book store to promote it the work had sold over  copies by march  the success of the gunslinger born led to an ongoing miniseries published by marvel with furth and david continuing to collaborate featuring both adapted material from the dark tower books and new material approved by king it also led to a second series of king adaptations in the same format serializing the events of the stand although the hollywood reporter announced in february  that plans were underway for lost cocreator j j abrams to do an adaptation of kings epic dark tower series abrams stated in a november  interview with mtv that he would not be adapting the series akiva goldsman ron howard nikolaj arcel and brian grazer produced a feature film based on the dark tower series with nikolaj arcel as the director while howard slated as the producer with an upcoming release date of july   pseudonyms main article richard bachman in the late s and early s king published a handful of short novels—rage  the long walk  roadwork  the running man  and thinner —under the pseudonym richard bachman the idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident an alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year he picked up the name from the hard rock band bachmanturner overdrive of which he is a fan richard bachman was exposed as kings pseudonym by a persistent washington dc bookstore clerk steve brown who noticed similarities between the works and later located publishers records at the library of congress that named king as the author of one of bachmans novels this led to a press release heralding bachmans death—supposedly from cancer of the pseudonym king dedicated his  book the dark half about a pseudonym turning on a writer to the deceased richard bachman and in  when the stephen king novel desperation was released the companion novel the regulators carried the bachman byline in  during a press conference in london king declared that he had discovered another bachman novel titled blaze it was published on june   in fact the original manuscript had been

pseudonyms the short story the fifth quarter was published under the pseudonym john swithen the name of a character in the novel carrie that was published in cavalier in april  the story was later reprinted in kings collection nightmares  dreamscapes in  under his own name in the introduction to the bachman novel blaze king claims with tongueincheek that bachman was the person using the swithen pseudonym digital era stephen king at the harvard book store june   in  king published online a serialized horror novel the plant at first the public presumed that king had abandoned the project

in his writing both in his fiction and nonfiction nonfiction references include a mention in kings book danse macabre where he calls the ramones an amusing punkrock band that surfaced some four years ago he also wrote about them in on writing making reference to dancing to the ramones—gabba gabba hey as one of the reasons he has maintained a good marriage king included further ramones references in his fictional work he quotes the lyrics to the ramones debut single blitzkrieg bop in his novel pet sematary on numerous occasions as in the sentence what is it the ramones say heyho lets go in the dark tower novel wolves of the calla the ramones get a further mention by the character eddie dean who states that roland stagedives like joey ramone critics have also noted the ramones references

fellows of the whitney museum of american art alfred a knopf later released it in a general trade edition in  analysis writing style kings formula for learning to write well is read and write four to six hours a day if you cannot find the time for that you cant expect to become a good writer he sets out each day with a quota of  words and will not stop writing until it is met he also has a simple definition for talent in writing if you wrote something for which someone sent you a check if you cashed the check and it didnt bounce and if you then paid the light bill with the money i consider you talented shortly after his accident king wrote the first draft of the book dreamcatcher with a notebook and a waterman fountain pen which he called the worlds finest word processor when asked why he writes king responds the answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else i was made to do i was made to write stories and i love to write stories thats why i do it i really cant imagine doing anything else and i cant imagine not doing what i do he is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question why do you assume i have a choice king usually begins the story creation process by imagining a what if scenario such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in colorado king often uses authors as characters or includes mention of fictional books in his stories novellas and novels such as paul sheldon who is the main character in misery adult bill denbrough in it ben mears in salems lot and jack torrance in the shining he has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including himself as a character in the dark tower series from wolves of the calla onwards see also list of fictional books in the works of stephen king for a complete list in september  it was announced he would serve as a writer for fangoria influences king has called richard matheson the author who influenced me most as a writer in a current edition of mathesons the shrinking man king is quoted a horror story if there ever was onea great adventure story—it is certainly one of that select handful that i have given to people envying them the experience of the first reading ray bradbury is another influence with king himself stating without ray bradbury there is no stephen king king refers to h p lovecraft several times in danse macabre gramma a short story made into a film in the s anthology horror show the new twilight zone mentions lovecrafts notorious fictional creation necronomicon also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein i know what you need from the  collection night shift and salems lot also mention the tome despite this in on writing king is critical of lovecrafts dialoguewriting skills using passages from the colour out of space as particularly poor examples– there are also several examples of kings referring to lovecraftian characters and settings in his work such as nyarlathotep and yogsothoth king acknowledges the influence of bram stoker particularly on his novel salems lot which he envisioned as a retelling of dracula its related short story jerusalems lot is reminiscent of stokers the lair of the white wormcitation needed he also gives joseph payne brennan credit for being one of his inspirations joseph payne brennan is one of the most effective writers in the horror genre and he is certainly one of the writers i have patterned my own career upon one of the writers whom i studied and with whom i kept school king has also referenced author shirley jackson salems lot opens with a quotation from jacksons the haunting of hill house and a character in wolves of the calla references the jackson book we have always lived in the castle kings book  mentions the jackson story the summer people king is a fan of john d macdonald and dedicated the novella sun dog to macdonald saying i miss you old friend for his part macdonald wrote an admiring preface to night shift and even had his famous character travis mcgee reading cujo in one of the last mcgee novels and pet sematary in the last mcgee novel the lonely silver rain in  kings philtrum press published don robertsons novel the ideal genuine man in his forenote to the novel king wrote don robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to become a novelist the other two being richard matheson and john d macdonald robert a heinleins book the door into summer is repeatedly mentioned in kings wolves of the calla as are several other works wolves of the calla is the king work in which the dark tower begins to follow a metafictional path in an interview with king published in the usa weekend in march  the author stated people look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource i do elmore leonard every day i wake up and—not to be morbid or anything although morbid is my life to a degree—dont see his obituary in the paper i think to myself great hes probably working somewhere hes gonna produce another book and ill have another book to read because when hes gone theres nobody else king partly dedicated his book cell to film director george romero and wrote an essay for the elite dvd version of night of the living dead his favorite books are in order the golden argosy adventures of huckleberry finn the satanic verses mcteague lord of the flies bleak house nineteen eightyfour the raj quartet light in august and blood meridian critical response although critical reaction to kings work has been mostly positive he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers science fiction editors john clute and peter nichols offer a largely favorable appraisal of king noting his pungent prose sharp ear for dialogue disarmingly laidback frank style along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty especially to children all of which rank him among the more distinguished popular writers in his book the philosophy of horror  noël carroll discusses kings work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction analyzing both the narrative structure of kings fiction and kings nonfiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing carroll writes that for king the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and therefore affirmed in his analysis of post–world war ii horror fiction the modern weird tale  critic s t joshi devotes a chapter to kings work joshi argues that kings bestknown works his supernatural novels are his worst describing them as mostly bloated illogical maudlin and prone to deus ex machina endings despite these criticisms joshi argues that since geralds game  king has been tempering the worst of his writing faults producing books that are leaner more believable and generally better written joshi suggests that kings strengths as a writer include the accessible everyman quality of his prose and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence joshi cites two early nonsupernatural novels—rage  and the running man —as kings best suggesting both are riveting and wellconstructed suspense thrillers with believable characters in  king won an o henry award for his short story the man in the black suit in his short story collection a century of great suspense stories editor jeffery deaver noted that king singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up while there were many good bestselling writers before him king more than anybody since john d macdonald brought reality to genre novels he has often remarked that salems lot was peyton place meets dracula and so it was the rich characterization the careful and caring social eye the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again before king many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious bluepenciled by their editors ‘stuff like that gets in the way of the story they were told well its stuff like that that has made king so popular and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing he is a master of masters in  king was honored by the national book awards with a lifetime achievement award the medal of distinguished contribution to american letters some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award richard snyder the former ceo of simon  schuster described kings work as nonliterature and critic harold bloom denounced the choice the decision to give the national book foundations annual award for distinguished contribution to stephen king is extraordinary another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life ive described king in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls but perhaps even that is too kind he shares nothing with edgar allan poe what he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentencebysentence paragraphbyparagraph bookbybook basis however others came to kings defense such as writer orson scott card who responded let me assure you that kings work most definitely is literature because it was written to be published and is read with admiration what snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academicliterary elite king himself later stated harold bloom never pissed me off because there are critics out there and hes one of them who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of intellectual prowess he might be able to say that mark twain is a great writer but its impossible for him to say that theres a direct line of descent from say nathaniel hawthorne to jim thompson because he doesnt read guys like thompson he just thinks i never read him but i know hes terrible in roger eberts review of the  movie secret window he stated a lot of people were outraged that king was honored at the national book awards as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously but after finding that his book on writing had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since strunk and whites the elements of style i have gotten over my own snobbery in  kings book on writing was ranked st on entertainment weekly list of the new classics the  best reads from  to  appearances and adaptations in other

by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan struck king who landed in a depression in the ground about  feet  meters from the pavement of route  according to oxford county sheriff deputy matt baker king was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding reckless or drinking in his book on writing king states he was heading north walking against the traffic shortly before the accident took place a woman in a car also heading north passed first king and then the light blue dodge van the van was looping from one side of the road to the other and the woman told her passenger she hoped that guy in the van doesnt hit him king was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family but was in considerable pain the author was first transported to northern cumberland hospital in bridgton and then flown by helicopter to central maine medical center cmmc in lewiston his injuries—a collapsed right lung multiple fractures of his right leg scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at cmmc until july  his leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator after five operations in ten days and physical therapy king resumed work on on writing in july though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about forty minutes before the pain became unbearable kings lawyer and two others purchased smiths van for  reportedly to prevent it from appearing on ebay the van was later crushed at a junkyard much to kings disappointment as he fantasized about smashing it up king later mentioned during an interview with fresh airs terry gross that he wanted the vehicle destroyed at a charity event in which individuals would donate money for an opportunity to smash it with a sledgehammer during this time tabitha king was inspired to redesign his studio king visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away what he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died providing a seed for his novel liseys story  in  king announced he would stop writing apparently motivated in part by frustration with his injuries which had made sitting uncomfortable and reduced his stamina he has since resumed writing but states on his website im writing but im writing at a much slower pace than previously and i think that if i come up with something really really good i would be perfectly willing to publish it because that still feels like the final act of the creative process publishing it so people can read it and you can get feedback and people can talk about it with each other and with you the writer but the force of my invention has slowed down a lot over the years and thats as it should be political activism in april  king spoke out against hb  a bill pending in the massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of  although king stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby he criticized the proposed law which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture and to act as surrogate parents to others children which he asserted is usually disastrous and undemocratic he also saw the law as inconsistent as it would forbid a yearold legally able to see hostel part ii from buying or renting grand theft auto san andreas which is violent but less graphic while conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games king also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society which would not be lessened by such a law and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games king argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor and the easy availability of guns which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence regarding video games he later stated that he enjoys playing light gun shooter arcade games such as time crisis a controversy emerged on may   when noel sheppard posted a clip of king at a library of congress reading event on the website newsbusters king talking to highschool students had said if you can read you can walk into a job later on if you dont then youve got the army iraq i dont know something like that the comment was described by the blog as another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military and likened to john kerrys similar remark from  king responded later that day saying that a rightwingblog would impugn my patriotism because i said children should learn to read and could get better jobs by doing so is beneath contempti live in a national guard town and i support our troops but i dont support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise king again defended his comment in an interview with the bangor daily news on may  saying im not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school so they have more options those that dont agree with what im saying im not going to change their minds king later expressed regret for the remark saying that he misspoke he characterized the comment as originating from a brain cramp and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in saying that during the vietnam war serving in the military was a great career for some and for others a sacrifice of two years of ones life king added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism kings website states that he is a supporter of the democratic party during the  presidential election king voiced his support for democratic candidate barack obama king was quoted as calling conservative commentator glenn beck satans mentally challenged younger brother on march   king spoke at a political rally in sarasota aimed against governor rick scott rfl voicing his opposition to the tea party movement on april   king published an article in the daily beast calling for rich americans including himself to pay more taxes

suggesting in a weekly radio address on march   that king avoided paying maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year the statement was later corrected by the governors office but no apology was issued king said lepage was full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green  and demanded that lepage man up and apologize lepage declined to apologize to king stating i never said stephen king did not pay income taxes what i said was stephen kings not in maine right now thats what i said  lepage further told king that he should make me the villain of your next book and i won’t charge you royalties the attention garnered by the lepage criticism has led to efforts to encourage king to run for governor of maine in  bangor city councilor joe baldacci posted on his facebook page that he was starting a draft stephen king effort and democratic state rep diane russell launched a petition drive to encourage king to run his spokeswoman posted to baldaccis facebook comment that he

the man in black in an alternatereality universe that is a cross between j r r tolkiens middleearth and the american wild west as depicted by clint eastwood and sergio leone in their spaghetti westerns the first of these stories the dark tower the gunslinger was initially published in five installments by the magazine of fantasy  science fiction under the editorship of edward l ferman from  to  the gunslinger was continued as an eightbook epic series called the dark tower which books king wrote and published infrequently over four decades in  the fantasy smallpress donald m grant known for publishing the entire canon of robert e howard printed these stories for the first time together in hardcover form with color and blackandwhite illustrations by fantasy artist michael whelan as the gunslinger each chapter was named for the story previously published in magazine form king dedicated the hardcover edition to his editor at fsf ed ferman who took a chance on these stories the original print run was only  copies which was by this time a comparatively low run for a first printing of a king novel in hardcover his  novel firestarter had an initial print run in trade hardcover of  copies and his  novel christine had a trade hardcover print run of  copies both by the much larger publisher viking the gunslingers initial release was not highly publicized and only specialty sciencefiction and related bookstores carried it on their shelves the book was generally unavailable in the larger chain stores except by special order rumors spread among avid fans that there was a king book out that few readers knew about let alone had actually read when the initial  copies sold out grant printed another  copies in  but these runs were still far short of the growing demand among fans for this book both the first and second printings of the gunslinger garner premium prices on the collectible book market notably among avid readers and collectors of stephen king horror literature fantasy literature and american western literature and fans of michael whelans artworkcitation needed in  king released the second installment the dark tower ii the drawing of the three in which roland draws three people from thcentury united states into his world through magical doors grant published the drawing of the three with illustrations by phil hale in a slightly larger run of  copies which was still well below kings typical initial hardcover print run of a new book it published in  had an initial print run of  copies kings largest to dateclarification needed king had believed that the dark tower books would be of interest to only a select group of his fans and he had resisted releasing it on a larger scale finally in the late s bowing to pressure from his publishers and fans who were searching for the books at this point fewer than  of his millions of readers would have been able to own any of the dark tower books king agreed to release the gunslinger and all subsequent dark tower books in trade paperback and massmarket formatscitation needed in the early s king revised the original book the gunslinger because he felt the voice and imagery of the original stories of the late s did not seem to fit the voice of the final installment of  king felt the style of the work had markedly changed during the intervening  years the revised version was published in  by his former hardcover publisher viking grant published its hardcover limited edition of the revised version of the gunslinger along with a prequel story set in the dark tower world called the little sisters of eluria originally published in  in the collection legends short novels by the masters of modern fantasy in  adaptations in october  king signed a deal with marvel comics to publish a sevenissue limited series spinoff of the series called the gunslinger born the series which focuses on a young roland deschain was plotted by robin furth with dialogue by peter david and illustrated by eisner awardwinning artist jae lee the first issue was published on february   and king david lee and marvel editorinchief joe quesada appeared at a midnight signing at a times square new york comic book store to promote it the work had sold over  copies by march  the success of the gunslinger born led to an ongoing miniseries published by marvel with furth and david continuing to collaborate featuring both adapted material from the dark tower books and new material approved by king it also led to a second series of king adaptations in the same format serializing the events of the stand although the hollywood reporter announced in february  that plans were underway for lost cocreator j j abrams to do an adaptation of kings epic dark tower series abrams stated in a november  interview with mtv that he would not be adapting the series akiva goldsman ron howard nikolaj arcel and brian grazer produced a feature film based on the dark tower series with nikolaj arcel as the director while howard slated as the producer with an upcoming release date of july   pseudonyms main article richard bachman in the late s and early s king published a handful of short novels—rage  the long walk  roadwork  the running man  and thinner —under the pseudonym richard bachman the idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident an alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year he picked up the name from the hard rock band bachmanturner overdrive of which he is a fan richard bachman was exposed as kings pseudonym by a persistent washington dc bookstore clerk steve brown who noticed similarities between the works and later located publishers records at the library of congress that named king as the author of one of bachmans novels this led to a press release heralding bachmans death—supposedly from cancer of the pseudonym king dedicated his  book the dark half about a pseudonym turning on a writer to the deceased richard bachman and in  when the stephen king novel desperation was released the companion novel the regulators carried the bachman byline in  during a press conference in london king declared that he had discovered another bachman novel titled blaze it was published on june   in fact the original manuscript had been

pseudonym digital era stephen king at the harvard book store june   in  king published online a serialized horror novel the plant at first the public presumed that king had abandoned the project

king further dee dee ramone wrote the song pet sematary in kings basement after king handed him a copy of the novel the song was eventually featured as the title song for the pet sematary  film and

overdrive king has also stated that he likes heavy metal and has named bands like anthrax judas priest and metallica as amongst his favourites to write to in  the band blue öyster cult recorded an

ghost brothers of darkland county  with musician john mellencamp visual art king produced an artists book with designer barbara kruger my pretty pony  published in a limited edition of  by the library fellows of the whitney museum of american art alfred a knopf later released it in a general trade edition in  analysis writing style kings formula for learning to write well is read and write four to six hours a day if you cannot find the time for that you cant expect to become a good writer he sets out each day with a quota of  words and will not stop writing until it is met he also has a simple definition for talent in writing if you wrote something for which someone sent you a check if you cashed the check and it didnt bounce and if you then paid the light bill with the money i consider you talented shortly after his accident king wrote the first draft of the book dreamcatcher with a notebook and a waterman fountain pen which he called the worlds finest word processor when asked why he writes king responds the answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else i was made to do i was made to write stories and i love to write stories thats why i do it i really cant imagine doing anything else and i cant imagine not doing what i do he is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question why do you assume i have a choice king usually begins the story creation process by imagining a what if scenario such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in colorado king often uses authors as characters or includes mention of fictional books in his stories novellas and novels such as paul sheldon who is the main character in misery adult bill denbrough in it ben mears in salems lot and jack torrance in the shining he has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including himself as a character in the dark tower series from wolves of the calla onwards see also list of fictional books in the works of stephen king for a complete list in september  it was announced he would serve as a writer for fangoria influences king has called richard matheson the author who influenced me most as a writer in a current edition of mathesons the shrinking man king is quoted a horror story if there ever was onea great adventure story—it is certainly one of that select handful that i have given to people envying them the experience of the first reading ray bradbury is another influence with king himself stating without ray bradbury there is no stephen king king refers to h p lovecraft several times in danse macabre gramma a short story made into a film in the s anthology horror show the new twilight zone mentions lovecrafts notorious fictional creation necronomicon also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein i know what you need from the  collection night shift and salems lot also mention the tome despite this in on writing king is critical of lovecrafts dialoguewriting skills using passages from the colour out of space as particularly poor examples– there are also several examples of kings referring to lovecraftian characters and settings in his work such as nyarlathotep and yogsothoth king acknowledges the influence of bram stoker particularly on his novel salems lot which he envisioned as a retelling of dracula its related short story jerusalems lot is reminiscent of stokers the lair of the white wormcitation needed he also gives joseph payne brennan credit for being one of his inspirations joseph payne brennan is one of the most effective writers in the horror genre and he is certainly one of the writers i have patterned my own career upon one of the writers whom i studied and with whom i kept school king has also referenced author shirley jackson salems lot opens with a quotation from jacksons the haunting of hill house and a character in wolves of the calla references the jackson book we have always lived in the castle kings book  mentions the jackson story the summer people king is a fan of john d macdonald and dedicated the novella sun dog to macdonald saying i miss you old friend for his part macdonald wrote an admiring preface to night shift and even had his famous character travis mcgee reading cujo in one of the last mcgee novels and pet sematary in the last mcgee novel the lonely silver rain in  kings philtrum press published don robertsons novel the ideal genuine man in his forenote to the novel king wrote don robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to become a novelist the other two being richard matheson and john d macdonald robert a heinleins book the door into summer is repeatedly mentioned in kings wolves of the calla as are several other works wolves of the calla is the king work in which the dark tower begins to follow a metafictional path in an interview with king published in the usa weekend in march  the author stated people look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource i do elmore leonard every day i wake up and—not to be morbid or anything although morbid is my life to a degree—dont see his obituary in the paper i think to myself great hes probably working somewhere hes gonna produce another book and ill have another book to read because when hes gone theres nobody else king partly dedicated his book cell to film director george romero and wrote an essay for the elite dvd version of night of the living dead his favorite books are in order the golden argosy adventures of huckleberry finn the satanic verses mcteague lord of the flies bleak house nineteen eightyfour the raj quartet light in august and blood meridian critical response although critical reaction to kings work has been mostly positive he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers science fiction editors john clute and peter nichols offer a largely favorable appraisal of king noting his pungent prose sharp ear for dialogue disarmingly laidback frank style along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty especially to children all of which rank him among the more distinguished popular writers in his book the philosophy of horror  noël carroll discusses kings work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction analyzing both the narrative structure of kings fiction and kings nonfiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing carroll writes that for king the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and therefore affirmed in his analysis of post–world war ii horror fiction the modern weird tale  critic s t joshi devotes a chapter to kings work joshi argues that kings bestknown works his supernatural novels are his worst describing them as mostly bloated illogical maudlin and prone to deus ex machina endings despite these criticisms joshi argues that since geralds game  king has been tempering the worst of his writing faults producing books that are leaner more believable and generally better written joshi suggests that kings strengths as a writer include the accessible everyman quality of his prose and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence joshi cites two early nonsupernatural novels—rage  and the running man —as kings best suggesting both are riveting and wellconstructed suspense thrillers with believable characters in  king won an o henry award for his short story the man in the black suit in his short story collection a century of great suspense stories editor jeffery deaver noted that king singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up while there were many good bestselling writers before him king more than anybody since john d macdonald brought reality to genre novels he has often remarked that salems lot was peyton place meets dracula and so it was the rich characterization the careful and caring social eye the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again before king many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious bluepenciled by their editors ‘stuff like that gets in the way of the story they were told well its stuff like that that has made king so popular and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing he is a master of masters in  king was honored by the national book awards with a lifetime achievement award the medal of distinguished contribution to american letters some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award richard snyder the former ceo of simon  schuster described kings work as nonliterature and critic harold bloom denounced the choice the decision to give the national book foundations annual award for distinguished contribution to stephen king is extraordinary another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life ive described king in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls but perhaps even that is too kind he shares nothing with edgar allan poe what he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentencebysentence paragraphbyparagraph bookbybook basis however others came to kings defense such as writer orson scott card who responded let me assure you that kings work most definitely is literature because it was written to be published and is read with admiration what snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academicliterary elite king himself later stated harold bloom never pissed me off because there are critics out there and hes one of them who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of intellectual prowess he might be able to say that mark twain is a great writer but its impossible for him to say that theres a direct line of descent from say nathaniel hawthorne to jim thompson because he doesnt read guys like thompson he just thinks i never read him but i know hes terrible in roger eberts review of the  movie secret window he stated a lot of people were outraged that king was honored at the national book awards as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously but after finding that his book on writing had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since strunk and whites the elements of style i have gotten over my own snobbery in  kings book on writing was ranked st on entertainment weekly list of the new classics the  best reads from  to  appearances and adaptations in other

based on kings novella the colorado kid car accident and after effects on june   at about  pm king was walking on the shoulder of maine state route  in lovell maine driver bryan edwin smith distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan struck king who landed in a depression in the ground about  feet  meters from the pavement of route  according to oxford county sheriff deputy matt baker king was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding reckless or drinking in his book on writing king states he was heading north walking against the traffic shortly before the accident took place a woman in a car also heading north passed first king and then the light blue dodge van the van was looping from one side of the road to the other and the woman told her passenger she hoped that guy in the van doesnt hit him king was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family but was in considerable pain the author was first transported to northern cumberland hospital in bridgton and then flown by helicopter to central maine medical center cmmc in lewiston his injuries—a collapsed right lung multiple fractures of his right leg scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at cmmc until july  his leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator after five operations in ten days and physical therapy king resumed work on on writing in july though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about forty minutes before the pain became unbearable kings lawyer and two others purchased smiths van for  reportedly to prevent it from appearing on ebay the van was later crushed at a junkyard much to kings disappointment as he fantasized about smashing it up king later mentioned during an interview with fresh airs terry gross that he wanted the vehicle destroyed at a charity event in which individuals would donate money for an opportunity to smash it with a sledgehammer during this time tabitha king was inspired to redesign his studio king visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away what he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died providing a seed for his novel liseys story  in  king announced he would stop writing apparently motivated in part by frustration with his injuries which had made sitting uncomfortable and reduced his stamina he has since resumed writing but states on his website im writing but im writing at a much slower pace than previously and i think that if i come up with something really really good i would be perfectly willing to publish it because that still feels like the final act of the creative process publishing it so people can read it and you can get feedback and people can talk about it with each other and with you the writer but the force of my invention has slowed down a lot over the years and thats as it should be political activism in april  king spoke out against hb  a bill pending in the massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of  although king stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby he criticized the proposed law which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture and to act as surrogate parents to others children which he asserted is usually disastrous and undemocratic he also saw the law as inconsistent as it would forbid a yearold legally able to see hostel part ii from buying or renting grand theft auto san andreas which is violent but less graphic while conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games king also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society which would not be lessened by such a law and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games king argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor and the easy availability of guns which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence regarding video games he later stated that he enjoys playing light gun shooter arcade games such as time crisis a controversy emerged on may   when noel sheppard posted a clip of king at a library of congress reading event on the website newsbusters king talking to highschool students had said if you can read you can walk into a job later on if you dont then youve got the army iraq i dont know something like that the comment was described by the blog as another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military and likened to john kerrys similar remark from  king responded later that day saying that a rightwingblog would impugn my patriotism because i said children should learn to read and could get better jobs by doing so is beneath contempti live in a national guard town and i support our troops but i dont support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise king again defended his comment in an interview with the bangor daily news on may  saying im not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school so they have more options those that dont agree with what im saying im not going to change their minds king later expressed regret for the remark saying that he misspoke he characterized the comment as originating from a brain cramp and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in saying that during the vietnam war serving in the military was a great career for some and for others a sacrifice of two years of ones life king added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism kings website states that he is a supporter of the democratic party during the  presidential election king voiced his support for democratic candidate barack obama king was quoted as calling conservative commentator glenn beck satans mentally challenged younger brother on march   king spoke at a political rally in sarasota aimed against governor rick scott rfl voicing his opposition to the tea party movement on april   king published an article in the daily beast calling for rich americans including himself to pay more taxes

temperament of a yearold maine politics king endorsed shenna bellows in the  us senate election for the seat currently held by republican susan collins king is a public critic of paul lepage the republican governor of maine and has referred to lepage as one of the three stooges along with florida governor rick scott and wisconsin governor scott walker he was critical of lepage for incorrectly suggesting in a weekly radio address on march   that king avoided paying maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year the statement was later corrected by the governors office but no apology was issued king said lepage was full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green  and demanded that lepage man up and apologize lepage declined to apologize to king stating i never said stephen king did not pay income taxes what i said was stephen kings not in maine right now thats what i said  lepage further told king that he should make me the villain of your next book and i won’t charge you royalties the attention garnered by the lepage criticism has led to efforts to encourage king to run for governor of maine in  bangor city councilor joe baldacci posted on his facebook page that he was starting a draft stephen king effort and democratic state rep diane russell launched a petition drive to encourage king to run his spokeswoman posted to baldaccis facebook comment that he would likely decline to run and king himself stated he would not run or serve on march  while still criticizing what he said was the laziness that made him mad about not checking his tax payments and that lepage had a problem finding a comfortable pair of bigboy pants king sent a tweet on june   stating that lepage is a terrible embarrassment to the state i live in and love if he wont govern he should resign he later clarified that he was not calling on lepage to resign but to go to work or go back home on august   king sent another tweet about lepage calling him a bigot a homophobe and a

the man in black in an alternatereality universe that is a cross between j r r tolkiens middleearth and the american wild west as depicted by clint eastwood and sergio leone in their spaghetti westerns the first of these stories the dark tower the gunslinger was initially published in five installments by the magazine of fantasy  science fiction under the editorship of edward l ferman from  to  the gunslinger was continued as an eightbook epic series called the dark tower which books king wrote and published infrequently over four decades in  the fantasy smallpress donald m grant known for publishing the entire canon of robert e howard printed these stories for the first time together in hardcover form with color and blackandwhite illustrations by fantasy artist michael whelan as the gunslinger each chapter was named for the story previously published in magazine form king dedicated the hardcover edition to his editor at fsf ed ferman who took a chance on these stories the original print run was only  copies which was by this time a comparatively low run for a first printing of a king novel in hardcover his  novel firestarter had an initial print run in trade hardcover of  copies and his  novel christine had a trade hardcover print run of  copies both by the much larger publisher viking the gunslingers initial release was not highly publicized and only specialty sciencefiction and related bookstores carried it on their shelves the book was generally unavailable in the larger chain stores except by special order rumors spread among avid fans that there was a king book out that few readers knew about let alone had actually read when the initial  copies sold out grant printed another  copies in  but these runs were still far short of the growing demand among fans for this book both the first and second printings of the gunslinger garner premium prices on the collectible book market notably among avid readers and collectors of stephen king horror literature fantasy literature and american western literature and fans of michael whelans artworkcitation needed in  king released the second installment the dark tower ii the drawing of the three in which roland draws three people from thcentury united states into his world through magical doors grant published the drawing of the three with illustrations by phil hale in a slightly larger run of  copies which was still well below kings typical initial hardcover print run of a new book it published in  had an initial print run of  copies kings largest to dateclarification needed king had believed that the dark tower books would be of interest to only a select group of his fans and he had resisted releasing it on a larger scale finally in the late s bowing to pressure from his publishers and fans who were searching for the books at this point fewer than  of his millions of readers would have been able to own any of the dark tower books king agreed to release the gunslinger and all subsequent dark tower books in trade paperback and massmarket formatscitation needed in the early s king revised the original book the gunslinger because he felt the voice and imagery of the original stories of the late s did not seem to fit the voice of the final installment of  king felt the style of the work had markedly changed during the intervening  years the revised version was published in  by his former hardcover publisher viking grant published its hardcover limited edition of the revised version of the gunslinger along with a prequel story set in the dark tower world called the little sisters of eluria originally published in  in the collection legends short novels by the masters of modern fantasy in  adaptations in october  king signed a deal with marvel comics to publish a sevenissue limited series spinoff of the series called the gunslinger born the series which focuses on a young roland deschain was plotted by robin furth with dialogue by peter david and illustrated by eisner awardwinning artist jae lee the first issue was published on february   and king david lee and marvel editorinchief joe quesada appeared at a midnight signing at a times square new york comic book store to promote it the work had sold over  copies by march  the success of the gunslinger born led to an ongoing miniseries published by marvel with furth and david continuing to collaborate featuring both adapted material from the dark tower books and new material approved by king it also led to a second series of king adaptations in the same format serializing the events of the stand although the hollywood reporter announced in february  that plans were underway for lost cocreator j j abrams to do an adaptation of kings epic dark tower series abrams stated in a november

the long walk  roadwork  the running man  and thinner —under the pseudonym richard bachman the idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident an alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year he picked up the name from the hard rock band bachmanturner overdrive of which he is a fan richard bachman was exposed as kings pseudonym by a persistent washington dc bookstore clerk steve brown who noticed similarities between the works and later located publishers records at the library of congress that named king as the author of one of bachmans novels this led to a press release heralding bachmans death—supposedly from cancer of the pseudonym king dedicated

fellows of the whitney museum of american art alfred a knopf later released it in a general trade edition in  analysis writing style kings formula for learning to write well is read and write four to six hours a day if you cannot find the time for that you cant expect to become a good writer he sets out each day with a quota of  words and will not stop writing until it is met he also has a simple definition for talent in writing if you wrote something for which someone sent you a check if you cashed the check and it didnt bounce and if you then paid the light bill with the money i consider you talented shortly after his accident king wrote the first draft of the book dreamcatcher with a notebook and a waterman fountain pen which he called the worlds finest word processor when asked why he writes king responds the answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else i was made to do i was made to write stories and i love to write stories thats why i do it i really cant imagine doing anything else and i cant imagine not doing what i do he is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question why do you assume i have a choice king usually begins the story creation process by imagining a what if scenario such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in colorado king often uses authors as characters or includes mention of fictional books in his stories novellas and novels such as paul sheldon who is the main character in misery adult bill denbrough in it ben mears in salems lot and jack torrance in the shining he has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including himself as a character in the dark tower series from wolves of the calla onwards see also list of fictional books in the works of stephen king for a complete list in september  it was announced he would serve as a writer for fangoria influences king has called richard matheson the author who influenced me most as a writer in a current edition of mathesons the shrinking man king is quoted a horror story if there ever was onea great adventure story—it is certainly one of that select handful that i have given to people envying them the experience of the first reading ray bradbury is another influence with king himself stating without ray bradbury there is no stephen king king refers to h p lovecraft several times in danse macabre gramma a short story made into a film in the s anthology horror show the new twilight zone mentions lovecrafts notorious fictional creation necronomicon also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein i know what you need from the  collection night shift and salems lot also mention the tome despite this in on writing king is critical of lovecrafts dialoguewriting skills using passages from the colour out of space as particularly poor examples– there are also several examples of kings referring to lovecraftian characters and settings in his work such as nyarlathotep and yogsothoth king acknowledges the influence of bram stoker particularly on his novel salems lot which he envisioned as a retelling of dracula its related short story jerusalems lot is reminiscent of stokers the lair of the white wormcitation needed he also gives joseph payne brennan credit for being one of his inspirations joseph payne brennan is one of the most effective writers in the horror genre and he is certainly one of the writers i have patterned my own career upon one of the writers whom i studied and with whom i kept school king has also referenced author shirley jackson salems lot opens with a quotation from jacksons the haunting of hill house and a character in wolves of the calla references the jackson book we have always lived in the castle kings book  mentions the jackson story the summer people king is a fan of john d macdonald and dedicated the novella sun dog to macdonald saying i miss you old friend for his part macdonald wrote an admiring preface to night shift and even had his famous character travis mcgee reading cujo in one of the last mcgee novels and pet sematary in the last mcgee novel the lonely silver rain in  kings philtrum press published don robertsons novel the ideal genuine man in his forenote to the novel king wrote don robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to become a novelist the other two being richard matheson and john d macdonald robert a heinleins book the door into summer is repeatedly mentioned in kings wolves of the calla as are several other works wolves of the calla is the king work in which the dark tower begins to follow a metafictional path in an interview with king published in the usa weekend in march  the author stated people look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource i do elmore leonard every day i wake up and—not to be morbid or anything although morbid is my life to a degree—dont see his obituary in the paper i think to myself great hes probably working somewhere hes gonna produce another book and ill have another book to read because when hes gone theres nobody else king partly dedicated his book cell to film director george romero and wrote an essay for the elite dvd version of night of the living dead his favorite books are in order the golden argosy adventures of huckleberry finn the satanic verses mcteague lord of the flies bleak house nineteen eightyfour the raj quartet light in august and blood meridian critical response although critical reaction to kings work has been mostly positive he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers science fiction editors john clute and peter nichols offer a largely favorable appraisal of king noting his pungent prose sharp ear for dialogue disarmingly laidback frank style along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty especially to children all of which rank him among the more distinguished popular writers in his book the philosophy of horror  noël carroll discusses kings work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction analyzing both the narrative structure of kings fiction and kings nonfiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing carroll writes that for king the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and therefore affirmed in his analysis of post–world war ii horror fiction the modern weird tale  critic s t joshi devotes a chapter to kings work joshi argues that kings bestknown works his supernatural novels are his worst describing them as mostly bloated illogical maudlin and prone to deus ex machina endings despite these criticisms joshi argues that since geralds game  king has been tempering the worst of his writing faults producing books that are leaner more believable and generally better written joshi suggests that kings strengths as a writer include the accessible everyman quality of his prose and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence joshi cites two early nonsupernatural novels—rage  and the running man —as kings best suggesting both are riveting and wellconstructed suspense thrillers with believable characters in  king won an o henry award for his short story the man in the black suit in his short story collection a century of great suspense stories editor jeffery deaver noted that king singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up while there were many good bestselling writers before him king more than anybody since john d macdonald brought reality to genre novels he has often remarked that salems lot was peyton place meets dracula and so it was the rich characterization the careful and caring social eye the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again before king many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious bluepenciled by their editors ‘stuff like that gets in the way of the story they were told well its stuff like that that has made king so popular and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing he is a master of masters in  king was honored by the national book awards with a lifetime achievement award the medal of distinguished contribution to american letters some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award richard snyder the former ceo of simon  schuster described kings work as nonliterature and critic harold bloom denounced the choice the decision to give the national book foundations annual award for distinguished contribution to stephen king is extraordinary another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life ive described king in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls but perhaps even that is too kind he shares nothing with edgar allan poe what he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentencebysentence paragraphbyparagraph bookbybook basis however others came to kings defense such as writer orson scott card who responded let me assure you that kings work most definitely is literature because it was written to be published and is read with admiration what snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academicliterary elite king himself later stated harold bloom never pissed me off because there are critics out there and hes one of them who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of intellectual prowess he might be able to say that mark twain is a great writer but its impossible for him to say that theres a direct line of descent from say nathaniel hawthorne to jim thompson because he doesnt read guys like thompson he just thinks i never read him but i know hes terrible in roger eberts review of the  movie secret window he stated a lot of people were outraged that king was honored at the national book awards as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously but after finding that his book on writing had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since strunk and whites the elements of style i have gotten over my own snobbery in  kings book on writing was ranked st on entertainment weekly list of the new classics the  best reads from  to  appearances and adaptations in other

by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan struck king who landed in a depression in the ground about  feet  meters from the pavement of route  according to oxford county sheriff deputy matt baker king was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding reckless or drinking in his book on writing king states he was heading north walking against the traffic shortly before the accident took place a woman in a car also heading north passed first king and then the light blue dodge van the van was looping from one side of the road to the other and the woman told her passenger she hoped that guy in the van doesnt hit him king was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family but was in considerable pain the author was first transported to northern cumberland hospital in bridgton and then flown by helicopter to central maine medical center cmmc in lewiston his injuries—a collapsed right lung multiple fractures of his right leg scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at cmmc until july  his leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator after five operations in ten days and physical therapy king resumed work on on writing in july though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about forty minutes before the pain became unbearable kings lawyer and two others purchased smiths van for  reportedly to prevent it from appearing on ebay the van was later crushed at a junkyard much to kings disappointment as he fantasized about smashing it up king later mentioned during an interview with fresh airs terry gross that he wanted the vehicle destroyed at a charity event in which individuals would donate money for an opportunity to smash it with a sledgehammer during this time tabitha king was inspired to redesign his studio king visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away what he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died providing a seed for his novel liseys story  in  king announced he would stop writing apparently motivated in part by frustration with his injuries which had made sitting uncomfortable and reduced his stamina he has since resumed writing but states on his website im writing but im writing at a much slower pace than previously and i think that if i come up with something really really good i would be perfectly willing to publish it because that still feels like the final act of the creative process publishing it so people can read it and you can get feedback and people can talk about it with each other and with you the writer but the force of my invention has slowed down a lot over the years and thats as it should be political activism in april  king spoke out against hb  a bill pending in the massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of  although king stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby he criticized the proposed law which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture and to act as surrogate parents to others children which he asserted is usually disastrous and undemocratic he also saw the law as inconsistent as it would forbid a yearold legally able to see hostel part ii from buying or renting grand theft auto san andreas which is violent but less graphic while conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games king also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society which would not be lessened by such a law and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games king argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor and the easy availability of guns which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence regarding video games he later stated that he enjoys playing light gun shooter arcade games such as time crisis a controversy emerged on may   when noel sheppard posted a clip of king at a library of congress reading event on the website newsbusters king talking to highschool students had said if you can read you can walk into a job later on if you dont then youve got the army iraq i dont know something like that the comment was described by the blog as another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military and likened to john kerrys similar remark from  king responded later that day saying that a rightwingblog would impugn my patriotism because i said children should learn to read and could get better jobs by doing so is beneath contempti live in a national guard town and i support our troops but i dont support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise king again defended his comment in an interview with the bangor daily news on may  saying im not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school so they have more options those that dont agree with what im saying im not going to change their minds king later expressed regret for the remark saying that he misspoke he characterized the comment as originating from a brain cramp and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in saying that during the vietnam war serving in the military was a great career for some and for others a sacrifice of two years of ones life king added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism kings website states that he is a supporter of the democratic party during the  presidential election king voiced his support for

stephen king did not pay income taxes what i said was stephen kings not in maine right now thats what i said  lepage further told king that he should make me the villain of your next book and i won’t

that he was starting a draft stephen king effort and democratic state rep diane russell launched a petition drive to encourage king to run his spokeswoman posted to baldaccis facebook comment that he
