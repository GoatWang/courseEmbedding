wa philosophy winemaking philosophy current release past releases vineyard sources where to find our wines short version don’t mess up what the vineyards give us and keep the process interesting and lively slightly longer version too many people try to make wine into much more than it is and it ends up coming across as an intimidating and elitist pursuit   our goal is to go in the other direction  keep it simple and make it fun at the end of the day we’re talking about squished grapes  but it’s the process the grapes follow from vineyard to bottle that is most important  to start we are blessed to have partnerships with the greatest growers in washington state’s columbia valley and columbia gorge avas  it’s these relationships that give us the best possible cabernet sauvignon syrah petit verdot and pinot gris  we’re also learning how incredible oregon’s willamette valley is for our pinot blanc dominant blend meadow in the winery we treat the grapes with the attention and respect they deserve the minute they arrive  once the wines successfully complete fermentation we make it our top priority to know what is happening in each and every barrel  this allows us to craft world class singularly distinctive consistent wines for you to enjoy bottom line we’re having a great time making delicious wines   ross andrew winery all rights reserved  general information    site
