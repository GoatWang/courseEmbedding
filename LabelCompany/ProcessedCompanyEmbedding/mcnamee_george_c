acquaintance of stanley hale barbara was a wonderful mentor and role model for me as i i once asked mrs dudley how she carried on through all of linda knopp dan dardis george and giles your mother left us with so susan arbit barbara mcnamee dudley has clearly contributed tremendous sandy sohcot the guest book is expired restore the guest book dudley barbara mcnamee cooley albany rensselaervillecommunity leader and lifelong capital district resident barbara cooley mcnamee dudley died peacefully saturday at the age of  at her home in rensselaerville the village whose character traditions and institutions she had helped define for over  years the cause of death was a brain tumor which became apparent suddenly in midseptember following spells of dizziness since then she hosted what was a nearly continuous house party with dinners often seating a dozen or more at table as she gathered her family and friends to share in the celebration of her life usually people wait until some one dies to hold the wake but i want to go to mine she said on several occasions so im having it right now dudleys life was one of continual enterprise and reinvention over the course of her long life she was a journalist a political activist a secondhand and rare book dealer a university trustee an investment banker and in the final decades of her life a leading citizen of rensselaerville devoting herself to the practical and personal welfare of the village and those who live there still it was her family that was the true center of her life she was married and widowed twice first in  to daniel vincent mcnamee jr a lawyer and president of the first albany corporation who died in  and second in  to architect george austin dudley who died in  she and dan mcnamee had four sons and two daughters one of whom died as a small child however that was just the beginning in addition to her own children she and dan mcnamee also helped raise three nieces and after her marriage to george dudley his four children and their families also became enfolded into the family circle dan mcnamee once commented that managing their large household was equivalent to running a small business which may have been an understatement dudley was born on august   the day the th amendment establishing the womens right to vote took effect she felt this coincidence as providential a graduate of the albany academy for girls and bryn mawr college she was a life long feminist and particularly in her later years became a mentor to many younger women offering a generous ear and nononsense advice many describe as pivotal in their lives a number were also part of her womens tennis circle nearly all decades younger who struggled to match her energy and remained mystified that she could still outsmart them at the net the first female copy boy on the albany times union dudley became a journalist in washington dc during world war ii covering developments in the rapidly changing aeronautics industry however like many women she was forced to give up her job to a returning gi moving back to albany she became a coordinator of the presidential campaigns of adlai e stevenson in both  and  a founder of the world affairs council and active in the league of women voters in the s she became the first woman elder of the first presbyterian church in albany joining rev robert c lamar on the civil rights march on washington in  she also launched an annual secondhand book sale to raise money for scholarships for bryn mawr college which soon evolved into a permanent shop that thrived into the new millennium along the way she became a licensed appraiser of rare books and an acknowledged expert on paper and bindings following the death of dan mcnamee she joined first albany corporation passing three new york stock exchange licensing exams within  months and serving as an active chairman of the board until her retirement at the age of  also a director of fleet bank she was one of only four women in america serving as senior executives of a new york stock exchange member firm her youngest son giles mcnamee joined her for the prep classes and worried she would be unnerved by some of the biz slang that tended to be a tad course spreads and straddles no problem he remembered she didnt bat an eyelash after the heartbreaking early death of dan mcnamee from cancer her remarriage was yet another reinvention and what she described as a true love match with george dudley she traveled widely to europe the middle east and the orient donning a burka in kuwait and a bamboo construction helmet in shanghai with all the architectural wonders she remembers being appalled by the restrictions on women which in saudi arabia required an original copy of their marriage license to share a room and excluded her from the hotel swimming pool together barbara and george dudley planned additions and improvements to hickory hill the farm she had inherited from her parents george and myra cooley and worked to get funding for badlyneeded repairs to the village water system and persuade the nys department of transportation to build a graceful new bridge across the ten mile creek in keeping with the setting perhaps closest to her heart was the presbyterian church which had been at the center of her summer life in the village since they moved there in  with a strong intellectual tradition ministers used the rensselaerville pulpit as a forum for ideas and over time barbara dudley took over responsibility for filling the roster of extraordinary visiting preachers each summer she used the themes and even the choices  that included blacks women gays catholics jews and more recently muslim theologians  as an opportunity to push for social change in the last year of her life she and her childhood friend time magazine researcher nancy chase undertook the challenge of writing a history of the rensselaerville presbyterian church whose congregation dates back to  finding rich previously untapped sources that grew into a fascinating and detailed portrait with an iconic role in the life of a small american town a draft of the manuscript was completed in the last week of her life edited and bound and put in her hand on the day she died now i can go she told a friend everything is moving along as it should calling hours will
