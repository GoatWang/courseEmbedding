jets for fsx pd hector alejandro rodriguez de alba nice add on very flyable model i think that something to improve is to add information about the flaps deployed acccording the approach speed in the owner´s manual at night there is no way to turn off of dimm the cockpit lights the engines sound need to be more powerful good job about the call the gorund serivcesi like it so much i recommend this package tropicalsim  antigua  tapa fs nadeem zabaneh great scenery accurate detail and nice scenery features i just wish if this version has more surrounding features such as roads and cars  general buildings around the airport area to add a real life feeling nevertheless superb work and thanks to the tropicalsim team for still supporting fs much appreciated rex  soft clouds fsx pd gabriel castro excellent addon quality at a very good price   compatible with pdv afsdesign  airbus a pd franklyn salomons i have purchased my share of simlite type aircraft and found them rather enjoyable for what theyre worth when i saw the afs a released for pd i thought why not now the v release which youll see on youtube is really old and looks far from an a but the v is improved and wanting an a with a representative vc in prepard  i have the freeware fsp version but the aliased a vc bugged me i dove in to take one for the team when first released it was listed as v ready but this was quickly removed i thought it was probably gauges but i still have v so no biggie install away installed in v as well in v it loads at my selected airport but no button in the vc works bring up the d panels they work but nothing in the d vc responds not a good start i looked in the sim objects panel folder and the gauges are all xml files so this should not be an issue unless i loaded v now it does not officially support v but lets be honest the default fsx aircraft and many fsx native freeware port over just fine as long as they dont depend on dlls but this a cannot load model in the vehicle selection screen uh oh this begins to confirm my suspicion load it anyway select my scenario loading crash to desktop now a model that claims to be made for pd having these much issues in two different pd version where much older almost  year old fsx models load fine so i pull up model converter x to check and sure enough fs based mdl file did a quick convert sans animations and it loads up in pd v select screen and no crash scenario loads i have to say that in light of this discovery im very dissapointed with this developer i was hoping to get it flying in v with some tweaks and offset the seeming negative views towards afs with an honest recorded flight but no you release a model claiming it is pd specific but its just the same fs based mdl because it seemed to work not even tried to recompile with any pd sdk nope afs design let me give you some advice prepard v is here as well as flight sim world the microsoft esp engine is moving forward in  bit era these past few and upcoming weeks are a crucial time as people who are transitioning are eager for natively produced models and sceneries many small developers like you have updated their products supporting fs to pd v with each installer made with the sims native sdk and check the reviews customers are won over heck even dd added an fsw install option to their scenery ive purchase addons from developers i havent before just because they made that effort and seeing what they did i would by from them again in a heartbeat in closing this item labelled as for pd is outright untrue but you can redeem yourself recompile it with the proper sdk and give that to your existing customers i personally will rate you higher if you pull through you have an opportunity right now to gain favor with the community during the transition to v and fsw other developers have gone in and are reaping the rewards dont get left behind your move binersim  halim perdanakusuma airport wihh  fsx james bristow excellent addition to indonesia fsx  relatively simplistic but very good visuals and performance lionheart  quest kodiak build  fsx pd fs omar capellan i love this aircraft they did a great job it is one of the best ive ever had makes me want to fly one in real life  fsimstudios  calgary international airport cyyc fsx pd marco eckl perfect scenery matching in every detail just to recommend jetstream designs  metznancy lorraine x fsx pd scott harmes a fantastic representation of this airport another great quality scenery from jetstream designs justsim  düsseldorf airport eddl fsx pd philip jensen this scenery is really a let down by the ground textures justsim other sceneries have better ground textures it really is disappointing considering the buildings look great you cannot see it easily from the distance but when taxiing it really shows aerosoft  trondheim vaernes x  fsx pd jason smart this is one of the best and comprehensive in terms of developments and advancements i have seen for instance the animated passengers adds a excellent realism to the overall sim and experience the only negative thing is that the elevation is way off for instance on a downward view it takes you under ground and some gsx integration errors seem apparent when gsx was offloading my aircrafts luggage the luggage containers were in the air and there was no baggage handler or equipment in sight as they were under ground again directly due to this elevation error also it seems for a pretty average airport in terms of size it is pretty framerate hungry i have a decent spec pc and overall setup and i am getting some frame rates on ground of fps with an average aircraft that i have had or dont have any issue in much more graphic challenging airports such as mallorca malaga x etc in terms of size and detailshopefully these will be rectifiedor improved in an update in the very near future otherwise it is an excellent rendition and enjoyable airport and approach your country of residence
