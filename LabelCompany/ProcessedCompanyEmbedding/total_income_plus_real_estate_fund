guides events training jobs awards homenewsarticles and features   tweet tweet bluerock launches total income real estate fund thu    tags  articles and features investment firm bluerock has launched the total income real estate fund a public fund of funds that provides individual investors with an opportunity to invest alongside endowments and pension plans in leading institutional real estate managers otherwise inaccessible to them due to large minimum investment size or other restrictions mercer investment management inc a topranked global investment manager selection specialist will serve as subadvisor on the ti fund under an exclusive longterm agreement with bluerock mercer is a topranked advisor to sovereign wealth funds pension plans banks family offices insurance companies endowments and foundations globally and has over usd trillion in assets under advisement access says dr randy anderson bluerock president and ti portfolio manager is perhaps the most compelling attribute of the fund “ti provides access to a carefullyvetted real estate portfolio whose objective is multistrategy multimanager and multisector” he says “absent ti an individual investor seeking to access to the same managers and investments and build the same portfolio would require a usd  usd million investment with ti an individual can access that investment portfolio for a usd minimum” “additionally ti provides individual investors the ability to invest like large pension and sovereign wealth funds using the ‘endowment model’ popularised by the regularly top performing yale investment office which attempts to capture the premium associated with private assets while providing liquidity to the investor through quarterly redemptions at nav’ says randy anderson ti portfolio manager mercer and bluerock will seek to invest in a select group of institutional funds that meet the primary ti investment criteria stable current income plus capital appreciation low volatility and low correlation to the broader equity markets decisionmaking begins with mercer’s proprietary screening process which incorporates rigorous quantitative and qualitative assessments of fund management teams and their track records in a process not generally available at the individual investor level in addition the partnership with mercer provides an opportunity to invest at a much lower threshold
