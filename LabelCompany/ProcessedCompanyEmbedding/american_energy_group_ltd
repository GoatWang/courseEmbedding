updating delayed stock price operations executive summary american energy group ltd’s portfolio comprises interests in a pakistan producing property and the potential for additional producing interests in two  other pakistan concessions all of which are nonexpense bearing interests providing a combination of early cash flow and longer term value creation opportunities the company’s core assets consist of the following royalties and  convertible working interests in oil and gas leases    royalty in the producing yasin block no  zone iii sindh province pakistan    convertible working interest in zamzama north block no  under exploration zone iii sindh province pakistan    convertible working interest in sanjawi block no  under exploration zone ii baluchistan province pakistan   the convertible working interest in the zamzama north block no  is “carried” ie free of exploration and development costs as to the initial three wells and the convertible working interest in the sanjawi block no  is carried as to the initial two wells  additionally in both the zamzama north and sanjawi blocks the company has the option to convert its  working interest at any time on a well by well basis to a  royalty free of the costs of exploration and development of theparticular well as to which conversion is elected this is an arguably safer alternative to investing in high risk exploration wells  the company’s approach provides investors with a lower risk participation in underexplored oil and gas markets in south asia with a higher transparency and corporate governance better liquidity and easier accessibility at a discount valuation in addition to its emerging markets core assets the company also holds a  royalty interest in certain galveston county texas oil and gas leases in the deep zones greater than  feet together with a right to operate the leases as to wells drilled to depths greater than  feet these leases are held in force by third party production and therefore the leases do not require development of these rights by a certain date this property is not a focus of american energy group and management is exploring the various opportunities to realize value from these deep rights including potential sale the company is continuously exploring new investment opportunities to further diversify its portfolio of energy resources royalty assets
