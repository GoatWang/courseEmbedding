cbncom beating the odds david grew up in a christian home in the small town of clinton missouri as a teen he lived through the racially tense s and recalls attending segregated schools sitting in the balcony of the movies and being barred from the public swimming pool david doesnt harbor any negative feelings about having to endure those days especially since his mother warned him against becoming bitter and resentful i literally lived on the other side of the railroad tracks says david but i learned that division doesnt work though his family had few material possessions david believes he inherited considerable wealth from his parents because they taught him what was important treating people right david recalls homeless people stopping by the house no one was ever turned away he says i saw faith in action david also remembers his mother giving her last dollar to the church i knew it was seed to be sown with the expectation of a harvest says david these principles of sowing and reaping have stayed with him for his entire life david always had a lifelong dream of owning his own business it was a burning desire inside of me he says after college david spent ten years in sales for three fortune  companies as the senior accountant for a major corporation david was awarded salesman of the year and was made a member of the companys hall of fame they presented an ice bucket with his initials engraved inside david looked inside the bucket and realized it was empty this was a defining moment says david i asked myself is this what i want out of life at the time david and his family were living paycheck to paycheck but david had complete faith in god it was clear in my mind that my belief in god coupled with the desire to work hard to serve others meant i was destined to succeed he founded world wide technology wwt in  on a shoestring budget and  employees wwt is the largest blackowned business in the united states and with over  billion in revenues last year wwt is the second blackowned business to ever hit the billiondollar mark they have over  employees and help companies develop systems that create databases of virtually any type that their customers may require for tracking orders platform for ministry while his ecommerce business is thriving david gives credit to the teachings in the bible while starting his business the odds were stacked against him looking back to  it was nothing short of a miracle says david it was a leap of faith david sees his company as his ministry it provides an opportunity for him to apply the lessons in the bible and also serves as a platform on which to serve god by being an ambassador in the business world his pastor dr lynn mims of union memorial united methodist church asked him to start a sunday school class for businesspeople david was concerned about the longterm commitment but wanted to somehow accommodate his pastors request davids wife thelma reminded him what the bible says in luke  from everyone to whom much has been given much will be required so they started the bible study and called it doing business by the book the catalyst for his book doing business by the good book  lessons on success straight from the bible today the class is attended by governors of missouri past and present senators congressman and other dignitaries two of the most important lessons david teaches are the following  good leadership is love i love my employees and show them through my actions he says and  blessed to be a blessing serving others and doing good for others is the bottom line davids hope is that the corporate world picks up his book and that it directs them to the bible this is the milk that gets people excited about the prosperity god has for their lives if it directs them to the word
