trading business by bradley hope and justin baer goldman sachs group inc is ceding most of its ground on the new york stock exchange’s trading floor imc financial markets a dutch highspeed trading firm agreed on wednesday to acquire goldman’s rights to operate as a designated market maker in more than  nyselisted stocks according to scott knudsen imc’s chicagobased head of trading imc will also hire about  floor brokers from the wall street firm the sale marks a retreat for goldman on the nyse floor though it plans to remain a broker there executing trades on behalf of clients goldman originally acquired the trading business as part of its  billion purchase of spear leeds  kellogg lp in  one of the key factors in marketmaking profitability is scale–operating on dozens of exchanges around the world handling significant trading volumes as an electronic marketmaker with a presence on  exchanges around the world imc will be positioned to expand the amount of volume it handles at one of the biggest and moststoried trading venues in the us at the time of goldman’s slk purchase before electronic trading and new rules turned the way stocks are bought and sold on its head marketmakers then called specialists played a more central role in trading terms of the imc purchase weren’t disclosed but people familiar with the deal said the price was under  million the wall street journal reported in april that imc was in talks to acquire the business electronic marketmakers use highspeed connections and advanced computer algorithms to provide liquidity in certain stocks the firms offer “twosided quotes” meaning they are consistently available to buy and sell shares of companies at certain prices they seek to capture the spread between the bids and asks on those stocks tiny profits that can add up to millions of dollars if the firms do enough volume the acquisition will provide a boost to imc’s equities marketmaking business said mr knudsen imc has traditionally been a major player in options marketmaking but has increased its presence in other asset classes over the past years he said “we’ve become a big player in equities but we have room to grow” he said ”this acquisition is part of that” imc is also expecting to take a more public role in discussions about highfrequency trading and market structure mr knudsen said regulators and investigative authorities have opened several probes into trading practices recently and some officials have called for a broader review of how the markets work in light of issues surrounding highspeed trading the new york attorney general has categorized some practices as “insider trading ” arguing that some firms were using loopholes to unfairly gain access to information before ordinary investors the publication on march  of “flash boys” a chronicle of a group of traders who built an alternative exchange designed to level the playing field between “fast” traders and big investors has also energized discussions author michael lewis described the us stock market as being “rigged” in favor of highfrequency traders exchanges and big banks mr knudsen said he was in favor of reducing complexity in the marketplace pointing out that investors didn’t need more than  venues to execute trades ”we support the sec’s datadriven approach to these issues” he said as the markets have come to be dominated by electronic traders since the turn of the century marketmaking has become a major business for highfrequency trading firms other major marketmakers at the new york stock exchange are
