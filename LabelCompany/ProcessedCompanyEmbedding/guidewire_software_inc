writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

most insurance companies are huge it is also important to consider that a relatively small improvement in claims can translate into a significant increase in operating margin now this is not news to most insurers and over the past few years many have made a lot of enhancements in claims processes but there is still room for improvement and one answer is predictive analytics guidewire insight claims analytics can enhance the bottom line in many ways including reducing settlement lags and claims payout automatically assigning adjusters according to priority and skill set and reducing leakage in terms of both expense and indemnity one current customer experiencing this is commercial lines insurer atlas financial holdings in this blog stuart rose market strategy director for

guidewire we had more of an open field it was difficult but the competitive landscape now is less favorable for new entrants entrepreneurs interested in the industry are not generally looking to build a core system but are looking at starting a new style of mga or applying some horizontal technology in iot drones or machine learning and apply it to an insurance problem that’s much more of the
