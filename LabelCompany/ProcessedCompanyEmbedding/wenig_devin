people and with culture people shop on ebay to find incredible value across our vast spectrum of inventory and our updated ebay brand campaign will address consumer misperceptions and bring to light the ebay that we’re building for the future stubhub is well positioned to capitalize on its leadership position as a global event experience marketplace we saw strong growth internationally in q and looking at our genres a good super bowl drove nfl performance with strength also in college sports and theater most of this strong genre performance was offset by lapping significant growth from last year we expect to see lower growth rates through the third quarter based on these tougher comps our classified platform continues to innovate the user experience and grew at double digits again this quarter in the netherlands we launched a new personalized homepage experience powered by our data thats already driving better engagement we also expanded the rollout of inventory integration with ebay and were now beginning to generate meaningful synergy between our ebay and classified platforms exiting q with over  million per week of gmv just through this integration as i mentioned earlier we recently announced the terms of a deal to invest in and partner with flipkart the leading ecommerce player in india i’m very excited about this new exclusive partnership which enables us to increase our penetration in india by making ebays global inventory accessible to a significantly larger set of indian consumers additionally ebays millions of active buyers will have access to more unique indian inventory provided by flipkart the team at flipkart are strong executors with deep knowledge of the local indian market and we’re committed to winning in india through this partnership we continue to believe there are significant opportunities to expand our business inorganically through our ma and partnership strategy we’re continually evaluating opportunities to broaden our reach

through the power of a global marketplace we will continue to advocate for principles and policies that support the needs of the global ebay community such as inclusion trade and the positive role that technology can play in peoples lives around the world in summary we’re making steady progress in our journey of changing ebay in the past year we have improved both the foundation of the business and our operating results this improvement has not always been linear and it may not be going forward but q was a good start to a year where we expect to make significant progress redefining the ebay user experience and brand now let me turn it to scott to provide more details on our quarterly financial results and our q guidance scott schenkel thanks devin lets begin with q performance starting on slide  of the earnings presentation in q we generated  billion of total revenue  of nongaap eps  million in free cash flow and we repurchased  million of our stock moving to q active buyers on slide  in the quarter trailing month growth was  yearoveryear a one point acceleration driven  driving  million incremental active buyers underlying the over  under overall trends we saw slightly lower churn rates stable growth in reactivated buyers and some early momentum on new buyer acquisition exiting the quarter particularly in the us and korea on slide  in q we enabled  billion of gmv up  by geography the us generated  billion of gmv up  while international delivered  billion of gmv up  yearoveryear as we discuss our growth rates keep in mind that growth was negatively impacted by a point as we lapped leap year somewhat offset by the timing of easter moving to revenue we generated net revenues of  billion up  on an fx neutral basis a one point acceleration and up  organically stable versus the prior quarter we delivered  billion of transaction revenue up  and  million of marketing services and other revenue up  diving a bit deeper into our marketplace platform on slide  q gmv grew  stable versus the prior quarter us gmv accelerated one point quarteroverquarter to  and international gmv grew  one point deceleration versus the prior quarter underlying those trends our bc growth rate was  yearoveryear and cc growth was  versus prior year both stable versus the prior quarter total marketplace revenue was  billion up  yearoveryear a one point acceleration versus the prior quarter transaction revenue grew  in line with gmv while marketing services and other revenue grew  accelerating seven points versus q mso performance was driven by strong growth of our cobranded credit card revenue agreement and expansion of our firstparty inventory program in korea where we supplement our thirdparty inventory with consumer staples to ensure consideration across a wide spectrum of shopping occasions we continue to shift our advertising revenue away from thirdparty and towards firstparty advertising such as our promoted listings product which is recognized in transaction revenue this will favor transaction revenue but put pressure on mso revenue growth going forward moving to slide  stubhub gmv grew  accelerating one point from q driven by international strength with the integration of our ticketbis acquisition stubhub revenue grew  down one point versus q excluding the impact of ticketbis gmv growth was stable at  and revenue decelerated three points to  gmv and revenue growth dynamics resulted in a higher take rate this quarter versus the prior year this was driven primarily by a reduction in our buyer incentives while stubhub is facing tougher growth comps in a more challenging nearterm event landscape relative to last year our longterm outlook of high single to low doubledigit growth for the platform has not changed moving to slide  in q classifieds grew revenue  a three point deceleration versus q we saw a strong growth in ebay kleinanzeigen offset by lapping price increases in our motors vertical last year and continued ad monetization pressure from the ongoing shift to mobile looking forward we continue to expect classifieds to grow in the low to mid teens turning to slide  and major cost drivers in q we delivered nongaap operating margin of  which is down  basis points versus last year driven by a  basis points each in product development and ga additionally the stronger us dollar negatively impacted margin by  basis points the impact of foreign exchange was felt across all spend category so i will focus my comments on the operational dynamics of our expenses cost of revenue increased yearoveryear driven by expenses related to our ticketbis operations and the previously mentioned expansion of our firstparty inventory program in korea partially offset by good operating leverage q sales and marketing expense was relatively flat as a percentage of revenue as productivity and reallocations across channels and platforms helped fund increased marketplace brand advertising this quarter we ran a significant outdoor campaign across the us and an ebay motors campaign with tv spots airing during major nascar events product development costs were up as we continue to invest in our product experiences across all of our platforms key areas of investment include ongoing expansion of structured data new user experience development and efforts around ai and machine learning ga expense was up yearoveryear as operating leverage was more than offset by lapping a onetime insurance recovery last year and ticketbis operating expenses turning to eps on slide  in q we delivered  of nongaap eps up  versus prior year with fx negatively impacting eps growth by four points eps growth was driven by revenue growth and the net benefits of share repurchases partially offset by the cost dynamics explained earlier gaap eps for the quarter was  up  versus last year the primary driver of the yearoveryear increase in gaap eps was a noncash gaap income tax benefit of  million which we recorded to recognize a deferred tax asset related to our classifieds entities this is part of the ongoing realignment of our legal structure and the noncash impact of this realignment is reflected in our gaap tax rate and gaap eps but has no impact on our free cash flow nongaap tax rate or nongaap eps as always you can find a detailed reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation on slide  in q we generated  million of free cash flow which was down  on a yearoveryear basis primarily driven by lower net income and differences in the timing of cash tax payment capex was  of revenue in q turning to slide  we ended the quarter with cash cash equivalents and nonequity investments of  billion with  billion in the us we continue to be disciplined capital allocators and align our actions against our capital allocation tenets ph in q we repurchased  million shares at an average price of  per share amounting to  million in total this amount is in line with our capital return commitment of a minimum about  of free cash flow for the fullyear we ended the quarter with  million of share repurchase authorization remaining were excited about the recent announcement of our partnership with flipkart and we believe our  million investment along with the contribution of our ebay india business significantly improves our competitive position in a strategically important market we expect this deal to close early in the second half of  and upon deal close we will no longer report active buyer gmv and related financials for ebay india we do not expect the gmv or financial impact to be material to our overall  results however we do expect to remove approximately  million buyers from our active buyer reporting turning to q guidance on slide  were projecting revenue between  billion and  billion representing organic fx neutral growth of  to  yearoveryear this growth range takes into account marketplace volume and revenue growth acceleration offset by stubhub and paypal operating agreement comparisons we expect nongaap eps of  to  per share representing yearoveryear growth of  to  on an as reported basis eps growth will be driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of our share repurchase program offset by our increased investment to drive improved user experiences and to market our brand additionally we expect foreign exchange to impact us by approximately five points of growth on a yearoveryear basis for q we expect gaap eps in the range of  to  our fullyear nongaap guidance remains unchanged from january as we continue to execute on our strategy to deliver the best choice the most relevance and a powerful selling platform our focus through the remainder of the year will be growing our base of active buyers and delivering a significant number of new user experiences to increase traffic and conversion while facing into tougher lapping with stubhub and our paypal operating agreement as a reminder for the year we expect revenue in the range of  billion to  billion operating margin of  to  a nongaap effective tax rate between  and  and nongaap eps of  to  per share additionally we continue to expect capex of  to  of revenue and free cash flow of  billion to  billion we are increasing our fullyear gaap eps guidance to  to  per share reflecting the impact of the previously mentioned deferred tax asset recorded this quarter the difference between our nongaap and gaap eps primarily consists of amortization of intangible stockbased compensation and tax impacts from our ongoing legal structure realignment in summary were making progress on our plans for the year launching a significant number of new user experiences that are starting to impact our results and drive a healthier ecosystem while growth may not only be perfectly linear we expect to deliver acceleration in our marketplaces platform and exit the year having made significant progress in redefining the ebay user experience and brand now wed be happy to answer your questions operator questionandanswer session operator certainly operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ross sandler from barclays your question please ross sandler great thanks i had one for devin and one for scott so devin on the macro picture given how challenging life is becoming for brickandmortar retailers right now how are the conversations with that group or large brands like cpg brands or oem is changing and is ebay becoming anymore central in  than maybe in years in the past for those constituents and then the second question is you called out a momentum in new buyer acquisition can you just give us a little color about whats driving that in the us and korea and is it still the right leading indicator to look at  to seek evidence of the replatforming kicking in this year thank you devin wenig yes ross thanks for the question i will take the first and i will let scott do the new buyer dynamics on the overall environment i guess what i would say is theres no change to our conversation with retailers and theres definite change to our conversations with brands so visàvis retailers it hasnt since the new leadership team took over it hasn’t been a core part of our focus there are some retailers that sell successfully on ebay we’re pleased about those relationships but were not looking to expand those relationships aggressively and we’re more focused on bringing outstanding inventory and where we can direct from the source i think that the conversation with brands has definitely changed they’re now looking at a platform that is doing  billion a quarter it has  million active buyers and we are  i expect that will accelerate the pace of brand acquisitions through this year meaning there will be more brands that sell directly or through resellers on ebay directly and those conversations i think have gone very very well its a little bit  it depends on the category but im really pleased and i think that for brands what they see in ebay is a costeffective channel to and a very progressive technology partner which is what they need to navigate the world that’s coming and on active buyer scott scott schenkel hey ross on active buyers as we called out we grew active buyers at  this quarter which was a one point acceleration versus last quarters growth rate i would call out three primary drivers of that strength the first is we feel like our new experiences that are being expanded to a larger portion of our buyers are beginning to help its showing up in the form of lower churn rates andor retain buyer base second our structured data pages on sco are starting to contribute to new buyer growth and while not at a material scale yet we are seeing early positive signs and as we step up our brand investments we see a halo effect across most of our marketing base of traffic and so look the improvements in our buyer funnel have not been linear i do think that as we look towards the future it might not be linear but we believe that active buyer growth is one of the metrics to your question that we look at closely and should portend an acceleration in gmv next question operator thank you our next question comes from the line of heath terry from goldman sachs your question please heath terry great just a couple of questions i guess first devin as you guys look deeper into how you want to optimize around advertising you’ve talked in the past about getting to a point where the rois on the page or conversion rates within the page generate the kind of positive rois that you need to more heavily invest in advertising can you kind of give us a sense of where you are on that spectrum to the extent that’s what’s driving the decision to invest more in advertising or marketing and then just on stubhub as we continue to see this gap between gmv and revenue as the transaction rate or take rate improves can you give us a sense whether or not we should be expecting at some point in the near mediumterm that gmv and revenue growth converge or is there  do you expect to continue to be able to take rate up over time devin wenig thanks i will take the first again and i will let scott second on advertising marketing generally we are now in a rapid period of user experience improvements i’m pretty pleased by that there is never a perfect time to start stepping up your advertising and marketing but we feel like this is the right time and we will take the next step this quarter q and for the brand spend you need some time to really measure that properly its too soon to know we’ve made a dramatic impact but as you heard from scott as we stepped up the brand we’ve seen traffic at a bit better and new buyers get a bit better so we like that and we think it is important as i’ve said in previous calls to correct any misperceptions about ebays business today and to set that in the context of a phenomenal ecommerce experience for consumers across segments so we’re going to take the next step this quarter and on the other more traditional advertising channels that weve always done things like paid search and social we’re now on  different social channels and messaging platforms we’re seeing better rois i think weve been doing this for quite a while weve been pretty good at it and we’re optimizing those channels very well so across the piece we are going to lean into this to try to drive traffic and buyers to what we think is now rapidly improving experience and its exactly what we said we would do and so far we like the results we see its one point i want to stay cautious and as you heard from scott it may not just be up from here but there were a few consecutive quarters of user growth decline and now we’ve bent that curve and thats what we were hoping and expecting this quarter so i’m pleased with that on stubhub scott devin wenig yes heath on the stubhub take rate and just to what we said it was  an increase of  basis points yearoveryear but down  basis points quarteroverquarter with the decrease being  it is really driven by the decrease in buyer incentives as i called out i dont really view that as a longterm structural change one way or the other really as we look towards the future we removed our fan rewards program last year and are currently in the process of revamping to a different type of program and so i dont expect the take rate to continue to go up nor do i expect that a significant change downwards on our underlying core stubhub us platform take rate heath terry so will those numbers can  will those growth rates converge over time given that devin wenig i think naturally yes heath they will just like we had a period of time in marketplaces where our gmv and revenue were disconnected you get weird yearoveryear comparisons that can drive that but i dont view that as a longterm thing heath terry okay great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of justin post from bank of america merrill lynch your question please justin post great i would like to talk about marketplace take rates looks like you had some fee changes maybe give us the outlook on that and then the advertising business how big of an impact can that be and i know you said that mso revenues might fall offsetting that benefit but how do you see the longterm benefit of some of the new ad initiatives that youve taken at this quarter thanks devin wenig again we will share it let me was first talk about these generally we’re always evaluating our fee structures and we take any change to fees quite seriously in our spring seller release which was about a month ago we did make some fee changes there will be some  for some sellers an increase in take rate and a bit of a decrease in discounting for certain sellers the reason we did that are really two reasons one this is a year of significant investment in tools that we’re going to give sellers to optimize their velocity and their margin on the ebay marketplace so there will be significant investments and products rolling out around seller hub and also significantly what were including with our fees going forward for quite a few sellers is promoted listings as part of that package now this is important because we’re seeing rapid growth in our promoted listings business as we take thirdparty ads of the site in certain areas particularly our thirdparty plas thats important for ebay because it drive to help your ecosystem it keeps people inside our ecosystem and our marketplace to transact its important for sellers because it drives additional velocity and for promoted listings it gives them the ability to promote inventory inside ebay and get additional velocity for some tradeoff of margin but thats now packaged inside the fee so basically its a marginal fee increase in return for what we think are significant seller benefits that they will be getting this year in  scott schenkel yes i think you covered it justin post and then on the ad business longterm are you optimistic switching the types of ads on the site devin wenig im very optimistic in our advertising business i think that its really worth the very beginning we’re seeing really nice growth in our firstparty advertising business we just really gotten ramping on that and when you think about a business of our size and our velocity and a business that’s doing hundreds of millions of searches a day and a business that has  million active buyers we really do believe that that the advertising business is a great opportunity over time and we’ve said that on the previous calls and in this quarter confirms it we’re really pleased with the trajectory of our advertising business scott schenkel yes maybe a bit more color justin we had  more sellers this quarter using our promoted listing product than last quarter and if you look at the overall  while the overall contribution revenue isnt that great again just to call out that that promoted listings will be showing up in take rate not in mso revenue but as we make that shift from thirdparty ads and removing them and that will reduce mso but certainly our overall broadly termed ad business i think i completely agree with that devin said justin post thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of colin sebastian from robert w baird your question please colin sebastian thanks and devin good quarter i guess first off a bit of a followup but it seems like a number good things are happening in q in terms of the new homepage faster buyer growth the more aggressive ad campaign but im not sure if we can really see that reflected in the quarterly guidance at least so i wonder if you can expand on why there might be a little bit of hesitation in terms of seeing those benefits nearterm and then on a related note are you still expecting the  basis points acceleration in marketplace this year scott schenkel sure why don’t i take that colin i think a couple of things first off for q i think its important to remember that we’re expecting to see marketplaces gmv and revenue acceleration within our guidance of the  to  on organic revenue which is again similar to this quarter going to be offset by the paypal operating agreement and the top lapping that stubhub has and so as we look at the quarter i think its  the q guidance is right in line with what we expected and i think we feel good based on some of the things that we saw on q heading into q and as we look at the second half of the year theres really no change in what we told you in january we still expect a  points of marketplaces volume acceleration for the year to occur based on the changes that we’re making to our user experience as well as the increased investment levels that we’re making in brand colin sebastian is there a target percent in terms of the traffic exposed to structured data we should think about for the end of the year or a step function sometimes during the year anything that we could use as a benchmark devin wenig we havent said a number and in part that number will be depending on testing and learning but as i think i said last quarter you wont be able to miss it by this holiday and the number will be a lot higher than  theres almost no chance that it wont be and we are going to rapidly start to  we are rapidly going to start to expose more traffic and more experiences to these new experiences that we think are performing quite well so there isnt a number but itll be a lot higher and keep in mind also we’re just ramping brand we’re just beginning that spend that will be  people will see that meaningfully early this summer when we take the next step so there are a lot of irons in the fire like you said but as scott also said weve got some very tough lapping quarters remember a yearago stubhub was growing mid s plus so the stubhub lapping is super tough for the next couple of quarters the business is in great shape i think the business is healthy but the growth rates are going to get substantially suppressed over the next few quarters but that doesnt change what’s happening in the core marketplace business which we feel good about colin sebastian okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of eric sheridan from ubs your question please eric sheridan thank you so much maybe two questions one for devin and one for scott devin in terms of the new users you are seeing come onto the platform wanted to know if there is anything new you’re seeing from them as a cohort analysis in terms of the way they shop their propensity to shop the amount of money they spend anything you want to call out for folks there in terms of how people are coming to ebay now versus a couple of years ago and then scott on the cost side of the equation q guide implies another sort of step up on the investments we’ve talked a little bit about that on the call so far i wanted to know if you could sort of isolate some of the buckets of investments sort of would be the transition the advertising business advertising for user growth and brand just for people to understand a little bit that the cadence of those numbers in the next couple of quarters thanks devin wenig on  it’s a good question on the new users i guess what i would say is its too soon to ascertain shopping patterns because remember the cohort is  days older  days older at best  days old so it’s a little early but we do think that in terms of who they are demographic segmentation they’re skewing a little younger and a little more female which is interesting and youll see us market that way in the summer we certainly think thats an untapped potential we  our intention is to improve consideration of the ebay brand among millennials among women we have large fire bases there but we’re underrepresented relatively to our other segments so its encouraging to see more new users come from those segments and we think thats just the beginning of that but in terms of their shopping behavior a little early to tell i think we need a little more longitude to be able to know that scott schenkel yes eric on q margin specifically i dont think theres really any change with maybe just two highlights to the underlying cost structure as we head into this quarter first is the product development investments that we’ve made and we will continue to make to move on the product experiences and activate the things that weve been talking about and the second part is brand there will be a ramp particularly in offline brand advertising throughout the year as we’ve called out to date we’ve paid for that with efficiencies and productivity within the marketing buckets by and large and we will continue to do some of that but some of that will end up bleeding through into the margin line over the course of the next few quarters operator thank you our next question comes from the line of douglas anmuth from jpmorgan your question please douglas anmuth thanks for taking the question devin and scott i just wanted to followup on the structured data implementation and improvements i think you talked about exposing it to  of traffic at this point if you could just elaborate a little bit more in terms of what youre seeing and also on the seo conversion which i think you said was holding and then how do you expect the categories to rollout going forward how are you prioritizing as you go thanks devin wenig so we’re pretty pleased with what we’ve been seeing on this in terms of seo structured data is now  of seo share which is up and obviously  of total traffic which is up for  which we exited last quarter and i think that as i said to colin before that number will go up quite a bit conversion bounce rates all the things we spoken about in previous calls look good as on seo as we’ve grown our share we have not diminished our conversion which is still double digits out in the seo ecosystem which is great on organic were at par and were just starting to iterate that so thats pretty good and gives us the license to go faster which will do so i think where we want to be visàvis categories were focusing very much on the categories that you would imagine have the highest impact of catalog those are hard good categories those are electronics they’re certain home and garden categories you know it’s across the spectrum i mean we’ve issued  we’re rolling structured data out across the business but as we said previously most of our focus is at the head and in hard good type categories where a catalog makes the biggest impact as you move down the tail it’s a unique oneoff items type of things that sell uniquely on ebay i’m not saying catalog is irrelevant but its not as impactful in areas like that so were focused on head categories and hard good categories initially where were seeing the biggest impact douglas anmuth great thank you devin operator thank you our next question comes from the line of scott devitt from stifel your question please scott devitt thanks i wanted to ask about the shipping initiative that you’re implementing later this year for guarantee ph just wondering if you can talk about maybe things like the percentage of orders already that are delivered in three days or less how sellers qualify for the program what happens to the search results for those that are going to be approved in the program and maybe the portion of gmv that you anticipate to flowthrough something like this over time thank you devin wenig its a great question keep in mind as we said previously about two thirds of all items in the us today are delivered in three days or less and we think that thats not well understood particularly by  that factors into the consideration of the ebay brand issue so without a subscription without charging people extra we’re today delivering millions of items in three days or less so there are really two things that we think are directly implicated by the program that we announce scott one is we are going to expand that inventory because we’re asking sellers to opt in we are getting really good uptake from our sellers many want to and can and that will expand the addressable inventory that is deliverable within three days the second is the user experience and there will be a change in the user experience where our customers can sort and filter by three days or two days or even one day and sometimes they will pay for that but many times it will be free as we said out of those  million items millions of them will be shipped for free so we do think that there will be  we’ve iterated with this in the past with something like fast and free this is a much more aggressive step to say youll be able to shop ebay on millions of items and we think in millions of those items will have the best price delivered in three days and delivered in three days for free we just think this is a way to stick our competitive advantage right out there and have no questions about why people shop on ebay and why they should so both the product change visàvis the ability to sort filter and shop by three days or less and an inventory change visàvis the request that sellers opt in to get that increased exposure and so far we’re getting a really nice uptake of sellers i wouldnt want to yet say what percent of gmv will be covered i suspect that will change over time anyway but i hope that we can come out of the gate with a meaningful number a meaningful portion of gmv covered so that its an impactful program scott devitt and if i could just followup i assume correct me if i’m wrong but it will be by product within the merchant versus merchants getting approved for all products can you just talk about that a little bit in terms of how merchant approval works for the system devin wenig it will be merchants opt in a set of inventory so they may not be able to opt all their inventory but they will be able to opt in what inventory they’re committing to ship within three days or less scott devitt thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark may from citi your question please mark may thanks i had a couple if i could please i believe you said that you’re going to start pointing most of your paid search traffic to new pages shortly if i heard that right what impact do you think that will have on your return on ad spend and how does it change your thinking about paid search spending in general secondly in terms of promoted listings i know you’re still relatively early but the thinking of longerterm there what are some of the industry benchmarks that we should be thinking about in terms of the percent of gmv that could eventually be spent by sellers on promoted listings and then if i could just sneak in a housekeeping one in terms of the … devin wenig mark you’re just limited to two  we’re just going to limit it to two for now we got others in the queue okay on paid search we are  our plan is to move paid search to structured data pages this quarter q probably more towards the end of the quarter so i dont think it will have a big q impact but our hope is that we will see improved conversion which will result in improved roi and we operate our paid search business to an roi curve so my hope is thats another reason to lean into that and as scott said why are we advertising more because we think were getting an impact we wouldnt advertise we wouldnt be spending in any channel if we werent getting an marketing impact if we can move the roi curve on paid search further out that’s great we will put more money into that we will drive more growth on promoted listings you know i wouldnt want to say what percent mark of gmv can move under that i guess i just say we are moving from  we started with a limited number of sellers we started with multisku inventory only we will now be expanding to single sku items in other words unique items that will be able to be promoted they will focus on business sellers but eventually we dont see any reason why a consumer seller shouldnt be able to promote their item as well and we’re really focused on making the product so easy to use that anybody who is on ebay the first time could make the choice to promote that item and happily pay a little bit of their take rate more to get visibility and exposure and hopefully more velocity so i think its going to be important and i think it will cover a meaningful portion of our business but i’m not going to predict the number at this point operator thank you our next question comes from the line of lloyd walmsley from deutsche bank your question please lloyd wharton walmsley thanks two if i can first following up on the new buyer growth you guys called out strength in the us and korea specifically wondering if this is primarily just driven by more advertising in these markets or if theres anything else you could call out driving this strength in those markets and then second one if i can looking at the improvements you’re making to user experience and increased adoption of the mobile app are you seeing any increases in customer frequency or buying across more categories or any other kind of indications of the benefit of the product improvements beyond conversion any color you could share there would be great scott schenkel i’d call out a few things and real quickly the new experiences as we parse out our underlying user base what we see is those new user experiences appear to be helping it lower our churn rates in our routine buyer base and the second is the structured data pages that we’re rolling out in sco in a small way is starting to attract new buyers to the ecosystem and the step up in the brands impacting it appears to be impacting across multiple channels and so those would be the call out in the active buyers obviously in the us we’ve rolled the most changes to in the last three to six months and so its going to index higher on those in that geography versus the others specific to your last question i’d say its too early to what devin said earlier    days and with the new set of buyer cohorts in three or six months will have a much better point of view of whether  we’re bringing in buyers that are buying in multiple categories are at a higher level devin wenig one more question operator and then we will wrap up operator certainly our final question for the day comes from the line of ron josey from jmp securities your question please ronald josey great thanks for taking the question i just want to go back i think devin you mentioned investments around the seller hub to now launch globally it help sellers manage demand and supply along with insight on pricing can you just talk about how seller hub has helped grow sellers better manage their business help ebay better understand their inventory all of which sort of ties into the better experience and structured data so just more information on seller hub would be helpful thanks devin wenig ron thanks a lot of this goes back to the decisions that we made a yearago structured data helps this and the decision to invest in a platform a unified platform that sellers could use is now manifesting itself in a product that were proud of it  as we said last quarter we’re growing the number of business sellers on ebay and part of the reason for that is we think its a very costeffective channel with great velocity but also they’re getting better and better tools and thats just starting we are going to do a lot more this year using once you have structured data once you’ve inventory level visibility we can then tell sellers here is your velocity in a certain category or your pricing is too high you’re not moving inventory because youre not price competitive or if you make these changes then we think youll get this type of return so a lot of  seller hub is a management tool but its also a data platform and what i am most excited about is the ability to give our sellers actionable data to allow them to make better decisions to drive either margin or velocity their choice to drive their business and make ebay an incredibly effective channel for them to run their commerce business id also say keep in mind that we’re also giving better tools to cc sellers so cc has been a problem for a while its very encouraging to me to now see two consecutive quarters of  growth after years of decline one of the things that we’re doing that we talked about is giving consumer sellers the ability to list simply and to manage their listings much much more elegantly and not churn them because of the complexity of ebay and we’re really  we made progress on that but i’d say we’re also just at the beginning of that i expect  to be a year where we give our consumer sellers significant additional tools and listing tools to minimize complexity so all of this is big investments in our sellers to give them the ability to join ebay and then be successful on our platform lets go and wrap up operator thank you operator certainly thank you this does conclude the questionandanswer session as well as todays program thank you for your

devin wenig thanks selim and good afternoon everyone q is a good quarter for us we delivered strong top and bottom line financial results led by acceleration in our core ebay platform at a time when retailers are struggling more every day we were able to accelerate growth by improving our customer experience and beginning to reinvigorate our brand overall total gmv was up  for the quarter while revenue was up  active buyer growth was stable at  as we added nearly  million buyers to our platforms in q excluding buyers in india which will no longer report after our flipkart transaction closes growth in buyer acquisition was  accelerating a point gmv on our marketplace platform grew  a one point acceleration driven by strength in the us our classified platform grew revenue at  and stubhub volume was down  driven by tough comps and a weaker event landscape than we expected finally we’ve returned  billion to our shareholders in the form of stock repurchases now let me take a moment to put our q performance in the context of our strategy two years ago we began repositioning our business for longterm success by driving the best choice the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform while sharpening the ebay brand at the time we said we’re confident in our ability to deliver improved user experiences and to accelerate growth on our core ebay platform now we’re doing just that we’ve made significant progress to modernize and simplify ebay while bringing forward its unique strengths we’ve created a product catalog that covers well over half our inventory we’ve built and launched hundreds of millions of new products and browse spaces and we’ve rolled out a significant number of customer improvements at an accelerating pace and we’ve begun to reposition the ebay brand to be more differentiated while also correcting longstanding misperceptions about ebay over the past two years we’ve added  million active buyers while improving the gmv growth of our core platform and accelerating revenue growth we’ve delivered well over  billion of net income while returning  billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases we’ve also created renewed vibrancy and energy across our company and our culture as we work together to execute our business strategy and to accelerate growth as an example over the past two years our employee satisfaction has increased while our turnover has decreased another important element of our culture is our ongoing commitment to make ebay more diverse and inclusive which is a competitive advantage in recruiting world class talent and ensuring that our workforce reflects the diversity of our marketplace in summary we’re on track with our plans we’re making progress in our business and our organization and we’re right where we expected we would be we continue to drive best choice by providing our consumers with great selection and value we’re focused on attracting and retaining sellers and brands that bring differentiated inventory to ebay and this continues to yield good results for example in q we collaborated with disney to offer exclusive pirates of the caribbean merchandise and we launched nest and egi ph as new brands on our platform growth in the global number of ebay business sellers accelerated in q the second straight quarter of acceleration and just last week we announced the partnership with shopify to enable their merchants to list and sell their products on ebay directly from their shopify account which will expand merchants and inventory over time finally we launched a price match guarantee on our ebay deals platform ensuring our consumers always have access to the best inventory at the best prices traffic to our new structured data enabled user experiences was at  exiting the quarter with continued strong conversion in our seo channel while conversion in our organic and pay traffic channels continues to be stable within seo where our experiences have been in place the longest conversion further improved then we saw strong acceleration in traffic growth this quarter the rollout of our new homepage has expanded to all users across eight key geographies we leveraged our structured data and ai to deliver and experience tailored to each ebay user’s interests and passions early evidence shows users are responding well to the new homepage with lower bounce rates and better engagement this tells us we’re matching users with content that’s more relevant to them and we stepped up our brand’s marketing in q in april we rolled out a national fashion campaign and in june we launched the first activation of our new brand platform fill your cart with color using multiple channels including television digital and social and while it’s still very early to determine the overall efficacy of our brand advertising we’re seeing promising early results with better fashion – better purchase consideration in our fashion category and an increase in traffic from new to ebay visitors we recently began building on our brand marketing with the launch of a significant out of home campaign in the us the next phase of our television and social advertising we plan to continue to invest in our brands in the second half of this year including the international rollout of the new campaign finally we continue to execute our plans to deliver the most powerful selling platform in q we engaged our developer community by hosting a developer conference at our san jose campus and we announced significant enhancements to our suite of apis over time this will enable better innovation on our platform which will benefit our sellers of all sizes we also continue to expand adoption of our seller hub product while adding capabilities to enable sellers to more effectively manage their ebay businesses our classified platform had another strong quarter of revenue growth driven across our broad portfolio of assets we’re focused on increasing traffic and engagement through better mobile experiences and improving our verticals and our inventory integration between marketplace and classifieds continues to perform well finally stubhub had a challenging quarter driven by continued lapping of strong growth comps coupled with the us events landscape that was significantly weaker than we had anticipated last year we’ve benefited from record setting events such as hamilton and copa america along with strong nba and nhl postseasons and good performance of top selling mlb teams none of which repeated in q of this year while us growth lags we continue to expand our global event marketplace with significant doubledigit international gmv growth this quarter and we continue to improve the product experience this quarter with innovations in our native app social commerce and a globally integrated event catalog while we expect to face tough growth comps again in q stubhub is well positioned to grow over the longterm due to our leading consumer brand expanding industry partnerships and continued innovation in summary q was a good quarter for our business with accelerating volume and revenue growth in our core marketplace platform in the two years since implementing our strategy we’ve made the product and technology investments necessary to enable us to deliver growth acceleration our focus continues to be on improving the customer experience and we won’t hesitate to tradeoff shortterm results when necessary looking forward to the second half of this year we expect good execution and an increasing pace of product innovation and with that i’ll turn it over to scott to give you more detail on the q results scott schenkel thanks devin let’s begin with q performance starting on slide  of the earnings presentation in q we generated  billion of total revenue  of nongaap eps and  million of free cash flow we repurchased  million of our stock and this week our board of directors approved an additional  billion share repurchase authorization moving to active buyers in the quarter we increased our total active buyer base to  million while trailing month growth was stable at  underlying the overall trends we saw stable retention and continued positive momentum in new user acquisition with particular strength coming from the us and korea on slide  in q we enabled  billion of total gmv up  by geography the us generated  billion of gmv up  while international delivered  billion of gmv up  yearoveryear moving to revenue we generated total net revenues of  billion up  on an fx neutral basis and up  organically both stable versus the prior quarter we delivered  billion of transaction revenue up  and  million of marketing services and other revenue up  turning to slide  our marketplace platform grew gmv by  in q one point acceleration versus the prior quarter us gmv accelerated one point quarter over quarter to  and international gmv grew at  stable versus the prior quarter underlying those trends our bc growth rate was  yearoveryear and cc growth was  both slightly improving versus the prior quarter total marketplace revenue was  billion up  yearoveryear two point acceleration versus the prior quarter transaction revenue also grew  and accelerated two points versus q one point faster than gmv as the pricing changes we announced in q which are enabling increased investments to drive velocity for our sellers went into effect marketing services and other revenue grew  a deceleration of two points versus the prior quarter the deceleration was driven by the elimination of certain third party ads on our site in addition to lapping significant q growth from our cobranded credit card revenue which is recognized annually in the first quarter as we continue to shift our advertising strategy away from third party and towards first party advertising this will favor transaction revenue putting ongoing pressure on mso revenue growth moving to slide  stubhub gmv declined  yearoveryear decelerating  points from q while revenue grew  a deceleration of  points versus the prior quarter this quarter we lapped the strongest growth rates from all of last year in addition to facing into a weaker events landscape as devin discussed earlier while we will continue to face comps tough comps through most of q we believe q will be the low point of growth for this year moving to slide  in q classifieds grew revenue  one point acceleration versus q we’re seeing strong growth across our key markets driven by improved user traffic and engagement partially offset by ongoing monetization headwinds as traffic shifts to our mobile app platforms turning to slide  and major cost drivers in q we delivered nongaap operating margin of  which is down  basis points versus last year  basis points of which was driven by a stronger us dollar impacting all spend categories i will focus my remaining comments on the operational dynamics of our expenses cost of revenue increased yearoveryear driven by our ticketbis acquisition our first party inventory program in korea and incremental investments in ebay customer support q sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue as productivity and marketing channels and reallocations across platforms more than offset increased marketplace brand advertising in june we launched a new multichannel brand campaign in the us which will rollout across our key international markets throughout the remainder of the year product development costs were relatively flat as a percentage of revenue as we are now lapping increased product investments from the second quarter of last year we continue to drive operating leverage to fund ongoing investments in key areas such as the expansion of structured data and the product experience enhancements across our platforms ga expenses were up yearoveryear driven by the addition of ticketbis operating expenses and investments in data security and employee benefits and services turning to eps on slide  in q we delivered  of nongaap eps up  versus prior year with fx negatively impacting eps growth by five points eps growth was driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of share repurchases partially offset by the cost dynamics described earlier gaap eps for the quarter was  down  versus last year our gaap results were negatively impacted this quarter by a noncash income tax charge of  million caused by the foreign exchange remeasurement of a deferred tax asset related to the ongoing realignment of our legal structure as always you can find the detail of reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures on our press release and earnings presentation on slide  in q we generated  million of free cash flow which was down  on a yearoveryear basis primarily driven by timing differences of cash tax payments capex was  of revenue in q and we continue to expect to be in the range of  to  of revenue for the year turning to slide  we ended the quarter with cash cash equivalents and nonequity investments of  billion of which  billion is in the us our capital allocation strategy is designed to manage the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility access to debt and our cost of capital to enable capital return and drive longterm shareholder value in q we raised  billion of debt which we plan to use for general corporate purposes repayment of our nearterm debt obligations share repurchases and ma activity additionally we repurchased  million shares at an average price of  per share amounting to  million in total we ended the quarter with  million of share repurchase authorization remaining and as i previously mentioned our board of directors approved an additional  billion authorization this week we remain committed to capital return at a minimum of  of free cash flow for the full year and we will continue to be in the market opportunistically at levels above that before discussing our q guidance i’d like to remind you that we will start to utilize hedge accounting to better protect revenue from currency movements in the second half of  as i mentioned on our january earnings call we implemented a new hedging program that is intended to reduce volatility of our topline from foreign exchange going forward are hedging results will be recorded in our net revenue line and not our interest and other line with that let’s turn to our q guidance on slide  we are projecting revenue between  billion and  billion representing organic fx neutral growth of  to  yearoveryear our guidance assumes continued improvement in marketplace volume and revenue growth we expect nongaap eps of  to  per share representing yearoveryear growth of  to  on an as reported basis eps growth will be driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of our share repurchase program offset by continued investments to drive improved user experience and to market our brand additionally we expect fx to impact us by approximately five points of growth on a yearoveryear basis for q we expect gaap eps in the range of  to  for the full year we continue to expect revenue in the range of  billion to  billion organic fx and revenue growth of  to  nongaap operating margin in the range of  to  nongaap eps in the range of  to  per share and free cash flow of  billion to  billion assuming foreign exchange rates remain where they are today we would expect revenue dollars to be slightly above the highend of our guidance range we are updating our fullyear gaap eps guidance to  to  per share reflecting the impact of the previously mentioned noncash income tax charge recorded in q as our legal structure realignment process continues throughout this year it may result in further noncash adjustments that are not currently factored into our gaap guidance in summary we are seeing positive momentum and we expect to launch an increasing number of product enhancements throughout the remainder of this year in addition to increasing our brand advertising to drive improved consideration in traffic as we significantly changed the ebay user experience the improvement in our results may not always be linear however we believe we are investing in the right initiatives to meet our commitment to accelerate growth we are on the right track and execution will be key for the second half of this year as we continue to set the business up for longer term success now we’d be happy to answer your questions operator questionandanswer session operator yes sir operator instructions our first question comes from the line of eric sheridan of ubs your question please eric sheridan thanks so much for taking the question maybe taking a step back as we look into that part of the year i want to know if you could frame some of those key investments that you think are necessary to continue the momentum in the business that you’re seeing in q over q and what we should be watching towards those investments play out in terms of the key metrics on either the top line users sellers gmv how should we be measuring that thanks so much devin wenig i’ll talk about the investments and then scott can just frame it it’s not a lot different than what we’re doing we think we’re on the right track and we will continue to build out our catalog and continue to build out our structured data foundation you’ll see an accelerating pace of user innovation on top of that meaning the ebay site will continue to evolve there are some significant product deliverables in the second half built on that foundation which we’ve already announced which in the coming weeks and months we’ll update on when the delivery is but there is significant move on things like guaranteed delivery and things like authentication and all of that’s built on the same foundation and we’ve already discussed that and we think those are on the right path you’ll also see us continue to expand the brand advertising campaign as an example we’ve launched it in the us we have not launched it yet internationally and that will happen in the second half so on the back of those things what we’re seeing is traffic improve buyers improve and conversion improve we like that so we’re going to keep expanding the surface area of that and it’s on that basis that we’ve given the guidance in the second half that we’ve given which implies continuing improvement i don’t know if you have anything to add scott scott schenkel no you covered it devin wenig okay next question operator thank you our next question comes from ross sandler of barclays capital your question please ross sandler great guys i just had couple questions first is the spring seller update can you just talk about the overall impact to back half revenue just going to be revenue neutral or accretive and you know if stubhub continues to underperform and i think scott’s comment about exceeding the highend of the revenue range that he just made what would that imply for marketplace of gmv exfx relative to that  at the highend and then second question is any – i think you mentioned the us active buyers are picking up in the second quarter any early feedback or metrics around the ad campaign that launched in the quarter is that was driving in or is it something else any color there would be helpful thank you scott schenkel yeah let me work backwards real quick first off on active buyers as devin called out excluding india we grew active buyers by  which accelerated nearly a point quarteroverquarter with particular strength in the us and we’d call that also augmented by korea three dynamics under there some of which we’ve talked about some of which i’ll just expand upon first is retention we continue to see that stable as we exposed more users to our new experiences new buyers we see new buyers coming particularly from our new seo landing pages based on the structured data pages that that underlie that and we’re starting to activate the brand much more at scale than we have and we expect that to supplement new buyer growth with increased consideration this is in early phases but we’re happy with the early start if i go back to your first couple questions first maybe start with guidance you know as i called out the q organic revenue as well as the total year organic revenue of between  and  is really going to be based on the acceleration that we expect to see in marketplaces gmv and revenue the pricing change that we made will continue to favor transaction revenue and much of that as i call that my remarks will be reinvested to try and accelerate the pace that we see in our growth what was the other one active buyers… devin wenig i think that was it scott schenkel that was it anything to add… devin wenig how the brand campaign is doing i just say – look we’re pleased with it i think the response has been really good to some extent we started feathering brand marketing in earlier in the year but we really kicked that in at the back half of q and you’ll see that continue throughout the year and expand internationally we’ve seen traffic respond nicely it’s a little early to be calling virus but we’ve seen traffic respond nicely and we’ve seen that traffic come from new to ebay users which is really the intention of a brand campaign as to expand those – expand our consideration and you know a month a month and a half in we think that’s happening but with all brand campaigns you’re going to keep it on and that’s what we’re going to do so we’ve – again it’s – these are all themes we think we’re on the right track and we’re going to keep doing it but on an accelerating pace scott schenkel yeah let me double click real quick on marketplaces gmv if you back up here we’ve accelerated marketplaces gmv from ish to  to  over the course of the last year and this has been driven by the us which has accelerated roughly one point per quarter over that same time period while international has been relatively stable so we’ve made the most improvement as devin called out to our foundation and as well as changes to the marketplaces ecosystem in the us and we’re in the – and we’re further along in the brand activation as devin called out in the us and those improvements the changes in the ecosystem the brand are in the process of rolling out across our platform and our properties internationally and so in a global ecosystem it’s highly dependent on many factors but as i said things won’t always be linear but we believe we’re making the right investments and we’re making balanced tradeoffs to drive that growth and our outlook and guidance assumes that devin wenig thanks let’s go ahead and go to the next question operator thank you our next question comes from douglas anmuth of jp morgan your line is open douglas anmuth thanks for taking the question devin just wanted to ask you about structured data you talked about sco being strong and conversion improving i hope you could also just talk about what you’re seeing in terms of organic and sem as well thanks devin wenig yeah those are stable those are kind of in line with where they’ve been because we haven’t yet fully penetrated that if you look at where we’ve taken structured data in the last quarter in q we’ve really expanded its presence in sco we’re up to  of total sco shares now on these new experiences and it’s interesting that those experiences have been in place for longest in sco and we see the most surface area and i think two quarters ago we started saying we’re seeing really nice double digit conversion gains those are actually moved up again this quarter and we’re really seeing very nice traffic acceleration in sco now so we like that in the core where we’re just starting to intersect with things like search in the homepage we’re pretty stable and i guess that’s to be expected we think that will move up over time but we also said you’re not going to get the gains at the edge that you’ve got near the middle near the core we think we will get gains but it will be a bit of a different profile but still this is playing out kind of the way we had hoped it would which is we’re seeing conversion gains we’re improving sco we’re moving from the edge into the core and i’ll just reiterate what i said i believe last quarter which is this is not  the pace isn’t linear it’s actually going to speed up in the second half and you’ll be able to see the new experiences in ebay from space by this holiday and we still believe that that will be the case douglas anmuth okay thank you devin wenig thanks next question operator our next question comes from colin sebastian of robert w baird your line is open colin sebastian thanks guys i had a couple of questions first with the active buyer activity picking up i wonder if you’re seeing a corresponding increase in seller activity not only in terms of number of sellers but more granular metrics such as number of listings per seller or something like that and then secondly as a followup on the advertising strategy devin are you closer to the point now where some of the investment in the brand initiatives at the top of the spending funnel can graduate towards more of a transactional or a direct response effort and if that’s the case how quickly should we expect to see the benefits of that shift in volume devin wenig yeah two good questions so let’s start with active buyers on the seller side we’re seeing a really nice acceleration of the number of sellers on ebay it’s the second straight quarter of acceleration so we’re seeing a lot of small and mediumsized businesses start selling on ebay for the first time we’re really happy about that i also talked about brands while we’re acquiring a lot of smbs and small sellers we’re also starting to acquire brands at an increasing pace which is excellent i am really pleased about that so listings i think what’s interesting is over time listings as structured data penetrates our site and our experiences listings will become a less important metric than products will we’re not quite there yet but i’ll just give you one example so listings are growing but we’re working with sellers to take duplicates now and we’ve been pretty aggressive about that right now because it clutters the site and it depresses conversion so listings might not linearly or exponentially keep going up there may be periods when it comes down but we’re actually adding the number of products so the most important thing are sellers and inventory and both are increasing at an accelerated pace visavis marketing colin we’re doing both at the same time so we’re doing the brand and there’s a significant amount of consideration work that’s implicit in the brand but we’re also doing a lot of the normal advertising that we do which is buy this and you saw some very active over the last several weeks selling our deals selling deals that are in our price match program so it’s all of the above and that’s implicit in our expectation of further acceleration in the second half colin sebastian thank you devin wenig thanks next question operator our next question comes from richard kramer of arete research your line is open richard kramer yeah thanks very much two quick questions first of all looks as if your principal competitor is very aggressively ramping sponsored listings in p ads can you give us a bit of an update of where you are in this transition from the p ads that are sort of rolling off of mso to the p ads that should be boosting marketplace growth and is that a significant factor in the second half of the year and then just another question just in the uk we’ve seen a number of instances where new management was reaching out and visiting sellers especially maybe in response to some things like mandating the standard images rather than the watermarked ones and can you comment on sort of your balance of sellers and do you see if you will a larger number of sellers sort of graduating to being more professional sellers on ebay or are you still in the funnel where you’re trying to bring new sellers on at the very early stage if that makes some sense devin wenig it does two indiscernible so our firstparty advertising business is a big priority we think it’s a really good opportunity and it is growing rapidly it is also small and it is not a major factor in our second half guidance so implicit in our guidance is standard gmv the way we’ve historically defined it will continue to improve but with that said we haven’t backed down on the p opportunity at all this quarter we continue to expand the skus that are available the number of sellers it’s available to and an example is in our latest seller release some core anchor stores got credits for promoted listing and that’s about to activate and they’re about to start using those credits to further enhance the penetration of p ads so we’re kind of in a yearoveryear – really acceleration here indiscernible keep in mind our commitment to the ecosystem was while this ramps we’re also going to take down thirdparty ads that bring people off of ebay and then as an example you heard in scott’s remarks this quarter we took down our off ebay plas entirely in the us so in the mso line you’re seeing a little bit of mix shift between transaction revenue and mso and if you net the two you’re not yet seeing the type of growth that we’re seeing on the left side of the ledger if you will because on the right side of the ledger we’re taking down ads that suppress gmv and make the ecosystem less healthy and we’ll keep doing that until we get to the place where those bleed off and then we’re just in the growth phase of the p ad strategy on the uk thing i wouldn’t – look we are still bringing in a lot of small businesses and in many ways that’s the heart and soul of our company and we’ll continue to focus on them i don’t – i’ve never viewed it as one or the other i’ve never viewed it as a large professional seller can’t sell right alongside a very small momandpop seller even a consumer to me that’s what is unique about ebay what’s unique about ebay is the seller base in the inventory and we’re actually leaning into that to make sure that we don’t end up as a metoo to any other competitor but we occupy a very distinct place in the ecommerce world and it’s for that reason that we’re being more aggressive than ever reaching out to small sellers and a great example of this is the shopify deal where shopify has got lots of small merchants will bring onto our platform and you’ll see other activities in the second half of us getting more aggressive in small seller acquisition thanks for the question next question operator next question comes from paul bieber of credit suisse your question please paul bieber great thank you for taking my question first off i was wondering how we should think about this trajectory of gross margins through the rest of the year given the investment in p in korea and then secondly on the classified business why is that such an important part of the ebay portfolio and i was hoping you could walk us through the synergies between classifieds and the marketplace business devin wenig yeah on gross margin i think it’s more the same i think you’ll continue – we’ll continue to see the dynamics with our ticketbis business along with first party from korea and so those dynamics i don’t expect a massive shift between first half to second but it will continue to be the factor in our overall gross margin on classifieds we’re the world’s leader in consumer selling and it just happens to be the classified as a format for consumer selling we sell globally we allow consumers to access global consumers and we allow them to access local consumers but both of those are important it happens to be we’ve organized it as a business unit but it is part and parcel and core to our business to directly answer your question around synergies the synergies are getting more and more every quarter because we’ve comingled the inventory now so our buyers can see the best inventory whether or not it ends up being listed on a classified format or on core ebay format so we talked about that integration two quarters ago and we’ve seen gmv each quarter improve since we’ve rolled it out two quarters ago so to me this absolutely core part of ebay we’re good at it we’ve grown it over a decade and it wouldn’t have grown the way it has grown if not for being part of our business scott schenkel yeah i mean we talk about classifieds and ebay as two different platforms because they’re two different sites but the fact of the matter is we go after the same segment consumer segment as devin talked about and so increasingly what you’re seeing in each of the – in some of the major markets is a blending of that inventory to try and make sure that we’re addressing customer needs across to do different sites and platforms and i think it’s been very successful and it’s always been a gotomarket strategy together in their respective markets paul bieber thank you devin wenig next question operator our next question comes from justin post of bank of america your question please justin post great i guess my questions are all around margins can you first say if there’s any unusual items in your margins this year that are depressing them x – excluding fx and then on fx if the exchange rates start to level off or even improve would that help your margins next year and then finally can you quantify how big that korea first party business is for revenue just thinking about the impact on marketplace revenues and also what the impact is on gross margins thank you devin wenig yeah i mean the first party – i’m going to breakout korea first party it’s not in the greater scheme of things a massive contributor on dollars on a yearoveryear basis it’s been growing nicely and does impact gross margins and that’s why we’ve called it out with respect to margins a couple of things as i called out foreign exchange was  basis points of the – was  basis points of the  versus prior year decline in margins the rest of the decline was really driven by investments in and the integration of ticketbis and so at a broad level if you want to call that an unusual that’s a yearoveryear change that’s driving most of it but similar to the last couple of years we’ve offset many of the investments that we’ve been making to accelerate growth via leverageproductivity and so i feel like as we look at the first half of the year there’s always unusuals we’ve called out ticketbis in this case but the fact of the matter is i think we’ve done a reasonably good job of operationally trading off the investments with productivity recognizing that we do have that ticketbis acquisition and foreign exchange maybe a bit more dynamic and get to your other question about foreign exchange if you look at the last two years those dynamics aren’t that dissimilar with the ad that i would put in here which is we had a standup costs in the first year of separation and so again a little bit of an unusual as we stood the company up as a standalone entity as we look at year to year we’re able to offset much of the foreign exchange impact the gains that we recorded historically in line and now that will be in revenue as i called out in my remarks but over time a stronger us dollar will pressure our margin rate and over time a weaker will help but it’s going to be muted on both sides if not eliminated with our hedging programs justin post great thank you devin wenig next question operator our next question comes from brian nowak of morgan stanley your line is open brian nowak thanks for taking my questions i have two the first one on the us the gmv continues to accelerate nicely in the marketplace i was wondering if you can just talk to any specific categories in particular that are driving that strength in the us growth and then the second one on the seller side devin as you think about the seller services are there any specific examples of new services that you’ve rolled out this year that had a positive impact on the seller growth or seller selection or anything just so we can think about what you’ve learned in kind of new seller services yeartodate devin wenig on acceleration in market places we have seen nice progress in fashion we’ve seen nice progress in electronics we’ve seen nice progress in home and garden to some extent the investments we’re making are horizontal they have lifted the water line for all of our categories but i’d say we’re particularly excited in the second half about fashion electronics and home and garden as we approach the holiday season in the second half on seller services the way that i look at what we’re doing for our bigger sellers who need – who generally take more services is we’re beginning to package the suite of services like seller hub with an increasingly rich data profile and that’s becoming part of our store subscription so you can almost think of it as the store subscription is almost seller loyalty plan where they’re paying us a fee for that they’re getting both price benefits to listing plus a set of services like data and inventory management in the new products that we launched within the last year so we’re not yet offering other services to those sellers but i think we’ll see as that expands over time if there are other products and services that they want that we can begin to add more and more value to our stores that’s the way we kind of looked at the commercial model visavis our larger sellers scott schenkel and if you go back to some of the conversations we’ve had in the last few quarters we’ve invested a lot in structured data and we’ve invested a lot in new experiences and i think you’re seeing that pay off in our parts and accessories experience which is also where we’re seeing nice growth in very differentiated based on the experiences that we’ve developed brian nowak great thanks devin wenig next question our next question comes from mark may of citi your question please mark may thanks a lot you q guidance obviously implies further revenue acceleration despite a – i think it’s  basis point tougher comp and despite as you mentioned the continued headwinds from stubhub did the company exit q andor are you entering q seeing this acceleration and that’s what’s giving you the confidence to provide that outlook or are there some things that you plan to do or see throughout the quarter that’s driving that expectation for improved growth going forward and then just quickly on the comment regarding q revenue potentially being above your guidance if fx rates hold can you just clarify that comment is that because you’re using maybe a different fx assumption in your guidance thanks devin wenig i won’t get into the kind of where we are at this week but i would say that we’re seeing improved  we’re generally seeing improvement in all the metrics that we want to see we’re seeing as time goes on and as we penetrate more and more with our strategy our new product our better customer experiences we’re seeing buyers traffic and conversion improve and it’s that that gives us the confidence to give the guidance that we gave so i won’t get into this week versus last week but i would say this business has gotten healthier consistently over time it’s not always perfectly linear but we think we know and we expect to see the continuation of that and we also expect to see acceleration in the second half we’re going to go faster with a lot of the foundation now in place and i’m seeing the results we’re hoping for we’re going to go accelerate and go faster so it’s  that’s implicit in it and i just say visàvis the revenue growth scott will talk about the fx the gmv acceleration is the primary driver of the revenue acceleration they tend to go in lockstep scott schenkel as i mentioned in my prepared remarks if fx rates remain where they are today then all i was calling out was that the revenue dollars that we report at the end of the year would be at or above really above the high end of the range that said the organic fx neutral growth rate of  to  remains and that’s driven by the dynamics we just talked about devin wenig operator we will take one more question operator yes sir our final question comes from ron josey of jmp securities your line is open ron josey great thanks for taking the question i wanted to go back a little bit to the new homepage and the product and devin you talked about lower bounce rates and better engagement rates from the new homepage are you seeing the same on mobile with the mobile product pages launched and if you could comment around mobile conversion rates as well that would be helpful thank you devin wenig it’s a little bit different because the homepage is obviously a different experience on mobile than it is on the desktop but what i would say is that historically for everyone’s ecommerce business mobile conversion is less than desktop conversion but we’re seeing improvements in mobile conversion alongside the improvements of the desktop from a lower base but we’re seeing the improvements as we begin to roll the structured data experiences out to mobile as well so sco on mobile is driven just the same by structured data experiences our product pages are now in our native app and in our mobile web experience so it’s moving right along at the same yes mobile is less than desktop but it is for everyone and we’re seeing it move up lockstep with the desktop so we’re pretty pleased by that no real difference depending on the floor mat ron josey thank you operator thank you and ladies and
