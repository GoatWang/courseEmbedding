equityholders the ercot market is highly competitive we have approximately  competitors that include generation companies affiliated with texasbased utilities independent power producers municipal and cooperative generators owners of cogeneration plants and wholesale power marketers we are an independent power producer which means that we generate power generation companies affiliated with utilities are power producers that are affiliated with utilities municipal and cooperative generators also generate power but use most of it to deliver power to their municipal or cooperative power customers owners of cogeneration plants produce power primarily for their own consumption wholesale power marketers do not own generation rather they buy power from generators or other market participants and resell it to retail providers or other market participants these competitors compete with each other and us by buying and selling wholesale power in the ercot market entering into bilateral contracts andor selling to aggregated retail customers competition in the ercot market is affected by among other factors the amount of generation and transmission capacity in the market as of september   our plants including our share of stp provided approximately  of the aggregate net generation capacity serving the ercot market according to ercot the independent system operator for the electric market that services  of the electric demand in texas we are the secondlargest generation company within the ercot market and the largest owner of power plants in the ercot markets houston zone based on total capacity we participate in three zones in the ercot market which we believe benefits our solidfuel baseload plants and is a source of competitive advantage for our business our competition is based primarily on price but we also may compete based on product flexibility product flexibility means for example that rather than selling power for delivery  days a week  hours a day  days a year we can shape the product for a customers needs such as selling power for delivery only during the peak hours of consumption our gasfired units allow us to design and sell products for customers who have an obligation to meet load and need to shape their power purchase to match their load as it increases and decreases the ercot market has had a very significant period of development of new power plants since january  and hence currently has reserve margins that have exceeded  according to information published by ercot most of these plants were new combined cycle natural gasfired plants and have not affected the dispatch of our solidfuel baseload plants we do not expect the growth of the generation supply in the ercot market to continue at the rate it has since  according to data published by the public utility commission of texas  was the last year expected to see such growth with about  mw added last year and approximately  of previously announced new generation capacity equivalent to  mw has been canceled or postponed since  company description we are a wholesale electric power generation company engaged in the ownership and operation of a diverse portfolio of power plants in the state of texas according to the electric reliability council of texas the independent system operator for the electric market that services  of the electric demand in texas we are the secondlargest generation company within that market and the largest owner of power plants in the houston zone of that market based on total generation capacity we sell power and related products to wholesale purchasers such as retail electric providers power trading organizations municipal utilities electric power cooperatives and other power generation companies we currently own  operating generation units at nine power generation plants including an undivided  interest in two nuclear generation units at south texas project electric generating station our generation plants are diversified across fuel sources technology and geographic regions within the electric reliability council of texas market the substantial majority of our revenues and cash flows are realized from the sale of power from eight units at our three solid fuel coal lignite and uranium power plants  w a parish limestone and south texas project electric generating station because generation units are generally dispatched in order of lowest cost and approximately  of the net generation capacity in our market is from highercost natural gasfired units we expect these eight baseload units to operate nearly  of the time they are available our management team has implemented a strategy of creating a stable base of operating cash flows through a combination of forward fixed price power sales natural gas price swap agreements which have the effect of hedging the price we would receive for additional future power sales and therefore our revenues and forward solid fuel and fuel transportation purchases as of august   we had hedged the price we will receive for approximately  of the power that we expect to generate at our solidfuel baseload units from  through including  under fixed price power sales contracts and  using natural gas price swap agreements these forward power sales and natural gas price swap agreements combined with sales and price swaps in  represent approximately  billion in total future revenues in addition we had contracted to purchase at future dates under fixed price contracts with contractuallyspecified price adjustments enough solid fuel to provide for approximately  of our expected generation from our solidfuel baseload plants from  through  we believe that the stable cash flows generated by this combination of forward power sales and natural gas price swap agreements and forward solid fuel and fuel transportation purchases create a strong platform for growth in our equity value initially through reducing the level of debt in our capital structure and ultimately through additions to our generation business in texas and expansion into other attractive markets in addition our portfolio of natural gasfired units that serve the houston market provides opportunities for us to capture additional revenues through offering capacity or similar products to retail electric providers and others selling power at prevailing market prices during periods of peak demand and providing ancillary services in support of system reliability as of june   the aggregate net generation capacity of our portfolio of operating assets was  mw of which  mw represented the generation capacity of our solidfuel baseload plants our three lowcost and efficient solidfuel baseload plants produced  of our total megawatt hours sold for the twelve months ended june   giving pro forma effect to the acquisitions of our generation plants including our acquisition of an additional  undivided interest in south texas project electric generating station and generated a substantial majority of our revenues and cash flow see businessour generation plants for more information about our portfolio of generation plants for the twelve months ended june   giving

offering as if these transactions had occurred on july   we had revenues of  million income before minority interest of  and net income of   recent initiatives since we signed definitive documentation in july  to acquire texas genco holdings inc from centerpoint energy inc our new management team has undertaken a variety of initiatives to materially enhance the value of our business including º executing new forward power sales and natural gas price swap agreements at attractive prices that we expect will generate an additional  billion of revenues through  º implementing initiatives that we expect will reduce annual operation and maintenance expenses after fiscal  by approximately  million as compared to our pro forma operation and maintenance expenses of  million which includes approximately  million of annual expenses for our additional  ownership interest in the south texas project electric generating station acquired may   for the twelve months ended june   through a
