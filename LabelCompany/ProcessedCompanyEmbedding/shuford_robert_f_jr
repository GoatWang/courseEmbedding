board of old point national bank last year he helped the banks net interest income grow by  percent and was chosen to serve as the  chair of the virginia peninsula chamber of commerceshuford chief operating officer director and senior executive vice president of old point national bank has been with the bank since  prior to that he earned a degree in biomedical engineering from duke university and worked in the biomedical fieldhe is also a graduate of the virginia bankers association school of bank management the civic leadership institute and the bai graduate school of bank operations and technology shufords father robert f shuford sr has been executive chairman president and chief executive officer at old point financial corp the parent company of the bank since  the elder shuford also serves as the chairman of old point national bankrob shuford as the younger banker is called talked about his banking career his role this year with the chamber and what he does when hes not at the bank or a community functionin  he looks forward to actively watching the peninsula and greater hampton roads economy growon the peninsula we have a wealth of resources such as the jefferson lab nasa and the national institute of aerospace so theres no reason why the peninsula cant be no  in the state for technology startups we have some work to do  but thats our missionwhat got you interested in banking did you feel like it was something you had to doi had previously been working in the us military as a naval officer and then in the biomedical engineering field my wife and i decided to move back to virginia when she was pregnant with our third child and i was looking for a changebanking offers a diverse landscape in regards to leadership and business skills and it encompasses everything you would find at a typical business its a really rich business career as far as the type of skills you can usei had an opportunity to get into banking on the technology and operations side so i could transfer the skills that i used in the military and biomedical startup companiesi was able to add a whole bunch of stuff to my repertoire its a really interesting career because anything you can find in any other business career you can find in bankingwhat have been some challenges youve faced in banking in the past year what do you expect for the last several years have been challenging for all banks because of the economy in hampton roads weve been slow to recover weve seen unique challenges because of our reliance on the government and the department of defense weve been hit hard with sequestrationin the past two years weve seen progress across the boards and were seeing that  wont show any major leaps forward but more of a slow progression of improvement across all sectorsold point had a successful year with a  percent increase in net income what contributed to thatgrowth in loans when the economy was not as good and loan volume was hard to come by the assets were primary in lowyielding securities so weve moved more assets from securities to loanswe also saw improvement because of a reduction in net interest expenses weve had a definite strategy to increase the amount of relationship money the entire team has been focusing on relationship money because it has a much lower cost and it brings in other relationships such as positional loans our focus is relationshiporiented bankinghow did you become involved in the peninsula chamberold point has always been a supporter of the peninsula chamber and the other area chambers i got involved a number of years ago and have always enjoyed being on the board and i rotated on and off for a while when kasia grzelkowski president and ceo of versability resources was the chair she wanted to take the board in a different direction and she asked me to join the boardwe are working very diligently with mike kuhns president ceo and secretary of the virginia peninsula chamber of commerce who is just amazing to raise the credibility of the virginia peninsula chamber of commercewhat are some goals for the peninsula chamber this yearwe want to improve the overall business environment on the peninsula so were looking at some of the root causes for why we have a low startup rate we want to foster discussions on how we can make it easier for startups to grow because thats the engine behind the economy in any area we have a great deal of programs that center around creating startups and we have all kinds of courses to help create a business plan and support growth as well as a great leadership programlead peninsula is a great program for middle level management and it promotes leadership in the business community were also very focused on activities around young people until we are able to bring the best and brightest back to the peninsula then we cant live up to the peninsulas potential we have the youth leaderships institutes and the young entrepreneurs academy yea which exposes young people to creating and executing a real business plan we think programs like that will reach out to young people and expose them to the richness of the peninsula so they feel more connected professionally to the peninsula and will look to come back home after college or military trainingcan we expect to see a continued relationship between the peninsula chamber and the hampton roads chamberwe have a good partnership with the hampton roads chamber of commerce my coworker joe witt who is the senior executive vice president at old point is the  chair of the hampton roads chamber of commerce our offices at the old point headquarters in hampton are right next to each other so were always talking to each other were always looking for ways to partner together and one organization with great potential is the hampton roads regional council the council is a place where leaders of the chambers and other local organizations update each other on local efforts joe and i are now both part of that organization and were looking for ways to create unity in the regionthe peninsula chamber and the hampton roads chamber will continue to meet jointly a few times a year which fosters a lot of friendships and networking opportunities between members on the peninsula and those on the southsidewhat are you looking forward to in i think the same thing that everyone is  an overall improving economy with hampton roads being so dependent on military and government our recovery hasnt been as strong as other areas we need to make it easier to do business and create our own engine for economic growth that isnt reliant on the governmenti think hampton roads has an amazing wealth of resources between the port and newport news shipbuilding and were strong players in modeling and simulation and with nasa and the national institute of aerospace there is no reason why hampton roads cant come roaring back from the recession and reinvent hampton roadsim a big believer in the hampton roads community foundations reinvent hampton roads headed by debbie dicroce and i think they are looking to do great thingshow do you spend your free timethese days it
