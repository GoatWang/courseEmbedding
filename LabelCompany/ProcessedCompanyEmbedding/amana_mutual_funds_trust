software interest free islamic home partnership program  guidance residential  menu  my account declining balance coownership program guidance residential is the  us provider of shariahcompliant home financing our declining balance coownership program is modeled on the islamic concept of ‘musharakah mutanaqisa’ or diminishing partnership the program has been certified by an independent shariah supervisory board which performs an annual audit to ensure absolute compliance with shariah in this model guidance residential and the homebuyer engage in a joint ownership venture where each owns a percentage of the home equal to the equity they each contributed homebuyers are required to make monthly payments to guidance residential over a predetermined period of time in order to completely buy out guidance residential’s equity and own the property outright the monthly payment consists of two portions an amount that is allocated for acquisition of guidance residential’s equity and the other allocated as rent for use of the portion of the home they do not yet own the acquisition amount helps in buying guidance residential’s shares of ownership over the predetermined period of time and the rent is the profit guidance residential earns from this coownership program read more   unique benefits of the program guidance residential offers  unique benefits that distinguish it from other home financing providers these benefits provide a transparent consumer friendly home financing and is consistent with the muslim faith’s strict prohibition on riba usury coownership guidance residential and home buyers each own a percentage as coowners home buyers increase their share over a period of time through a monthly payment risk sharing guidance residential shares the risk with the home buyer in case of natural disasters eminent domain or foreclosure ribafree the declining balance coownership program does not involve payment of interest it is  ribafree no prepayment penalty there is no prepayment penalty required by guidance residential when a home buyer wants to pay ahead of the agreed schedule capped late payment fees in case of late payments guidance residential charges only a capped fee equaling  or less exclusively meant to cover the expenses involved in administering a late payment rather than the standard  penalty nonrecourse commitment in the event of payment default guidance residential does not pursue any of the home buyer’s other assets the guidance residential difference a comparison of musharaka or declining balance coownership program to a conventional mortgage shariahcompliant declining balance coownership program conventional mortgages the home buyer and guidance residential agree to be coowners in the property  the home buyer arranges a loan from a bank or mortgage company according to a fixed or floating interest rate the two parties buy the home and the ownership of the property is determined by each party’s down payment  the home buyer purchases the home the home buyer makes monthly payments to guidance residential part of the payment is a utility fee for full use of the home and the rest is a payment to increase the buyers ownership in the property  the home buyer makes monthly payments to repay principal and interest on the loan over the course of the arrangement the home buyer purchases all of guidance residential’s ownership stake and becomes the sole owner of the property  over the course of the loan the home buyer repays the debt in full endorsements from eminent thinkers find out more about what scholars in islamic doctrine have to say about guidance residential’s declining balance coownership program                 fatwa or certifications of the program learn more about the legal opinion provided by

due on their wealth to return whatever was given them in trust and have enough savings to bear the expenses of the journey such as travel hajj tax and lodging and the sacrifice of an animal besides this they also have to provide for their families and dependents during their absence they must have earned and saved enough to cover these expenses no hajj is valid if it is performed on credit

homefunds  performanceamana mutual funds trusthalal investing following principles of islamic finance halal investing halal investing requires investment decisions to be made in accordance with islamic principles as a faithbased approach to investment management investors often consider halal investing to be a category of ethical or socially responsible investing islamic principles require that investors share in profit and loss that they receive no interest riba and that they do not invest in a business that is prohibited by islamic law or sharia before investing in a company it is necessary to evaluate its business activities and financial records to determine where its primary revenue comes from and how its income and expenditures are managed a company that meets certain criteria would be halal or permissible if it does not meet the criteria it would be haram or not permitted interpretation of islamic law as applied to business activities is nuanced and halal investment guidelines can vary therefore muslim investors often rely on guidance from islamic scholars to help determine whether an investment is halal investments that sharia scholars universally consider unacceptable are companies whose primary business activities violate the core tenets of islam including the manufacture or marketing of alcohol gambling or gaming activities conventional interestbased financial services pork and pork products and pornography in addition most sharia scholars advise against investing in tobacco companies islamic scholars have established financial guidelines to determine when a business activity is a core source of revenue and when it is not for example the five percent rule says that a core business activity is one that accounts for more than five percent of a companys revenue or gross income this reasoning applies to the islamic prohibition on riba or interest as well if a companys interestbased income or holdings exceed certain limits then investing in the company is forbidden often it is not possible to avoid haram business activities islamic law requires purification of investment earnings that can be attributed to haram activities one way to do this is through zakah a form of charitable giving that can help you cleanse impure investment income by giving it away to acceptable charitable causes for more information on zakah and how saturna capital can help please refer to our zakah page halal investment screening halal investment screens help assess whether a companys business activities are halal or haram the screens facilitate the elimination of haram investments from consideration halal investing screens seek to eliminate bonds and other interestbased investments stocks of companies that have high debt sometimes referred to as highly leveraged securities of companies in industries that do not adhere to islamic principles such as liquor gambling pornography pork insurance banks etc mutual funds or hedge funds that trade securities frequently have high turnover rates because frequent trading is seen as gambling by some islamic scholars saturna capital adviser to the amana funds employs proprietary screens and an investment process developed in collaboration with islamic scholars of the fiqh council of north america fcna a nonprofit organization serving the muslim community in addition to the business sector screens listed above saturna capital applies the following financial screens seeking to eliminate companies with greater than five percent of their revenue coming from haram sources greater than  percent total debt as compared to their market capitalization trailing  month average greater than  percent accounts receivable as compared to their total assets trailing  month average if a company fails the screening process it is considered an unacceptable investment however halal investment screening is not always straightforward when considering whether an investment is halal it is necessary to look deeply into a companys business activities to discover its core sources of revenue or how it actually makes its money a companys industry sector or part of the economy to which it belongs may not always tell you the whole story a computer software company may write programs used in gambling a company that publishes childrens books may also produce books that are considered pornographic an agricultural producer might sell its crops exclusively to breweries on the surface each of these companies may not appear to be haram but a closer examination reveals otherwise saturnas investment analysts use neptune® software developed inhouse by saturna to screen grade and monitor more than  securities traded worldwide monthly securities that receive an a grade are subject to further indepth review prior to purchase the halal investment process does not end with a securitys purchase we monitor the securities in the amana funds portfolios for ongoing compliance with halal investing criteria and sell if they fail screens at a later date benefits and risks of halal investing investing according to islamic principles can offer many benefits to muslims and nonmuslims alike halal investing encourages a disciplined investment process that promotes indepth security research and monitoring generally the low debt requirements of islamic screens facilitate a conservative approach that appeals to riskaverse investors halal investing discourages shortterm speculation the low turnover required in halal investment portfolios results in longer planned holding periods and close scrutiny of company financials low turnover also minimizes portfolio trading expenses such as broker commissions while increasing tax efficiency by avoiding rapid buying and selling of securities that can generate taxable capital gains the limitations imposed on investment opportunities by islamic principles potentially creates risk for example among the securities researched monthly by saturna capital for the amana funds less than half pass the initial screens necessary to be considered halal restricting investment choices to a smaller universe means that a halal portfolio may not be as diversified as other portfolios which may increase the risk of loss the returns from various market sectors rise and fall at different times islamic principles may limit opportunities to gain when prohibited market sectors such as financial services rally because islamic principles preclude the use of interestpaying investments halal cash reserves cannot be invested in traditional money market funds or deposited in an interestearning bank account and therefore do not earn income halal mutual funds in  dr m yaqub mirza suggested the idea to create the first us mutual fund managed according to islamic principles which became the amana income fund as an active member of a muslim investing group mirza found it difficult and timeconsuming to vet securities for his own halal portfolios he felt a professional investment advisory firm with greater collective expertise and resources would be better suited to carry out the complex islamic screening process he also felt a mutual fund would be the ideal halal investment vehicle because its structure ensures that investors share in profit and loss today a variety of halal investment products serve the needs of muslim investors including the original amana income fund started in  the amana growth fund started in  and the amana developing world fundstarted in

applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns

structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over

perfect mutual fundapr  about amana mutual amagx mycroft friedrich research analyst newsletter provider contrarian longterm horizonmarketplacefriedrich global researchsummaryperforms a quantitative analysis of the amana growth fund using some unique free cash flow ratioscompares the results to the sp  index and the powershares qqq etfallows one to practice capital appreciation through capital preservation recently i wrote an article on seeking alpha called how to value your portfolio on main street vs wall street that explains how our friedrich algorithm can take any list of stocks indices or specific portfolios and analyze each on main street and wall street using some unique free cash flow ratios friedrich is the name given to our algorithm for analyzing companies that trade on the global stock markets in creating friedrich we concentrated on analyzing each companys main street operations and compared those results to wall streets own valuation as measured by market price through our friedrich algorithm we can analyze  years of balance sheet income statement and cash flow statement data for each company all at once and generate one final result in minutes friedrich was designed to be ultra conservative and thus will cut zero slack to any company under analysis and will do so with zero emotion in this article we will be analyzing the amana growth fund mutfamagx and compare its results to those of the sp  index nysearcaspy and the powershares qqq etf nasdaqqqq here is the link to the fund manager the following is a performance chart of the amana growth fund versus the powershares qqq etf and the sp  index from a wall street performance point of view the amana growth fund has dramatically outperformed the sp  index and the powershares qqq etf since  almost doubling the performance of the sp  index and more than doubling that of the powershares qqq etf now if we look at the following below you will see that what the amana growth fund has achieved is very rare as only about  of mutual funds have been able to beat the sp  index over the last  years thus the amana growth fund is in a very select group as an investor it is very important to continuously analyze ones holdings by measuring your portfolios main street performance versus its wall street valuation whether you are a portfolio manager in charge of  billion in assets or a small investor with a  portfolio the concept is always the same you as an investor should always know where your portfolio stands at all times and thus not be swayed by groupthink by doing so you are always practicing capital appreciation through capital preservation well how does one go about doing so before i present our final results for the amana growth fund versus the sp  index and the powershares qqq etf let us first explain how we compare main street performance to wall street valuation we will do so by using our friedrich global research system the main street ratio we use in our analysis is called froic which can be defined as main street analysis  froic froic means free cash flow return on invested capital forward free cash flow  net income  depreciation   revenue growth rate  capital spending  when doing our free cash flow calculation please note that because capital spending is recorded in the cash flow statement as a negative result and we therefore must add it in order to subtract it properly froic  forward free cash flowlongterm debt  shareholders equity what the froic ratio does is tell us how much forward free cash flow the company is generating on main street relative to how much total capital it has employed so if a company invests  in total capital on main street and generates  in forward free cash flow it therefore has a froic of  which we consider excellent this is just one of the key ratios  in total we use to identify how a company is performing on main street as it is our belief that if a company is making a killing on main street this news will eventually show up on wall streets radar for our wall street analysis we use our pricetobernhard buffett ratio wall street analysis  pricetobernhard buffett fcf many years ago while reading berkshire hathaways nyse brka nyse brkb  letter to shareholders i discovered a ratio which mr buffett entitled owner earnings or what we may consider to be mr buffetts version of free cash flow to my amazement in that little footnote mr buffett explains how to use it and basically states that it is one of the key ratios that he and charlie munger used in analyzing stocks in that article he defined the term owner earnings as the cash that is generated by the companys business operations owner earnings represent a reported earnings plus b depreciation depletion amortization and certain other noncash charges less c the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment etc that the business requires to fully maintain its longterm competitive position and its unit volume i have used this free cash flow ratio for decades using data from the value line investment survey whose founder was arnold bernhard mr bernhard was a big fan of free cash flow and probably introduced it sooner than mr buffett did i know this as i was able to calculate the fcf ratio using old value lines sheets for my year backtest of the djia from  to  in the backtest i mentioned above i demonstrated that if one can purchase a company whose shares are selling for  times or less its pricetofree cash flow ratio the probability of success will dramatically increase in most cases i have renamed the ratio the bernhard buffett free cash flow ratio in honor of both men the following is how each ratio below is calculated pricetobernhard buffett free cash flow ratio  sherlock debt divisornet income per share  depreciation per share  capital spending per diluted share sherlock debt divisor  market price per share  working capital longterm debtdiluted shares outstanding sherlock debt divisor a major concern that i have these days in analyzing companies is the amount of debt each takes on relative to its operations and whether management is abusing this situation by taking on more debt than it requires debt when used wisely allows for what is called leverage and leverage can be extremely beneficial within certain parameters on the other side of the coin the use of debt also can be excessive and put a companys future in jeopardy so what i have done to determine if a companys debt policy is beneficial or abusive is to create the sherlock debt divisor what the divisor does is punish companies that use debt unwisely and reward those that successfully use debt as leverage how do i do this well i take a companys working capital and subtract its longterm debt if a company has a lot more working capital than longterm debt i reward it and punish those whose longterm debt exceeds its working capital so if this result is higher than the current stock market price then leverage is being used and the more leveraged a company is the worse the results of this ratio will be and the less attractive its stock will be as an investment thus having successfully defined the sherlock debt divisor i thought i would give an example of how it works by analyzing the largest holding in the amana growth fund which is apple inc nasdaqaapl in order to do that we need the following bits of financial data in order to calculate it for apple ttm for those who dont know is trailing  months or as close to real time data as we can get based on when each company reports market price per share   at time of analysis working capital  total current assets  total current liabilities total current assets   total current liabilities   working capital   longterm debt   diluted shares outstanding   sherlock debt divisor  market price per share  working capital  longterm debtdiluted shares outstanding sherlock debt divisor       sherlock debt divisor       since apple has more longterm debt versus working capital we therefore must punish it and use the new  as our new numerator in all our calculations having calculated the sherlock debt divisor for apple let us now proceed and do a pricetobernhard buffett analysis for the company pricetobernhard buffett fcf ratio  sherlock debt divisornet income per share  depreciation per share  capital spending per diluted share sherlock debt divisor   net income per diluted share     depreciation per diluted share     capital spending per diluted share            pricetobernhard buffett free cash flow ratio    now that we have taught everyone how to calculate our pricetobernhard buffett free cash flow ratio let us now move on and teach everyone how to calculate our froic ratio using apple again as our example this is how we calculate it froic means free cash flow return on invested capital forward free cash flow  net income  depreciation   revenue growth rate  capital spending froic  forward free cash flowlongterm debt  shareholders equity net income per diluted share     depreciation per diluted share     capital spending per diluted share      revenue growth rate ttm           longterm debt   shareholders equity   diluted shares outstanding   froic  forward free cash flow per diluted sharelongterm debt  shareholders equitydiluted shares outstanding    froic   now that we have defined the ratios to be used in our analysis and have showed everyone how to calculate each of them here is a complete analysis of the individual components of the amana growth fund when analyzing the amana growth funds components we set up certain rules to use when analyzing any group of stocks which you should also follow when analyzing ones own portfolio using our methodology if a stock has a negative froic result we automatically assign it a score of  for its pricetobernhard buffett fcf ratio in order to keep everything consistent and logical as you cant have a negative pricetobernhard buffett fcf ratio when analyzing portfolios then at the same time the maximum froic allowed is  so we can keep everything consistent and logical as well as anything higher distorts the results for the group we also give a zero result for froic for any cash position in the portfolio and a  result for the pricetobuffett free cash flow which is  buy   sell     this was done to force one never to feel comfortable in cash unless one has no choice in the matter which is the case for us now our realtime research clearly shows that the markets are overvalued as measured by our analysis of the following the final results for the entire the amana growth fund are froic   main street pricetobernhard buffett fcf   wall street the final results for the entire sp  index are froic   main street pricetobernhard buffett fcf   wall street the final results for the entire the powershares qqq etf are froic   main street pricetobernhard buffett fcf   wall street for froic we consider any result above  to be excellent and any result above  to be good so when we round off the  froic for the amana growth fund we get  which is considered excellent and tells us that as a group on main street the holdings of the fund are doing great the fund also generated a score of  for our pricetobernhard buffett fcf ratio that ratio considers a stock a bargain when it trades under  times and overbought when it trades over  times therefore the fund is not yet overbought but is sure getting close to being so nevertheless on main street the amana growth fund has the highest froic score main street performance that we have ever seen for a fund or etf but having said that the word perfect can only be found in the dictionary and not in real life so let us say it is the best fund so far the funds holdings are great but most are overbought and that is because the us markets are overbought as well so the rising tides just keep rising and are lifting all boats in the process our model portfolios which are available to our premium subscribers here on seeking alphas marketplace use cash as a way to hedge against market overvaluation and our conservative portfolio has a  froic currently while our more aggressive one has a froic of  thus our subscribers dont need to invest in funds or etfs as our friedrich algorithm generates elite model portfolios that are filled with main street super stars we also bought most of them at attractive price to bernhard buffet wall street valuations as we enter more countries we will eventually launch our global portfolio very soon picking stocks from  countries for those of you who want to go international going forward our friedrich algorithms results show that it might be safer to invest in apple inc rather than the amana growth fund as apple has a very strong track record of consistency as shown by our friedrich datafile and friedrich chart below in addition to our friedrich algorithm i rely on a tool that i found to be very useful in verifying our work the forensic accounting stock tracker fast model helps identify companies that may be resorting to more financial tricks to make analyst estimates the model helps pinpoint where management might be aggressive with revenue recognition cash flows and the balance sheet and also takes into account valuation and other metrics here is the fast models results for apple delvecchiojd in conclusion it is my belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies and my hope is that you may add these ratios to your own investor tool box in order to help you

software interest free islamic home partnership program  guidance residential  menu  my account declining balance coownership program guidance residential is the  us provider of shariahcompliant home financing our declining balance coownership program is modeled on the islamic concept of ‘musharakah mutanaqisa’ or diminishing partnership the program has been certified by an independent shariah supervisory board which performs an annual audit to ensure absolute compliance with shariah in this model guidance residential and the homebuyer engage in a joint ownership venture where each owns a percentage of the home equal to the equity they each contributed homebuyers are required to make monthly payments to guidance residential over a predetermined period of time in order to completely buy out guidance residential’s equity and own the property outright the monthly payment consists of two portions an amount that is allocated for acquisition of guidance residential’s equity and the other allocated as rent for use of the portion of the home they do not yet own the acquisition amount helps in buying guidance residential’s shares of ownership over the predetermined period of time and the rent is the profit guidance residential earns from this coownership program read more   unique benefits of the program guidance residential offers  unique benefits that distinguish it from other home financing providers these benefits provide a transparent consumer friendly home financing and is consistent with the muslim faith’s strict prohibition on riba usury coownership guidance residential and home buyers each own a percentage as coowners home buyers increase their share over a period of time through a monthly payment risk sharing guidance residential shares the risk with the home buyer in case of natural disasters eminent domain or foreclosure ribafree the declining balance coownership program does not involve payment of interest it is  ribafree no prepayment penalty there is no prepayment penalty required by guidance residential when a home buyer wants to pay ahead of the agreed schedule capped late payment fees in case of late payments guidance residential charges only a capped fee equaling  or less exclusively meant to cover the expenses involved in administering a late payment rather than the standard  penalty nonrecourse commitment in the event of payment default guidance residential does not pursue any of the home buyer’s other assets the guidance residential difference a comparison of musharaka or declining balance coownership program to a conventional mortgage shariahcompliant declining balance coownership program conventional mortgages the home buyer and guidance residential agree to be coowners in the property  the home buyer arranges a loan from a bank or mortgage company according to a fixed or floating interest rate the two parties buy the home and the ownership of the property is determined by each party’s down payment  the home buyer purchases the home the home buyer makes monthly payments to guidance residential part of the payment is a utility fee for full use of the home and the rest is a payment to increase the buyers ownership in the property  the home buyer makes monthly payments to repay principal and interest on the loan over the course of the arrangement the home buyer purchases all of guidance residential’s ownership stake and becomes the sole owner of the property  over the course of the loan the home buyer repays the debt in full endorsements from eminent thinkers find out more about what scholars in islamic doctrine have to say about guidance residential’s declining balance coownership program                 fatwa or certifications of the program learn more about the legal opinion provided by
