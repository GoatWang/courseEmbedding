environment gasification is a process that does exactly that gasification is a clean and efficient process to recover energy from a variety of types of solid waste according to the world bank the world currently generates about  billion tons of all types of waste per year the world’s cities alone generate about  billion tons of solid waste per year this volume is expected to increase to  billion tons by  in lower income countries waste generation is expected to double over the next  years world bank what a waste” march  currently threefourths of this waste is disposed of in landfills with only one fourth being recycled this municipal solid waste msw includes “ trash” such as kitchen waste electronics light bulbs plastics used tires old paint and yard waste in the us japan and europe laws and regulations have significantly increased recycling and reuse of materials from msw however despite significant increases in recycling and energy recovery in those areas only about a fourth of the total msw is recovered—leaving the remaining threefourths to be disposed of in landfills or incinerated burned but these traditional methods of waste disposal are increasingly becoming less viable in some countries where there is limited landfill space or where new laws and regulations either ban disposal of msw in landfills or have very high landfill disposal fees the traditional options of landfilling and incineration are becoming less feasible in addition to consuming valuable land decomposing msw generates methane a greenhouse gas and the leaching wastes may also pose a threat to surface water and groundwater further some areas have banned incineration of waste because of the negative environmental impacts landfills incineration and biological treatment are the primary means of solid waste management today but are environmentally undesirable and are not energy efficient gasification the technology that we coalesced around is the next generation technology this all spells a tremendous opportunity for us at greenpower we expect that our growth rates will exceed the overall industry because of the robustness of our solution according to grandview research the global solid waste to energy market will be worth us  billion in  growing at a compound annual growth rate of  from  we calculate that the potential market opportunity for the global solid waste

of  per kwh regardless of which figure you use this is a big market and we here at biopower have a solution that merits your consideration we believe that our overall growth of the market is a function oflist government mandated shift toward replacing old conventional coal based power generation with renewable energy power generationincreasing volumes of domestic and industrial solid waste has prompted governments across the world to promote sustainable energy generation from wastefavorable regulatory policies coupled with government support in the form of tax benefits and financial

incinerationthe gasification process represents significant advances over incineration in order to understand the advantages of gasification when compared to incineration it’s important to understand the differences between the two processes incineration literally means to render to ash incineration uses msw as a fuel burning it with high volumes of air to form carbon dioxide and heat in a wastetoenergy plant that uses incineration these hot gases are used to make steam which is then used to generate electricity gasification converts msw to a usable synthesis gas or syngas it is the production of this syngas that makes gasification so different from incineration in the gasification process the msw is not a fuel but a feedstock for a hightemperature chemical conversion process instead of producing just heat and electricity as is done in a wastetoenergy plant using incineration the syngas produced by gasification can be turned into higher value commercial products such as transportation fuels chemicals fertilizers and even substitute natural gas incineration cannot achieve this one of the concerns with incineration of msw is the formation and reformation of toxic dioxins and furans especially from pvccontaining plastics these toxins end up in exhaust streams by three pathwayslist by decomposition as smaller parts of larger molecules by “ reforming” when smaller molecules combine together andorby simply passing through the incinerator without changeincineration does not allow control of these processesincineration does not allow control of these processes and all cleanup occurs after combustion one of the important advantages of gasification is that the syngas can be cleaned of contaminants prior to its use eliminating many of the types of afterthefact postcombustion emission control systems required in incineration plants the clean syngas can be used in reciprocating engines or turbines to generate electricity or further processed to produce hydrogen substitute natural gas chemicals fertilizers or transportation fuels the ash produced from gasification is different from what is produced from an incinerator while incinerator ash is considered safe for use as alternative daily cover on landfills there are concerns with its use in commercial products in hightemperature gasification the ash actually flows from the gasifier in a molten form where it is quenchcooled forming a glassy nonleachable slag that can be used for making cement roofing shingles as an asphalt filler or for sandblasting some gasifiers are designed to recover melted metals in a separate stream further taking advantage of the ability of gasification technology to enhance recycling news  biopower operation corporation news – biopower operation

treatment works           septic tanks           flushtech sanitation system           restaurants           abattoirs etc   this is the unique organic product biopower corporation uses to treat pit latrines ventilated improved pit latrines septic tanks flushtech systems as well as waste water treatment works the bacteria contained in the mixture breaks down organic waste inside the mentioned units and is proving very effective in the prevention of sludge buildup as well as the removal of already accumulated material the product has no added chemicals being  organic  environmentally friendly unlike other green solutions it is not an enzyme either the organisms contained within rather producing the enzymes used to break down waste matter this creates a thriving safe miniecosystem that continually works even without addition biosol sl contains fossilized peat and free lignin in a water soluble form   it also contains the following organic elements             bacteria that occur naturally in the fossilized peat           added bacteria with specific abilities           naturally occurring nutrients that is specific to the bacteria           biologically treated water   after an initial shock dosage of around mℓ the application of mℓ biosol sl once a week per pit latrine will dissolve organic waste inside the latrine eliminate odours and keep it odour free as long as the product is applied it cleans the fluid left in  for example  the pit latrine to such a level that it is safe to use for gardening purposes and does not contaminate ground water biocore sl jet mixer applications             waste water treatment works           biogas digesters   this locally manufactured device optimizes mixing and aeration capabilities in waste water treatment works by using high velocity air or gas aerating and mixing creates a more energy efficient process with huge savings in the use of electricity   using biosol sl in conjunction with the jet mixer will increase the efficiency of digesters in the production of biogas and reduce the material that needs disposal   there are no moving parts in the jet mixer translating to minimal maintenance and a straight forward operating method which increases the throughput of waste and increases the capacity of digesters   the biocore sl keeps all of the solids in suspension bringing the existing bacterial population into contact with the new sludge while softening the smaller pieces it reduces electrical demand by replacing large numbers of existing motors eg at aeration ponds where it replaces  x kw motors with  x kw unit saving kw     flushtech sanitation system applications             water recycling           waste treatment   the flushtech sanitation system fts package plant operates in accordance with the activated sludge process with retention single tank or sbr plant   following preliminary treatment for use with our biosol sl product the wastewater is buffered in the buffer tank and treated in the sbr in batches   the special characteristic of the sbr process lies in the fact that the individual process phases of an activated sludge plant aerobic anoxic and anaerobic mixture as well as sedimentation run along onetime axis in the same tank with this the times of the individual process phases  denitrification depending on required effluent quality nitrification settling phase clarified water discharge and removal of excess sludge  are matched to the respective degree of loading and thus the meeting of the required discharge limits can be maintained with certainty   the water in the system is used to flush the toilets after passing through a uv unit   the fts system is especially suited to ruralsemirural households schools clinics and hospitals and can be designed to accommodate between  and a  houses or  to  learnerspatients schoolshospitals   by replacing the pit latrines with an fts system the biggest benefits are flushing toilets skills development and water conservation   sustainable ecoagri villages the construction of sustainable ecoagri villages and rural digesters bring together a number of our solutions to create a community that is selfreliant with regards to energy water and sanitation the company sees this as an offering that can be tailored in terms of needs and cost and is ideal for communities located far from essential

technology and the fischertropsch process which has been in use for ninety years turning gas into fuel the facility will be built at the existing st lucie county solid waste management facility and extend the life of the landfill while reducing environmentally harmful greenhouse gas emissionsgp has finalized negotiations with st lucie county on an agreement to develop a renewable energy gasification facility at the countys glades road landfill which will be presented to the county commissioners on july   for their consideration gp has finalized the site plandr neil williams phd pe ceo of greenpower stated st lucie county has a long history of implementing innovative and costeffective technologies at the st lucie county solid waste management facility this facility will enable st lucie county to increase their landfill air space over time while reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions to that end and due to the close proximity of the site to the gp corporate offices i and the florida turnpike gp plans to construct our showcase facility at the st lucie county sitethe facility will reduce the odors from waste collected which will no longer be placed into the landfill thus eliminating the disposal of organic waste in the landfill gp has been working with its strategic partner vanderweil engineering a joint venture partner in the facility which will convert approximately  tons per day of municipal solid waste construction and demolition debris used tires and yard waste to synthetic diesel fuel if additional waste is needed on any given day the additional waste will be excavated from the county landfill to create more landfill air space and reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the landfillgreenpower operations usa and vanderweil will be paid for and provide design permitting engineering procurement and contractor epc services during the next  months while the facility is being permitted and built gp will also provide operations and maintenance for the facilities for  years with a  year extension after the facility is builtgaren demirchian pe a partner with vanderweil engineering stated the gp gasification facility will be a highly efficient facility that is highly protective of human health and the environment the st lucie gasification facility has been designed to a higher standard that includes exceeding air emissions standards by more than  times recycling water from the processes and extracting water from the wastes in order to prevent the use of drinking water and prevent discharge of wastewater to the sewer and reuse of the ash and conversion of the ash to concrete blockrobert kohn ceo of biopower commented we believe this will be the first of many wastetoenergy projects that are environmentally sound to be
