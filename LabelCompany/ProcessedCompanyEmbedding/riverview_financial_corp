security  riverview bank your security and protection when online   preventing cybercrime computer crime also referred to as cybercrime remains a big concern for most people and businesses   did not present the same level and severity of system incursions but the election process and issues surrounding purported state sponsored hacking to influence the election seems to have awakened many people  that said rest assured those going after personal information are still there and working on their next big payday  the financial losses experienced as a result of cybercrime may range from minimum to catastrophic the impact to a person’s life can be devastating as they try to recover from identity theft  there is no magic method to prevent cybercrime but there are critical steps that everyone can take to help prevent cybercrime and avoid becoming a victim  riverview bank can’t act as an advisor to you for your computer security  however our providing you some general tips that may aid you when making decisions regarding your computer’s security and bringing to your attention the need to be proactive regarding information protection benefits everyone  we do not recommend any specific settings  the decision to accept and implement any of the security tips within this document remains your individual decision  the internet offers a tremendous amount of computer security information that you should review periodically to see if you can improve your system’s security   we hope you find this information helpful passwords yes we all hate them but when implemented correctly they help prevent others from accessing information we do not wish them to see or have  consider requiring a password to access your computer particularly if it is a laptop or portable system  should it be lost or stolen there is a better chance your data may not be compromised  also make sure the password you select is not easily guessed  use a mix of upper and lower case letters symbols and numbers and make it at least eight characters long  generally it is not a good idea to store passwords on a file maintained on the system  this would apply to mobile phone banking systems also data encryption using one of the many and relatively inexpensive data encryption packages renders your data useless to anyone that does not have the “key” to decrypt the data  should you chose to implement encryption on any system make sure to keep the key in a secure location that can be accessed should the need arise   otherwise the data may be unrecoverable  even to you firewalls most systems come with a softwarebased firewall available and already installed  the rules it enforces depend on the security level you chose to implement  medium to high levels are better but could result in the denial of some inbound messages  more importantly make sure the firewall is turned on before connecting your computer to the internet  there is a very short time between connecting to the internet and becoming infected unless proper precautions are in place antivirus and antispyware with malicious code in one of every  emails as determined by symantec   it appears to be highly probable that your system will face this threat at some point  make sure you install and regularly update antivirus and antimalware software to protect your systems  this software can also be scheduled to run automatically and both shorter daily scans and more indepth weekly scans should be implemented  make sure your mobile phone is protected as there are more and more instances of malware and virus infections taking place on those devices  make sure you only install apps from trusted sources as rogue apps can easily compromise systems and steal passwords and user ids  from that point the theft of your data and even bank account compromises are possible  with the mobile banking from smartphones gaining user adoption rest assured the “other side” will be working hard to find the best way to access those devices to steal your money wireless connections ensure that your wireless connection is secure  read the documentation that came with your wireless access point and make sure encryption is set to wpa or wpa  wep level encryption has been determined to have flaws making it insecure  make sure to change the default name of the system to something that will not easily identify you  set the password to access the device to a complex password as described above  your access point provider can assist with implementing security in most cases email hazards email from people you may or may not know or recognize encouraging you to “click on a link” is a warning sign  clicking on the link could result in your downloading malicious software and may compromise your system’s security  if you were not expecting the communication you should not click on the attachments  the same goes for downloading applications from unknown and untrusted sites  you may get all you want – and more public computer use surfing the internet from a public computer is not necessarily bad   unfortunately the user will normally have no knowledge of the security in place if there is any    for that reason you should never access sites that require you to input your password as it along with other information may be recorded  if you want the information to remain private you may want to wait until you are on your own or another system known to be secure  hotel airport and businesses offering free wifi are certainly convenient but you never know if it is a site established by cybercriminal solely to steal information smart phones and pdas consider implementing the password lock to protect your device and the information on it should it be lost or stolen  these types of devices are now frequently used to house a lot of personal and even financial information  this has not gone unnoticed by criminals  similar protective software on these devices to that on your home systems may be necessary to provide adequate security  if you use mobile banking you may want to determine what mobile security is available to you  where possible use a wired phone or secured connection to transmit confidential information such as banking information or social security numbers data backups most people acquire a computer at some point and use if for numerous purposes  the replacement of a computer is pretty easy  sadly the recovery of data you store on the computer may not be so easy  therefore having a recent backup copy of your data is a good practice  with the increase of data hijacking for ransom you will be glad you have a copy of your data rather than have to pay a fee to “maybe” get it back   how often you backup your system should be related to the value of the information it contains – and what its loss would mean unknown data storage devices many usb thumb drives have been lost and many found  people who find them seem to be curious as to their contents and plug them in to their system to see what is on the drives  imagine if you will a number of thumb drives loaded with selfextracting virus software trojan applications or other malware being placed near a business office  staff members find these devices plug them in to their office pc and the software infects their system and spreads throughout the company network  once installed the software makes an outbound connection and the system is then further exploited   destroying these devices if found is a better practice systems disposal just because you decide to dispose of your computer the data you had on it does not magically disappear  you can obtain software that will scrub the data from the drive  if you really want to protect any possible data remove the hard drive and destroy it yourself  better to be sure your data is no longer on the system then sell it to someone and later discover your data was compromised stay aware remain aware and question anything that is not normal  changes in the way an application functions inability to access certain files and worse yet suspicious account activity could all mean your system has been compromised   take action to determine what has happened   if you determine your system has been compromised and do not feel capable of correcting the issue seek help to minimize the damage and prevent further spreading of any virus or malware education the internet is constantly updated with information relative to protecting computer resources and information  locate a few sites that provide information on threats and make it a practice to visit them frequently  you may be enlightened and able to take protective action to avoid becoming a victim of a cybercrime social media what an explosion of offerings has taken place  the wonder years of america on line aol have become snapchat linkedin twitter and facebook etc   while the services offered with these social media services can be good make sure your use of them does not put you at risk  pay attention to security settings and what they mean  do not be overly giving with birthdates ages locations or other information that can be used to build a profile of you that may be used for identity theft  keep in mind what other people post about you on their sites can reveal things that you may not want publically known  there are guides on the internet to assist you with security for these services get more information for additional information on phishing and identity theft go to the federal trade commissions website at wwwftcgov  there is a lot of good information available there to assist you in protecting yourself and your assets important contact information if youve been a victim of identity theft us government agencies federal trade commission website  wwwconsumergovidtheft social

robert m garst chief executive officer of riverview financial corp and mark f ketch chief executive officer of union bancorp inc stated that “by combining the strengths of our companies we are creating an institution with significantly greater scale opportunity and potential to generate additional value for shareholders customers communities and employees we believe there are exceptional

interest margin and growing compliance related expenses associated with increasing regulationgarst explained “given the current trends in the financial services industry it is critically important to secure solid partnerships to continue to thrive in this era of increasing earnings pressure both boards of directors firmly believe this combination will enhance shareholder value through improved earnings and the opportunity for increased dividends and common stock liquidity we anticipate our combined entity can offer more diverse and progressive services and products and create substantial cost efficiencies beyond what either company could achieve standing alone this transaction is possible because both boards of directors and management teams share the same strategic vision and culture that emphasizes customer service and local decision making as methods of enhancing shareholder value”garst went on to point out that “this is an ‘inmarket’ merger with very limited office overlap
