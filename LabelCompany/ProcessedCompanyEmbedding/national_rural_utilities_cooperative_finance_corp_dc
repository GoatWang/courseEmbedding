via comtex  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is designed to provide a better understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations and as such should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto and the information contained elsewhere in this form k including part i item a risk factors unless stated otherwise references to we our or us relate to the consolidation of national rural utilities cooperative finance corporation cfc rural telephone finance cooperative rtfc national cooperative services corporation ncsc and certain entities created and controlled by cfc to hold foreclosed assets and to accommodate loan securitization transactions throughout this management discussion and analysis we will refer to certain of our financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap as adjusted in our executive summary our discussion focuses on the key metrics that we use to evaluate our business which are adjusted times interest earned ratio tier and adjusted debttoequity ratio the most closely related gaap measures are tier and debttoequity ratio we measure our performance based on gaap and nongaap measures the financial covenants in our revolving credit agreements and debt indentures are based on our adjusted measures rather than the related gaap measures the main adjustments we make to calculate the nongaap measures compared with the related gaap measures are to adjust interest expense to include derivative cash settlements to adjust net income senior debt and total equity to exclude the noncash adjustments from the accounting for derivative financial instruments to exclude from senior debt the amount that funds cfc member loans guaranteed by the rural utilities service rus subordinated deferrable debt and members subordinated certificates and to adjust total equity to include subordinated deferrable debt and members subordinated certificates see nongaap financial measures for further explanation of the adjustments we make to our financial results for our own analysis and covenant compliance and for a reconciliation to the related gaap measures our primary objective as a memberowned cooperative lender is to provide costbased financial products to our rural electric and telecommunications members while maintaining sound financial results required for investmentgrade credit ratings on our debt instruments our objective is not to maximize net income therefore the rates we charge our memberborrowers reflect our adjusted interest expense plus a spread to cover our operating expenses a provision for loan losses and earnings sufficient to achieve interest coverage to meet our financial objectives our goal is to earn an annual minimum adjusted tier of  and to achieve and maintain an adjusted debttoequity ratio within a range of to executive summary lending activity during the year ended may    million of cfc longterm fixedrate loans repriced of this total  million selected a new longterm fixed rate  million selected a longterm variable rate  million selected a new rate offered as part of our loan sales program and were sold by cfc with cfc continuing to service the loans sold and  million were repaid in full funding activity credit spreads and rates continued to decrease during fiscal  which provided us with the opportunity to refinance maturing debt with lower cost debt and exercise early redemptions of our collateral trust bonds and subordinated deferrable debt to replace such debt with lower cost debt specifically we completed a debt exchange transaction in which we exchanged  million of our  percent mediumterm notes series c due  for  million of  percent collateral trust bonds due  and  million of cash on march   we redeemed early  million of our  million  percent collateral trust bonds with an original maturity of july   on april   we issued  million of  percent subordinated debt due  on may   we redeemed early all of our  million of series nrc  percent subordinated debt due  and all of our  million of series nru  percent subordinated debt due  at par during the year ended may   we continued to maintain a high utilization of our commercial paper and other shortterm funding to take advantage of the low interest rate environment at may   and  commercial paper select notes daily liquidity fund and bank bid notes outstanding represented  percent and  percent respectively of total debt outstanding in march  we took advantage of availability in the capital markets to extend the maturity and increase the amount of our revolving credit agreements thereby providing us with an additional source of liquidity over the near term specifically we amended our  million threeyear  million fouryear and  million fiveyear revolving credit agreements to i extend the maturity dates for the threeyear fouryear and fiveyear revolving credit agreements to october    and  respectively and ii lower the facility fee for the threeyear revolving credit agreement to  basis points with respect to the threeyear agreement  million of commitments will expire at the original maturity date of march   and the facility fee for lenders holding such commitments will continue to be  basis points until maturity in addition we exercised our option to increase the commitment levels for the fouryear and fiveyear revolving credit agreements to  million and  million respectively on may   we exercised the commitment increase option under our  million threeyear credit agreement maturing on october   and increased the commitment by  million financial results the increase to our adjusted net income for the year ended may   as compared with the prior year was driven primarily by an increase in the recovery of our loan losses a reduction to the loss reported on foreclosed asset operations and an increase to fee income and adjusted net interest income for the year ended may   we reported a recovery of loan losses of  million compared to  million for the prior year the increase in the recovery is due to refinements in assumptions used to estimate of our allowance for loan losses for the year ended may   we also reported a net loss of  million from foreclosed assets compared with a loss of  million in the prior year this improvement in results was primarily due to the fact that no impairment was recorded at may   versus  million of impairment in the prior year and  million of positive onetime adjustments being recorded in the current year period we had an increase of  million to fee and other income for the year ended may   which is primarily due to the  million prepayment fee received on a capital expenditures loan in september  and other prepayment fees received we also had an increase of  million to adjusted net interest income which was primarily due to the refinancing of higher cost debt with lower cost debt and the continued high utilization of our commercial paper issuance capacity at may   our debttoequity ratio decreased to  to compared with to at may   as mentioned previously we use adjusted nongaap measures in our own analysis to evaluate our performance and for covenant compliance our adjusted debttoequity ratio decreased to  to at may   compared with to at may   primarily due to the increase in adjusted equity partially offset by the increase in adjusted liabilities outlook for the next  months we have  million of longterm debt scheduled to mature over the next  months we believe that we have sufficient liquidity from the combination of member loan repayments and our ability to issue debt in the capital markets to our members and in private placements to satisfy member loan advances and meet our need to fund longterm debt maturing over the next  months at may   we had  million in cash and investments up to  million available under committed loan facilities from the federal financing bank  million available under committed revolving lines of credit with a syndicate of banks and subject to market conditions up to  million available under a revolving note purchase agreement with the federal agriculture mortgage corporation we also have the ability to issue collateral trust bonds and mediumterm notes in the capital markets and mediumterm notes to members we believe we can continue to roll over the  million of commercial paper select notes daily liquidity fund and bank bid notes scheduled to mature through may   as we expect to continue to maximize the utilization of these shortterm funding options we expect to be in compliance with the covenants under our revolving credit agreements therefore we could draw on these facilities to repay dealer or member commercial paper that cannot be rolled over in the event of market disruptions as of the date of our filing approximately  million of the total longterm debt maturing in the next twelve months has matured or been refinanced we expect to be able to maintain the adjusted debttoequity ratio within a range of to over the next  months critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting principles as described in note  general information and accounting polices to the consolidated financial statements are essential in understanding managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate values of assets and liabilities we have procedures and processes to facilitate making these judgments we identified the allowance for loan losses and the determination of fair value of certain items on our balance sheet as critical accounting policies because they require significant estimations and judgments by management these policies are summarized below and identify and describe the development of the variables most important in the estimation process in many cases there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs required for estimation where alternatives exist we used the factors we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could affect net income separate from the possible future effect to net income from our model inputs marketsensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date often significantly due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant negative effect on future operating results below is a description of the process used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the determination of fair value for certain items on our balance sheet allowance for loan losses there are significant subjective assumptions and estimates used in calculating the amount of the loss allowance required we review the estimates and assumptions used in the calculations of the loan loss allowance on a quarterly basis because of the subjective nature of these estimates other estimates could be reasonable and changes in the assumptions used and our estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements the estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a review of the composition of the loan portfolio past loss experience specific problem loans current economic conditions available market data andor projection of future cash flows and other pertinent factors that in managements judgment may contribute to incurred losses the methodology used to calculate the loan loss allowance is summarized below the loan loss allowance is calculated by dividing the portfolio into two categories of loans general portfolio during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we experienced an increase in the amount of loan advances specifically total loans outstanding increased  million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which represents  percent of the total increase for fiscal  with a larger than usual amount in the form of unsecured loans the shift to unsecured from secured as well as the recording of our first distribution system loss prompted us to assess the inputs and assumptions used in our allowance for loan losses we have also seen a shift in the mix of our loan portfolio to primarily electric system loans over recent years as of may   the company made refinements in the assumptions used to estimate its allowance for loan losses specifically we updated certain assumptions used to estimate defaults which included transitioning from the sp corporate bond default table to the sp utility sector default table refining the linkage between the companys internal risk ratings and the sp ratings and reassessing and reducing the loss emergence period in consideration of the aforementioned items we determined that the standard  poors corporate bond default table used prior to may   was no longer the most representative of the estimated default profile of our current loan portfolio as of may   we began using the standard  poors utility sector default table which we believe is more representative of the default risk associated with the current composition of our loan portfolio our internal risk ratings system is designed to produce a borrower risk rating brr for each borrower and a facility risk rating frr for each loan or other credit facility based on our internal policies and practices the brr is considered a measure of a borrowers risk of default and is determined by various risk factors including quantitative and qualitative measures and assessments the frr is also considered a measure of default risk based on the brr with adjustments dependent on whether the loan or other credit facility is secured or guaranteed we have determined that the brr rather than the frr is a more accurate credit quality indicator as of may   and as such the risk ratings used in our loan loss model are based on brr the company has a history of limited defaults and chargeoffs on our loans in determining the allowance for loan losses we estimate the loans that will default during the loss emergence period which is the time between the loss causing events and the date that we charge off the unrecoverable portion of the loan at may   our most recent historical experience indicates that on average the loss emergence period of our loan portfolio is five years which is shorter than the time period previously estimated by the company such loss emergence period considers the various workout efforts and restructurings by the company as well as our recent experience in the current environment these refinements resulted in a decrease to the general allowance for loan losses of  million at may   as a result of the refinements made in the assumptions used to estimate the general allowance for loan losses we also refined our approach for calculating the qualitative component of the general reserve by focusing on risk factors not captured in the general allowance for loan losses the overriding factor that creates the necessity for this additional component of loan loss reserves not captured in our loan loss model is lag in the timing of receipt of information regarding our borrowers to measure these additional risk factors we incorporated an internal credit risk ratings portfolio stress test into our assessment of the qualitative reserve for the general portfolio the refinements in the qualitative component of the general reserve resulted in a decrease to the allowance for loan losses of  million at may   we believe these refinements will more appropriately reflect the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses in our financial statements we concluded that these refinements represent a change in an accounting estimate which we therefore recorded in the quarter ended may   the combination of these refinements resulted in a decrease to the allowance for loan losses of  million at may   and a corresponding increase to the recovery of loan losses of  million for the quarter ended may   we use the following factors to determine the loan loss allowance for the general portfolio category  general financial condition of the borrower  our judgment of the quality of the borrowers management  our judgment of the borrowers competitive position within its service territory and industry  our estimate of the potential impact of proposed regulation and litigation and  other factors specific to individual borrowers or classes of borrowers · standard  poors historical utility sector default table the table provides expected default rates for the utility sector based on rating level and the remaining maturity we correlate our internal risk ratings to the ratings used in the utility sector default table we use the default table to assist in estimating our loan loss allowance because we have limited history from which to develop loss expectations · loss emergence period estimated based on the time between the loss causing events and the date that we charge off the unrecoverable portion of the loan · recovery rates estimated recovery rates are based on our historical recovery experience by member class calculated by comparing loan balances at the time of default to the total loss recorded on the loan we have been lending to electric cooperatives since our incorporation in  at may   the  million reserve produced by our general allowance for loan losses model represented  percent of the outstanding balance of loans an increase or decrease of ten percent in our default rates would result in a corresponding increase or decrease of  million to the general allowance for loan losses model an increase or decrease of  percent in our recovery rates would result in a corresponding increase or decrease of  million to the general allowance for loan losses model in addition to the loan loss allowance for the general portfolio we maintain a qualitative reserve for the general portfolio based on risk factors not captured in the general allowance for loan losses the overriding factor that creates the necessity for this additional component of loan loss reserves not captured in our loan loss model is lag in the timing of receipt of information regarding our borrowers we actively monitor the operations and financial performance of our borrowers through the review of audited financial statements review of borrower prepared financial statements if required and discussions with borrower management as a result of the lag there could be credit events or circumstances that exist with our borrowers for which we have not been made aware that could potentially lead to reassessingdowngrading of certain brrs to better reflect the risk of default and ultimate loss additional qualitative considerations include our expectations with respect to loan workouts risks associated with large loan exposures and economic and environmental factors to measure these additional risk factors supporting an additional reserve for the general portfolio we perform an internal credit risk ratings portfolio stress test quantifying the impact that both upgrades and downgrades in internal credit risk ratings would have on our estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio impaired loans · the borrowers payment history · communication with the borrower · economic conditions in the borrowers service territory · pending legal action involving the borrower · restructure agreements between us and the borrower and · estimates of the value of the borrowers assets that have been pledged as collateral to secure our loans an impairment loss on a loan receivable is recognized as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the estimated future cash flows associated with the loan discounted at the effective interest rate if the current balance in the receivable is greater than the net present value the impairment is equal to that difference and a portion of the loan loss allowance is specifically reserved based on the calculated impairment if future cash flows cannot be estimated the loan is collateral dependent or foreclosure is probable the impairment is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the collateral securing the loan in calculating the impairment on a loan the estimates of the expected future cash flows or collateral value are the key estimates made by management changes in the estimated future cash flows or collateral value affect the amount of the calculated impairment the change in cash flows required to make the change in the calculated impairment material will be different for each borrower and depend on the period covered the effective interest rate at the time the loan became impaired and the amount of the loan outstanding estimates are not used to determine our investment in the receivables or the discount rate since in all cases the investment is equal to the loan balance outstanding at the reporting date and the discount rate is equal to the effective interest rate on the loan at the time the loan became impaired our policy for recognizing interest income on impaired loans is determined on a casebycase basis an impaired loan to a borrower that is nonperforming will typically be placed on nonaccrual status and we will reverse all accrued and unpaid interest we generally apply all cash received during the nonaccrual period to the reduction of principal thereby foregoing interest income recognition interest income may be recognized on an accrual basis for restructured impaired loans where the borrower is performing and is expected to continue to perform based on agreedupon terms all loans are written off in the period that it becomes evident that collectability is highly unlikely however our efforts to recover all chargedoff amounts may continue the determination to write off all or a portion of a loan balance is made based on various factors on a casebycase basis including but not limited to cash flow analysis and the fair value of collateral securing the borrowers loans fair value the primary instruments recorded on our balance sheet at fair value are derivative financial instruments derivative instruments must be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value since these instruments generally do not qualify for hedge accounting the accounting standards require that we record all changes in fair value through earnings we record the change in the fair value of derivative instruments along with    aug   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from
