college majors from electrical engineering to computer science was a painful one “i got shocked pretty badly in one of our labs and i thought electrical engineering might be more dangerous than writing software” he said enlarge david beitel is winner of the cio innovator award the chief technology officer at zillow… more business journal photo  marcus r donner the safe choice proved to be the right choice for beitel after graduating from cornell university with a master’s of engineering in computer science he’s helped build two dynamic dotcoms as chief technology officer cto at travel website expedia and now zillow — home of groundbreaking real estate valuation tools beitel is passionate about making technology work for people in their everyday lives he has been that way ever since he wrote his first program when he was  “it was a christmas card database for my mom” he said that’s when he realized “computers are more than just playing games” expedia a travel website and zillow a real estate website deliver a range of content tools and services that help consumers make smart decisions by putting oceans of information at their fingertips over the years they’ve become the kings of their categories but that’s not the only thing expedia based in bellevue and zillow based in seattle have in common they’ve both got microsoft in their dna — and so does beitel beitel landed in redmond straight out of college as a software design engineer he soon joined a team led by lloyd frink and rich barton that was developing a travel product — which turned out to be expedia when microsoft spun off expedia in  beitel rode out of redmond with frink and barton and ultimately became cto after  years at expedia beitel accepted an offer from frink and barton to join them as cto at a new company they were starting — zillow besides being ready for a change the phoenix native was drawn by the opportunity to continue “working with people you like to work with who like each other and respect each other” he said zillow’s first incarnation — a site where people could buy and sell homes online — “flopped” beitel said zillow then reinvented itself as a site where people could obtain real estate information and services starting with estimated property values which were dubbed zestimates when zillow went live in  it logged more than a million visitors in its first three days building a system to collect data on millions of homes was “one of the most technically challenging things we’ve ever done” beitel said “my role was to recruit the best engineers i could find to create zestimates in an efficient way” zillow wasn’t the first to develop an estimating tool but it was the first to make it openly available to consumers beitel said a stream of other innovations have followed zillow now offers zestimates for rental properties and apps for mobile devices — with more than half of zillow’s weekend traffic now coming from this channel the yearold is on a restless quest to improve zillow’s products and its business operations two or three times a year he presides over weeklong hackathons of developers working intensively together on a project “a lot of neat ideas flow from that and people have fun doing it” he said zillow also conducts frequent “ab” tests in which it runs alternate versions of the website simultaneously to see which is faster “we’re measuring things in milliseconds” he said seattlebizjournalscom   in his own words david beitel born phoenix ariz raised conroe texas first career job my professional career started at microsoft where i joined the pen windows team after graduating from cornell in  i had interned at microsoft the previous summer how you earned your first dollar mowing lawns and washing cars in the neighborhood in
