and subsequent filings use of nongaap financial measures healthwarehousecom inc the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap in addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with gaap the company discloses information regarding adjusted ebitda which is commonly used in addition to adjusting net loss to exclude interest depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda also excludes stock issued for services and certain other nonrecurring charges adjusted ebitda is not a measure of performance defined in accordance with gaap however adjusted ebitda is used internally in planning and evaluating the companys performance accordingly management believes that disclosure of this metric offers investors bankers and other shareholders an additional view of the companys operations that when coupled with the gaap results provides a more complete understanding of the company’s financial results adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or to net cash used in operating activities as a measure of operating results or of liquidity it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating the companys performance contacts
