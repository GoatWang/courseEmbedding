request for noaction and exemptive relief our response is attached to the enclosed photocopy of your letter to avoid having to recite or summarize the facts presented in your letter unless otherwise noted capitalized terms in this letter have the same meaning as in your november   letter ssf iii plans to commence a onetime issuer exchange tender offer to all qualified purchasers of ssf iii based on the representations in your letter but without necessarily concurring in your analysis the united states securities and�exchange commission commission hereby grants exemptions from rule efi under the securities exchange act of  exchange act to permit ssf iii to make the exchange tender offer available only to holders of limited partnership units of ssf iii who are qualified purchasers as described in your letter the exemption from rule efi is granted to permit ssf iii to make the exchange tender offer available only to qualified purchaser unit holders because they are the only holders of units of the limited partnership interests of ssf iii that are eligible to accept securities offered by ssf qp  rule efii under the exchange act to permit ssf iii to offer units of limited partnership interests of ssf qp only to the qualified purchaser unit holders as opposed to the cash consideration being offered to all ssf iii security holders in the cash repurchase offer the exemption from rule efii is granted to permit ssf iii to offer units of ssf qp only to the qualified purchaser unit holders during the concurrent cash repurchase offer because they are the only holders of units of the limited partnership interests of ssf iii that are eligible to accept securities offered by ssf qp based on the representations in your letter but without necessarily concurring in your analysis the division of corporation finance will also not recommend that the commission take enforcement action pursuant to rule ef regarding purchases made by ssf iii pursuant to its cash

published a notice of application investment company act release no  on november   the period for any interested person to request a hearing expires at  pm on november   incoming letter inquiry

of corporation finance us securities and exchange commission  f street ne washington dc  mr bruce r macneil senior counsel division of investment management us securities and exchange commission  f street ne washington dc  re special situations fund iii lp  rule efi rule efii and rule ef under the securities exchange act of  as amended dear sirs on behalf of special situations fund iii lp “ssf iii” we hereby request that the securities and exchange commission the “commission” grant an exemption from rule efi the “all holders provision” and rule efii the “best price provision” under the securities exchange act of  as amended the “ act” and issue a noaction position with respect to rule ef under the  act under the unique circumstances described in this letter the requested relief would enable ssf iii to conduct a ontime issuer exchange tender offer the “exchange tender offer” together with a cash repurchase offer the “cash repurchase offer” and together with the exchange tender offer the “offers” the issuer cash repurchase offer will provide all holders of partnership interests “units” in ssf iii with the voluntary option to tender their units to ssf iii in exchange for a cash payment of a dollar amount equal to the net asset value “nav” of the tendered units on december   the “valuation date” no relief is requested for the cash repurchase offer to all unit holders the cash repurchase offer will be conducted in accordance with rule c of the  act and therefore is exempt from the requirements of rule e of the  act pursuant to rule eh the onetime exchange tender offer will provide ssf iii unit holders that are qualified purchasers as defined in section a of the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” “qualified purchasers” with the voluntary option to tender their units to ssf iii and receive in exchange therefor an amount of whole or fractional units of special situations fund iii qp lp “ssf qp” and together with ssf iii the “applicants” equal in value to the tendered ssf iii units nav as calculated on the valuation date ssf iii intends to commence the offers on november   and have the offers expire on december   ssf iii intends to exchange ssf iii units for ssf qp units pursuant to the exchange tender offer at the close of business on december   and distribute the proceeds of the cash repurchase offer by january   as background ssf iii is a closedend management investment company registered pursuant to the  act that invests primarily in equity securities and securities with equity features of companies traded publicly on nasdaq and “overthecounter” or listed on national securities exchanges a “grandfather” provision under treasury regulation section l which has had the effect of allowing ssf iii to satisfy a “private placement safe harbor” in applicable treasury regulations ensuring that it would not be treated as a publicly traded partnership for federal income tax purposes will expire on december   because the maximum number of partners ssf iii is permitted to have in order to qualify will decrease from  to  so long as it remains a registered investment company ssf iii had  partners as of october   a publicly traded partnership generally is taxed as a corporation subject to a double level of tax that could be extremely adverse to the ssf iii unit holders unless ssf iii satisfies a different “safe harbor” the determination of whether it should be treated as a publicly traded partnership would be made by applying a “facts and circumstances” test reliance upon the “facts and circumstances” test is not a viable alternative because of the high level of uncertainty which would be associated with its application to ssf iii particularly with ssf iii’s current repurchase policies which might result in such a volume of repurchases that ssf’s units could be considered to be readily tradable on a public market or a substantial equivalent thereof and cause ssf iii to be taxed as a publicly traded partnership to satisfy a safe harbor and avoid the uncertainty of the “facts and circumstances” test ssf iii will propose amendments for the approval of the partners to its repurchase offer policies to change the minimum repurchase offer amount from  of the units outstanding per semiannual period or  per year to  of units outstanding per semiannual period or  per year and to increase the repurchase request deadline from  days to  days prior to the repurchase pricing date if such amendments are approved commencing in  ssf iii’s repurchase of units during each year would be limited to  of its outstanding units with certain exceptions including the annual repurchase of up to an additional  of the units outstanding while these changes in ssf iii’s repurchase offer policies would reduce the liquidity of the investment of the remaining unit holders it would enable ssf iii to continue to be taxed as a partnership which is a “passthrough” entity for federal income tax purposes and avoid the double level of taxation that would occur if ssf iii were considered to be a publicly traded partnership in the absence of these changes in the repurchase offer policies if the “facts and circumstances” test were not met the income of ssf iii would be taxed at the partnership level and then again when distributed to the partners which would be disadvantageous to the partners the applicants believe that the benefits of avoiding double taxation outweigh the burden of the decrease of liquidity resulting from such amendments and thus that such amendments would be in the best interests of the unit holders remaining in ssf iii the applicants believe that the offers are in the best interests of all limited partners of ssf iii “limited partners” the individual general partners collectively the “board” have considered other alternatives to the offers after coming to the conclusion in may  that there was no likelihood that the expiration date of the “private placement safe harbor” which had been in existence for approximately  years would be extended the board considered having ssf iii qualify as a “regulated investment company” under the internal revenue code of  as amended this alternative was determined not to be preferable to the offers because of the restrictions on ssf iii’s operations and investments which would be expected to result therefrom including limitations on the concentration of its portfolio the requirement generally to distribute to investors  or more of its taxable and taxexempt income and the less favorable treatment of any operating losses or net capital losses plus the additional anticipated administrative costs associated with such compliance with the applicable requirements and restrictions the board also considered the possibility of liquidating ssf iii this was not considered preferable to the offers as it likely would result in the recognition of taxable gain for a number of limited partners and deny many of them the opportunity to obtain the investment management services of the adviser on may   the board including a majority of the individual general partners who are not “interested persons” as defined in section a of the  act “independent general partners” approved the offers on behalf of ssf iii subject to the commission issuing an order pursuant to this application in approving the offers the board concluded that i the offers are consistent with the policies of ssf iii as recited in its registration statement ii the terms of the offers including the consideration to be received by each fund are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and iii participation in the offers are in the best interests of ssf iii and its limited partners and the interests of existing limited partners of ssf iii will not be diluted as a result of the offers these findings and the basis upon which such findings were made are recorded in the minute book of ssf iii in the absence of the exchange tender offer a decision by a limited partner of ssf iii to switch its investment in ssf iii to a more liquid investment whether in ssf qp or another vehicle would require that the limited partner accept a cash repurchase offer mass cash repurchases would require ssf iii to liquidate a portion of its investment portfolio to make a cash repurchase payment to the limited partner such a liquidation by ssf iii could disrupt its investment operations such a liquidation could also cause the recognition of gains or losses and thereby reduce returns that might not otherwise occur in the ordinary course which would be borne by all ssf iii’s unit holders moreover a cash payment to the electing limited partner would be taxable to such limited partner to the extent the payment exceeded his tax basis in the units repurchased in addition because ssf iii’s cash repurchases are limited by the  act and ssf iii’s governing documents ssf iii might not be able to satisfy all requests for cash repurchase offering the exchange tender offer would likely reduce or eliminate the number of qualified purchaser unit holders accepting the cash repurchase offer which would eliminate any adverse impact of mass cash repurchases thus ssf iii seeks an equitable and efficient means to i permit unit holders who do not approve of amending ssf iii’s repurchase offer policies to liquidate their investment in ssf iii for cash ii permit qualified purchaser unit holders who do not approve of amending ssf iii’s repurchase offer policies and do not desire to have their units repurchased for cash to exchange their units in ssf iii for equivalent units in ssf qp and iii avoid disadvantaging ssf iii unit holders who would like to continue their investment in ssf iii by amending its repurchase offer policies so as to fall within the treasury regulation safe harbor described above thus enabling them to continue to obtain the investment management services of the adviser and avoid the adverse tax consequences that might otherwise result ssf iii believes that the proposed exchange tender offer is consistent with the policies and purposes underlying rule e generally but is requesting relief because certain features of the exchange tender offer could be viewed as inconsistent with the terms of rule e as a matter of policy and based on precedent the relief requested should be available to permit ssf iii to conduct the exchange tender offer without complying with the all holders provision the best price provision or rule ef under the circumstances and the specific terms described in this letter i background ssf iii ssf iii which was organized as a delaware limited partnership on october   is a closedend management investment company registered with the commission under the  act ssf iii’s units are not registered under the securities act of  the “ act” because units are sold in nonpublic offerings in compliance with regulation d promulgated under the  act each investor in ssf iii is an “accredited investor” within the meaning of regulation d under the  act and a “qualified client” within the meaning of rule  under the investment advisers act of  as amended the “advisers act” ssf iii may offer and sell additional units to existing limited partners and qualified new investors in the future ssf iii operates as an “interval fund” under rule c promulgated under the  act and conducts routine cash repurchase offers pursuant to its fundamental policies and rule c under the  act as well as its limited partnership agreement ssf iii’s investment objectives are to maximize longterm capital appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities and securities with equity features of companies traded publicly on nasdaq or “overthecounter” or listed on national securities exchanges which possess a technological market or product niche which may be for various reasons undervalued or with prospects of going private or being acquired at the end of each semiannual fiscal period of ssf iii the number of units held by each partner is redetermined to maintain a fixed price of  per unit as of september   i ssf iii’s total assets were approximately  million ii the adviser held  units of ssf iii representing approximately  million and  of the outstanding units as a general partner and no units as a limited partner iii the individual general partners as a group held an aggregate of  units of ssf iii representing approximately  million and  of the outstanding units as general partners other than  units held as a limited partner by one individual general partner the adviser receives a performance allocation the “corporate general partner incentive allocation” equal to  of the net profit allocated to limited partners for each fiscal period which is calculated with regard to a “high water mark”  that is if there is a loss for an accounting period the corporate general partner incentive allocation will not apply to future periods until the loss has been recovered ssf iii pays each quarter in arrears an administrative fee the “administration fee” to awm investment company inc “awm” equal to  per annum of ssf iii’s nav the total amount of fees and expenses including the administration fees professional fees and custodial fees and the corporate general partner incentive allocation paid to the adviser charged to ssf iii for the calendar year ended december   was approximately  of average net assets for the year ending december   excluding the corporate general partner incentive allocation fees and expenses were  of average net assets ssf iii complies with section a of the  act as of september   ssf iii had approximately  unit holders who are qualified purchasers “qualified purchaser unit holders” owning approximately  of ssf iiis units and approximately  unit holders who are nonqualified purchasers “nonqualified purchaser unit holders” owning the balance ssf qp ssf qp is a delaware limited partnership that was formed on may   to effect the exchange tender offer ssf qp has been formed in compliance with and will be bound by the terms and conditions of this application it will not be registered under the  act in reliance upon the exemption afforded by section c of the  act as all of its investors will be qualified purchasers ssf qp’s units will not be registered under the  act in reliance upon regulation d promulgated under the  act each investor in ssf qp will also be an “accredited investor” within the meaning of regulation d ssf qp will have no assets until after the valuation date after which date the last business day immediately prior to the effectuation of the exchange tender offer ssf iii will contribute portfolio securities on a strict pro rata basis except for fractional shares to ssf qp having a total nav equal to the total nav of the ssf iii units tendered in the exchange tender offer in exchange for such contribution of portfolio securities to ssf qp ssf iii which is a qualified purchaser shall be issued units in ssf qp consisting of limited partnership interests and general partnership interests which will be exchanged to qualified purchaser unit holders who participate in the exchange tender offer “exchanging holders” and the adviser respectively as described more fully in this application ssf qp will have the same investment objectives as ssf iii but will not begin investment activities until the exchange tender offer is completed ssf qp expects to offer and sell additional units to exchanging holders and other qualified purchasers semiannually ie as of january  and july  of each calendar year at the discretion of the general partner beginning january   ssf qp will have the same administration fee and performance allocation structure as ssf iii the adviser will receive a performance allocation equal to  of the net profit allocated to limited partners of ssf qp for each fiscal period which is calculated with regard to a “high water mark” as described above ssf qp will pay each quarter in arrears an administrative fee to awm equal to  per annum of ssf qp’s nav beginning june   limited partners of ssf qp may redeem their units of ssf qp semiannually on june  and december  of each calendar year by providing written notice to the adviser on or before june  or december  respectively of such calendar year the adviser has the right to limit the aggregate redemptions of units of ssf qp by limited partners in any semiannual fiscal period to  of the outstanding units at the last day of the period after the redetermination of units to reflect ssf qp’s profit or loss as of the end of such period assuming the transaction participation assumptions and that such transactions were consummated on december   the applicants estimate that the fees and expenses for ssf qp excluding any corporate general partner incentive allocation but including all other fees including the administration fee would have been on a pro forma basis approximately  of average net assets for the calendar year ended december   ssf qp is eligible to satisfy a “passive income” exception from the general rule that a publictraded partnership shall be taxed as a corporation it is expected that ssf qp’s gross income will consist of sufficient “passive income” eg dividends interest and gain from the sale of securities to satisfy this safe harbor therefore the expiration of the “grandfathered” safe harbor under treasury regulation section  does not affect ssf qp in comparison ssf iii is not eligible to satisfy the “passive income” exception because it is a registered investment company the adviser the adviser which is a delaware limited partnership is an investment adviser registered with the commission under the advisers act the adviser serves as a general partner of and the investment adviser to ssf iii and upon completion of the exchange tender offer will also serve as the general partner of and investment adviser to ssf qp awm is the sole general partner of the adviser and austin w marxe david m greenhouse and adam stettner are the sole limited partners of the adviser collectively with awm the “principals” as of september   i the adviser held  units of ssf iii representing approximately  million and  of the outstanding units as a general partner ii mr marxe individually held  units of ssf iii representing approximately  million and  of the outstanding units as an individual general partner iii mr greenhouse individually held  units of ssf iii representing approximately  million and  of the outstanding units as a limited partner and iv mr stettner individually held  units of ssf iii as a limited partner ssf iiis repurchase offers ssf iii conducts routine cash repurchase offers pursuant to its fundamental policies rule c promulgated under the  act and its limited partnership agreement partners of ssf iii are entitled to redeem units at their nav semiannually on june  and december  of each year for each semiannual repurchase date the board determines the percentage of units to be repurchased which currently must be at least  of the total units outstanding and not more than  of the total units outstanding on the redemption date determined after redetermination of the units the cash repurchase offer would be such a “routine” cash repurchase offer to all limited partners including nonqualified purchasers unit holders information concerning the semiannual routine repurchase offers conducted pursuant to rule c for the last five calendar years is annexed to this application as schedule  during the last five years the board has determined that the maximum percentage of units to be repurchased in ssf iii’s routine repurchase offers would be limited to  of ssf iii’s outstanding units for each semiannual period limited partners however have not exceeded  of total capital for any semiannual period requests for repurchase have exceeded  and  on a semiannual and annual basis respectively on three occasions – december   december   and december   in all cases resulting from significant tenders by the adviser which shall not participate in the cash repurchase offer in addition holders of units in ssf iii received notice from ssf iii of the expiration of effective january   the grandfather provision of the safe harbor relied on by ssf and the effect of such changes on the operations of ssf iii before the most recent routine cash repurchase offer in june  there were no material deviations in the amount of units tendered for repurchase in the june  offer as a percentage of units of outstanding as compared to amounts historically tendered at the time of each future semiannual repurchase offer ssf iii expects to offer and sell additional units to existing limited partners and other accredited investors beginning in june   the cash repurchase offer will be conducted in accordance with rule c of the  act and thus is exempt from the requirements of rule e of the  act pursuant to rule eh therefore no relief is requested for the cash repurchase offer to all unit holders ssf iiis proposed cash redemption offer the cash repurchase offer will enable all unit holders of ssf iii including qualified purchaser unit holders to choose to tender their units to ssf iii for a cash payment equal to the nav on the valuation date of the units tendered the board has determined that the maximum percentage of units to be repurchased pursuant to the cash repurchase offer initially will be  of the total units outstanding if the limited partners tender for repurchase in the cash repurchase offer more than  of the units outstanding the board will exercise its discretion to increase such maximum by another  of the total units outstanding for a total of  if the cash repurchase offer remains oversubscribed ssf iii will repurchase units tendered on a pro rata basis based upon the number of units submitted for purchase by each such holder the applicants believe that in the cash repurchase offer which will be for up to  of ssf iiis outstanding units all nonqualified purchaser unit holders who tender units will be able to receive cash for all units tendered in addition the applicants believe that repurchases above  would be imprudent and disruptive to ssf iii’s investment operations the individual general partners the adviser and the principals will not participate in the cash repurchase offer ssf iii’s proposed exchange tender offer the exchange tender offer will allow all of the qualified purchaser unit holders which are the only investors eligible to invest in ssf qp a onetime opportunity to tender all of their ssf iii units for an equal amount of full and fractional units of ssf qp having the same nav as the tendered units of ssf iii on the valuation date the cash repurchase offer is not limited by the exchange tender offer thus a qualified purchaser unit holder of ssf iii will have the option to accept the cash repurchase offer or the exchange tender offer any partner that is eligible to invest in ssf qp will be eligible to participate in the exchange tender offer while all unit holders of ssf iii would have the right to participate in the cash repurchase offer only qualified purchaser unit holders of ssf iii would have the right to participate in the exchange tender offer following the exchange tender offer exchanging holders will be limited partners of ssf qp rather than ssf iii but they will hold an interest in an equivalent securities portfolio at the same nav in this sense the exchange tender offer can be viewed as a change in the form in which assets are held rather than as a disposition giving rise to rule e concerns the proposed offers would be structured in this manner to treat all unit holders equally to the greatest extent practicable under the circumstances described below without disadvantaging any unit holders the qualified purchaser unit holders are not arbitrarily designated groups of holders and qualified purchaser unit holders would be unable to alter their character for purposes of eligibility for the offers the purpose of the proposed exchange tender offer is to provide all qualified purchaser unit holders of ssf iii with an exchange option that if elected would enable such unit holders to switch their investments from ssf iii to ssf qp and thereby avoid the potential adverse consequences to all unit holders of ssf iii that may otherwise result in the absence of the exchange tender offer the proposed offers would be voluntary no unit holder of ssf iii would be required to tender any units on november   the limited partners of ssf iii approved i the amendment of the limited partnership agreement of ssf iii to authorize the exchange tender offer with  of the units outstanding present in person or by proxy  voted for  against and  abstained and ii the ratification of the terms of the exchange tender offer with  of the units outstanding present in person or by proxy  voted for  against and  abstained in addition no repurchase fees brokerage commissions fees or other remuneration will be paid by ssf iii ssf qp or any unit holder in connection with the offers ssf qp will bear as organizational costs the costs of effecting the exchange tender offer including the legal fees associated with this request the relief requested under the  act described below and the preparation and filing with the commission of ssf iii’s proxy materials and tender offer materials for the exchange tender offer the applicants estimate such fees to be  or approximately  of ssf qp’s total assets assuming the transaction participation assumptions any and all costs and expenses in connection with the cash repurchase offer will be incurred before ssf iii calculates its nav and therefore will be reflected in the nav on the valuation date depending on participation in the exchange tender offer and the cash repurchase offer ssf iii is likely to be significantly smaller after the effect of the offers although the decrease in the size of ssf iii will not result in an increase in the rate of the fee paid to ssf iii’s administrator other expenses of ssf iii such as legal accounting and compliance fees will not decrease in proportion to the decrease in the size of ssf iii assuming the transaction participation assumptions and that such transactions were consummated on december   the ratio of all fees and expenses of ssf iii excluding any corporate general partner incentive allocation but including all other fees including the administration fee to average net assets would have been  on a pro forma basis for the calendar year ended december   rather than the actual expense ratio of  of average net assets for the calendar year ended december   although the relative increase in ssf iii’s expense ratio is expected to be material the board believes that the benefits of the transaction to all partners including the continued service of the adviser outweigh the burden of any such increase in ssf iii’s expense ratio the board has not asked the adviser to waive or reduce the corporate general partner incentive allocation to offset any increase in the expense ratio and has no reason to believe that the adviser would lower the corporate general partner incentive allocation if asked the board is very satisfied with the performance of the adviser as ssf iiis investment adviser in light of ssf iii’s outstanding performance history in light of this history even with an increased expense ratio the board believes that the remaining limited partners would benefit from the transaction and the adviser’s continued role under the current compensation arrangement in the exchange tender offer ssf iii will receive instructions from the exchanging holder to exchange the tendered units of ssf iii for ssf qp units to be issued to an exchanging holder pursuant to the exchange tender offer each unit of ssf qp issued to an exchanging holder will have an nav equal to the nav of ssf iii units exchanged the nav of ssf iii units and ssf qp units will be determined in an identical manner because units will be exchanged and issued at nav limited partners of ssf iii will not be diluted moreover such exchange of units will not be a taxable transaction for ssf iii nor for the exchanging holder as will be stated in the document describing the cash repurchase offer and is consistent with ssf iii’s practice and the disclosure for prior routine cash repurchase offers a partner may obtain information concerning the nav of ssf iii or of a unit of ssf iii on any date by telephoning ssf iii and ssf iii will compute the nav of ssf iii and the nav of a ssf iii unit daily during the period from december   through december   the exchange tender offer could be deemed to constitute an affiliated transaction prohibited under the  act ssf iii has filed an exemptive application to the commissions division of investment management for an exemptive order granting relief under the  act for ssf iii to conduct the exchange tender offer the commission published a notice of application investment company act release no  on november   and the period for any interested person to request a hearing expires at  pm on november   ii analysis rule e under the  act regulates issuer tender offers and imposes various requirements on such tender offers rule e is designed to prevent fraudulent deceptive or manipulative acts or practices in connection with issuer tender offers the all holders provision rule efi requires that a “tender offer be open to all security holders of the class of securities subject to the tender offer” while the all holders provision does not prohibit partial tender offers or offers for less than all outstanding securities of a class the provision in effect provides that all security holders of a class must be able to accept the tender offer if they so desire as proposed only qualified purchaser unit holders of ssf iii would be able to elect the exchange tender offer although all limited partners will have the same opportunity to participate in the cash repurchase offer this feature could be viewed as inconsistent with the all holders provision in that no nonqualified purchaser unit holder of ssf iii would be able to elect the exchange tender offer the best price provision rule efii requires that “the consideration paid to any security holder pursuant to the tender offer be the highest consideration paid to any other security holder during such tender offer” the commission in adopting amendments to rule e stated that the best price provision requires that “the highest price paid to any tendering security holder    would need to be paid to any other tendering security holder” in the proposed offers tendering qualified purchaser unit holders of ssf iii who elect the exchange tender offer would receive whole or fractional units of ssf qp equal in value to their tendered ssf iii units nav calculated on the valuation date tendering qualified purchaser unit holders of ssf iii who elect to participate in the cash repurchase offer would receive cash payment of their tendered ssf iii units nav calculated on the valuation date this feature of the proposed offers could be viewed as inconsistent with the best price provision in that alternative forms of consideration would be offered to unit holders of ssf iii in this regard rule ef provides an exception to the best price provision that permits alternative forms of consideration to be offered to tendering security holders provided that i security holders are afforded an equal right to elect among each of the types of consideration offered and ii the highest consideration of each type paid to any security holder is paid to any other security holder receiving that type of consideration in the proposed offers all qualified purchaser unit holders of ssf iii but only such unit holders would have an equal right to elect either the cash repurchase offer or the exchange tender offer this feature of the proposed offers could be viewed as inconsistent with rule efi because no nonqualified purchaser unit holder of ssf iii would have the right to elect the exchange tender offer therefore the proposed offers do not appear to qualify for the rule ef exception to the best price provision rule ef requires that “until the expiration of at least ten business days after the date of termination of the issuer tender offer neither the issuer nor any affiliate shall make any purchases otherwise than pursuant to the tender offer of i any security which is the subject of the issuer tender offer    and ii in the case of an issuer tender offer that is an exchange offer any security being offered pursuant to such exchange offer    ” in the proposed offers the repurchase by ssf iii pursuant to the cash repurchase offer of units of ssf iii which are the subject of the exchange tender offer may be viewed as inconsistent with rule ef if the date of the expiration of the cash repurchase offer ie december   is considered to be the purchase date for purposes of rule ef because it is within ten business days of the termination of the exchange tender offer also december   notwithstanding the fact that certain features of the exchange tender offer may be considered inconsistent with the terms of rule e ssf iii believes that the offers are consistent with the policies and purposes underlying rule e generally in addition the exchange tender offer would otherwise comply with rule e which would include among other things i filing a schedule to with the commission ii furnishing disclosure documents containing information required by schedule to promptly to ssf iii unit holders iii providing a ssf qp private placement memorandum with the exchange tender offer iv remaining open at least  business days v allowing for withdrawal of any tendered units while the exchange tender offer remains open vi not extending the exchange tender offer without proper notice and vii promptly exchanging the tendered units for ssf qp units following the termination of the exchange tender offer further ssf iii believes that based on precedent relief should be available to permit it to conduct the exchange tender offer without complying with the all holders provision the best price provision and rule ef the exemptive relief requested with respect to the all holders provision and the best price provision is consistent with relief recently granted to manglenwood lexington llc et al “manglenwood” pub avail january   therein the commission permitted manglenwood to conduct an exchange offer whereby only the tax exempt investors in a registered investment company would be permitted to exchange their units for units in a registered investment company that afforded such investors beneficial tax treatment the commission has also granted relief from these provisions under the various tender offer rules as discussed below in circumstances where a particular offer although not in compliance with these provisions would not violate the public policy of prohibiting discriminatory offers that disfavor certain security holders in particular the commission has granted relief in circumstances where although not otherwise factually applicable to the offers one group of holders would receive benefits not available to other holders although the facts and circumstances of the proposed offers differ from those in the belowcited precedent ssf iii believes that the relief it seeks in this letter is consistent with the position the commission took in those instances these positions are represented in noaction letters involving similar all holders and best price provisions that are contained in rule d which applies to thirdparty tender offers see eg madison dearborn partners llc pub avail july   relief granted to allow a tender offer to treat shareholders differently by including an alternative to cash payment available only for nonus shareholders because the alternative in the form of “loan notes” offered no tax benefits to us holders esat telecom group plc pub avail dec   similar transaction see also international business machines corp pub avail march   tender offer allowed canadian shareholders to receive certain exchangeable shares rather than common shares available to other shareholders to maximize tax benefits available to canadian holders while minimizing tax liabilities of both groups the purpose of the exchange tender offer is to permit qualified purchaser ssf iii unit holders to switch funds without liquidating their ultimate investment and thereby avoid the adverse consequences to all limited partners described herein all qualified purchasers are eligible and will be treated equally it is voluntary on the part of qualified purchasers and there will be no recommendation by ssf iii as to whether a tender should be made the offers will benefit all ssf iii unit holders as the alternative of liquidating or conducting only a cash tender offer to all unit holders would result in taxable income to all unit holders resulting from sale of ssf iii’s securities portfolio the proposed exchange tender offer to qualified purchasers will result in no taxable income to other unit holders and it is expected that it will not result in taxable income for tendering qualified purchasers ssf iii believes that combined with the cash repurchase offer the exchange tender offer allows ssf iii to achieve a result that is in the best interest of all unit holders under the circumstances no regulatory purpose is served by preventing ssf iii from conducting the offers as proposed although the applicants are not seeking exemptive or noaction relief from provisions other than the all holders provision the best price provision and rule ef the applicants note that payments as required under rule ef and rule ec must occur promptly the proceeds of the cash repurchase offer will be distributed on january   as required by rule c of the  act and ssf iii’s limited partnership agreement with respect to the exchange tender offer the exchange will occur on december   after calculation of the nav as of the valuation date ssf iii’s limited partnership agreement requires that the valuation date for a cash repurchase offer be  days after the termination of such cash repurchase offer applicants believe that it is in the unit holders best interest to ensure economic equivalence between the cash repurchase offer and the exchange tender offer by having a common valuation date and conducting the offers concurrently moreover for limited partnerships such as ssf iii to avoid an additional closing of the books of account during the middle of a fiscal period and the costs administrative burdens and possible inequities associated therewith it is standard practice to effect a transaction in the nature of the exchange at the end of a fiscal period december   thus the applicants believe that payment in the exchange tender offer will be prompt for purposes of rule ef and rule ec the applicants have also considered the application of rule e to the offers the applicants believe that the cash repurchase offer and the exchange tender offer are part of the same tender offer applicants believe that the cash repurchase offer could also be exempt under rule eb because under ssf iii’s agreement of limited partnership a binding and unconditional contract entered into prior to the making of the offers ssf iii is contractually bound to make a semiannual cash repurchase offer in the minimum amount of  of its outstanding units and upon the other terms of the cash repurchase offer set forth in ssf iii’s limited partnership agreement the existence and material terms of such offer are described in the offering materials for the cash repurchase offer and the exchange tender offer moreover ssf iii’s units are not transferable pursuant to ssf iii’s limited partnership agreement and there is no market for ssf iii’s units the cash repurchase offer and the exchange tender offer are being conducted concurrently having the same termination date and valuation date and are economically equivalent if the offers are considered as separate for purposes of rule e the applicants believe no unit holder is disadvantaged specifically participation in the cash repurchase offer will not affect the nav at which the exchange tender offer is conducted in addition the nonqualified purchaser unit holders in the cash repurchase offer likely benefit from ssf iii’s providing to the qualified purchaser unit holder an equivalent alternative to the cash repurchase offer for the reasons stated herein thus the applicants believe that the offers do not violate rule e the all holders provision the commission has granted relief from the all holders provision in several instances to permit issuers to conduct tender offers in which only some identifiable group of their security holders was eligible to participate eg peter kiewit sons inc kiewit materials company pub avail aug   relief granted to permit an issuer to make a selective exchange offer to a limited group of security holders westamerica bancorporation pub avail june   relief granted to permit an issuer to make a selective repurchase offer to a limited group of security holders in granting relief from the all holders provision the commission in each instance noted the following factors i that within the group of security holders eligible to participate in the tender offer the issuer made the offer available to all members of the group and ii that the issuer made no recommendation as to whether members of the group should tender or refrain from tendering their securities these factors are present in the proposed offers as well as proposed the cash repurchase offer would be made available to all unit holders of ssf iii regardless of their qualified purchaser status therefore all unit holders of ssf iii would be eligible to participate in the proposed cash repurchase offer equally if they desired to liquidate their investment in the other instances cited some security holders were ineligible to participate in any way in the proposed tender offer and did not have the opportunity to have their securities repurchased which is afforded by the cash repurchase offer if the number of units submitted for repurchase by partners exceeds the maximum amount of the repurchase offer as it may be increased ssf iii will repurchase units submitted for repurchase on a pro rata basis based upon the number of units submitted for purchase by each such holder although the applicants believe that the maximum amount of the repurchase offer will be sufficient to allow for the satisfaction of requests for repurchase although the nonqualified purchase unit holders of ssf iii could not choose the exchange tender offer it would be made available to all qualified purchaser unit holders and all unit holders within that group would be treated equally both qualified purchasers unit holders and nonqualified purchaser unit holders would be able to participate in the economically equivalent cash repurchase offer to liquidate all or a portion of their investment on equal terms in addition neither ssf iii nor any individual general partner would make any recommendation as to whether any unit holder should tender or refrain from tendering its units in the cash repurchase offer or the exchange tender offer moreover as stated above the purpose of the proposed exchange tender offer is to provide all qualified purchasers unit holders of ssf iii with an offer that if elected would enable such unit holders to switch their investments from ssf iii to ssf qp without liquidation which otherwise would create potential adverse consequences to all unit holders of ssf iii adverse consequences discussed below may otherwise result in the absence of the exchange tender offer because ssf qp is designed for investment solely by qualified purchasers investors no purpose would be served by ssf iiis extending the exchange tender offer to all of its unit holders who would not be eligible to own ssf qp units the best price provision the commission has granted relief from the best price provision in certain instances to permit issuers to conduct tender offers in which security holders of a closedend fund have the option to tender their securities either for cash or for the cashequivalent amount of shares of certain other funds within the same fund complex that are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge eg gt global floating rate fund inc pub avail march   ev classic senior floatingrate fund pub avail april   in each instance shareholders electing to receive cash would have been subject to an early withdrawal charge “ewc” if they had held their tendered shares for less than a specified period of time shareholders electing to receive the cashequivalent amount of contingent deferred sales charge “cdsc” shares would not have been subject to an ewc such shareholders would have been subject however to a cdsc equivalent to the ewc in the event that they redeemed their cdsc shares within the same period of time while not factually the same as the offers in each instance the proposal would not have resulted in unfair discrimination among shareholders nor would the proposal have misled shareholders the two options were viewed as economically equivalent these factors are present in the proposed offers as well in the absence of the exchange tender offer qualified purchaser unit holders of ssf iii desiring to switch their investments from ssf iii to ssf qp would be required to accept a repurchase offer that does not contain an exchange privilege tender their units to ssf iii for cash liquidation and then purchase units of ssf qp thus in the absence of the exchange tender offer it is likely that more qualified purchaser unit holders may accept a cash repurchase payment as a costly and inefficient means to switch to ssf qp than would be the case if an exchange privilege were available such a large offer would require ssf iii to seek to liquidate a greater portion of its securities portfolio compared to the amount it would otherwise liquidate if an exchange privilege were available and elected to accommodate a larger cash repurchase payment to the tendering qualified purchaser unit holders compared to the amount it would otherwise make if an exchange privilege were available and elected the results of such a liquidation of portfolio investments could have a significant adverse impact on the remaining unit holders of ssf iii to fund a large repurchase ssf iii would need to liquidate investments that it may not otherwise liquidate which could disrupt ssf iiis investment operations and also cause ssf iii limited partners to recognize gains or losses or ssf iii to incur fees  and thereby reduce any returns that it might not otherwise incur a large liquidation of holdings may also reduce the investment opportunities available to ssf iii and cause its expense ratio to increase offering the exchange tender offer would likely reduce or eliminate the number of qualified purchaser unit holders accepting the cash repurchase offer which would eliminate any adverse impact on ssf iii and its remaining limited partners of qualified purchaser unit holders switching their investments from ssf iii to ssf qp structuring the proposed offers as described in this letter would be beneficial to all qualified purchaser unit holders of ssf iii and would not be detrimental to the remaining nonqualified purchaser unit holders of ssf iii the proposed offers would avoid the potential adverse consequences to unit holders of ssf iii that may otherwise result in their absence thus the proposed offers would not result in unfair discrimination among unit holders of ssf iii nor would the proposed offers mislead unit holders the cash repurchase offer and the exchange tender offer also would be economically equivalent as discussed above a unit holder accepting or electing the cash repurchase offer would receive cash payment of the tendered ssf iii units nav calculated on the valuation date and a qualified purchaser unit holder electing the exchange tender offer would receive units of ssf qp valued at nav the exchange tender offer would not give exchanging holders a different or better price for their units of ssf iii than other unit holders no repurchase fee brokerage commission transaction fees or other remuneration will be paid by ssf iii ssf qp the adviser or any unit or interest holder in connection with the offers no repurchase fees brokerage commissions fees or other remuneration will be paid by ssf iii ssf qp or any unit holder in connection with the offers ssf qp will bear as organizational costs the costs of effecting the exchange tender offer including the legal fees associated with this request the relief requested under the  act described below and the preparation and filing with the commission of ssf iii’s proxy materials and tender offer materials for the exchange tender offer the applicants estimate such fees to be  or approximately  of ssf qp’s total assets assuming the transaction participation assumptions any and all costs and expenses in connection with the cash repurchase offer will be incurred before ssf iii calculates its nav and therefore will be reflected in the nav on the valuation date rule ef rule ef is “essentially an antimanipulation restriction” the release adopting rule ef states the “purpose of the prohibition on postoffer purchasing activity is to prevent the issuer from supporting the market at that artificial price after termination of the tender offer”  ssf iii’s units are not transferable under ssf iii’s limited partnership agreement and no market exists or could exist with respect to ssf iii’s units thus ssf iii would be unable to support the market at an artificial level or otherwise influence the price of the subject securities in addition ssf iii’s repurchase of its units in the cash repurchase offer will have no effect on the nav at which the exchange tender offer is effected accordingly the proposed transactions would not involve any of the abuses intended to be addressed by rule ef and it is appropriate to grant no action relief from rule ef to the extent the exchange tender offer is inconsistent with such rule rule eh as stated above rule e is designed to prevent fraudulent deceptive or manipulative acts or practices in connection with issuer tender offers where offers for and exchanges of securities that are the subject of an issuer tender offer will not result in abuses that the williams act was designed to prevent the commission has reserved the right to grant an exemption from all or part of rule e pursuant to paragraph h of that section rule eh provides that the issuer tender offer provisions of rule e shall not apply to “any other transaction or transactions if the commission upon written requestexempts such transaction or transactions either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions as not constituting a fraudulent deceptive or manipulative act or practice comprehended within the purpose of this section” the concern underlying the williams act is that uninformed security holders could be pressured into rushed decisions to sell their securities the exchange tender offer is not a transaction that involves any abuse that the williams act was designed to prevent or that otherwise raises the concern underlying the williams act moreover the exchange tender offer will be structured to comply with all of the requirements and safeguards of rule e with the exceptions discussed in this letter therefore ssf iii believes that it is appropriate for the staff to grant the exemptive or noaction relief sought in this letter iii conclusion for the foregoing reasons ssf iii believes that the exchange tender offer could not constitute a fraudulent deceptive or manipulative act or practice on behalf of ssf iii we hereby request that the commission grant an exemption from the all holders provision and the best price provision and advise us that it will not recommend an enforcement action under rule ef under the  act with respect to the exchange tender offer to enable ssf iii to conduct the exchange tender offer as described in this letter while this relief is sought from the division of corporation finance we have discussed the request with members of the division of investment management and this letter is copied to that division please note that ssf iii would like to conduct the offers with an expiration date of approximately december   this will require that ssf iii file tender offer materials by november   due to the compressed time frame involved ssf iii respectfully requests expedited review of this letter and we would appreciate hearing from the staff at its earliest convenience if members of the staff have any questions about this request or need any further information please contact allen b levithan at   very truly yours s allen b levithan allen b levithan  ssf iii has a corporate general partner mgp advisers limited partnership a delaware limited partnership the “adviser” which acts as its investment adviser and individual general partners “individual general partners” and together with the adviser the “general partners” who serve in the same capacity as directors of a registered investment company organized as a corporation the individual general partners are responsible for the overall management and supervision of ssf iii the individual general partners shall remain in such capacity with ssf iii all other partners of ssf iii are limited partners together with the general partners the “partners”  the cash repurchase offer will be conducted in accordance with rule c of the  act and therefore is exempt from the requirements of rule e and e of the  act pursuant to rule e the exchange tender offer will be conducted in compliance with regulation e under the  act  a limited number of employees of awm investment company inc ssf iii’s administrator and the general partner of the adviser who are not “accredited investors” or “qualified clients” are investors in ssf iii such employees do not pay a performance fee to the adviser  this figure excludes the units held by the adviser although austin marxe an individual general partner is deemed to beneficially own the units held by the adviser by virtue of his control over the adviser  for purposes of projecting the effects of the transactions described in this application the applicants have assumed the cash repurchase offer and the exchange tender offer were consummated as follows collectively the “transaction participation assumptions” a all qualified purchaser unit holders other than the adviser and the principals as defined below fully participated in the exchange tender offer b approximately  of the outstanding units of ssf iii representing half of the units of nonqualified purchaser unit holders participated in the cash repurchase offer c the adviser did not participate in the cash repurchase offer d the adviser and two principals as defined below austin marxe and david greenhouse participated in the exchange tender offer in the same proportion as other limited partners as described in endnote  below and e adam stettner a principal did not participate in the cash repurchase offer or the exchange tender offer the net result of the transaction participation assumptions is that approximately  of ssf iii’s total units would be exchanged for units of ssf qp approximately  would remain in ssf iii and approximately  would be repurchased for cash there can be no assurance that participation in the cash repurchase offer and the exchange tender offer will be similar to the transaction participation assumptions  in december  the board exercised its discretion to increase the maximum to permit satisfaction of all tenders for repurchase  ssf iii will conduct the exchange tender offers pursuant to section c of the  act and pursuant to rule e and regulation e under the  act at a duly called meeting to be held on november   the limited partners approved an amendment of the limited partnership agreement of ssf iii to authorize the exchange tender offer ssf iii would conduct the exchange tender offer only in conformity with any relief under rule e promulgated under the  act granted by the commission or staff the cash repurchase offer and exchange tender offer will appear in one document sent to ssf iii’s limited partners with participation in the exchange tender offer clearly designated as restricted to qualified purchasers  the individual general partners other than mr austin marxe who is an individual general partner and a principal will not participate in the exchange tender offer the adviser and two of its principals austin marxe and david greenhouse in their individual capacities will participate in the exchange tender offer in the same proportion as the limited partners after giving effect to the cash repurchase offer that is they will exchange units in the same proportion as the units held by all limited partners other than mr greenhouse are exchanged subject to the adviser and the individual general partners holding collectively at least  of ssf iii’s outstanding units mr adam stettner will not participate in the exchange tender offer assuming the transaction participation assumptions the adviser and the principals collectively would own approximately  of ssf iii’s outstanding units as follows the adviser   mr marxe   mr greenhouse   and mr stettner    in addition regulation e prohibits various
