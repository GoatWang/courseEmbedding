pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit bribery mail fraud wire fraud and tax evasion davis has not chosen to give back the money from cunningham while many other recipients have davis received a donation from congressman bob ney who pleaded guilty for bribery and his involvement with convicted felon jack abramoff controversiesedit on april   at a northern kentucky lincoln day dinner davis compared the campaign slogans of barack obama to the sales pitch of a snake oil salesman he said in his remarks at the gop dinner that he participated in a highly classified national security simulation with obama im going to tell you something that boys finger does not need to be on the button davis added he could not make a decision in that simulation that related to a nuclear threat to this country  davis also made reference to obama as being put into the senate by someone who will probably spend many years of his life in prison presumably a reference to tony rezko and that obama had never had a real job before  davis later apologized for his comment in a letter dear senator obama on saturday night i gave a speech in which i used a poor choice of words when discussing the national security policy positions of the presidential candidates i was quoted as saying that boys finger does not need to be on the button my poor choice of words is regrettable and was in no way meant to impugn you or your integrity i offer my sincere apology to you and ask for your forgiveness though we may disagree on many issues i know that we share the goal of a prosperous secure future for our nation my comment has detracted from the dialogue that we should all be having on legitimate policy differences and in no way reflects the personal and professional respect i have for you sincerely geoff davis resignationedit on july   geoff davis resigned from congress due to family health issues effective immediately governor steve beshear called for a special election
