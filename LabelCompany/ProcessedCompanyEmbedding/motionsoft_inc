is designed to be an immediate dropin replacement for your current means of checking in your members idlink is a value addon for your existing membership management software how does cardless checkin operationally work cardless checkin does not replace your existing membership management software cardless checkin is an addon to your existing membership software just like a card reader or bar code reader instead of members carrying a card they simply present their finger to sign in if your front desk staff normally greet your members your front desk staff still greet your members like normal how does cardless checkin technically work your existing membership management system uses a unique id for every one of your active members when a member presents their card or barcode this unique id is read by the card reader or bar code reader instead idlink uses fingerprints when a member presents their fingerprint the unique id is read from their fingerprint this unique id is used by your membership software to find the member’s data record to confirm their membership is valid to perform a checkin keyboard wedge mode vs integrated mode our engineers have designed idlink to function in one of two ways the first is keyboard wedge mode simply replace your barcode scanners or card readers with idlink fingerprint biometric scanners and you have immediate use of cardless checkin with your existing membership management softwarethe second mode is integrated mode we have partnered with several software companies that have chosen to integrate our software into their own this allows the gym owneroperator to simply initiate the enrollment process directly from the membership software integration streamlines the enrollment process for a quicker workflow it is possible to integrate idlink into your own solution cardless checkin benefits save money cardless checkin using finger biometrics is very cost effective compared to the costs of issuing new rfid cards or bar codes when they are lost and the potential reduction in fraud a cardless checkin system based on finger biometrics is often cheaper from its first day of use save time your employees should no longer spend time issuing cards or reissuing lost stolen or damaged cards time spent on this can disrupt the workflow of a front desk checkin situation with idlink you will enroll your members’ biometric information once there is no need to reenroll across all fingerprint scanners in your network stop fraud always know who is in your club finger biometrics cannot be copied or shared like cards barcodes and fobs proven technology cardless checkin using finger biometrics is proven at many facilities already this includes one of the largest health club networks in the world that consists of more than  locations and over  million members across  us states and  international locations environmentally friendly cardless checkin using finger biometrics is environmentally friendly finger biometrics do not require the issuance of plastic cards or plastic bar codes and reduces electronic waste happier members members no longer need to remember to carry their cards or barcodes with them your members do not need to worry that unknown people may be using your facilities idlink prevents fraud by using each member’s fingerprint biometrics smarter idlink uses morpho fingerprint scanners which use highly sophisticated algorithms that turn a fingerprint into a data stream called a biometric template this highly secure form of member identification replaces old technology like bar code scanners and card readers for a more foolproof and secure method to assure accurate checkin plug and play idlink is simple to set up and operate the equipment is powered and connected by usb to a windowsbased computer download and install the idlink software and connect the equipment to start using it our team has worked very hard to ensure that idlink will function as an immediate dropin replacement for your current card readers or barcode scanners in fact idlink works exactly like a barcode scanner cloud based idlink is cloudbased what does this mean for you every time a member’s biometric template is created at the time of enrollment idlink securely stores that information on our cloud servers there is no need to store that information locally at your fitness center we establish and maintain our own servers for ease of use and peace of mind technology fingerprint technology overview the unique nature of a fingerprint makes it ideal for use in automated recognition systems a fingerprint is made of a series of ridges and grooves once a fingerprint is captured the system locates the minutia points these minutia points occur where the lines of the ridges begin end branch off and merge with other ridge lines these points are then mapped and a line is drawn between each point this creates a map of how each point relates to the other points the map is then stored as a data stream called a minutia template in a database for future comparison with other presented fingerprints it is important to note that during the entire process no fingerprint images are stored on the system and a fingerprint image cannot be recreated from the minutia template read more about safran identity  security idlink uses morpho biometric terminals morpho’s biometric terminals are valued by public and private sector clients around the world morpho’s proprietary biometric algorithms and sensor technologies combined with their design and manufacturing expertise has made them the world number one in this market morpho’s algorithms are ranked first in evaluations conducted by the american nist national institute of standards and technology minutiae interoperability exchange test minex minutiae

major categories for fingerprint matching accuracy morpho’s results are  higher than the next closest vendor in template interoperability morpho’s results are  higher than the next closest vendor for matcher interoperability morpho’s scored  better than the next closest vendor read more fingerprint images vs biometric templates idlink does not store fingerprint images on its cloud servers during enrollment idlink uses sophisticated algorithms to convert a live fingerprint image into a string of ones and zeros we call this the biometric template this template along with a unique member id and a verification hint are all that idlink securely stores on its servers no personal information is stored it is also important to note that it is impossible to take the biometric template and convert it back into a fingerprint image restassured your members’ information remains anonymous safe and secure read more  day money back there is absolutely no risk to try the solution if you are not

software it runs in the background and interaction with the app is not required how is idlink installed idlink is downloaded from the web after installing the application the hardware is connected idlink uses a morpho mso fingerprint scanner and a numerical keypad these devices connect via usb idlink works out of the box and no settings need to be adjusted idlink is easy to install and requires only the most basic knowledge about computers what details are stored a unique id a hint and a biometric template not a fingerprint image are member fingerprints andor details secure yes idlink does not store or use any personal details a unique id and a hint are the only details that idlink store furthermore idlink uses a biometric template and not a fingerprint image this template is generated by morpho’s sophisticated algorithm and cannot be reverse engineered to an image in the unlikely event of a security breach the details would be useless to the hacker will member details andor fingerprints be shared with third parties no idlink never shares any information idlink does not store any user details which means there are no details to share and other parties cannot use the biometric template without knowing who it belongs to the information we store is of no value to any other parties contact us contact info   salesidentityonenet follow us facebook instagram contact us
