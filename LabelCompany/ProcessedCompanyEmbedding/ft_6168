christmas storage brick clips indoor timers tree stands extension cords cord protectors weather resistant light curtain weights history of christmas lights first christmas tree with electric lights  christmas lights have been one of the most popular christmas decorations for the past century in  three years after edison invented the first sensible light bulb edward h johnson created the first christmas lights in his home in new york city the tree was handwired and lit with  red white and blue globes the lights blinked and twinkled while the tree slowly revolved christmas lights were first made available for sale in  but were so expensive that most people could not afford them they were a symbol of status among the wealthy and many people rented lights instead of buying them in  one set of  christmas lights sold for  considering the average person made about  a week this was far too extravagant for the normal family in addition to the cost of the lights the service of a wireman was required and if the house was not electrically powered they also needed a generator christmas lights did not become practical for the average family until the s by this time not only were homes decorated with electric lights stores community christmas trees and government buildings were also adorned with the twinkling lights general electric began to sponsor community lighting competitions in the s but it wasnt until the s that it was common to see rows of houses lit on the outside today the places you find the lights are as numerous as the types of lights available varieties of christmas lights mini string lights are the most popular because of their versatility available in either incandescent or led technologies and in a wide range of color options these christmas lights are the perfect addition to almost any holiday lighting design all of our mini string lights are very reliable and stay lit if a single bulb fails our incandescent mini string lights come with replacement lamps and we carry led testers and “pods” for repairing the led strings c and c string lights are an excellent choice for those that want a more classic feel for your holiday lighting the difference between these types of christmas lights is primarily the size of the bulb the number after the “c” represents the diameter of the bulb in eighths of an inch for example a c bulb is ” or ” in diameter so the larger the number the bigger the bulb these string lights are available in several colors and in either led or incandescent options if you’re looking to customize the colors in your lighting design we also offer cc light strands and bulbs sold separately decorate mantles wreaths or even centerpieces in light without needing to worry about having a nearby outlet or running an extension cord with battery operated christmas lights from lit ribbons and invisilite strings to led spheres and mini light strings you’re sure to find the right battery operated christmas lights for this holiday season you can’t go wrong with net lights or tree wrap lights for trees columns and bushes tree wrap lights are long and narrow designed for tree trunks and columns net lights are shorter
