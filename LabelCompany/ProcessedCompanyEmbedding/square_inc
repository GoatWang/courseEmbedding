markets such as the uk europe and australia and emerging markets such as china and india in the case of the uk europe and australia consumer interchange fees are heavily regulated at very low flat rates between  so squares allinclusive flat payment processing fee is far less attractive to merchants in the case of emerging markets low levels of credit card penetration and prevalence of cash transactions for micropayments make squares solutions significantly less attractive in this respect square also faces regulatory risks that would potentially make its business model far less appealing for micromerchants in the us and canada a cap on credit card interchange fees like debit card swipe fees implemented by the durbin amendment could be potentially devastating to square yet is not a

online loan providers also reliant on fickle thirdparty funding sources like ondeck capital should serve as a cautionary tale for square capital  micromerchants have neither the business need nor

anywhere to take credit card payments now competition is heating up in the mobile payments market by issie lapowsky issie lapowskys work has been featured in inc new york daily news blackbook magazine and the brooklyn rail she lives in manhattan issielapowsky issielapowsky  comments bring it on jack dorsey anticipated early skepticism about square and confronted it directly credit company profile company square headquarters san francisco year founded  employees  it started with a list  reasons why square will fail in  jack dorsey distributed the list replete with counterpoints to potential investors to prove that he knew exactly what his new startup was up against and more important that he knew how to face it squares plan was to use technology to allow anyone anywhere to take credit card payments the list was a cheeky reference to dorseys last company twitter and a clever nod to the naysayers who doubted that the guy who invented a microblogging service could take on the financial industry i didnt have a finance background my cofounders didnt and we didnt hire anyone who worked in finance until we reached  employees dorsey says we get to design what we want to see in the world rather than doing what other people think should be done the market buys in one guiding philosophy at square is that technology should be so intuitive that no one stops to question how difficult it must have been to create that philosophy is paying off in  square introduced the card reader a inchsquare white dongle that plugs into a headset jack and voilà turns any iphone ipad or android phone or tablet into a credit card processor today more than three million merchants are using the card reader to process  billion a year in transactions the reader which is free to order on the square site connects to square register a soupedup pointofsale app that replaces the traditional cash register allowing customers to pay with cash or swipe a credit or debit card and sign on the screen with a finger in  square launched a consumerfacing app square wallet that allows customers to walk into a store and pay by just saying their names its being used at more than  locations in the us and canada the idea for square came from a frustration one that many smallbusiness owners have struggled with james dyson square charges merchants just  percent per swipe or for merchants who swipe less than  a year a flat fee of  per month for smallbusiness owners accustomed to hidden fees and rates that can run in the ballpark of  percent per swipe this transparency is the cherry on top   despite squares rapid growth which recently earned the company a valuation of  billion theres not a single salesperson among its  employees the product sells itself dorsey says that fact was apparent at the artists  fleas popup craft fair in downtown manhattan which dorsey visited one friday afternoon in march its fantastic a thoroughly tattooed classic new york character named tony stinkmetal gushed he and his friend keith golly bishop run golly nyc a company that sells custom superhero tshirts housewares and clothes made of childrens sheets and sleeping bags stinkmetal says he started using square because his last credit card processor took several days to deposit money into his account square does it overnight everyone who has a business right now is kind of scrambling he says so those two days make a big difference mike lindwasser a photographer with a booth at the market praised squares analytics standing nearby as lindwasser tells his story dorsey looks proud this is why he started square creation myth as the ofttold story goes the idea for square came about after jim mckelvey dorseys friend and former boss who is a computer engineer and skilled glass blower missed out on a  sale of one of his glass faucets mckelvey like millions of smallbusiness owners in the country couldnt accept his potential customers credit card so he dorsey and an ios engineer named tristan otierney developed what would eventually become square to ensure this would never happen again i knew what it was like to be a small merchant and be excluded from commerce because i didnt have a credit card system says mckelvey who now sits on squares board as it turned out dorsey mckelvey and otierneys dream directly violated the major credit card companies rules at the time they banned socalled payment aggregators which allow people to accept credit cards without a merchant account the aggregator acts as the merchant the card companies had made an exception for paypal an online aggregator but mobile aggregators were a different story if square was going to work the card companies would have to rewrite their rule books so dorsey took a clunky but functional prototype to the major banks and credit card companies and gave them a demo within six months they came around in many ways square is building the quintessential technology of a new generation if the past decade was about the ipad the iphone and other gadgets we hold in our hands squares success suggests the next decade will be about the technology we never see instead we will merely accept and come to expect that its working all around us thats the future dorsey imagines the product that edges closest to that future is square wallet dorsey challenged his engineers to build a product that would let him walk into a coffee shop place an order tell the barista his name and walk away wondering if he even paid square wallet does just that users open the app and choose a participating merchant when they arrive the merchant has a photo of them on square register with the tap of a button the merchant can charge the customers account the competition wakes up square is the golden child of silicon valley so far it has raised more than  million in financing from vc firms starbucks and other investors but its success has also bred fierce competition there are now thousands of players in the mobile payments market according to gartner analyst sandy shen including the very credit card companies that once blocked aggregated transactions bank of america recently undercut squares prices with its mobile card reader which charges vendors  percent per swipe and visa signed a deal with samsung to equip samsungs next generation of phones with visas paywave app paypal intuit and groupon are also on squares evergrowing list of competitors for now square clearly has the firstmover advantage especially with small businesses and last year it struck a deal with starbucks to roll out square wallet in  starbucks stores which is raising awareness among mainstream consumers were trying to keep our stress levels low and just do innovative things says dorsey within the next  years dorsey expects square to be available worldwide thats a tall order but few people could have predicted the huge success of twitter when dorsey cofounded that company in  two years later he was publicly ousted as ceo a year after that he founded square you fail and you get back up he says thats part of doing anything that people find to be revolutionary or important youll have tons of people saying no you cant do this but you do it again anyway and you dont let them stop you    published on apr   square support center  us square supporthave a question start by searching here popular articleswhat are squares

compliant and verisign certified in april  rival payment company verifone claimed that the square system at the time was insecure and that a reasonablyskilled programmer could write a replacement app
