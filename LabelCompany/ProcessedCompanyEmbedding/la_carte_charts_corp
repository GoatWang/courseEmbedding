for all ratings the higher the number the better click here for details and an important notice about our exclusive ratings  speed ratings trackmaster assigns a speed rating to each horses race where there is enough information to accurately do so these ratings tell you how fast a horse has been performing it is based on the horses actual time and other factors such as the composition and condition of the track and the post position the horse started from  class ratings trackmaster assigns a class rating to todays and historical races the class rating for a race is made up of a weighted average of the previous speed ratings from the horses entered in that race the number is basically a projection of what the expected winning speed rating would be for that particular race pace figures in addition to the horses race speed rating individual fractional pace figures are computed for the various segments of the races these figures when averaged together will equal the final speed rating handicappers use these to identify during which parts of the race the horse did its best work looking for horses that made more than one sustained move or looking for horses with dominating early or late ability track variants the track variant is calculated using a proprietary formula which computes the difference between the expected and actual winning times at a track the resulting number is then added to the speed ratings compensating for the various daytoday factors affecting the track condition this can even vary between races as conditions change claims  scratches
