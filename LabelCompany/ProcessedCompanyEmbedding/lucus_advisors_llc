to different conditionsat lucus we recognize that some things in the world stay the same but many things change in order to achieve our goal of generating high riskadjusted returns over long periods of time we must be able to evolve ourselves strategies and firm with the inevitable future transformations in our environment clarity clarity is the capability to think and communicate clearlywe are bombarded with more information and stimuli than we are able to process entirely the limitless permutations of investment strategies requires that we effectively isolate the promising approaches we
