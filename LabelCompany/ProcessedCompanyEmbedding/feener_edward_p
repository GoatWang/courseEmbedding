biochemical and cellular mechanisms that mediate the vascular complications of diabetes especially diabetic retinopathy and stroke a major focus of his laboratory is on the contributions of the kallikrein kinin system and intrinsic coagulation cascade on vasogenic edema neuronal dysfunction hemostasis and thrombosisdiabetic retinopathydiabetic macular edema dme is a leading cause of vision loss although antivegf therapies are often effective in improving vision and reducing macular thickness in patients with dme a large proportion of patients do not fully respond to this approach a major goal of the feener lab is the identification of vegfindependent mechanisms that contribute to dme the laboratory utilizes a combination of research strategies including proteomics of human ocular fluids mechanistic and imaging studies using animal models and molecular and biochemical analyses this work has led to the identification of the plasma kallikrein kinin system as a potential cause of dme studies are currently investigating the effects of the plasma kallikrein and its downstream effectors including kinins and of the intrinsic coagulation cascade components on retinal edema and visual function in rodent models of diabetic retinopathycerebrovascular disease and strokediabetes increases the risk and worsens the outcomes of stroke which is a major cause of mortality and adult disability dr feeners laboratory investigates the effects of diabetes on cerebral hemorrhage and ischemiainduced edema and infarction studies are ongoing to characterize the role of plasma kallikrein and the intrinsic coagulation system on vascular permeability edema and hematoma expansion during stroke in the presence of high blood glucose studies are also underway to characterize the
