unprecedented milestone in the concrete densification industry   years and over  billion square feet of ashford formula product description applications ashford formula a leader in concrete densification since  is a transparent chemically reactive waterbased sealer that penetrates concrete and masonry building materials permanently protecting preserving and strengthening them curing—ashford formula controls hairline checking and temperature cracking on new concrete when applied to properly placed structurally sound freshly finished concrete ashford formula will uniformly cure the concrete through a combined chemicalmoisture retention reaction so vital to the complete hydration process sealing—ashford formula penetrates deep into the concrete forming a chemical reaction that locks the pores from within providing a deep permanent seal on all types of concrete surfaces hardening—ashford formula solidifies the component parts of the concrete into one solid mass increasing the density toughness hardness and substantially increasing the abrasion resistance and durability of the concrete surface smooth steel troweled surfaces develop a marblelike finish and sheen ashford formula treated concrete has been compressively tested  harder after  days than fully cured untreated concrete dustproofing—ashford formula chemically reacts with the salts in the concrete permanently eliminating the release of concrete dust through the surface pores neutralizing alkali  as the ashford formula progressively penetrates the concrete it neutralizes the alkalis forcing them to the surface where they can be washed away during the application the deep alkalis are locked in and efflorescence and the leaching of lime and alkalis stop bonding—ashford formula prepares the treated surface for paints caulking compounds adhesives and floor coverings by eliminating the surface concrete salts that are so detrimental to proper bonding ashford formula contains no silicone and is coatable and compatible with any type of covering when standard surface preparation guidelines are followed with one application of ashford formula concrete or other masonry is cured and permanently sealed for its lifetime and is rendered highly resistant to oils greases and other surface contaminants the component parts of the concrete are solidified into a solid mass that toughens hardens and increases the density surface alkalis are neutralized and efflorescence and the leaching of lime and alkalis are stopped applications for ashford formula include warehouses
