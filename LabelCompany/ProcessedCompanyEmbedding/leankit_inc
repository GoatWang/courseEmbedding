manage projects haven’t changed much since visicalc introduced them in  the workplace has evolved dramatically but project management tools haven’t kept up with today’s needsstatus updates are difficult to manage and teams spend hours in status meetings only to emerge with guesstimates of how much effort a project will take meanwhile management struggles to know who’s doing what work and
