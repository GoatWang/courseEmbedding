not yet opened a pack opened from the bottom and resting as it normally did in a shirt pocket would appear unopened therefore the soldier in possession of cigarettes would be able to avoid having to

used black and gold the colors of luxury european cigarettes narrowing the marketing further uptown cigarettes were to be packed with filters facing down the reverse of the usual arrangement  market research indicated that many blacks open packs from the bottom possibly to avoid crushing the filters it was later discovered that cigarette packs were opened from the bottom for a different reason this phenomenon traces back at least to world war ii when cigarettes were a valued commodity among soldiers often a soldier temporarily without cigarettes and without funds would bum a smoke from a fellow soldier it was impolite to refuse such a request however there were two occasions when a refusal was not considered impolite if there was only one cigarette left in the pack and if the pack was not yet opened a pack opened from the bottom and resting as it normally did in a shirt pocket would appear unopened therefore the soldier in possession of cigarettes would be able to avoid having to
