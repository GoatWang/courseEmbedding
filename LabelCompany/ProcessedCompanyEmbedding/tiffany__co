were worn by famous us families such as the astors vanderbilts posts huttons and morgans athletes hollywood stars and european royalty were also tiffany customers however like other similar diamond retailers tiffanys enacts a strict policy against the repurchasing of diamonds sold from its stores in  a female customer in new york city was denied after she attempted to sell back a diamond ring she had bought from tiffany two years earlier for us writing for the atlantic publication in  edward jay epstein explained the rationale for such a policy retail jewelers especially the prestigious fifth avenue stores prefer not to buy back diamonds from customers because the offer they would make would most likely be considered ridiculously low  most jewelers would prefer not to make a customer an offer that might be deemed insulting and also might undercut the widely held notion that diamonds go up in value moreover since retailers generally receive their diamonds for engagement rings from wholesalers on consignment and need not pay for them until they are sold they would not readily risk their own cash to buy diamonds from customers rather than offer customers a fraction of what they paid for diamonds retail jewelers almost invariably recommend to their clients firms that specialize in buying diamonds retail in november  tiffany  co negotiated a threeyear contract to purchase

she had bought from tiffany two years earlier for us writing for the atlantic publication in  edward jay epstein explained the rationale for such a policy retail jewelers especially the prestigious fifth avenue stores prefer not to buy back diamonds from customers because the offer they would make would most likely be considered ridiculously low  most jewelers would prefer not to make a customer

wholesalers on consignment and need not pay for them until they are sold they would not readily risk their own cash to buy diamonds from customers rather than offer customers a fraction of what they

athletes hollywood stars and european royalty were also tiffany customers however like other similar diamond retailers tiffanys enacts a strict policy against the repurchasing of diamonds sold from its stores in  a female customer in new york city was denied after she attempted to sell back a diamond ring she had bought from tiffany two years earlier for us writing for the atlantic publication in  edward jay epstein explained the rationale for such a policy retail jewelers especially the prestigious fifth avenue stores prefer not to buy back diamonds from customers because the offer they would make would most likely be considered ridiculously low  most jewelers would prefer not to make a customer an offer that might be deemed insulting and also might undercut the widely held notion that diamonds go up in value moreover since retailers generally receive their diamonds for engagement rings from wholesalers on consignment and need not pay for them until they are sold they would not readily risk their own cash to buy diamonds from customers rather than offer customers a fraction of what they paid for diamonds retail jewelers almost invariably recommend to their clients firms that

yellow diamond is usually on display in the new york city flagship storecitation needed tiffany designs were worn by famous us families such as the astors vanderbilts posts huttons and morgans athletes hollywood stars and european royalty were also tiffany customers however like other similar diamond retailers tiffanys enacts a strict policy against the repurchasing of diamonds sold from its stores in  a female customer in new york city was denied after she attempted to sell back a diamond ring she had bought from tiffany two years earlier for us writing for the atlantic publication in  edward jay epstein explained the rationale for such a policy retail jewelers especially the prestigious fifth avenue stores prefer not to buy back diamonds from customers because the offer they would make would most likely be considered ridiculously low  most jewelers would prefer not to make a customer an offer that might be deemed insulting and also might undercut the widely held notion that diamonds go up in value moreover since retailers generally receive their diamonds for engagement rings from wholesalers on consignment and need not pay for them until they are sold they would not readily risk their own cash to buy diamonds from customers rather than offer customers a fraction of what they paid for diamonds retail jewelers almost invariably recommend to their clients firms that specialize in buying diamonds retail in november  tiffany  co negotiated a threeyear contract to purchase diamonds from russias alrosa for us million annually at the time of the alrosa deal the

retailers tiffanys enacts a strict policy against the repurchasing of diamonds sold from its stores in  a female customer in new york city was denied after she attempted to sell back a diamond ring she had bought from tiffany two years earlier for us writing for the atlantic publication in  edward jay epstein explained the rationale for such a policy retail jewelers especially the prestigious fifth avenue stores prefer not to buy back diamonds from customers because the offer they would make would most likely be considered ridiculously low  most jewelers would prefer not to make a customer an offer that might be deemed insulting and also might undercut the widely held notion that diamonds go up in value moreover since retailers generally receive their diamonds for engagement rings from wholesalers on consignment and need not pay for them until they are sold they would not readily risk their own cash to buy diamonds from customers rather than offer customers a fraction of what they paid for diamonds retail jewelers almost invariably recommend to their clients firms that specialize in buying diamonds retail in november  tiffany  co negotiated a threeyear contract to purchase

attempted to sell back a diamond ring she had bought from tiffany two years earlier for us writing for the atlantic publication in  edward jay epstein explained the rationale for such a policy retail jewelers especially the prestigious fifth avenue stores prefer not to buy back diamonds from customers because the offer they would make would most likely be considered ridiculously low  most jewelers would prefer not to make a customer an offer that might be deemed insulting and also might undercut the widely held notion that diamonds go up in value moreover since retailers generally receive their diamonds for engagement rings from wholesalers on consignment and need not pay for them until they are sold they would not readily risk their own cash to buy diamonds from customers rather than offer customers a fraction of what they paid for diamonds retail jewelers almost invariably recommend to their clients firms that specialize in buying diamonds retail in november  tiffany  co negotiated a

attempted to sell back a diamond ring she had bought from tiffany two years earlier for us writing for the atlantic publication in  edward jay epstein explained the rationale for such a policy retail jewelers especially the prestigious fifth avenue stores prefer not to buy back diamonds from customers because the offer they would make would most likely be considered ridiculously low  most jewelers would prefer not to make a customer an offer that might be deemed insulting and also might undercut the widely held notion that diamonds go up in value moreover since retailers generally receive their diamonds for engagement rings from wholesalers on consignment and need not pay for them until they are sold they would not readily risk their own cash to buy diamonds from customers rather than offer customers a fraction of what they paid for diamonds retail jewelers almost invariably recommend to their clients firms that specialize in buying diamonds retail in november  tiffany  co negotiated a
