morningstar category  real estate inception date  tax id  investment objective the fund seeks to provide longterm growth through a combination of capital appreciation and current income strategy to invest at least  of net assets in the equity securities of real estate companies the funds definition of real estate companies is broad and includes those with a minimum of  of revenues or profits derived from or assets committed to real estate activities up to  of fund assets may be invested in companies deriving a substantial portion of revenues or profits from servicing real estate firms as well as in companies unrelated to the real estate business the fund can invest up to  of its total assets in foreign securities riskreward potential click on the riskreward spectrum below to view the funds in that category higher moderate lower this fund offers longterm capital growth potential through a combination of appreciation and current income this fund is widely diversified within the real estate universe and could complement a stock and bond portfolio because real estate does not closely track the performance of the broad markets the fund also invests in many companies that pay dividends which are always a positive component of total returndue to its concentration in the real estate industry the fund�s share price could be more volatile than that of a fund with a broader investment mandate trends perceived to be unfavorable to real estate such as changes in the tax laws or rising interest rates could cause a decline in share prices this chart displays relative risk of each us mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart methodology we evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific riskreturn category on an annual basis a fund is generally placed in a riskreturn category based on the year standard deviation of its performance if a fund is less than  years old the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full year history or longest time period available up to  years for an asset allocation fund with less than  years of performance history substrategy returns are used when a substrategy is less than  years old the actual substrategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full year history or longest time period available up to  years risk return categories overlap a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories denoted by a plus  is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of t rowe price when a fund has a cashlike benchmark denoted by a double plus  its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns if the fund is less than  years old benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate all investments are subject to market risk including the possible loss of principal standard deviation of returns a measure of price volatility is one measure of risk please consult the funds prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds risks see glossary for additional details on all data elements open

 was dec  mar jun  nina jones portfolio manager we invest primarily in developed markets and seek to have broad geographic exposure while avoiding large country bets we are diversified across property types although given our bottomup approach we may be over or underweight particular subsectors at any given time we believe that highquality assets in highbarriertoentry markets run by skilled management teams drive superior performance within the real estate space over the long term because real estate cycles occur over long periods we employ a longterm orientation to allow for the compounding of value for our clients we believe that fundamental research is the key to identifying attractive longterm riskreward opportunitiesunited states the largest absolute weight in the portfolio and benchmark is in the united states the largest and most mature market within commercial real estate in the us leasing pipelines remain active and occupancy rates and rents are increasing in many markets across a range of property types we believe that commercial real estate should benefit from constrained new supply in conjunction with moderate demand growth we hold a diverse range of us commercial real estate companies with our largest allocations in regional mall companies simon property group and general growth properties and apartment reit avalonbay communities simon property group is the largest reit and maintains a dominant us mall portfolio high barriers to entry network effect advantages longterm leases and high occupancy rates have combined to produce robust and predictable cash flows the company has a strong management team that has skillfully reinvested cash flow during the quarter we added to equity residential the largest publicly traded apartment reit in the us the companys holdings have evolved into a portfolio of highquality bicoastal assets with an urban focus we also added to lodging reit sunstone hotel investors which owns a focused portfolio of hotels located in urban areas urban edge properties which owns necessityoriented shopping centers mainly concentrated in the northeast us and boston properties which owns office properties in leading urban markets we trimmed federal realty investment trust an owner of shopping centers in the northeast and midatlantic on strength we also reduced douglas emmett which owns office and multifamily properties in california and hawaiijapan we have a significant weighting in japan where we believe our holdings are well positioned to benefit from economic recovery and a reversal of deflationary pressures our largest holding is mitsui fudosan which manages numerous office housing and retail properties throughout japan the company appears well positioned for cash flow growth in a recovery we also have a sizable position in mitsubishi estate which develops and manages a portfolio located in primarily highbarrier markets the company owns a substantial concentration of assets in the marunouchi district in japan adjacent to the imperial palace during the period we added to mori hills which owns office assets within central tokyo we believe the planned acquisition of sponsor company mori buildings pipeline should support external growth we eliminated our position in invincible investment a lodging jreit on strengthhong kong we also maintain a substantial weighting in hong kong where we focus our efforts on those companies with highquality properties in attractive locations the lack of available land for commercial and residential construction should benefit operating fundamentals over the long run our largest exposure is to cheung kong property holdings which owns welllocated office buildings in central hong kong as well as a lowcost land bank for residential use and an attractive hotel portfolio we also hold positions in hongkong land holdings and wharf holdingsaustralia we have a significant weighting to australia where we focus on companies benefiting from a solid retail environment driven by low oil prices low interest rates and a surge in tourism our largest exposure is to scentre group which owns operates and develops a portfolio of westfieldbranded shopping centers in australia we believe the company owns great retail assets in the best locations and should benefit from its strong management team and favorable retail environment we also hold a
