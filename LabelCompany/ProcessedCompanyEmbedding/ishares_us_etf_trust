is the largest and most heavily traded gold etf as well as being the preferred gold etf for many professional traders it also set the stage for rival ishares gold trustetf nysearcaiau debuting in late  and iau quickly found its own success with more than  billion in assets under management iau is big though still not close to gld’s  billion still ishares’ product is one of the largest gold etfs on the market — and for that matter also one of the largest commodity funds of any variety to be technical iau is not actually an etf as ishares points out it is structured as a trust that holds physical gold though it more or less acts just like an etf does “the trust is not an investment company registered under the investment company act of  or a commodity pool for purposes of the commodity exchange act” says ishares “shares of the trust are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds” iau offers gold exposure at a discount gld charges  per year or  on a  stake that is not bad among commodity funds but it’s high enough to make iau’s annual fee of  notable for investors looking for longterm gold exposure saving  per year can and will add up over time the  best etfs on the planet the ishares gold trust is designed to give investors exposure to daytoday price movements in gold one of the most heavily traded commodities in the world in addition to its low fee iau has also been a hit with retail investors due to its low share price because gld represents a tenth of an ounce of gold whereas iau shares represent a hundredth the former tends to trade at triple digits while the latter trades at double digits in either case investors should be aware that selling a product such as gld or iau does not result in ownership of gold bars no one from ishares will come to your door delivering gold after you sell the investment gold also does not offer investors yield or interest so this is not the investment for the incomeseeking crowd however a small allocation to a product like iau can help a portfolio endure rising inflation and profit from a weaker us dollar gold like all commodities is denominated in dollars the weaker the dollar the better

healthcare etfs you can buy view all posts when it comes to gold exchangetraded funds the gold standard — no pun intended — is the spdr gold shares nysearcagld at the very least gld is the largest and most heavily traded gold etf as well as being the preferred gold etf for many professional traders it also set the stage for rival ishares gold trustetf nysearcaiau debuting in late  and iau quickly found its own success with more than  billion in assets under management iau is big though still not close to gld’s  billion still ishares’ product is one of the largest gold etfs on the market — and for that matter also one of the largest commodity funds of any variety to be technical iau is not actually an etf as ishares points out it is structured as a trust that holds physical gold though it more or less acts just like an etf does “the trust is not an investment company registered under the investment company act of  or a commodity pool for purposes of the commodity exchange act” says ishares “shares of the trust are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds” iau offers gold exposure at a discount gld charges  per year or  on a  stake that is not bad among commodity funds but it’s high enough to make iau’s annual fee of  notable for investors looking for longterm gold exposure saving  per year can and will add up over time the  best etfs on the planet the ishares gold trust is designed to give investors exposure to daytoday price movements in gold one of the most heavily traded commodities in the world in addition to its low fee iau has also been a hit with retail investors due to its low share price because gld represents a tenth of an ounce of gold whereas iau shares represent a hundredth the former tends to trade at triple digits while the latter trades at double digits in either case investors should be aware that selling a product such as gld or iau does not result in ownership of gold bars no one from ishares will come to your door delivering gold after you sell the investment gold also does not offer investors yield or interest so this is not the investment for the incomeseeking crowd however a small allocation to a product like iau can help a portfolio endure rising inflation and profit from a weaker us dollar gold like all commodities is denominated in dollars the weaker the dollar the better gold and iau usually
