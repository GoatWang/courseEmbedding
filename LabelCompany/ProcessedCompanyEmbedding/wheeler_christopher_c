commandmentyou shall not covet your neighbors houseone is forbidden to desire and plan how one may obtain that which gd has given to another this case comes before you as an appeal of a decision of the florida supreme court fsc denying petitioners motion for rehearing clarification and certification  it also is an appeal of the decision of the fsc denying again without issuing opinion petitioners judgment non prosequitur  the procedural and substantive aspects of those cases and the related matters are described in detail commencing at page  infra under of the captionstatement of the case redux the events underlying the case before this court demonstrates that the events leading up to this appeal are a farce a smoke screen fraught with conflicts of interest and abuse of process and power in an attempt to take your eyes off the much larger case of patent theft by entrusted attorneys who violated their oaths under gd to protect their clients inventions as guaranteed in the constitution under article  section  clause   in the process they violated a host of federal state and international criminal codes and committed many torts against petitioner in tandem with a complete and total violation of the attorney conduct codes in several states  do not let smoke get blown up your ass with the fsc nonsense before you for the florida case is so fraught with conflicts of interest and abuses of public office as to make it is worthless  so outrageous as to stand as evidence of a desperate attempt by the same attorney criminals that to date have been permitted to steal the patents to then attempt a coverup to evade the evidence and witnesses against them hiding from the court room in legal trickery through abuse of process and procedure infiltrating the legal system and public office disguised as honest attorneys  to evade prosecution these corrupt attorneys penetrated and planted some very conflicted attorneys from the proskauer rose llp proskauer law firm and others related to their firm throughout the ethics and disciplinary departments and the civil courts to derail petitioners rights to due process  this was accomplished by causing each of petitioners complaints to be dismissed without the merits ever being considered  wherever charges were brought against them conflict of interests are found in the state bar associations and disciplinary departments and in the civil courts where all conflicts known at this time lead back to proskauer  the attorneys recruited to carry out the cover up positioned in conflict to derail the complaints against their partners directly influencing the outcome and acting as counselor to parties when prohibited by their office roles and rules  in florida and in new york it will be evidenced herein and in appendix c that an almost identical set of conflicts and abuses of public offices exist again corruption elevates to the highest positions in those state disciplinary departments and courts  that so much evidence and witnesses now stand against these attorneys the only way to delay certain retribution was to coverup through public office violations and denial of petitioners rights to due process access to the courts and finally stripping rights all together to complain against them  as you read the lower courts work and then start with the original complaint against christopher clark wheelerwheeler it is the beginning of learning about a much broader and unbelievable crime of patent theft that has come to be discovered over the past several years as well as attorneys for petitioner converting petitioners inventions for their own use and profit  these crimes have culminated in some high level officials at federal agencies now investigating these attorneys and other professionals involved in what perhaps is the most diabolical crime ever attempted in the history of our country  one of the most sophisticated crimes in that it involved every level of abuse of attorney privileges and violations of confidences and oaths including violations of the patent bar and violations of state supreme court public offices  in the state supreme courts of florida and new york where conflict and abuse of public offices has been evidenced and confirmed and in new york even ordered for investigation is the only place you will find that these attorneys who controlled the disciplinary process and courts evaded prosecution by misuse of the legal system  further they are found attempting to put on an air of vindication using the disciplinary departments as a shield  through smoke and mirrors mired in conflicts of interest and public office corruption leaving them controlling the disciplinary departments and certain high level court positions they then acted as if these legal institutions were their own private law firm and used the letterhead of the state bars and the courts to advance positions in their favor when no formal investigations or due process has ever been undertaken     the lawyers and their law firms accused herein and in appendix c are on the other hand under very real investigations by the federal patent bar office of enrollment and discipline oed director harry i moatz moatz as well as the commissioners office commissioner of the united states patent and trademark office uspto for charges of fraud on the uspto by the lawyers and their law firms defined herein and inappendix c  the patent theft is a very clever attempt by the patent attorneys and their cohorts to convert their client inventors patents into their own names and others for monetization in patent pools that inure benefit to them instead of the true and proper inventors  the patent office has suspended the patents of petitioner based on the charges filed on the bequest of moatz of fraud upon the uspto  moatz and his offices found that attorney dockets for the intellectual property are materially false and misleading including containing patents that they cannot disclose ownership to petitioner and petitioner companies shareholders the list of companies now uncovered has evidence of all of the following companies uviewcom inc  dl iviewit holdings inc  dl iviewit holdings inc  dl iviewit holdings inc  fl iviewit technologies inc  dl       iviewitcom inc  fl iviewitcom inc  dl ic inc  fl iviewitcom llc  dl iviewit llc  dl iviewit corporation  fl iviewit inc   fl iviewit inc  del hereinafter referred to as companies citing the freedom of information act and where moatz stated an act of congress would be necessary to disclose whose patents these are  with that information moatz discharged all prior counselors from the patents and instituted formal investigations causing suspension of certain intellectual properties by the commissioner while the matters are investigated by the commissioners office  that false and misleading information to petitioner and petitioner companies shareholders shareholders who invested in the patents who now find they have no rights titles or interests in certain patents and companies and that these intellectual property dockets were prepared by proskauer foley meltzer lippe goldstein wolfe and schlissel mlgws and blakely sokoloff taylor and zafman bstz all submitted to investors and institutional funds to raise capital including the federally backed sba  this takes the crimes against the government financial institutions international patent authorities petitioner and the shareholders to new levels since all of them were transmitted such false patent information if that did not catch your eye as cause to investigate the same attorneys at the state bar level or at least work with federal authorities to collaborate efforts it certainly shows an inconsistency that must be reckoned how are the state bars writing letters of accommodations for the accused attorneys when federal authorities have begun formal procedural investigation on the same nexus of events and evidence  how have the state bars overlooked the obvious that the patents were in the wrong inventors names in some instances in the attorneys name and in others in brian utleys utley name  utley a proskauer referred president and chief operating officer for petitioner companies who claimed under deposition to have no patents in his name and this directly is refuted by moatzs information at the uspto  yet when fsc and tfb were presented this overwhelming evidence they ignored it and refused to talk or work with moatz   the federal bureau of investigation fbi has taken the case to united states attorney and has contacted the uspto and moatz to collaborate their investigations  again one might ask why the state bars and state courts looking at the same information are rushing to judgment in favor of the accused attorneys without investigation and based on conflict riddled reviews  the inspector generals office of the small business administration sba is beginning to audit the trail of their investment monies and what has happened to their rights in the patents obtained through sbic loans to a proskauer referred venture capitalist  again the florida bar tfb and fsc were presented evidence of the crimes committed by the attorneys against the united states and they refused to recognize these crimes that were presented to them and take any action  as petitioner learned more and more of these activities petitioner sent submission after submission to the bars who took an adversarial role against petitioner and where tfb actually and without authority became the advocate and spokesperson for the same attorneys now under investigations  patents around the world will be in a total state of chaos if these actions are allowed to stand and cause loss of inventor rights and all directly due to attorney corruption and delays in due process  further loss now is caused by failure of the attorney complaint process to discipline and act according to their own laws and procedures upon discovering evidence that patents were being stolen by the accused attorneys in conjunction with our accountants and management employees all referred by the accused attorneys they were fired for cause  the evidence was just a few pieces of paper at the time that were found in utleys possession showing patents going into the wrong companies albeit named similarly to petitioner companies in fraudulent inventors names and where the named other inventors had no involvement in the invention process  as we dug deeper ninety patents were discovered in our attorneys name and they all resemble ideas learned under attorneyclient privileges quite the conflict  a patent pool mpegla llc mpeg was acquired by the main protagonist proskauer to directly monetize and proliferate the inventions of their client converting such royalties to themselves  mpeg and its founder kenneth rubenstein rubenstein gatekeeper to patent inclusion in the pool of which petitioners technologies stood as a direct competitive threat to make obsolete was at once acquired by proskauer after learning of inventors inventions  mpeg then took the inventions as their own and began bundling and tying it with thousand of products creating a barrier to entry to market of petitioner and shareholders a major oversight of the antitrust laws they were supposed to be protecting petitioner against  the fsc case before you is composed of conflicts and abuse of public offices to give you the impression that this case has been tried and heard and that is factually untrue  in fact in florida in the state civil court then at tfb lawyers were found to have infiltrated the legal processes and acted to deny due process and keep the matters out of court and disciplinary actions through handling complaints by persons directly in conflict of interest and violation of public office  those conflicts caused the complaint process to be tainted and was affirmed by tfb proving that a grievance committee member and proskauer partner mathew triggs triggs had violated his public office  charges should have been filed immediately upon affirmation of the conflict  instead we find not only did tfb not file charges against a member caught violating a public office they then denied the right of petitioner and shareholders to file complaint against triggs and have it publicly docketed and afforded due process  when evidenced to the fsc including evidence that the corruption elevated to the executive offices of tfb they too denied petitioner and shareholders due process and attempted to cause the case before you to go away through surreptitious orders including orders to destroy the evidence  this may make fsc accomplice and culpable to the crimes  the order to destroy the tfb files before this court or law enforcement could prosecute the conflicts and violations of public offices stands not as an err in judgment but actions to aid and abet in evading prosecution  fsc and tfbs attempt to destroy the case files work product and evidence was with the intent to destroy the evidence before it was reviewed including by this court  in fact even upon motion for rehearing clarification and certification which the fsc knew would escalate the matters to this court they still gave the document execution orders to tfb  that this petition stands not only as a call for this court to review errors in the lower courts decisions but to file charges against them for their involvement new evidence exposes that when the proskauer accused attorneys discovered that the inventions were being heralded as the holy grail and worth a trillion dollars by leading industry experts they told petitioner and shareholders that they were going to file for patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets that they billed petitioner and shareholders for  they intentionally concealed that they were writing a second set of patents similar to petitioners inventions in name and in concept with fraudulent owners applicants and inventors  they then brought in dick from foley when evidence surfaced that raymond joao joao an attorney referred by proskauer under questionable and suspicious employment claims claiming initially to be with proskauer was found possibly converting inventions in his name and leaving material pertinent to petitioner patents out of the applications and failing to file certain inventions entirely to replace joao and fix errors that foley claimed were repairable  dick failed to disclose to petitioner and shareholders that he was part of the scheme that attempted to commit theft of intellectual property causing loss to a south florida businessman as described herein  yet as the inventors signed oaths on their inventions the new attorneys from foley like joao before them threw out the corpus of the inventions and replaced them with frivolous filings certain to fail and wrote fraudulent applications to continue the scheme  proskauers next step was to set up companies for petitioner and shareholders to hold the bogus patents  they then fraudulently set up similar and identically named companies for themselves to house the stolen patents for they needed those patents to truly monetize the pools and control the technologies after getting rid of petitioner and shareholders this crime just described violates the fundamentals of the constitution which could lead to catastrophic endangerment of free commerce as the sanctity of the patent office is defiled by those sworn to uphold it  before this court stands these issues not the florida court decision of the bar complaint review process on wheeler and whether the review was done well or not the case before you arrived here through a cover up attempt by those caught in the act  once the first evidence was discovered against them and at the time it was only a small fragment they began an immediate retaliation to destroy the companies the inventor and to try to erase from the record their crimes  in doing so they began litigation proskauer rose llp v iviewit technologies inc iviewitcom inc and iviewit holdings inc case no ca  ab in the circuit court of the fifteenth judicial circuit in and for palm beach county florida litigation and an involuntary chapter  bankruptcy action case bkcshf in the united states bankruptcy court southern district of florida bankruptcy against their own fraudulent companies identically named to petitioners that housed the stolen patents by suing them and bankrupting them through felonious legal actions with the intent of recovering the stolen core patents and other intellectual properties buried within  it was by chance that after firing the accused attorneys and their management for cause that while doing due diligence for a twenty five million dollar us  license and investment it was discovered by members of american online time warnerwaner bros aoltwwb that these legal actions existed and there went that deal  in the same moment the lead investor in the company referred by proskauer pulled funding and the companies were devastated  further at the time the actions were discovered it was not known by petitioner or shareholders that the legal actions instituted against the companies by proskauer in the litigation and their management and others including intel in the bankruptcy were against companies that were not owned by petitioner and shareholders but were identically named corporations owned by the attorneys and others  in fact upon finding out of the legal actions petitioner contacted a friend caroline prochotska rogers esq who retained replacement counsel for the counsel that was representing the companies without authorization or retainers and without management or shareholder knowledge  rogers brought in bankruptcy counsel but that matter was instantly dropped  in the litigation it did not go away so fast as counsel was retained and although nobody knew at the time that these were fraudulent actions on fraudulent companies in an attempt to abscond with stolen patents the shareholders began representing the actions  the litigation was a billing dispute instigated unbeknownst to shareholder by proskauer days after being fired with cause and failing to come to board meetings to explain themselves and the fragments of evidence uncovered to the remaining board  these legal actions were efforts to get rid of the fraudulent companies and stolen patents before anyone discovered them  arthur andersen at the time was in an almost year long audit when they accused the accountant gerald lewin lewin anderika lewin e lewin of goldstein lewin  co pa goldstein of misleading auditors regarding the corporate structure and immediately thereafter andersen terminated the audit  petitioner and shareholders did not find the transactional documents for years after the audit was terminated showing this evidence as exhibited in appendix c and its exhibits  almost surreal this appears when looked at with hindsight of what really was going on and understood in light of the new evidence to be the cause of very real suspensions on patents at the uspto and investigations by federal authorities  at first glance one might think that this was all unbelievable and then heap upon it all this collateral smoke screen at the bars and one might believe that it is impossible yet dig at the evidence for a few days and it is irrefutable  in the litigation after reviewing the matters without full knowledge that the companies were mirror companies owned by proskauer attorney steven selz selz filed a counter claim based on what little evidence existed at the time advancing that fraud had taken place on the uspto and other crimes against the shareholders had been committed by their attorneys accountants and management amazingly judge jorge labarga labarga refused the counter claim stating that it came untimely and that prior counsel sachs sax  klien sachs had somehow gave up the right to a defense  the problem sachs was hired by proskauer agents to represent the bogus companies  reviewing the litigation by counsel now hired by petitioners companies selz the first thing that became apparent was that proskauer sued companies that they had no retainer with and no bills for and it appeared they were suing the wrong companies  this was ignored by labarga who refused to dismiss the action based on this fact evidencing that they had no cause to file against these entities  selz then took depositions on the key protagonists wheeler utley rubenstein and lewin and what was learned was even more fascinating they had lied and perjured themselves to no end  in fact rubenstein had written a sworn statement to labarga in attempt to avoid his deposition professing that he did not know anything about the inventions inventors and that proskauer had not done any intellectual property work  rubenstein claimed that he had merely referred petitioner and shareholders to his former law firm and joao  further rubenstein wrote the judge that since he never had any involvement that this was a form of harassment and that he would not be deposed  yet the judge ordered him to deposition and it was unbelievable what happened there rubenstein was confronted by selz regarding his sworn statement to labarga about not knowing the companies or inventors and was presented evidence to refute his claims including the proskauer billings where his name was logged in for over three years of dealings with the company and portraying far more involvement than his sworn statement to labarga  rubenstein had also tendered a written response to a bar complaint against him in new york and the deposition showed perjured statements either in his sworn statements to the bar and judge or in his sworn deposition statements  rubenstein refused to answer direct deposition questions and left his deposition demanding that selz take his refusal up with labarga  for wheeler deposition was equally as revealing and perjured statements cropped up in his testimony versus his sworn statements to tfb  wheeler the main corporate attorney was unable to explain even his own corporate set up in deposition and attempted to refuse to return to deposition to even answer the questions he stated he would have to check his notes to answer  both rubenstein and wheeler refused to return to even a second day of deposition and selz had to motion the judge to compel them back to answer the questions they had refused under direct deposition  with evidence that rubenstein had perjured statements in his deposition versus statements written to the judge it looked like only a moment until justice would prevail  the judge ordered rubenstein and wheeler back to deposition to answer the questions they refused and finish their depositions  that day as yet has not come the next obstruction of justice denial of due process and prevention of access to the courts came when the trial that was scheduled in the litigation was cancelled without notification to petitioner or shareholders counsel  petitioner was then usurped two different counselors representing him selz and schiffrin  barroway llp sb in the litigation that had been representing him at the rescheduling of the trial both counsels for petitioner submitted withdrawal of counsel motions stating the other counsel would represent petitioner at the rescheduled hearing  the judge instead granted both counselors the right to withdraw and on the eve of trial left no one representing petitioner and shareholders all inapposite of petitioner and shareholders rights  labarga called petitioner from the gallery to the bench where he informed petitioner that he had dismissed his counsels and that if he did not find replacement counsel immediately for such a complicated case that a default would be entered against him  for the next weeks with very little funds even though there was a binding signed lou by sb that was to pay two million dollars on signing and provide representation to petitioner and shareholders in the litigation and where this breach after signing by sb caused catastrophic financial disaster which at the time rendered petitioner who had forgone other investments based on the legal case against proskauer to be left on the table in favor of the sb lou and legal retainer now unable to secure counsel and investment in such short notice  counsel selz then went missing on vacation leaving petitioner with no access to the case files necessary to find replacement counsel  one can now only wonder at how this travesty occurred but it appears a well intentioned plan to deny petitioner counsel bribe a judge to overlook high crimes against the united states and ignore judicial cannons obligating labarga to report those accused lawyers practicing before him  through denying petitioner his fundamental rights to access the civil legal system right to due process to trial access to the courts and finally legal representation petitioner had no venue left to press claims and defend his constitutional rights  labarga immediately granted a defaultagainst petitioner and shareholders for failure to obtain replacement counsel and petitioner pleaded with that court to allow pro se representation for shareholders by management until counsel could be found or the sb lou could be enforced to provide counsel as called for under the binding lou and legal retainer  all these pleas fell on deaf ears  this led to a filing with the judicial qualifications commission jqc docket no  against labarga for his part in aiding and abetting and otherwise violating his judicial cannons driven to poverty and with the companies destroyed unable to secure investment with the patent shenanigans going on petitioner turned to the state bar and disciplinary departments for the attorney conduct complaints that had been filed and put on hold pending the conclusion of the litigation to now finally begin to press the claims of attorney misconduct  evidencing new information of attorney perjured statements to tfb that showed that attorneys wheeler and rubenstein had committed perjury in their depositions that completely contradicted former sworn statements to the state bars could not be overlooked these were direct perjured statements  what happened next and all before discovering that conflicts were causing derailment made tfb look like an attorney protection agency and consumer unfriendly place this is where the case before you begins to serve as evidence of how these attorneys have avoided prosecution through illegal infiltration of the processes that could prosecute them  this will reveal yet another layer of crimes crimes to prevent due process and usurp petitioner and shareholders access to the legal complaint process established under the florida constitution  the proskauerwheeler complaint tfb case   c and second proskauerwheeler complaint tfb case to be determined were filed evidencing that wheeler had partaken in a host of criminal activities against petitioner shareholders the united states government and foreign nations in a violation of almost every rule of professional conduct in florida  the proskauerwheeler original bar complaint had been put on hold pending the conclusion of the civil litigation and months went by during the litigation where petitioners were denied the ability to press these charges of crimes and violations of ethics in either forum the labarga court or the state bar including crimes against the united states caught in a catch  where labargas refusal to hear the counter complaint issues and the bars refusal to hear the attorney complaint issues left petitioner and shareholders unable to press the claims in any venue as would normally be provided  a complete denial of access to the courts access to counsel and a forum to be heard in by the very members of the legal community that were entrusted with providing such access and using dubious methods to achieve such in violation of the laws and rules  finally at the conclusion of the litigation the bar began a review not an immediate investigation of the matters and concluded that they would not undertake prosecution of the proskauerwheeler bar complaint and dismissed the case based on such review  staggering amounts of direct evidence had been presented to tfb in the wheeler complaint and company rebuttal to the triggs conflicted response on behalf of wheeler over one thousand pages  evidence that irrefutably showed cause for investigation such as perjured statements to tfb and yet tfb refused  to add insult to injury the bar reviewer hoffman went further than just stating tfb was not going to prosecute and where without investigation tfb is not permitted to espouse opinion in favor of either party according to the rules regulating the florida bar yet that is exactly what transpired  tfb had taken a position that based on review and not formal and tried investigation of the facts evidence and witnesses was in support of the very weak position maintained by proskauer and wheeler in their defense to the complaints as if proskauer were writing the letters for themselves that it was discovered after several levels of review and further letters supporting proskauer that were tendered by the various reviewers that proskauer in fact was controlling the bar process with triggs representing the proskauerwheeler bar complaint in violation of his public office position with tfb  triggs was handling the complaint against his partner wheeler while in a blackout period that prevented his representation of anyone before tfb for a period of oneyear  plain and simple triggs acted within the year and failed to disclose such conflict of interest and violation of his public office and acted for over a year without ever disclosing or seeking approval for his conflict and violations  complaints were filed against triggs for the violation of public office and conflict of interest and even after securing affirmation from tfb in writing in a letter dated july th  showing that triggs had violated his public office tfb then refused to allow petitioner and shareholders an opportunity to press their claims by denying the  formal written complaint and refusing formal docketing and procedure  this refusal stands directly against the intent of the florida constitution in creating tfb to handle formal complaints further derailing the petitioner and shareholders of their rights to due process and procedure by now denying complaints for affirmed violations of public office against public officials  how high did the conflicts elevate in tfb to be able to suppress the petitioner and shareholders their rights to the legal complaint process against corrupt attorneys evidence now shows conflicts and violations of office extending all the way to the president of tfb kelly overstreet johnson johnson johnson coincidently was found being a direct report to the brother of the main protagonist james wheeler j wheeler in a small florida law firm  this conflict of interest became known after johnson began receiving petitioner and shareholders complaints for months from the petitioner and shareholders with pleas to intercede on behalf of their efforts to force formal docketing and disposition of the complaint against triggs and begin formal charges against triggs and wheeler for conflict and abuse of office  also pleas to have the triggs responses tendered in conflict voided from the wheeler complaint record and all prior complaint reviews reevaluated in light of the conflicts and without their prejudicial influence as would be required by law and procedure were submitted to johnson  although johnson took the information again and again she failed to disclose the obvious conflict she had with wheelers brother until of course she was confronted with the fact that petitioner and shareholders had discovered her conflicts and asked for formal written disclosure upon which she refused to tender and had tfb counsel call and state that she would no longer take any submissions or speak with petitioner in regard to the matters with no further ado and realizing that further complaints were frivolous at tfb having exhausted every level of review petitioner and shareholders appealed the matters to the direct oversight of tfb as instituted in the florida constitution the fsc  fsc at once issued orders to halt a proposed destruction of the proskauerwheeler complaint files by tfb prior to record retention rules and prior to the fsc review of the misconduct at tfb of its members  later without investigation into the matters fsc reversed their decision by ordering petitioners motion for non prosequitur denied except to allow tfb to continue in the unlawful destruction of the files  this constitutes cause for this courts direct intervention  further fsc then overturned a previous order for tfb to tender a response to the petition and the allegations contained therein and when a nonresponse to the substantive issues was tendered they ruled to move the case closed without affording petitioner the opportunity of further due process and procedure all without explanation or basis in law  again reason for this court to see that not only did they err in decision but actively participated in the denial of due process and procedure with intent to cover up crimes that had penetrated tfb  the justices all being members of the opposing party tfb can be viewed as taking a matter where they have direct membership interests in one of the parties and failing to disclose or respond to formal requests for their disclosure as a means to handle the matters in conflict and protect the organization that they have ultimate state oversight for  no longer is petitioner asking this court to review their errs in the matter but institute charges against fsc and tfb for their direct involvement in furthering the crimes and failing their legal rules of professional conduct and judicial cannons to uphold justice and afford citizens civil rights to fair and impartial access to the courts due process the attorney complaint process and counsel  this same set of fact patterns emerges in new york and soon will rise to this court for review as will be evidenced herein and in appendix c statement of the case redux by way of example all of the following missteps and miscues in case sc make the lower courts actions null and void such as                                              i            ignoring johnsons conflict with wheelers brother james wheeler where johnson failed to disclose this obvious conflict while accepting petitioner complaint submissions on wheeler and others for several months                                             ii            ignoring the affirmed conflicts of interest and abuse of public office of triggs  triggs also simultaneously acted as proskauer counsel in the litigation for proskauer with a similar nexus of events while holding a tfb active role  as such this would have invalidated both the litigation and the wheeler complaint and set off a host of other conflicts as evidenced to fsc in the triggs complaint attached to the original petition  triggs would have been precluded from maintaining both cases with a similar nexus of events where he has direct interest in the outcome including ownership in iviewit stock because petitioner conveyed iviewit stock to proskauer in exchange for intellectual property and other legal fees  these are the reasons a complaint was filed against triggs for abuse of his public office and conflict not surprisingly the triggs complaint was refused by tfb and fsc to be formally docketed and procedurally disposed of according to established law                                           iii            wheeler who has recently been arrested in the dui having had an additional complaint filed against him for conflicts including knowingly selecting triggs to represent him in conflict in a blackout period  that second complaint against wheeler cited in petitioners petitions to fsc also went without formal docketing due process and procedure by tfb and then fsc                                          iv            due to the discovery of conflicts at tfb and after conflict was discovered and affirmed by tfb tfb attempted to hurriedly destroy the complaint file on wheeler and triggs prior to the time permitted under the state record retention laws in effort to obstruct justice and failed to prosecute triggs as is a proscribed part of their duties on behalf of petitioner complaint  after ordering a halt on the destruction fsc overturned their prior ruling ordering without explanation the destruction of the tfb work product files                                            v            the fsc order for tfb to respond to petitioners petition which included the charges of conflict of interests and abuses of public office that went unanswered  tfbs response addressed the court and parties incorrectly so as to make the response unintelligible and legally invalid and further failed to address any of the claims asserted in the petition  again tfb knew that they had to avoid having the merits considered at any level  fsc after realizing that tfb was unable to respond to the issues of public office abuse and conflict then ruled against petitioner by denying hearing the case further and attempted to aid evasion of prosecution of the confirmed conflicts and deny petitioner further due process                                           vi            the united states government through these sba loans is the largest single shareholder in petitioner companies and therefore the largest investor in the stolen patents regarding stolen investment funds from the companies by the putative attorneys and their management formal filings were made at the boca raton police department boca pd  boca pd has been supposedly investigating the matters now for several years and where boca pd had told petitioner they had taken the matters to the securities and exchange commission sec for collaborate investigation on the advice of the state attorney and that this was what was taking so much time for investigations as stated by detective robert flechaus  evidence showing that the sec was never informed by boca pd of the crimes was evidenced in a motion to fsc including a plea for intervention to protect petitioner and others based on such information that boca pd was transmitting false information  the motion was denied stating to take the matters to another court without explanation of what court and then fsc removed the motion from the public docket on their website after it had been docketed  petitioner subsequent to the motion for rehearing clarification and certification filed yet another motion to fsc asking for clarification as to what court they referred to and why once they were notified of this law enforcement malfeasances they where not taking the matter to another court where again their judicial cannons would have constituted such reporting of florida law enforcement misconduct even if they did not hear the matters                                         vii            ignoring the fact that tfb reviewer lorraine christine hoffman hoffman had placed the wheeler complaint on hold pending the outcome of the litigation inapposite of the rules regulating the florida bar                                       viii            ignoring the evidence that petitioner was then given yet another inadequate review by eric montel turner turner and again turner acted wholly outside the bounds of law and the rules regulating the florida bar and again wrote letters in favor of proskauers position again based on review and not on formal investigation and disposition  in fact turner now took the step of making legal conclusions in favor of proskauer and wheeler such as they were not patent counsel inapposite of evidence and witness statements submitted by petitioner and where his reviews were steeped in language that was not intelligible or legally sound for lack of clarity  it appeared that proskauer was authoring the letters that turner wrote to support their weak defense that they were not intellectual property counsel for petitioner  turner upon formal written request further refused to clarify his illegible statements  turner upon being challenged by petitioner to take the matter to the next highest level for review claimed there was no further review higher than his and stated the fsc would not even entertain the complaints  prior to hanging up the phone he gave petitioner the general number of tfb stating no one would hear the matter or overturn his final decision  petitioner called such general number and came upon kenneth marvin marvin of tfb who shocked at turners claim that he was the final authority for tfb stated that turner was absolutely incorrect in his assessment and that indeed there were higher levels of escalating the review of his work prior to filing for fsc intervention  marvin directed petitioner back to turner to have turner escalate the complaints to the next highest level of view                                           ix            ignoring the fact that turner then handed the complaint to joy a bartmon bartmon and again there is evidence that without investigation bartmon acted merely as a proskauer liaison and used the tfb letterhead as if it were proskauer letterhead  making assertions that based on her review she found that proskauer was not patent counsel etc again where the rules regulating the florida bar clearly state that without formal investigation or prosecution of the matters tfb is prohibited from making opinion or statement in favor of either party  the only response should have been that after review they had decided not to take the matter under consideration and file charges  yet letters continued to be authored that clearly advanced the proskauer position it was as if proskauer were authoring these letters letters they could use to influence other investigations in an attempt to claim that they had been vindicated of the crimes by tfb after investigation                                             x            ignoring the fact that petitioner within the original petition asked tfb for direct disclosure of the conflicts by those members accused of conflicts and yet there was not a single mention of the word conflict the triggs complaint attached to the petition citing multiple conflicts by triggs while a member of tfb and neither turner in his response on behalf of tfb or triggs as a party to the petition provided a response johnson the president failed to respond to the allegations of her conflict with j wheeler  neither wheeler nor tuner tendered response to the allegations of wheelers conflicts in either the original or second complaint as requested in the petition  the responses to the factual allegations in the petition were completely ignored although fsc had ordered a response to the petition and petitioner assumed that they meant the substantive issues and charges raised  the response instead of addressing a single issue in the petition instead was a response stating their work product was done well and an attempt to claim that they adequately reviewed the complaints and yet failed to acknowledge that such reviews were done with a tainted response included by an officer of tfb triggs how can one claim anything about the reviews if conflict was present in the response which would have invalidated any reviews that could have been influenced by the tainted response                                           xi            ignoring the fact that petitioner then filed a rebuttal to the response which asked the fsc to reconsider such response a non response and rule forward with prejudice against tfb members for defaulting on every substantive issue in their response to the petition not surprising to petitioner at this point fsc instead suddenly refused to hear the case further and again denied petitioner the right to have these matters given fair and impartial due process                                          xii            the fact hat fsc pulled out the case after such failed response to the petition by tfb without explanation for their actions  this further increased petitioners contempt for the legal system with cause and where such contempt is not against the whole of the system just for how easily the process has become susceptible to penetration by a few mob type lawyers and how it has failed in its system of self regulation entirely that must be revamped from ever allowing this infiltration by criminal enterprises disguised as law firms to control it                                        xiii            overlooking information that showed that while petitioner was making a filing with the oed director moatz who after review of the state bar complaints against several of the same attorneys being filed against with his offices asked what the status of the cases in florida and new york were   these state bars were looking at the same evidence and moatz further asked petitioner to have such state bar authorities contact his offices to coordinate and streamline efforts surprised that nothing had already been done  petitioner would hate to label moatz as an instigator or troublemaker and truly thinks of him as an angel but petitioner was blown away by the response to the requests of moatz first by the supreme court of new york appellate division first department departmental disciplinary first dept ddc and then tfb  when first dept ddc chief counsel thomas cahill cahill was asked the status of the case weeks went by without answer to submission after submission asking for status to give to the patent office  when finally petitioner confronted cahill in a phone call it was learned that similar to tfb the matters of the attorney misconduct complaints had been put on hold there pending the civil the litigation  the problem this was in a letter misaddressed to petitioner and never delivered return to sender to first dept ddc  evidence suggests that the letters were created overnight to try and cover up for the lack of due process for well over a year in new york  in the deferral letter the matters were stated to have been placed on hold again in violation of the rules regulating first dept ddc which states similar to florida that disciplinary complainants should not be delayed do to civil actions in progress related or nonrelated   again the civil case had already been limited to billing dispute matters only and thus none of the crimes were being investigated in yet another catch  of injustice where again crimes against several government agencies were involved and exposed to the disciplinary departments and action was cleverly evaded  when cahill was asked to call moatz and given his number cahill refused and stated that his offices would begin immediate investigation of the rubenstein and joao matters  weeks again went by where cahill was harder to find than the wizard of oz when suddenly petitioner received information from an undisclosed thirdparty that perhaps the reason for so much delay was due to the fact that the two most powerful members of the new york courts and the disciplinary departments were directly tied to the accused proskauer and controlling the complaint process  the information revealed that steven c krane krane was directly representing the complaints of rubenstein and later himself at the first dept ddc where he was in fact the most conflicted person in new york  kranes conflicts come from the irrefutable fact that he holds positions including at the time the as president of the nysba with a year of time after his position where he maintained duties and held other concealed roles as a member of the first department ddc all while handling the complaints further krane is a member of proskauers intellectual property department formed after learning of petitioners inventions  that with an ethics background this appears even stranger that krane would have not known that with personal interests in the matters and a multiplicity of roles of influence in the rule creation and enforcement divisions of the nysba and first dept ddc and others that he was in conflict  such concealment reveals instead that this was done with intention by proskauer and krane to act as a barrier to due process and with krane handling the complaints directly petitioners chance of due process was nil  with such fresh information that krane was abusing his public office position and in conflict petitioner approached cahill with the conflicts  cahill immediately denied that he knew of any conflicts and petitioner and shareholders then filed a complaint against krane for his conflicts  in fact while cahill stated that he knew of no roles that conflicted krane and did not know krane petitioner was sitting on resumes of krane clearly showing that he held numerous positions with the nysba and first dept ddc in both rule creation and enforcement committees including post service activities in his role as president of nysba that would have all singularly forced at minimum disclosure but more certainly recusal of his involvement in any way  add to this his direct personal interest in the matters and it is apparent that proskauer choose the most conflicted individual in new york for a reason  other conflicts exist since proskauer is accused in the complaint and directly named as a respondent in that matter kranes self representation of the firm his partner rubenstein and later in the complaint against him were prohibited  krane had direct public offices roles that could even remotely affect the outcome and again failed to disclose any of these prior to representation  in response to the complaint filed against krane krane tendered what can only be described as a response so fraught in fraud and concealment as evidenced in appendix c attempting to separate his nysba roles he maintained from the first dept ddc roles he maintained but concealed them in his response  krane in his response claims that his roles at nysba as former president and still with post position duties and his roles in rule creation and enforcement that affect all disciplinary departments in new york were not conflicting a hard yarn for even krane to spin  so hard in fact that when cahill was confronted with this and refused to file formally the written complaint on krane for the conflicts petitioner went to the clerk of the new york supreme court appellate division first department first dept catherine ohagan wolfe wolfe to find out what the next step was to get the complaints filed against krane formally docketed and heard  upon telling wolfe the circumstances she informed petitioner that krane factually was a member of the first dept ddc at that present moment with a referee role of influence confirming information petitioner had and that she served alongside krane and cahill at the first dept and that they certainly knew that this was conflicted  she was astonished that krane would have denied his roles and that cahill would have similarly denied knowing krane who was a direct member of the first dept ddc or his conflicts  wolfe advised petitioner to file a petition with the first dept on krane rubenstein joao and cahill for knowingly allowing the conflict to succeed and for their efforts to cover such facts up furthermore wolfe stated that kranes influence in the all of the disciplinary departments and rule creation and enforcement roles were obvious conflicts petitions were filed at first dept resulting in a court ordered investigation of rubenstein krane and joao and just how they have evaded that investigation will reveal further conflicts and will be a subject for perhaps the next petition to this court if petitioner is unsuccessful in his efforts here and now  evidence of how such derailment was achieved can be found in appendix c and through review of the new york matters   that the point of new york here is how it relates to the immediate matter before this court and that is that such conflicts of krane led to discovery of triggs acting in conflict as counsel to wheeler  in new york the court ordered investigation was then derailed by the department it was transferred to and again we find department members acting as counsel to the accused and the accused provide no response of their own to complaints against them  again formal written complaints were filed and refused in this instance by those who they were filed against with no legal or procedural basis denying petitioner access again to the legal system and complaint process in new york  the supreme court of new york appellate division second department departmental disciplinary committee second dept ddc was transferred the complaints against rubenstein joao and krane to conduct the court ordered investigation by five justices concurring after duedeliberation to have an investigation of krane rubenstein and joao  yet to get out of this would truly take some magic and that magic comes in the form of altering the word investigation to mean review or good review  upon reviewing the complaints instead of addressing that court that ordered the investigation the second dept ddc wrote to inform petitioner and shareholders that no investigation was done after only a review was done of the materials  the review had not tested a single piece of evidence and failed to call a single witness that was presented in the new york matters  a review that ignored the fact that the uspto and the uspto oed had begun formal investigation of two of three attorneys complained and commenced investigation of them  a review that ignored the fact that the fbi had taken these matters to the united states attorney for further disposition and investigation and also failed to take into account that the patents were suspended by the uspto commissioner directly due to charges of fraud upon the uspto by two of three attorneys  a review that failed to seek a response from krane directly to the conflicts he was caught in and in fact where the second dept and second dept ddc authored his response and defense for him and again without legal basis finally members of second dept not even legally involved in the complaint process tried an attempt to dismiss all the cases and allow formal complaints and investigations to be evaded second dept ddc immediately became suspect with their failure to follow the court ordered investigation in favor of review upon confronting the reviewer chief counsel diana maxfield kearse kearse further conflicts were immediately discovered and affirmed by the reviewer herself  kearse having admitted having professional and personal relations with krane then stated that if petitioner and shareholders wanted a disclosure of her conflicts to put it in writing  once caught in conflict and failure to follow a court ordered investigation kearse failed to respond to the conflict letter and continued to handle the matters personally  finally refusing to docket complaints against her refusing disclosure of her conflicts with krane and kaye that she had already admitted kearse still persisted in maintaining her decision to review and not investigate stating that she was not under the jurisdiction of the first dept and thus not obligated to investigate  the matter was escalated to the chairman lawrence digiovanna digiovanna of second dept ddc and for his refusal to docket the complaints against kearse his failure to force her to publicly disclose the conflicts she had admitted having a complaint was filed against digiovanna that similarly kearse refused to formally docket according to proper procedure   where krane and kayes influence were obvious at second dept ddc now petitioner called james pelzer pelzer clerk of the supreme court of new york appellate division second department second dept to find out what the next step was in elevating these matters and having second dept move the complaints due to conflicts and failure to docket formal written complaints against second dept ddc members and force the investigation ordered by first dept  pelzer than took the matter to chief justice of the second dept a gail prudenti prudenti who made a grandstand effort to use her position of influence similar to what boggs had done in florida to exculpate triggs on disciplinary letterhead to act as counsel for everyone involved from the department and all the proskauer partners prudenti attempted to justify the actions of the accused applaud their work state that a review is kind of like an investigation and get the complaints out of her court as evidenced in appendix c  petitioner prior to these actions by pelzer and prudenti had formally requested that prior to their involvement which had no basis in law or formal procedure in the disciplinary process that they formally and publicly disclose any conflicts  on information and belief it was learned prior to their involvement that prudenti and pelzer had conflict with krane  kaye and whereby their refusal to affirm or deny a formal written disclosure request stating if they were conflicted with any of the parties prior to having involvement is taken by petitioner that the source information regarding the conflicts is correct  the reason this disclosure was so important was that petitioner was now weary of pelzer who had turned the complaints over to prudenti as petitioner and pelzer had prior discussed the need for conflict waivers from all parties due to positions of prominence in the disciplinary department of those being accused and where pelzer had assured petitioner that he would make certain everyone disclosed any conflicts in advance  petitioner was shocked when kearse was first confronted regarding her decision to obstruct the first dept order for investigation with an attorney present on the line marc garber esq garber and admitted that he she had conflicting relations with krane and kaye  petitioner called pelzer being the direct cause of two formerly innocent people kearse and digionvanna now having complaints filed against them for his failure to screen for conflicts as promised  pelzer then assured petitioner that he would talk to prudenti to find out if petitioner should petition first dept to enforce the investigation order or second dept  instead petitioner received a letter from prudenti authored by pelzer attempting to dismiss everything to claim that investigation had been done directly opposite the statements in the reviewers letter stating no investigation was done and put a spin on the word investigation never before heard  again where that letter has no bearing as it comes with no legal or procedural basis by two people not involved in the disciplinary process and thus that letter of recommendation for proskauer may be considered garbage except as evidence for forthcoming complaints against prudenti and pelzer for their involvement and misuse of public office  yet it is useless to file complaints when they control the department and refuse to process complaints against members of their department until such controls are removed  how could this be happening crimes ignored violations of ethics so grotesque unheard crimes against the united states and foreign nations overlooked by members involved in the disciplinary processes and investigations derailed  the answers were unknown until recently where again through undisclosed third parties information regarding how such blockage occurred surfaced revealing that controls were so high up in the process as to block petitioner from access to the courts and disciplinary processes in new york  this led to uncovering in new york conflict that permeates directly from krane to chief judge of the new york supreme court of appeals nysc judith kaye kaye whom krane not only formerly clerked for but who is married to a proskauer partner stephen kaye s kaye also strangely a member of the proskauer newly formed patent department  kaye has vested interest in petitioner companies as a holder of founding shares of stock vis a vis her marriage interests  a greater conflict is the fact that if petitioner is successful in securing fair and impartial due process anywhere in new york that s kaye krane and proskauer will face lengthy federal prison sentences and loss of property  there is also conflict in that kaye is the most powerful figure in both the courts of new york and its disciplinary departments and where in a recently published article she states that proskauer is the in firm to work for in new york  in new york after discovery of conflict petitioner had contacted the court of appeals to gain kayes intervention not knowing at the time her marital interests in the matter and sent over the petition filed at first department to that court  these concealed conflicts and violations of public office is how proskauer and their partners evaded the evidence prosecution and retribution for the crimes  simply through controlling justice top down in conflict and perverting the whole legal system and all it stands for acting in concealed conflicts and committing ever increasing numbers of crimes to prevent petitioner from fair and impartial due process through a complete desecration of law and public office  petitioner has played fair at every level and fears not their ability to purchase justice to pervert justice or to otherwise use the law to commit these most heinous of crimes as triggs and krane so eloquently stated in their conflict tendered responses on behalf of their criminal firm and partners petitioner fears no evil  for further evidence of this please refer to appendix c and the deposition in the litigation of petitioner contained therein  whereupon confronting tfb to work with moatz similar to new york collaboration was refused and later led to uncovering the triggs conflicts                                       xiv            ignoring that the verified conflict of triggs and krane should have forced the prior reviews that were tendered in conflict in both states to be thrown out and resulted in immediate charges against triggs krane wheeler and rubenstein for violations of their legal ethics the law and public offices in new york and florida  how this was allowed to evade prosecution cannot be understood by reading the former reviewers or responses in either state and trying to evaluate the matters from those conflicted members it must be understood by first removing the controllers of the process in conflict entirely which is all the petitioner has constantly asked for a conflict free forum in which to have due process  it is an irony to note that with leading law firms being accused they all seem to be afraid of the courtroom against a solo pro se inventor having all the lawyers in the world to defend them at their disposal  yet again and again the only way they have prevailed in these state supreme court run disciplinary agencies is to keep the matters out of the courtroom through conflict and abuse of power  all of these failures of the legal system are caused by a few bad apples positioning perfectly to use the establishment as a criminal tool to serve their other criminal ends nonetheless such conversion of the establishment has had a massive impact on the loss of petitioners rights as an inventor protected at the opening of the constitution in article  section  clause  and denied by the very system the constitution created to protect those rights with all due deference in regard to this courts schedule petitioner prays this court to hear this case as soon as possible once filed as petitioners invention rights are close to being permanently lost due to the above referenced actions of the accused attorneys and judicial officials  these losses of rights will occur in only weeks both nationally and internationally  any such permanent loss of petitioners rights as an inventor or otherwise would now be directly attributable to not only the accused lawyers but the legal systems failure to take actions against its own members and allow conflicts to prevail  this court must find reason to intercede on behalf of petitioner as the legal systems involvement in causing such loss from corrupted patent attorneys to corrupted bar members acting in violation of public offices to denial of petitioners rights to file complaints against members of the legal community and to an obstruction of justice by justice are compelling in that they represent the single largest threat to the institution of law this country has ever witnessed  these factors make it impossible for petitioner to assert claims in any venue he goes to protect the intellectual properties and his constitutional rights in those states  yet while the bad guys continue to control the courts and disciplinary processes they appear bullet proof even when caught  neither triggs nor krane has been forced to respond to conflicts and formal filed complaints against them and that takes some heavy controls   in fact not only do they not have to respond we find the disciplinary agencies responding and defending them as if they were counsel for them  petitioner thus comes before this court battered and abused denied all of his rights in the legal system and processes with his inventions not only stolen but converted and monetized by his attorneys for their profit and having no safe harbor to press his claims free of conflicts of interest petitioner having exhausted his legal remedies within a corrupted system acting as a barrier to his rights and causing further damages as a contributory factor in denying his constitutionally protected rights to inventions calls to this court to join his efforts  from the legal systems failure to act no matter the reason in the end in fact has become an accomplice to the crimes and will be viewed by the public as such due to the delays caused by the conflicts and abuses of public offices the denial of due process the denial to access to the courts petitioner and shareholders have lost permanently it appears certain intellectual property rights already already in violate of article  section  clause  caused by a catastrophic failure of the legal system to protect civil rights from corruption within  these losses already incurred may cause this court to later be called in anyway to determine how exactly the law will have to change to revive and restore inventors rights already lost despondent denied access to the legal system at every level exhausted of every dollar in efforts to bring these matters to justice so much so as to force his family to poverty to protect shareholder interests in the patents petitioner prays that these walls of justice cannot and will not allow this mockery of the legal system to continue for a second longer  these threats to i the legal system which freedom is dependent on ii the bar and disciplinary system which ensure that corruption cannot penetrate the legal system that freedom is dependent on iii the patent system which free commerce is dependent on and instituted by congress under article  to protect the constitutional rights of inventors iv the patent bar which ensures that free commerce is ensured through attorney regulation and protects inventors from corrupt patent attorneys all hang in the balance of this courts decision to hear these matters and force due process and procedure free of further possible conflict or abuse of public office  never before this court have so many issues and threats to the constitution and the establishment of law combined  so significant are these issues that if the crimes succeed it could cause the public and inventors to fear that patent lawyers can steal their inventions then block due process block access to the courts of the inventors trying to get them back and finally deny any rights to complain against the attorneys or public officials involved  further that to achieve their ends they can violate public offices and conflicts laws ad nauseam and then do everything to destroy the inventors life liberty and pursuit of the good old american dream will cause panacea worldwide  a wrong decision or no decision or no help from this court the court of last resort would eventually as the matters are tried and afforded due process at some point lead to a collapse in the patent system and fear that invention is something to tell your children not to do or to file in russia for any patents when the legal system itself serves its enemy the end of our freedoms has arrived  is this worth proskauer and their coconspirators stealing petitioners inventions however valuable they are absolutely not the buck must stop here in praying that this court will pave the way for petitioners rights to be fully restored through due process the petitioner begs for all relief this court has in its power in the matters and including but not limited to the following                                              i            secure the files of respondents and all parties listed herein and in appendix c that have records pertaining to these matters where evidence has already shown that official documents have all ready been tampered with including but not limited to the uspto the state departments of florida and delaware supreme courts and disciplinary departments of florida and new york and foreign nations these documents are essential to the patent matters and determining culpability and before further destruction takes place order an immediate seizure of all records                                            ii            issue any orders to secure and freeze all remaining patent filings both here and abroad before any other loss can occur while these matters are being investigated and until all matters are concluded to the fullest extent of the law and all appeals exhausted                                           iii            issue any orders in its power to insure that going forward that fair and impartial due process will prevail and where all parties involved are prescreened for conflict with the thousands of lawyers and legal establishments now entangled in historys greatest bungled crime                                          iv            prescreen all members of even this court for possible conflict prior to review and where petitioner asks as a precautionary measure  further that all justices write a simple statement that they are not conflicted or related to any of the thousands lawyers or members of the bars accused herein and in appendix c so as to provide absolute assurance that there is no chance that later a conflict arises causing any cause for public concern with this most esteemed court to have a statement that no prior conversations with any of the accused has taken place and where this is precautionary as well as these attorneys have access to even this court and even the slightest prior conversation with anyone involved could be cause of concern or later conflict  since petitioner has no access to this court on either a social or professional basis and the accused do it could be construed as unethical if prior conversations or any involvement in the matters had taken place prior without full public disclosure  petitioner is ashamed to ask this court for such but such request is also valid since these law firms have prior infiltrated state supreme courts and have had plenty of time to started to plant even at this level and where again petitioner states that this is precautionary versus accusatory  humbly i ask this request                                            v            issue any relief in response to the statutes cited herein and in appendix c that have been violated federally                                          vi            issue the relief of aiding petitioner to find a counselor at law that is not conflicted with any of the parties and licensed to practice before this court  or provide an attorney to petitioner due to the catastrophic ruins preventing petitioner from affording or even trusting a lawyer caused by the failures in the legal system due to the accused abuses of such systems                                         vii            issue relief to provide an oversight committee to these matters composed of non conflicted third party non lawyers such as a grand jury or special inquisition or whatever this court sees fit                                       viii            hear this case exclusively and hear the matters directly in this court if possible as even over ruling fsc in this case and sending the matters back to florida or new york cannot ensure fair and impartial due process at any level where those supreme courts and bar agencies are now in conflict directly with petitioner                                          ix            take this case before this court or provide some forum of quorum as to ensure that delay in the courts does not happen again through infiltration and corruption in filing legal remedies that could cause further loss of rights to invention and where by the time appeals would be heard total loss of the intellectual property both here and abroad would be lost                                            x            provide patent counsel for petitioner as moatz has suggested that it would benefit both the uspto in their efforts and petitioner in his but after the fiasco petitioner has had with now five or six patent counsels he would prefer that this court provide such counselor who will fear repercussion of this court for any further attempts at foul play                                          xi            issue orders to make this case expedited due to the imminent dangers inventor bernstein and others are in in trying to expose this scandal as close to a watergate as this nation has come  recent evidence shows in a petition that was going to be filed requesting additional time to file this petition sent to the clerk of this court jeff atkins atkins which demonstrates that abuse of process is now occurring to attempt to cause harm such as loss of home to petitioner and petitioners family through another frivolous and harassing legal action of eviction that was later withdrawn by the opposing lawyers on the eve of that hearing yet interfered with the preparation of the filing significantly as petitioner had to devote considerable time preparing a pro se response and learning yet another code section of law  also that eviction action is part of the reason petitioner decided to hold on the extension request to prepare the best possible petition for this court under extreme fear that prior to filing he would be evicted and penniless on the street with his family and unable to file anything with this court in such state where evidence shows that lawyers involved in that proceeding submitted a series of false and fraudulent documents to achieve their ends to that court and then ran away from the courtroom when confronted with petitioners pro se response  petitioner has no money is on welfare has been entirely deprived of his rights and freedoms and can not turn to legal remedies to help him and his family anywhere they go  petitioner begs this court to look at this eviction case carefully as described in the extension sent to atkins and see the damages caused to my children by these attorneys that ignored mold issues identified by state health agencies and florida power and light as problems  where instead of dealing with the mold growth and instead of curing the problem they ignored them and filed legal actions against petitioner ignoring serious health problems which may now have caused permanent damage to his children  petitioner prays for his children and his wifes safety that this court cause immediate resolution to these matters that obstructions of justice have obstructed long enough and before these monsters described herein take further harmful actions either through abuse of legal process to harass and harm or other actions  reasons for granting writ petitioner and shareholders are seeking this courts intervention to turn the patents back to the rightful owners and be compensated for the losses endured  that all of these financial gains through patent pools such as mpeg and other illegal mechanisms be redirected to petitioner and shareholders and the licensing royalties be redirected to the true and proper inventors as called for under the constitution  finally to have this court put the criminal enterprises disguised as law firms out of existence and all those who aided and abetted the crimes through utter desecration of the legal institution and all it stands for stripped of their legal titles and put in federal prison  petitioner prays this court should see no mercy in distributing punishment to those directly in violation of law and everything sacred in our constitution entrusted them to uphold  that this court send a message so powerful to attorneys thinking of corrupting and violating their attorneyclient privileges and further violating public offices to further crimes that attorneys going forward will fear the repercussions of this court and cite this case and the punishments meted out as reason to follow the path of the righteous    this case represents one of the greatest threats to this nation in our history by a quasi mafia type of lawyer group that has infiltrated the legal system and the patent office to carrier out their criminal enterprise of theft of intellectual properties  this case also represents one of the greatest tales of perseverance of the inventors and the petitioner and shareholders against all odds denied of almost every legal right normally afforded to protect them and where those systems designed to protect inventors turned from protection to further abuses of process both civilly and through the attorney disciplinary agencies becoming the further cause of loss of rights  because the criminal organization controls the courts and acts to block due process and deny the rights of the inventors never has an inventor been subjected to such abuse not only by big business but by their trusted attorneys and the entirety of the legal process that now serves to further their criminal ends  this court must be where the buck stops to this madness heaped on your steps by attorneys that to petitioner and shareholders are nothing more than crooks cloaked in lawyers clothing that must be stopped short of succeeding as a success for them in stealing the inventions and successfully derailing due process and access to the courts is a loss for the legal system and every honest lawyer practicing law  in fact along with the threat this case poses to free commerce and the faith in the patent system by johnny q public public it represents a threat to the beliefs in the constitutions powers to establish laws designed to protect inventors and the checks and balances that should have ceased the madness when the claims were first presented  this case also could cause a loss by public in the faith of the state legal systems selfregulating disciplinary process the state civil court processes and the state supreme courts ability to oversight the process where it could be construed that the system was easily infiltrated entirely by the very criminals being accused   if they are successful we can teach our children the following lessons                                              i            do not invent essential technologies and then seek to patent them using white shoe law firms for they may steal them and violate their attorneyclient privileges to convert your inventions to their own names and profit                                            ii            do not take inventions to uspto for fear that those representing the patent offices can then file your inventions to inure remuneration for themselves while destroying you and your patents through a conversion that comes through violation of their oaths and legal privileges and frauds on the patent office                                            iii            if you catch them in the act of stealing your patents and inventions you cannot trust taking it to the legal system to protect your rights for they can block you there from your rights to due process and procedure by violating public offices and other dubious methods to prevent you from pressing any legal rights                                           iv            that in fact if you then catch them in conflict and violation of their public offices you may be denied the right to complain against them and in some instances they may refuse the complaints against themselves and their criminal brethren at the door  this obviously is a story that would put and end to the patent office for inventors in the united states and poses significant threat to the lawyers who practice patent law and that patent office that is the engine of free commerce  a failure to correct these overwhelming injustices would cause catastrophic distrust and disdain for the legal system civilly and the attorney complaint and disciplinary agencies fearing they are no more than legal country clubs penetrable by corrupt attorneys who run them as their own private law firm in conflict to deflect complaints wholly inapposite of the florida and united states constitutional intent in creating such organizations and selfregulating enforcement agencies  where the moral of the story to your kids would have to be that with the odds stacked against you in every legal venue to take your patents to another country and hope for a more honest system that has not corrupted from a to z  foreign inventors would fear the united states patent system and fear patenting their inventions here united states inventors would seek protections elsewhere and the damage to the economy and legal system would be staggering therefore we ask this court not only to invoke its regulatory oversight of the state supreme courts and the state disciplinary agencies as it has power under its jurisdiction when they appear infiltrated by corruption but to also invoke its powers to protect the inventors rights under the constitution and their rights under due process and procedure  this matter cannot be turned back over to the states for further abuse as this may lead perhaps to a further loss of inventions and where recent actions in the european patent office have led to loss that was caused directly by the delays in due process and procedure under international treatise designed to protect united states inventors rights in foreign countries when filed as pct applications in the united states  certainly there is no other court in the land that can resolve in as timely a fashion as this matter now merits the multiplicity of state federal and international crimes committed and the retributions necessary to save the rights of the inventors  that this court must oversight justice gone awry at the state level to stop the corruption that maintains control over the process of justice in those states and to prevent further loss of constitutionally protected rights of the citizens from being denied as direct result of failure of the state courts and disciplinary agencies in those states  perhaps this is why the forefathers in designing the constitution placed the inventors rights after creation of this court and immediately prior to state courts being created in article  section  clause  and left such matters as inventors rights directly with this court the inventor and those that opposed the rights of the inventor  petitioner begs this court to force the return of the inventions to their proper owners and restore and remunerate petitioner and shareholders their civil rights to their property and all other rights heretofore denied and issue all relief to protect them and the united states and enjoin petitioner and shareholders in actions that correct this infiltration of corruption in the legal system and restore justice and civil rights as the constitution mandates  conclusion petitions for writ of certiorari extraordinary writ writ of habeas corpus writ of prohibition and writ of mandamus are all necessary here to address fundamental elements of this courts power to protect the constitutional rights of the citizens to their property access to the courts access to counsel and due process under law when state courts have failed in and further acted as accomplice to preventing such freedom of rights  similarly these are all necessary for this court to take action on behalf of the government and the threat these matters pose to the establishment respectfully submitted in forma pauperis eliot i bernstein  pro se  stonehenge circle  suite  boynton beach fl
