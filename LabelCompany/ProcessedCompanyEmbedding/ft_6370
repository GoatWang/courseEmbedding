javasdk bvseo cloud getcontent ms questions product customer reviews  amp  in metal cutting circular saw is rated  out of  by  rated  out of  by anonymous from good saw but found same mfg flaw on two i needed something to cut sheet metal with and borrowed a used  abused one i tried the saw out cutting some parts out of ga   and loved it just what i needed an economical dependable comfortable tool for cutting sheet metal cleanly no more grinding  i ordered my own the next day the box it came in was in perfect condition but i found that milwaukee has a manufacturing flaw where the shoe assembly bracket is riveted  tack welded onto the shoe plate as my new one was broken loose upon opening it the borrowed one was as well but i figured it was due to abuse  just lined it up  welded it back in place a simple adjustment needs to be made on milwaukees machine for better welds plus shipping me a new shoe assembly since its brand new date published  rated  out of  by anonymous from time saver i have been using my metal cutting saw for several years and cut  gauge panels like it was plywood just finished hose supports by ripping  sch  pipe x  ft in half the blade was never replaced but perfect finish date published  rated  out of  by anonymous from saves time and less mess i use this saw in my fabrication shop it is a real timesaver over using a torch makes a clean cool cut no warping on thinner metals only complain is the shoe mount needs attntion i welded mine back on it is stainless so its not a fix for everyone date published  rated  out of  by anonymous from great time saver occasionally need to cut up to ga mild steel electrical equipment panelsswitchgear in shop or field this saw is a  improvement over the reciprocating or grinding type tools we have used in the past borrowed it one day and then ordered one for next day delivery  hours after we started using it such a dramatic improvement that listing cons would be petty date published  rated  out of  by barnhill from milwaukee metal cutting saw i am a multicraft worker at work and i was really impress with the easy of using this saw almost as easy as using a saw for lumber but at slower travel speed we use this saw to cut various flat metal sheet metal cpurlin cable tray square tubing and cutting angles but keep safety in mind smaller metal need to be clamp down to cut highly recommend ear plugs glasses and gloves maintain a firm grip should saw to get in a bind toward the end of a cut iit has a heck of a kickback  just back it out of the cut and come in from the other side a great tool date

metal cutting saw for several years and cut  gauge panels like it was plywood just finished hose supports by ripping  sch  pipe x  ft in half the blade was never replaced but perfect finish date published  rated  out of  by anonymous from great time saver occasionally need to cut up to ga mild steel electrical equipment panelsswitchgear in shop or field this saw is a  improvement over the reciprocating or grinding type tools we have used in the past borrowed it one day and then ordered one for next day delivery  hours after we started using it such a dramatic improvement that listing cons would be petty date published  rated  out of  by anonymous from saves time and less mess i use this saw in my fabrication shop it is a real timesaver over using a torch makes a clean cool cut no warping on thinner metals only complain is the shoe mount needs attntion i welded mine back on it is stainless so its not a fix for everyone date published  rated  out of  by anonymous from good saw but found same mfg flaw on two i needed something to cut sheet metal with and borrowed a used  abused one i tried the saw out cutting some parts out of ga   and loved it just what i needed an economical dependable comfortable tool for cutting sheet metal cleanly no more grinding  i ordered my own the next day the box it came in was in perfect condition but i found that milwaukee has a manufacturing flaw where the shoe assembly bracket is riveted  tack welded onto the shoe plate as my new one was broken loose upon opening it the borrowed one was as well but i figured it was due to abuse  just lined it up  welded it back in place a simple adjustment needs to be made on milwaukees machine for better welds plus shipping me a new shoe assembly since its brand new date published  rated  out of  by mln from milwaukee has done it again for metal cuting you can not beat this saw from sheet metal to heavier stock it cuts threw it like butter very easy to use and set up date
