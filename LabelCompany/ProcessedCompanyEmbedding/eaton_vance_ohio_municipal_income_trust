first quarter of  with the bloomberg barclays municipal bond index the index returning  for the threemonth period after experiencing a significant amount of volatility foll owing donald trumps presidential election victory during the fourth quarter of  the municipal market stabilized during the first quarter during the period shortterm municipal yields declined  basis points while intermediate and longerter m yields were flat to slightly higher after experiencing significantly negative outflows during the last six weeks of  mutual fund flows stabilized and turned positive in january as some investors sought to take advantage of both higher municipal yields and attractive relative valuatio ns despite this expression of confidence at the beginning of the year mutual fund flows for the entire quarter were fairly tepid with overall inflows totaling just under  billion issuance during the quarter declined to  billion compared to  b illion during the fourth quarter of  the slowdown in issuance was largely related to the a decline in refunding activity due to higher interest rates and the uncertainty surrounding president trumps agenda for health care tax reform and infrastruc ture spending compared to the sharp selloff during the fourth quarter the municipal market was relatively quiet during the first quarter treasury yields traded in a fairly tight range and the curve was more or less unchanged meanwhile the municipal yield curve st eepened significantly as two and fiveyear yields declined  and  basis points respectively while year yields increased bp as a result short term municipals outperformed longerterm municipals with the fiveand sevenyear part of the curve le ading the way in terms of credit quality lower quality municipals outperformed higher quality as bbbs within the index returned  compared to aaas up  similarly after underperforming significantly during the fourth quarter the bloomberg barclays high yield municipal bond index returned  significantly outperforming investment grade this outperformance was primarily due to higher carry spread tightening and renewed strength in the tobacco sector which returned  finally puerto rico cred its underperformed significantly following the release of its certified financial plan in midmarch which proved to be more negative for all bondholders than previously anticipated performance summary  eaton vance municipal income trust the trust evn underperformed the index at net asset value for the quarter the funds security selection within zero coupon bonds and electricpower sector bonds hurt performance relative to the index for the qu arter the funds security selection within the idr pcr industrial development revenue and pollution control revenue sector bonds aided relative performance in addition the funds security selection within insured puerto rico bonds bolstered perform ance the funds use of leverage employed through tobs and auction preferred shares aided from performance relative to the index these securities act as a financing mechanism allowing investors to borrow at shortterm rates and invest in higheryielding bonds historical returns as of mar   annualized  mo

cumulative fund factsas of mar   performance inception  investment outlook and fund positioning  we believe munis continue to be attractive on both an absolute and relative level intermediate and longerterm municipals stabilized during the quarter and the  and year municipaltotreasury ratios ended the quarter at  and  respectivel y lackluster mutual fund flows and the ongoing expectation of lower taxes under the trump administration have combined to keep municipal valuations attractive in our view in addition we continue to lack specific details related to the specifics of trump s policies what will get through congress and when as a result there are a wide range of potential outcomes in our view the historic move higher in yields during the fourth quarter of  created an emerging opportunity to lock in higher yields and potentially generate higher future returns after the first three months of  we believe this opportunity r emains in place in recent history the municipal market has proven to be resilient and sharp increases in municipal yields have resulted in buying opportunities and rewarded investors with strong returns in subsequent months therefore we continue to b elieve that municipal yields could move back down a bit in  there are other factors that could cause rates to retrace a bit especially on the longer end of the treasury curve first us treasury yields are still historically low but very attract ive when compared with other developed markets such as europe and japan second following the failure to reform the affordable care act uncertainty surrounding president trumps ability to deliver on the policy front has increased and finally after i ncreasing the fed funds rate by  basis points during the first quarter the federal reserve is forecasting two more rate hikes in  demonstrating a willingness to squeeze off inflationary pressures if necessary given this outlook we believe taxsensitive investors continue to be offered the opportunity to scale into munis at attractive yields and valuations in addition we believe municipals will continue to act as an anchor to provide diversification in the context of an
