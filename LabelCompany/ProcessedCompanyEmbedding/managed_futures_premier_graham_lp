with the euro in the energy markets short natural gas futures positions recorded gains as prices fell when the american gas association reported growing inventories and lack of demand throughout most

domestic stock markets and the us  economy overall may have bottomed out leading to an increase in demand additional losses were recorded from newly established long gold futures positions as gold prices sharply reversed lower after spiking higher earlier in the month after reports that russian president vladimir putin was willing to sell part of russias gold reserves to help flood victims in
