growth strategy lanny thorndike is the coportfolio manager the portfolio managers conduct fundamental bottomup research analysis on existing and prospective holdings century’s equity analysts are leveraged for affirmation and confirmation on companies they are analyzing the equity analysts have dedicated gics sector coverage we believe that this dedicated coverage leads to strong knowledge and experience which enhances the large cap growth investment process investment philosophy the key tenets of the century large cap growth investment philosophy are invest in solid high quality businesses to help mitigate risk be contrarian at purchase exploit the herd mentality apply exhaustive fundamental research targeting growth profitability and valuation express bets in a high conviction portfolio investment approach  universe the large cap growth investment approach is fundamental bottomup the investment style is traditional large cap growth the strategy’s benchmark is the russell  growth index the investment universe typically consists of roughly  companies that have a market capitalization greater than  billion at purchase and trade on a us stock exchange fundamental research the fundamental research step of the investment process is perhaps the most important this is the phase where we dig deeply into the fundamentals of the company and the industry in which it operates the large cap growth strategy invests primarily in two types of investment opportunities  “core growth” companies which typically have a leading market share position high barriers to entry consistent growth and profitability a strong balance sheet and business model sustainability and  “secular growth” companies that commonly demonstrate faster topline growth are experiencing positive industry tailwinds have disruptive business models that are redefining a value proposition for customers and are often innovative businesses with visionary leaders at the buy point the investment approach is contrarian in nature we seek to identify companies experiencing a temporary event that has prompted the stock price to drop fairly meaningfully creating an attractive valuation ideally the stock price has stabilized leaving additional downside risk more muted as some shortterm bad news is reflected in the stock price at this point the research conclusion is that there’s a potential multiple expansion opportunity with a company where forecasted earnings growth remains solid to qualify for purchase the portfolio managers seek at least  appreciation potential over the next  months with a list of candidates sourced from our screening methodology and idea generation we then further filter the candidates through both a quantitative and qualitative analysis in terms of the quantitative analysis we compare and contrast a new idea’s financial performance against that of its industry peer group this analysis incorporates a combination of growth profit valuation and leverage metrics further the analysis covers several years of historical performance as well as a couple years of forecasted assumptions this analysis enables us to quickly compare and contrast the performance of one company against that of its peers this assessment is important because we believe that a company’s ultimate valuation is a function of its growth and profit margin outlook armed with a better understanding of a company’s historical financial performance and outlook we conduct a qualitative analysis the qualitative analysis conducted is similar to michael porter’s five forces analysis we analyze the level of competition within a given industry and business strategy development we then dig into the annual and quarterly reports from the company and its competitors listen to earnings conference calls review sellside research and often conduct meetings directly with company managements this analysis provides us with a more complete mosaic of the company and the industry in which it operates the financial analysis paints the picture while the qualitative analysis provides the added context which is also important once an investment candidate passes the deeper quantitative and qualitative analyses we then work to estimate by establishing a price target what potential return we might earn if we buy the stock valuation once an understanding of the industry landscape is achieved for a company the focus shifts to valuation a company’s price  earnings next  months price  sales next  months and enterprise value  ebitda next  months are analyzed both on an absolute basis and relative to a company’s sector and the broader market a month price target is established for each existing and prospective holding price targets are established by forecasting earnings expectations then applying an appropriate multiple typically wall street consensus estimates are used appropriate multiples are determined utilizing the following  the historical multiple of the company going back  years and  the current multiple being granted to the company’s industry peer group a target multiple may be adjusted based on a company’s competitive positioning within its industry as well as company specific issues portfolio construction typically the portfolio managers construct a high conviction portfolio of  companies with favorable growth profitability and valuation attributes position sizes mostly range from  of portfolio assets at purchase with a maximum position size of  cash reserves are generally less than  the portfolio managers make the final decisions for the century large cap growth strategy including portfolio construction sell discipline a stock may be sold or trimmed for the following reasons deterioration of fundamentals price target

strategy he is supported by century’s equity analysts and traders the team conducts fundamental bottomup research analysis on existing and prospective holdings the research analysts have dedicated gics sector coverage we believe that this dedicated focus leads to strong knowledge and experience which we think enhances the small cap value investment process each equity analyst has deep experience researching companies as a result each of them has developed an extensive list of company and industry contacts along with domain expertise that we believe are valuable when researching companies the team’s approach to company research is intensive with the portfolio manager and equity analysts each having a goal to meet with  companies per year investment philosophy century’s small cap value investment philosophy has four primary tenets small capitalization markets are inefficient this provides an opportunity to utilize a fundamental research approach to identify superior companies trading at a discount to intrinsic value in the context of value investing it is important to delineate between less innovative and more innovative sectors focus on opportunities with the greatest upside potential emphasizing a combination of both classic valuation and relative valuationearnings power neutralize relative benchmark risk to isolate stock selection as the primary source of alpha mitigating the difficulty of consistently predicting market sector and industry direction while delivering high active share investment universe the small cap value market capitalization range is generally within the range of the russell  value rv index typically  million to  billion fundamental research the strategy’s fundamental research process includes both financial modeling and qualitative analysis the model is designed to develop an understanding of a company’s operating dynamics financials margins and growth rates and perform various scenario and sensitivity analyses the strategy’s qualitative analysis is focused around researching the key drivers of the business the portfolio manager analyzes the industry’s competitive landscape speaks with company management and listens to past earnings calls the company specific research is further complemented with a formal sector profile designed to focus on the key catalysts driving sector dynamics valuation the strategy’s primary valuation methodology is a discounted cash flow dcf model once the dcf analysis is completed the portfolio manager considers the output within the context of less innovative and more innovative sectors in less innovative sectors we compare a company’s intrinsic value to the current stock price in more innovative sectors we compare a company’s intrinsic value to street estimates and the deviation between the two portfolio construction the portfolio manager constructs a portfolio typically consisting of  companies larger positions generally range from  –  and tend to exhibit high expected return potential and a positive contribution to risk smaller positions typically range from  –  the risk and return profile can be higher or more moderate if the return profile is high the smaller position is generally based on the desired sector or industry exposure relative to the benchmark from a portfolio construction standpoint sell discipline the portfolio manager utilizes a comprehensive and flexible sell discipline the following may trigger a sale company’s cumulative valuation and earnings upside potential approaches fair value better opportunities exist
