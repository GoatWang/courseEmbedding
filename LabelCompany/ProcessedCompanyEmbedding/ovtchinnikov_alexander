this listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the united states patent and trademark office uspto laser ablation process for manufacturing submounts for laser diodes and laser diode units publication number  abstract a method for manufacturing submounts for laser diodes includes the steps of providing a base configured with a ceramic carrier and a metal layer deposited upon the substrate the method further includes using a pulsed laser operative to generate a plurality of pulses which are selectively trained at predetermined pattern on the metal layers surface so as to ablate the desired regions of the metal layer to the desired depth thereafter the base is divided into a plurality of submounts each supporting a laser diode the metal layer includes a silver sublayer deposited upon the ceramic and having a thickness sufficient to effectively facilitate heat dissipation type application filed

of patent september   assignee ipg photonics corporation inventors alexander ovtchinnikov igor berishev alexey komissarov svletan todorov pavel trubenko wavelength stabilized diode laser module with limited back reflection publication number  abstract a module is configured with a housing enclosing a diode laser fast and slow axes collimators are located behind the rear facet of the laser which along with a front facet defines an intracavity cavity of the laser the facets are partially transmissive to light and therefore emit laser light a wavelength selective optical element is aligned with the collimators and configured to reflect light emitted through the back facet and processed by collimators back into the intracavity as a result the laser beam is emitted through the front facet at a wavelength locked on the desired wavelength of the optical element a delivery fiber is mechanically coupled to the front facet of diode laser and configured to receive and guide the emitted laser beam along the path of light type application filed october   publication date may   applicant ipg photonics corporation inventors alexander ovtchinnikov alexey komissarov igor berishev dmitriy

semiconductor unit with submount for semiconductor device publication number  abstract a semiconductor unit includes a submount and a chip coupled to the submount the submount is configured with a base and a plurality of layers between the base and the chip one of the layers a heatspreading electroconducting sliver “ag” layer is deposited atop the base the thickness of the ag layer is selected so that a cumulative coefficient of thermal expansion of the submount substantially matches that one of the chip coupled to the active zone of the chip is a stressdumping layer made from elastic malleable materials type application filed december   publication date april   applicant iipg photonics corporation inventors alexander ovtchinnikov alexey komissarov igor berishev svetlan todorov optical device patent number  abstract a laser diode is configured with a substrate delimited by opposite ar and hr reflectors and a gain region the gain region bridges the portions of the respective ar and hr reflectors and is configured with a main resonant cavity and at least one side resonant cavity the main resonant cavity spans between the portions of the respective reflectors and at least one additional resonant cavity extends adjacent to the main resonator cavity the gain region is configured so that stimulated emission is generated only in the main resonant cavity accordingly the laser diode is operative to radiate a highpower output beam emitted through the portion of the ar reflector which is dimensioned to shape the output beam with the desired nearfield type grant filed
