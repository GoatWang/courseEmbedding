artery disease pad is the narrowing or blockage of vessels that carry blood from the heart to the extremities caused by the buildup of plaque within the walls of arteries pad occurs primarily in the legs but can be found in vessels throughout the body common pad symptoms include pain aching or cramping while walking claudication and nonhealing ulcers or sores critical limb ischemia pad is also a marker for significant cardiovascular morbidities and patients generally present with many comorbidities initial treatment for pad is through medication and lifestyle adjustments more advanced cases are treated using invasive surgical bypass or minimally invasive interventional procedures patients with critical limb ischemia cli the most advanced patients may have a combination of surgery amputation and interventional therapy although angioplasty is often considered to be the leading interventional treatment for pad recent studies have revealed that angioplasty  month patency rates are estimated to be  when angioplasty fails stent implantation can help improve patency but the underlying issues relating to the presence of calcification remain and stent placement reduces future treatment options more recently drug coated balloons have been introduced to the market designed to target the inflammatory response caused by angioplasty these have shown an improvement in the patency of standard lesions but are known to be significantly less effective in the presence of calcification peripheral artery disease and calcium as patients with pad live longer thanks to improved therapeutic options and lifestyle changes the plaque in their arteries mineralizes and becomes calcified over the last few decades the prevalence of calcified lesions has risen along with life expectancy with severe calcium being present in as many as  of patients with pad the incremental nature of improvements to devices available to treat these lesions has resulted in calcium becoming a significant obstacle to achieving successful outcomes the most common device used to treat calcified lesions is a standard balloon dilatation catheter often deployed at very high constant pressure unfortunately the physics of constant high pressures in the presence of calcium preferentially targets or damages soft tissue leading to elastic recoil dissections and frequently requires a bailout stent this has been known to occur in up to  of standard lesions and may occur even more often in calcified lesions over the last  years several technologies have been developed in an attempt to overcome these shortcomings some incremental such as scoring and cutting balloons and others more dramatic and severe such as atherectomy each of these fails to address the fundamental need effective dilation of calcified lesions while limiting vascular injury and complications such as perforations distal emboli and the need for bailout stenting lithoplasty technology solution for pad shockwave medical leveraged the power of lithoplasty® technology to develop devices for the treatment of calcified peripheral vascular lesions built on a semicompliant balloon platform each catheter incorporates multiple lithotripsy emitters activated with the touch of a button while the integrated balloon is inflated to low subnominal pressures once activated these emitters produce pulsatile mechanical waves that are inherently tissueselective passing through the balloon and soft vascular tissue preferentially disrupting the calcified plaque by creating a series of microfractures once the calcium has been disrupted the vessel can be effectively dilated using low pressures thereby enabling even historically challenging pad patients to be treated effectively and with minimal injury to the vessel in an initial peripheral clinical study of  moderate and severely calcified lesions lithoplasty technology demonstrated ease of use minimal interruption to procedure flow and an excellent safety profile treatment with lithoplasty technology resulted in a low residual stenosis of  and with only  stent implanted click here for more information the technology is inherently familiar easy to use operates with just the push of a button and works seamlessly with existing cardiovascular treatments and because it is built on a traditional balloon catheter platform it is compatible with clinicians’ existing workflow product details peripheral lithoplasty balloon dilatation catheters are available in diameters ranging from mm to mm standard balloon techniques integrated proximal and distal markers and predetermined lithoplasty technology settings ensure the catheters can be prepared delivered accurately placed and activated with minimal disruption to standard procedure flow miniaturized lithotripsy emitters apply intermittent pulsatile pressure waves along the length and diameter of the balloon activated under low pressure  atmospheres these pressure waves selectively disrupt calcified lesions after which the balloon can be dilated to reference vessel diameter diameter mm length mm guidewire compatibility in sheath compatibility working length cm    f     f     f

for blood to flow can completely bypass calcified lesions but calcium in the artery may limit proximal starting and distal landing zones angioplasty a catheter with a balloon in its tip is advanced to reach the narrowed or blocked artery the balloon is inflated widening the vessel by pushing the plaque against the artery wall cutting or scoring balloons could be used in place of standard balloons to cut into soft tissue this could be supplemented with the use of a drug coated balloon to reduce the inflammatory response of the vessel due to the injury caused by angioplasty excessive force transfers to soft tissue leads to elastic recoil poor lesion expansion and frequent dissections requiring stent placement for efficacy or bailout reasons scoring or cutting elements have limited effectiveness in calcified lesions dcb have not been shown to improve patency rates in calcified vessels stenting a stent is a tiny mesh tube that is placed inside an artery often after angioplasty to help keep the vessel open stents are designed to remain in the blood vessel indefinitely can be difficult to deliver in highly calcified lesions insufficient radial strength may lead to suboptimal luminal gain increased risk of stent fracture permanent implant limits and adds complexity to future treatment options atherectomy extracts atherosclerotic plaque through sanding or shaving of vessel tissue can be acutely effective in superficial calcium but neglects the deep calcium that impacts vessel expansion extensive soft tissue removal creates significant vessel injury and increases the risk of vessel perforation and distal embolization difficult to use interrupts procedure flow complicated and lengthy procedures requiring specialized training and a change to normal procedure flow lithoplasty balloon dilatation catheters harness the power of lithoplasty technology to disrupt calcium semicompliant balloon catheters with multiple lithotripsy emitters along the length of the balloon delivers pulsatile mechanical energy that disrupts both superficial and deep calcium pulsing occurs at subnominal pressures followed by dilatation to reference vessel diameter for important

calcified plaque in patients with pad the system consists of three components a singleuse proprietary balloon catheter a reusable generator and a reusable connector cable the balloon catheter has integrated lithotripsy emitters designed to enhance angioplasty by disrupting calcium before balloon dilation of the stenosis during a percutaneous procedure the physician delivers the catheter through the peripheral arterial system of the lower extremities to the target lesion partially inflating the balloon energizes the lithotripsy emitters which generate pulsatile mechanical energy within the balloon at the treatment site subsequent lowpressure balloon dilation of the stenosis facilitates passage of blood  purported benefitsadvantages according to manufacturer information delivers pulsatile mechanical energy that disrupts both superficial and deep calciumpulsatile mechanical energy is inherently tissueselective disrupting calcium while minimizing injury to soft tissuelowpressure dilatations avoid injury to vessel walls while maximizing luminal gainfamiliar balloonbased technology is compatible with clinicians existing workflow lithoplasty catheters have shown effective deliverability with  successful crossing of moderate and severely calcified lesions with limited need for adjunctive therapycombines the calcium disrupting power of lithotripsy with the familiarity and simplicity of a balloon in a single enabling devicelithotripsy pulses selectively target and disrupt calcium in the peripheral vasculature improving tissue flexibility note this is

medical lithoplasty system is intended for lithotripsyenhanced balloon dilatation of lesions including calcified lesions in the peripheral vasculature including the iliac femoral iliofemoral popliteal infrapopliteal and renal arteries not for use in the coronary or cerebral vasculature safety information on the company website states the followingdo not use if unable to pass  guidewire across the lesion not intended for treatment of instent restenosis or in coronary carotid or cerebrovascular arteriescurrent treatments pad most commonly caused by atherosclerosis is plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to the legs arms and pelvis over time the plaque hardens and narrows the affected artery which in turn limits the amount of oxygenrich blood circulating to the affected tissues the most commonly affected arteries are in the legs patients with pad in the legs may experience signs and symptoms that include numbness pain upon walking andor climbing stairs and an infection in the leg that is difficult to treat pad increases the risk for coronary heart disease stroke transient ischemic attack and heart attack clinicians initially manage pad by recommending lifestyle changes ie smoking cessation improved diet exercise medical therapy may include medications to lower cholesterol and blood pressure improve walking capacity control blood sugar help prevent blood clots and relieve symptoms clinicians may treat more advanced pad with a minimally invasive endovascular option eg balloon angioplasty with stent or stentgraft placement atherectomy dcbs designed to target the inflammatory response caused by angioplasty have recently emerged surgical treatments for pad include arterial bypass and endarterectomy ie plaque removal for additional information about atherosclerosis and pad see links to the documents by the centers for disease control and prevention and the national heart lung and blood institute under selected references and

adverse event rate of  at  days and  at  months procedural success was achieved in  of the study patients at  days and in  at  months three patients  required target lesion revascularizations within six months findings from the disrupt pad study suggest that the lithoplasty system is safe and may work as intended to treat pad for up to six months however additional studies are needed to confirm these findingsin the absence of controlled trials no conclusion can be reached regarding comparative effectivenessour searches of clinicaltrialsgov identified three ongoing trials of the lithoplasty
