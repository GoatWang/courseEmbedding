government executive national journal quartz and defense one reach leaders across all sectors—consumer business media and government strategically designed to meet the unique needs of this community atlantic media’s innovative portfolio of digital print event social and mobile platforms engages an influential audience of over  million worldwide each month   letter from the chairman would they know us our boston beginning on a tuesday afternoon may   magazine publisher moses phillips convened a fivehour meeting of some consequence – to us – of new england’s leading literary minds gathered at the parker house hotel were among a few others ralph waldo emerson henry wadsworth longfellow james russell lowell and oliver wendell holmes sr with their concept and phillips’ capital the group decided to launch the atlantic monthly magazine in part the men later joined by harriet beecher stowe sought a national publication for their writings against slavery more generally and in the words of the atlantic’s modernera editor cullen murphy the magazine was “an attempt to define and create a distinctly american voice to project an american stance to promote something that might be called the american idea” in the pantheon the atlantic founders are in the pantheon of great american minds of the th century and drafting a founding “declaration” they were about high purpose “in politics the atlantic monthly will be the organ of no party or clique but will honestly endeavor to be the exponent of what its conductors believe to be the american idea… it will not rank itself with any sect of anties but with that body of men which is in favor of freedom national progress and honor…” …and in the fray how much do i concede in admitting that at least my work at atlantic media feels some many rungs down life’s ladder – less pantheon more fray at its founding the atlantic monthly weighed in on the great issues of the era at the stately pace of  articles per month across our several titles – more digital than print – the atlantic citylab national journal government executive quartz defense one atlantic media now publishes  articles and posts every day at a rate of  pieces per year some are about freedom national purpose and honor httpwwwatlanticmediacomabout httpwwwatlanticmediacomabout httpwwwatlanticmediacomaboutsome less so writing high writing low writing for the moment and on occasion for all time atlantic media feels very much in the bustle of life of its  million global readers so would they know us were emerson longfellow lowell and holmes to return for a term would they recognize their mark in us would they click on our sites and mark them as favorites well there is this as in  the atlantic – and now its sister titles – writes for the single mosteducated readership in the united states and our atlantic media writers hold as close to religious faith two tenets that date to our founding  that considering issues honestly wholly on their merit we are in service of “no party or clique” and  that in our writing as in the nation’s life more broadly it is ideas that matter most so would they know us well some of us more than others likely i’d be out calling on advertisers  but we would know them and mostly proud want to walk them through our work david g bradley chairman – atlantic media read more leadership david g bradley chairman
