acquire shares in nonparty volkswagen ag vw porsche moves pursuant to cplr  a and  to dismiss the complaints in the viking and glenhill actions alternatively porsche moves pursuant to cplr a to dismiss or stay the actions in light of an appeal pending in a related federal action elliott assocs v porsche automobil holding se  f supp d  sd ny  backgroundthe plaintiffs are a group of global hedge funds who invest in a variety of companies through inter alia short sales of securitiesfn porsche a public company is a car manufacturer organized under the laws of the european union and germany and is headquartered in stuttgart germany vw is also a public company headquartered in lower saxony germany the german state of lower saxony owns approximately  of vw shares the shares of vw are traded on stock exchanges globally including in new york it sells its products under brand names including vw audi scania skoda seat bentley lamborghini and bugatti in  the german government enacted legislation the vw act to shield vw from a hostile takeover under the vw act any acquirer such as porsche needed to own  of vws shares in order to effectuate a takeover rather then the typical  threshold under german law in  the european commission determined that the vw act violated european union law because it effectively made vw shares less attractive to investors throughout europe thereby hindering the free movement of capital in  based upon its expectation that the vw act would be amended porsche decided to increase its share ownership in vw according to plaintiffs porsche secretly sought to acquire  of vws shares so that it could take control of vw however porsche purportedly believed that it would not be able to achieve this  ownership level unless it deceived the market about its intentions and holdings by september  porsche had secretly acquired  interest in vw by the end of  porsche was vws largest shareholder owning approximately  of its shares by october  porsches position in vw shares grew to  throughout  porsche issued several press releases and made direct statements to plaintiffs in telephone conversations and emails concerning its intentions regarding its ownership interest in vw for instance on march   porsche announced its intention to acquire more than a  interest in vw with the caveat that it did not seek a controlling stake in vw and only sought a simple majority on march   porsche purportedly denied any plans to increase its holdings in vw to  noting that lower saxonys  ownership of vw made it very unlikely that porsche could ever accumulate such a significant percentage of vw shares between march and october  porsche continued to make public statements reaffirming its march  declaration that its authority and intention was to hold only a simple majority of vw and that any intention of its achieving  ownership was mere speculation in reliance upon porsches representations that it did not intend to attempt a takeover of vw and thus believing that the share price of vw would decline plaintiffs decided to short vws stock plaintiffs became concerned when vws stock price began to increase unexpectedly and significantly although porsche never corrected or changed its policy declared publicly on march   concerning its intentions vis a vis vw plaintiffs sought to speak directly to the head of investor relations at porsche frank gaube the viking plaintiffs lead analyst andrew immerman scheduled a call with gaube which took place on august   and lasted  minutes immerman aff ¶ fn immerman took contemporaneous notes which indicated that gaube reaffirmed porsches march  statement and that it was unrealistic for porsche to acquire a controlling stake in vw and that in any event the state of lower saxony would never sell its shares the glenhill plaintiffs additionally allege that its new yorkbased analysts engaged gaube in at least six separate telephone calls during which he verified that porsche did not intend to seek a controlling stake in vw throughout september porsche continued to make public statements that it did not intend to seek a  stake in vw however on october   porsche made an announcement that shocked the markets in a press release titled porsche heads for domination agreement which porsche emailed directly to plaintiffs it disclosed that it had already accumulated a total of  of vw shares the press release stated in part due to the dramatic distortions on the financial markets porsche  has decided over the weekend to disclose its holdings in shares and hedging positions related to the takeover of vw at the end of last week porsche  held  percent of vw ordinary shares and in addition  percent in so called cash settled options relating to vw ordinary shares to hedge against price risks representing a total of  percent upon settlement of these options porsche will receive in cash the difference between the then actual vw share price and the underlying strike price in cash the volkswagen shares will be bought in each case at market price assuming the economic framework conditions are suitable the aim is to increase to  percent in  paving the way to a domination agreement the intention to increase the volkswagen stake to above  percent in novemberdecember  remains unchanged emphasis added october   press release according to plaintiffs porsches misrepresentations that it did not intend to seek a controlling stake in vw had an effect on the price at which they entered into short positions in vw shares by hiding the true extent of its control over vw shares and its intention to acquire additional shares up until the october   announcement porsche led plaintiffs to believe that the natural interplay of supply and demand had been determining the prices of vw shares in fact the supply and demand for vws shares had been skewed by porsches fraud following the october   press release the price of vw spiked so high that vw briefly became the most valuable corporation in the world by stock market value as a result of the short squeeze prices prevailing in the market plaintiffs allege that the price reaction following porsches announcement demonstrates that the market was unaware of porsches true intention and actual holdings in order to cover its short positions plaintiffs had to pay markedly more for vw shares suffering more than a billion dollars in losses while porsche achieved massive profits on its trading in vw procedural historyin  thirtyfive global hedge funds including the plaintiffs commenced an action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against porsche and two of its executive officers the complaint in the federal action alleged violations of § b of the securities exchange act and common law fraud noting that the issuer of the reference securities and the perpetrator of the alleged fraud were both located in germany the court granted porsches motion to dismiss the § b claim on the grounds that the subject transactions securitiesbased swap agreements constituted a foreign securities exchange and thus were not within the purview of the securities and exchange act elliot assocs v porsche  f supp d   sd ny  having dismissed the federal claims the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the common law fraud claim id the plaintiffs appeals are pending before the second circuit meanwhile germanys federal financial supervisory authority and the stuttgart public prosecutor began investigating whether porsche had manipulated the german markets by failing to disclose information relating to its holdings in vw shares private investors have also commenced actions in germany alleging market manipulation and fraud by porsche plaintiffs commenced these actions in march  alleging claims for fraud and unjust enrichment porsche now seeks to dismiss the complaints in the viking and glenhill actions under the doctrine of forum non conveniens and for failure to state a claim the motions to dismiss were converted into summary judgment and the parties permitted to conduct limited discovery solely on the issue of reasonable reliance discussioni forum non conveniens the common law doctrine of forum non conveniens codified in cplr  permits a court to dismiss an action if it would more appropriately be heard in another forum whether to dismiss in favor of another forum is left to the sound discretion of the court shinetsu chemical co ltd v  icici bank  add   st dept  although no one factor is controlling courts should balance factors including the factual nexus between new york and the action the burden on new york courts the potential hardship to the defendant of litigating here the availability of an alternative forum in which the plaintiff may bring suit and the residency of the parties kinder morgan energy partners lp v ace american  add  st dept  lv denied  nyd   kuwaiti engineering group v consortium of intl consultants llc  add   st dept  in addition private and public interest considerations must be factored including the forums interest in litigating the controversy and the need if any to apply foreign law fox v fusco  add   st dept  shinetsu chemical co ltd  add at  ultimately the plaintiffs choice of forum is afforded great weight and should not be disturbed unless the balance strongly favors the jurisdiction in which the defendant seeks to litigate the claims anagnostou v stifel  add  st dept  a balancing of the relevant factors reveals that porsche has not met the heavy burden of demonstrating that this action should be dismissed on the ground of forum non conveniens first plaintiffs establish a factual nexus between this action and new york plaintiffs are an international collection of hedge funds whose principal places of business are in new york at issue in this action are the multiple representations that porsche purportedly made directly to plaintiffs in new york for instance plaintiffs allege that porsches head of investor relations gaube participated in at least ten telephone conversations with plaintiffs in new york during which he misrepresented porsches intent to acquire vw stock and the extent of its current holdings immerman aff ¶¶   at the time plaintiffs analysts who spoke with gaube identified themselves as representing hedge funds based in new york in an effort to arrange the calls gaube and his assistant exchanged numerous emails with plaintiffs in addition porsche representatives transmitted by email press releases and newspaper articles with porsche itself providing plaintiffs with the english translations of the documents plaintiffs allege that they evaluated all of porsches public statements and oral communications sent or made directly in new york in their new york headquarters conducted their due diligence and made their investment decisions in new york as for the location of potential witnesses all five of the critical witnesses that plaintiffs identify from their side either reside or have offices in new york plaintiffs due diligence documents pertinent to porsches defense on the claim for fraud are located in new york although the critical witnesses that it identifies all reside in germany large corporations such as porsche with ample resources have minimal difficulty bringing foreign witnesses or documents to new york courts mionis v bank julis naer  co  add   st dept  intertec contr v turner steiner intl  add   st dept  further porsche and its whollyowned affiliates regularly transact business in new york and in general have extensive operations in the united states with sales in excess of  billion employ over two hundred people here and provide vehicles parts services marketing and training for more than  dealers compare ifs intl inc v slm software inc  add  d dept  porsche has also not established that litigating this action here would burden new york courts although the choiceoflaw issue in this action has not yet been adjudicated even if it were concluded that german law applies this would not be an inconvenience attributable to the forum see mionius  add at  yoshida printing co v aiba  add   st dept  the commercial division of this county is fully capable and frequently called upon to apply another countrys laws finally the court rejects porsches characterization of the issues in this action as the manipulation of the german stock market and the trade of german securities at the core of plaintiffs claims are whether new york courts may hold responsible a foreign entity who conducts business globally for fraudulent misrepresentations purportedly aimed at new york plaintiffs new york clearly has a vested interest in such an action the issue of market manipulation is of interest but not dispositive of the fraud claims therefore the branch of the motions that seek to dismiss the complaints on the grounds of forum non conveniens is denied ii fraud porsche moves to dismiss the claim for fraud on the grounds that its statements were clearly not predictive in nature which cannot form the basis of an actionable fraud claimfn in addition porsche argues that plaintiffs are highly sophisticated investors who should have recognized that porsche might seek a  stake in vw if circumstances allowed and knowingly assumed the risk of the potential for unlimited loss associated with short selling and thus their reliance on its statements was unreasonable as a matter of law plaintiffs claims are premised on allegations that between march and october  porsche made in public announcements and on at least ten separate occasions during telephone conversations material misrepresentations that it was not seeking to raise its stake in vw above a simple majority porsches statements concerning its present intent as to the amount of vw shares that it was attempting to acquire were intentionally false because it allegedly decided to take over vw at least as early as february  and as early as mid had already achieved control of  of vw shares through outright positions and call options despite its denials as part of its plan to hide the extent to which it was already controlling vw shares porsche allegedly engaged in a series of manipulative derivatives trades according to the complaints porsche knew that as a practical matter it was impossible to acquire  of vw stock fn in the open market without short sellers such as plaintiffs who could increase the supply of vw shares by borrowing shares to sell accordingly porsche sought to target short sellers in the market in order to induce them through its public and private representations to borrow vw shares and short them porsche then purchased call options while the counterparties to those options agreements bought the shares that plaintiffs were selling short to hedge porsches call options porsche purportedly disguised these options as cashsettled options that did not have the same disclosure requirementsfn as soon as porsche disclosed that it was headed for a domination agreement with vw in its october   press release the price of vw shot upwards and while porsche made massive profits plaintiffs lost close to a billion dollars covering short positions at artificially inflated prices the elements of a fraud claim are a false representation concerning a material fact scienter reasonable reliance and damages mcghee v odell  add  st dept  at the outset the court is persuaded that plaintiffs sufficiently allege an actionable misrepresentation of material fact plaintiffs allege that between march and october  porsche knowingly made false statements regarding its present intent to obtain a controlling stake in vw and the extent of its current holdings on repeated occasions and directly to plaintiffs a statement of ones present intention is a statement of a material existing fact sufficient to support a fraud claim see channel master corp v aluminum ltd sales inc  nyd   furthermore the court rejects the contention that plaintiffs reliance on porsches statements was unreasonable as a matter of law in assessing the reasonableness of a plaintiffs alleged reliance courts should consider the entire context of the transaction including the sophistication of the parties the information available at the time of the operative decision and the plaintiffs ability to discover the truth with due diligence emergent capital inv mgt llc v stonepath group inc  f d   d cir  jp morgan chase bank v winnick  f supp d   sd ny  global mins  metals corp v holme  add   st dept  sophisticated business entities are indeed held to a higher standard where a sophisticated plaintiff enjoys access to critical information but fails to take advantage of that access new york courts are particularly disinclined to entertain claims for fraud dragon inv co ii llc v shanahan  add   st dept  ust private equity investors fund inc v salomon smith barney  add   st dept  on the other hand where the facts allegedly misrepresented were within the exclusive knowledge of the defendant or where one partys superior knowledge of essential facts renders the transaction without disclosure inherently unfair a sophisticated plaintiffs reliance on the defendants representations is not unreasonable as a matter of law ddj mgt llc v rhone group llc  nyd   pt bank central asia v abn amro bank nv  add  st dept  harbinger capital partners master fund i ltd v wachovia capital markets llc  misc d a sup ct ny county  appeal withdrawn  add  st dept  nonetheless the question of what constitutes reasonable reliance is factintensive ddj mgt  nyd at  for this reason it is an element that is not generally subject to summary disposition unless reasonable reliance is so conspicuously absent see ventur group llc v finnerty  add   st dept  global mins  metals corp v holme  add at  here plaintiffs allege that there was no public information or other available information to them that would have allowed them to ascertain the truth all of porsches public statements and representations made directly to plaintiffs in telephone conversations consistently stated that porsche would not seek to raise its stake in vw to  while porsche was concealing that it already controlled significantly more than a simple majority of vw shares by the amount of options it possessed as alleged in the complaint only porsche knew of its actual vw holdings and its present intent to expand its holdings to achieve a controlling stake in response to inquiries as to whether it intended to increase its stake in vw to a controlling one porsche quickly and repeatedly dismissed such speculation as the mind games of analysts and investors sundheim aff ¶  plaintiffs also allege that they carefully reviewed all available information and spoke with reliable sources of information they submit affidavits testifying to the extensive due diligence that they performed in an effort to accurately evaluate the risks associated with the potential investment plaintiffs testify that they scrutinized porsches and vws public statements press releases and financial statements consulted with independent experts in accounting to review its financial disclosures and with germanlicensed counsel to analyze german corporate law as it related to the vw law and conducted extensive market analysis see immerman sundheim chandra einhorn fergang goodman robbins affidavits plaintiffs also submit the affidavit of a due diligence expert who states that he is prepared to testify that a reasonable sophisticated investor would infer from porsches public and private statements that it sought only a slight simple majority of vw shares and not a controlling stake zask affidavit significantly plaintiffs sought to verify porsches public statements by making direct inquiries to porsche itself seven of plaintiffs analysts spoke separately and directly with porsches head of investor relations gaube concerning its plans with respect to vw when plaintiffs analysts asked gaube if he could verify porsches public statements that it did not intend to acquire a controlling stake in vw gaube confirmed this while repeating porsches false plans consequently this is not a situation where the plaintiffs failed to make use of the means of verification that were available to it compare hsh nordbank ag v ubs ag  add  st dept  ust private equity investors fund inc  add at  ventur group llc  add at  dragon inv co ii llc  add at  zanett lombardier ltd v maslow  add   st dept  valassis communications inc v weimer  add   st dept  appeal denied  nyd   finally plaintiffs sufficiently allege that porsches misrepresentations were material to their decision to take shortterm positions in vw shares according to the complaints only after porsche confirmed its intent not to take over a controlling stake in vw and conducting its own due diligence did plaintiffs conclude that there was no reason for vws stock to move up premised upon allegations that porsche gave oral confirmation of misleading factual information coupled with the extensive efforts purportedly taken to verify that information the court is persuaded that plaintiffs sufficiently state the element of reasonable reliance in order to survive the pleading stage ultimately the determination of whether plaintiffs had a right to rely on porsches public and private statements as to its intent to acquire vw is an issue of fact which must be explored in discovery ii unjust enrichment porsche moves to dismiss the claim for unjust enrichment on the ground that the alleged connection between porsches enrichment and plaintiffs loss is too attenuated to state a claim a plaintiff claiming unjust enrichment must show that the other party was enriched at plaintiffs expense and that it is against equity and good conscience to permit the other party to retain what is sought to be recovered georgia malone  co v ralph rieder  add  st dept  affirmed nyd  wl   although privity is not required a claim will not be supported unless there is a connection or relationship between the parties that could have caused reliance or inducement on the plaintiffs part id plaintiffs sufficiently state a claim for unjust enrichment premised upon allegations that porsche induced plaintiffs to borrow vw shares and short them thereby undertaking an obligation to repurchase them and return them at a future date by misrepresenting its intent to acquire a controlling stake in vw porsche purportedly targeted its scheme at plaintiffs as short sellers because it could not obtain the percentage of vw shares it needed to achieve domination in a series of telephone calls to plaintiffs representatives porsche purportedly lied about its true intent and the extent of its vw holdings once porsche revealed its true intent and that it had already acquired  of vws shares it triggered a short squeeze in the market and permitted porsche to make massive profits at the expense of plaintiffs who lost tremendous amounts of money covering their short positions at artificially high prices see cox v microsoft corp  add   st dept  finally the branch of motions that seeks alternatively to stay the actions on other grounds is also denied although there are undoubtedly overlapping facts between this action and the federal action pending appeal to the second circuit the causes of action and judgment sought are distinct  associates llc v palmer  add   st dept

prevailing market price and returning the borrowed shares to the broker or  entering into securitybased swap agreements which are privately negotiated contracts that provide for the exchange of payments based on the value of the securities and the transfer of the financial risks associated with changes in the value of the securities without the conveyance of any ownership interest footnote  immerman testifies that he emailed porsches investor relations department indicating that he was from a money management firm based in new york  doing some research on porsche immerman aff ¶  immerman provided vikings midtown office address and its new york telephone number after several email exchanges immerman was able to speak with gaube directly footnote  in support of this argument porsche points to an interview with its ceo wherein he stated we do not want to rule out this possibility of acquiring a  share in vw at the end of the day some point in the future but for the moment domination remains a theoretical possibility footnote  at the time more than  of vw shares were controlled by shareholders who would not or effectively could not sell their shares to porsche the state of lower saxony controlled  of vw shares and other investors including index funds owned approximately  of vw shares footnote  plaintiffs allege that porsches options were not actually cash settled options which is demonstrated by the words porsche chose when it finally revealed the truth to the market of its intent and holdings on october   at the time porsche admitted that its options actually reflected part of its  stake and minimized the cashsettled nature of the contracts by calling them so called cashsettled options according to plaintiffs porsche used the options in order to acquire control over vw shares not as a means to benefit in cash from a rise in the price of vw shares but as a means to convert these options into actual share ownership which it was otherwise obligated to
