growth share download pdf robert pepper john garrity connie lasalle cisco systemsforty years ago the queen of england became one of the first individuals and the first head of state to transmit realtime electronic data over national borders in  just three years after the united states connected arpanet to londonâs university college and the royal radar establishment in norway her majesty queen elizabeth ii sent an email under the username âhmeâ today over  billion people across the world have access to and use the internet and the flow of digital communication between countries companies and citizens as a component of the âknowledge economyâ has been recognized for years as a critical driver of economic growth and productivity countries adept at fostering digital activity have witnessed the emergence of new industries as well as the accelerated development of traditional sectors however despite the intensive and extensive growth of the global internet concerns over growing barriers to digital flows are mountingthis chapter explores the impact of the free flow of data across national borders on innovation and growth first reviewed is the literature on the impact of crossborder data flows on countries companies and individuals the chapter then presents an original analysis of the growth of new services built on the free flow of trade through global digitization and concludes by discussing policy guidelines that mitigate national concerns over data transmission while simultaneously maximizing the benefits of crossborder data flowsthe growth of global digital industries and their national economic impactsthe development of the commercial internet has occurred concurrently with a massive expansion of the global economy which has experienced fold growth in nominal termsâfrom us trillion to us trillion since  internet protocol ip traffic continues to advance rapidly with  traffic projected to be  times its  volume global internet bandwidth accounts for much of this growth more than quadrupling between   terabytes per second and   terabytes per second more importantly total crossborder internet traffic increased fold from  to this cumulative growth impacts all facets of national economies not just their budding technology sectorsâin fact an estimated  percent of the internetâs benefit is captured by companies in traditional industries a wide range of positive economic impacts stems from the flow of digital data across borders for example  percent us billion of total us service exports were digitally delivered in  and  percent of total us imports were digitally deliveredin absolute terms the amount of digitally delivered exports and imports is even larger in the european union which digitally delivered us billion in exports in  and spent us billion on imports digital trade is credited with an estimated increase in us gross domestic product gdp of  percent to  percent in  and with the creation of up to  million jobs according to the united states international trade commission us itcthe united nations conference on trade and development unctad also estimates that about  percent of all traded services is enabled by innovation stemming from the technology sector which includes the facilitation of crossborder data flowsaccording to a newly released report by mckinsey  company data flows account for us trillion of global gdp in  and âcrossborder data flows now generate more economic value than traditional flows of traded goodsâbeyond this economic impact the free flow of data is itself a significant driver of innovation it allows the sharing of ideas and information and the dissemination of knowledge as well as collaboration and crosspollination among individuals and companies internetenabled innovation requires an environment that encourages individuals to experiment with new uses of the internet in places with severe restrictions that inhibit digital collaboration people are less likely to experiment and as a result innovation is less likely to emerge countries with an open internet tend to be more innovative as demonstrated in figureÂ  which illustrates the relationship between a countryâs ability to share information and its capacity for innovation the figure demonstrates that countries with a higher capacity to share data internationally as reflected by a high international internet bandwidth capacity per capita tend to have a greater degree of national innovation as well quantified in the figure by each countryâs score on the  global innovation index a leading measure of innovation capacity at the country level which is calculated according to  different indicators additionally a high degree of correlation is observed between various measures of potential data flow at the country level and outcome measures one measure of potential data flow is freedom houseâs  freedom on the net indicator which measures  countries on the basis of obstacles to internet access limits on content and violations of user rights when correlated with the economic impacts pillar of the  networked readiness indexâs impact subindex tableÂ  which serves as an outcome measure a clear relationship is demonstrated the impact of crossborder data flows firms and the engine of economic activitycrossborder data flows acutely impact the ability of firms to conduct business internationallyin a recent report business roundtable identifies at least six different areas of activity whereby firms may transmit data across national borders to support business operations these include interconnected machinery big data analytics backoffice consolidation supplychain automation digital collaboration and cloud scalability see boxÂ box  firmsâ uses of crossborder data flowsin a  report business roundtableâan industry group representing companies with  trillion in annual revenues and  million employeesâidentified the following six mechanisms by which crossborder data flows drive business benefits to firmsinterconnected machinery companies improve processes and optimize efficiency by interconnecting elements of the production chain such as realtime monitoring of capital equipment to reduce downtime or to be able to prepare for immediate service replacementsbig data analytics companies collect data gathered from various or all aspects of their operations across regions and apply advanced statistical analysis to be able to make better decisions both for the business and for customer satisfactionbackoffice consolidation companies centralize standard business operations to take advantage of economies of scale eg human resources accounting payroll support call centers marketing etc by improving buying power and eliminating overlapsupplychain automation companies track inventory levels process reordering automatically and match supply and demanddigital collaboration companies increase communication and collaboration between teamscloud scalability companies lower capital expenditure and cost structure of information technology it hardware infrastructure software and applications all provided as a service and they reduce capital investment in idle capacity thus lowering the total cost of ownership and increasing business agility and resilience to failuressource business roundtable Â crossborder flows data and voice in particular reduce costs related to both trade and transactions this includes customer engagement finding and fulfilling orders as well as other operational costs associated with doing business one recent report by the us itc estimates that the internet reduces trade costs by  percent on averageadditionally small and mediumsized enterprises that utilize the internet to trade on global platforms have a survival rate of  percent which is  percent higher than that of offline businesses furthermore those small and mediumsized firms that are online are almost as likely to export as large businessesat the firm level a multitude of specific examples illustrate how the ability to transmit data internationally improves firm operations and performance for example unilever the consumer goods company with over  employees and operations across  countries has developed a global enterprise data warehouse wherein it collects information from all of its operations to deliver full visibility into the entire system the primary objective of this effort was to compile a comprehensive consumer database enabling analysis at the most granular level possible additionally aggregating information on the firmâs operations helps identify areas where lowering costs and improving business performance can drive more affordable products for consumerssimilarly rio tinto the mining company with operations in over  countries across six continents collects realtime data from its trucks and drills which are then transmitted to its processing excellence center pec in brisbane australia active monitoring and realtime adjustment of rio tintoâs operations have already driven significant savings from operational efficiencies with more savings certain to follow on the heels of new and emerging process innovationat cisco the ability to transfer data across borders optimizes the companyâs operations for example the research triangle park facility in raleigh north carolina ciscoâs largest technical assistance center which has more than  employees provides aroundtheclock tech support to customers  hours a day  days a week anywhere in the world when customers and cisco employees confront challenging hardware or software problems technical experts are able to log in remotely run diagnostic tools and exchange data to and from one another seamlessly this type of business activity fundamentally relies upon the free flow of dataas the appendix to this chapter further illustrates firms around the world innovate and optimize business outcomes by transferring data across borders moreover when trade flows between businesses are curtailed innovation may decelerate through the interruption of technology transfer or through the reduction of competitiondriven development which is why the uninhibited exchange of data is increasingly critical to productivity and growththe impact of crossborder data flows individuals and entrepreneursat the individual level the ability to access cloudbased information provides significant benefit individuals are increasingly storing more of their personal information online ciscoâs global cloud index estimates that by   billion internet users or  percent of all consumer internet users will use personal cloud storage up from  billion users in  globally consumer cloud storage traffic per user will be  gigabytes per month by  compared to  megabytes per month in  cloudbased services may be hosted in the domestic market or in other countriesnew entrepreneurs also benefit from access to infrastructure platforms and software from cloudbased services which may reside in other countries these include applications data middleware operating systems virtualization servers storage and networking capabilities or equipment because of the ability to access these services on a payasyougo model rather than committing to a large initial capital investment the financial barriers to new business entry have fallen significantly by one estimate the cost for an entrepreneur to establish a business with a working prototype has fallen from around us million in the s down to less than us and approximately six weeks of workfurthermore depending on the business model in some cases startup costsâwhen supported by the affordability of cloudbased infrastructureâcan be as low as usthe free flow of data and the digital economy value at stakeciscoâs data analysis demonstrates that the free flow of data enables people and things to connect which can improve processes and add tremendous value to any given economy the potential bottomline value at stake defined as the combination of increased revenues and lower costs that is created or will migrate among companies and industries as a result of increasing the adoption of internet technologies is estimated to be us trillion over the â periodthis includes up to us trillion in the private sector where up to onethird of corporate profits may be at stake and where telecommunications service providers have an opportunity to capture us trillion in new economic value up to us trillion may be generated in the public sector as well these improvements to the overall digital economy represent a potential annual gdp upside of  percent and potential employment creation of  million jobs worldwidefigureÂ  highlights the relationship between the value at stake that can be generated by the digital economy and the freedom on the net score the figure suggests that countries with higher freedom on the net scores are better poised to benefit from potential value at stake from digitization in other words those countries and companies that have not positioned themselves in an environment that fosters open internet practices may find innovation and economic growth hampered risks related to cybersecurity also slow innovation as demonstrated by new cisco survey research wherein senior executives have determined that cybersecurity concerns have forced their companies to drop some missioncritical projects specifically  percent of the  executives surveyed state that their organization has âhalted a missioncritical initiative due to cybersecurity concernsâ in ciscoâs survey  percent of all respondents somewhat or strongly agree that cybersecurity threatsâboth potential and actualâhinder innovation furthermore  percent somewhat or strongly agree that cybersecurity risk dampens smart and connected product development a critical element on the path to digitizationrestrictions on crossborder data flowsthe internet was architected with protocols to identify the fastest possible route to transmit packets of data between any two points however increasing concerns of national governments around privacy security and local competition have resulted in some policy and regulatory impediments difficulties arise when overly restrictive regulations on crossborder data flows create trade barriers and impact business models overly burdensome regulations can slow or prevent business transactions which increases costs and obstructs the delivery of products to the market examples of these restrictions as noted by business roundtable are included in tableÂ  the number and impact of restrictions that are implemented around the world appear to be increasing the us itc identifies localization requirements as a barrier for  percent of large firms and  percent of small and mediumsized enterprises in the digital communications sector localization mandates are the most frequently identified digital trade barrierthese restrictions impose significant business costs the burden of compliance related to both cost and logistics can slow or stop business activity and limit innovation for example one analysis estimates that disruptions to crossborder data flows and services trade could result in a negative impact on the european union of up to  percent of gdp as well as a potential drop in eu manufacturing exports to the united states of up to  percentin seven different countries and regions of the world studied in one analysis data localization requirements would also result in lower gdp conversely efforts to decrease barriers to crossborder data traffic have been shown to drive growth and based on  estimates the removal of obstacles to the flow of data could increase gdp by  percent to  percent in the united statesthe path forward balancing growth data flows and national concernsas demonstrated above the benefits of crossborder data flows are significant additional empirical work needs to be done however and there are still cases where national concerns over privacy security and local economic activity may prompt regulations to curb some flows in those instances we propose the following guidelines see boxÂ  for examplesminimize fragmentation by ensuring that any policy actions are leasttraderestrictive to achieve legitimate public policy objectivescarefully craft regulations that are as narrow in scope as possible with clearly articulated goalscoordinate globally to minimize conflicts in regulations between different jurisdictionsevaluate the full costs of any proposed regulation and ensure that costs of compliance do not outweigh the quantifiable benefitsadhere to trade obligationsbox  country examples singapore and the netherlandssteps taken in several economies embody the spirit of the proposed guidelines illustrating the feasibility of their implementation across national boundaries for example the government of singapore has promoted data centers in an effort to attract their establishment by private or third party entities within its bordersÂ additionally singaporeâs personal data protection commission pdpc has actively engaged industry in the development of good practices in data management including those that regard the transfer of data furthermore guidelines for industry compliance with the personal data protection act  developed by the pdpc have been narrow in scope and organized by sector and developed in consultation with industrywhile singapore has enhanced its presence as a global leader in digital transfer by emerging as a major hub for finance and services the netherlands has done so by serving as a major port for traded goods as well as a hub for european data traffic despite taking different routes to become more connected both economies have recognized the importance of digital flows including those both internally and externally facing supporting this notion in the march  report on digital globalization the mckinsey global institute mgi finds that global flows of goods foreign direct investment people and data contribute structurally to economic growth by increasing productivity assessing mgiâs two most highly ranked economies in country connectedness singapore st and the netherlands nd both also rank in the top  for data flow underscoring the crucial significance of open borders for data transfer and subsequently global competitiveness and innovationÂ in sum any limitations on crossborder data flows should address specific concreteânot merely theoreticalâproblems be least intrusive be minimally restrictive and if possible be timebound in cases where marketdriven forces justify fragmentation because of businessenhancing reasons such as when intellectual property may be affected segmentation should be driven by the market rather than by government requirementsthese actions would minimize any collateral damage done to the economy imposing restrictions and they would ensure that the internet continues to serve as a driver of innovation economic growth and social developmentreferencesaustin s and m olarreaga  enabling traders to enter and grow on the global stage an ebay report brussels
