effective it actually was declared effective by the sec after the markets closed on wednesday night so today’s higher volume is likely at least some of those shares finding new homes and the steady

mattersight to “revamp” its business model venturebeat is this afternoon reporting the following — in a rather breathless tone from vp andrew traba and as a sidenote — to my eye that’s another new name in the mattersight roster of seemingly endless vps of… whatever …as people begin to think about how they feel about ads on intelligent assistants voice analytics company mattersight is planning to use unique voice signatures to deliver personalized advertisements and bots using artificial intelligence to recognize your personality within  seconds mattersight wants to deliver personalized ads and bots to amazon echo google home and other voicecontrolled devices… “we know how words or language correlate with personality styles we ultimately think of ourselves fitting into that landscape as we’re going to train bots how to be empathetic” said mattersight vp of data science andrew traba mattersight assigns personality profiles to the people who call major brands and it wants to bring that same service to intelligent assistants using voice biometrics as an identifier instead of phone numbers… as i’ve long intoned i very sincerely doubt that google or amazon need matr’s algorithms despite the showy business method patents — in order to do this on their own but whatever most of this junk is public domain s nasa tech and well — i guess this indicates that once again ceo conway cannot find a path to profitability on the current business model that has been the main business model “only” since  prior to that the model from  to  failed and was largely sold back to the old parent under the prior eloyalty name prior to that the pure call center model never delivered a profitable quarter in what was over a decade so here we sit — coming into mid… mattersight went public in  and still it has no idea what it will be if it can ever… grow up ugh oh… and… yes — this is the quarterly “shiny object“ always used to deflect another quarter of gaap losses per share as q  is closed out this afternoon at  pm cdt more — over the weekend i’m off for some outdoor fun   we said we’d let you know… …when we felt it likely that craighallum was ending its role in stabilizing the market for mattersight’s common stock on the nasdaq otc post the private placement of february   in view of the smallish volumes over the last few days and generally flat to declining nasdaq prices we think the market stabilization effort has gone into hibernation said another way many of the holders who are friendly to mattersight and were looking to change or rearrange their positions as a result of or in response to the highly dilutive   million private placement — have likely now done so it is my expectation that if there are short sellers out there with open option or direct short positions we will see them emerge in the coming days and weeks next big event the proxy filing with the sec’s edgar window which will list any related party transactions in excess of  and the full orgy of
