the minerals will be more readily dissolved oxide ore is generally processed using a heap leach method   “placer” means alluvial deposit containing particles or larger pieces of gold or other minerals   “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade andor quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves but the sites for inspection sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven measured reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation   “proven reserves” means reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are wellestablished   “quartz” is one of the most common of all rockforming minerals and one of the most important constituents of the earth’s crust quartz may be transparent translucent or opaque it may be colorless or colored   “recovery” means that portion of the metal contained in the ore that is successfully extracted by processing can also be expressed as a percentage              “reserves” or “ore reserves” mean that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination   “stripping ratio” or “strip ratio” means the ratio of waste tons to ore tons mined   “sulfide” means a compound of sulfur and a metallic element generally processed using milling methods   “tailings” means refuse materials resulting from the washing concentration or treatment of ore   “ton” means a short ton  pounds   “vein” is a deposit of nonsedimentary origin which may or may not contain valuable minerals lode   “waste” means rock or other material lacking sufficient grade andor other characteristics to be economically processed or stockpiled as ore and which is often necessary to access an ore deposit   high desert holding corp   high desert holding corp is a mineral exploration company our primary focus is identifying mining properties and mining equipment primarily located within the western united states that may be economically feasible for commercial development we have not limited our property identification and subsequent exploration activities to those containing only precious metals as we have determined that nonprecious metal markets may provide more nearterm benefits to our company and its shareholders in the nearterm we are seeking to acquire or obtain rights to acquire properties that possess potentially commercially viable nonprecious andor precious mineral resources throughout the western united states   corporate history   high desert holding corp “we” “us” “our” the “company” or the “registrant” was incorporated in the state of nevada on august   since inception we have focused our activities on researching and identifying potential mineral properties primarily in nevada california idaho and arizona that may be economically feasible for commercial development we believe there are many undervalued property opportunities in this region of the united states and we have acquired and seek to acquire or obtain rights to further explore and develop these properties   management   mark a kersey who serves as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has extensive business development experience particularly within mining exploration development and operations   our business   we are a precious and nonprecious mineral exploration company we have informally established contacts with individuals and other entities to identify potentially viable resources while we currently do not have any binding letters of intent or obligations we may seek to partner or enter into other business combinations with other individuals or entities   our initial efforts are focused on identifying both public and privately held land that have historically demonstrated commercially viable resources   market opportunity   we believe that there is a significant opportunity within the precious and nonprecious mineral exploration and development industry while other companies may have significantly more resources and currently identified viable resources we believe the continued global demand for mining based commodities and market prices for both precious and nonprecious minerals allows us to identify obtain and potentially develop commercially viable resources in this regard we may seek partner with or acquire other companies to achieve our development goals   our key competitive strengths   we believe that the following competitive strengths enable us to compete effectively and to capitalize on the growth of the market that includes our products   · commodity prices for both precious and nonprecious minerals remain strong with no material signs of global demand deterioration · we have informal relationships with industry experts with significant experience in identifying and preliminarily exploring properties within the united states · we have not entered into material obligations to make expenditures on properties that may not contain commercially viable resources · we believe we have access to capital markets not readily available to other entities within our industry however we have not entered into any formal arrangements to obtain the capital necessary to develop any mineral properties            our growth strategy   we are committed to the identification exploration and development of commercially viable precious and nonprecious mineral properties we are not seeking shortterm returns rather we are focused on longterm development and production opportunities expected to be achieved through joint ventures or other business combination activities although we have not entered into any such arrangements   principal executive offices   our headquarters is located in incline village nevada where we maintain our corporate and administrative offices on a shortterm lease basis  our telephone number is    we maintain a website at wwwhighdesertholdingcorpcom  which contains information about our

in our common stock is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk investors should carefully consider the risk factors and other uncertainties described in this prospectus before purchasing our common stock see “risk factors” beginning on page                       risk factors   an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to other information in this prospectus including the financial statements and the related notes thereto the risks and uncertainties described below are those that are currently deemed to be material and specific to our company and industry if any of these risks actually occur our business may be adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment   risks associated with our business   there may be conflicts of interest between our management and the nonmanagement stockholders of the company   conflicts of interest create the risk that management may have an incentive to act adversely to the interests of the stockholders of the company a conflict of interest may arise between our managements personal pecuniary interest and its fiduciary duty to our stockholders   our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern   based on our financial history since inception our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern we are an exploration stage company that has not generated any revenue specifically the company is proceeding with its business plan to identify and acquire exploratory nonprecious or precious mineral properties in the western united states the company has taken certain steps in furtherance of this business plan including soliciting geological consultants with significant exploration experience throughout the western united states and north america if we cannot obtain sufficient funding we may have to delay the implementation of our business strategy   we have limited operating history and face many of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by exploration stage companies   we are an exploration stage company and to date our efforts have been focused primarily on the development of our professional staff to identify and acquire mineral properties that or potentially economically viable we have limited operating history for investors to evaluate the potential of our business development we have just recently acquired properties and are in the early stages of our exploratory activities in addition we also face many of the risks and difficulties inherent in mineral exploration   we have no proven or probable reserves on our leased mineral properties and we do not know if our properties contain any gold or other minerals that can be mined at a profit   the leased properties on which we have the right to explore for gold and other minerals may not contain mineral reserves and we do not know if any deposits of gold or other minerals can be mined at a profit whether a gold or other mineral deposit can be mined at a profit depends upon many factors some but not all of these factors include the particular attributes of the deposit such as size grade and proximity to infrastructure operating costs and capital expenditures required to start mining a deposit the availability and cost of financing the price of the gold or other minerals which is highly volatile and cyclical and government regulations including regulations relating to prices taxes royalties land use importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection   we are an exploration stage company and have only recently commenced exploration activities on our claims we reported net losses for all periods since our inception in  through march   and expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future   our evaluation of our kibby flats and qr properties is primarily based on recent minimal geological data from samples taken in  or prior our plans for further exploration activities at the property and other claims are in their early stages and preliminary accordingly we are not yet in a position to estimate expected amounts of minerals yields or values or evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful we have not earned any revenues from any operations the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the exploration of the mineral properties and potential commencement of mining activities based on the conclusions reached from our exploration activities these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to exploration costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates and the requirement for external funding to continue our business prior to completion of our exploration stage we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues we expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future   we expect to require additional external financing to fund ongoing exploration for at least the next twelve months if we are unable to raise external funding and eventually generate significant revenues from our claims and properties we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations we have no production history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and it is uncertain that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely fail   exploring for gold and other minerals is inherently speculative involves substantial expenditures and is frequently nonproductive   mineral exploration currently our only business and gold exploration in particular is a business that by its nature is very speculative we may not be able to establish mineral reserves on our properties or be able to mine any gold or any other minerals on a profitable basis few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines unusual or unexpected geological conditions fires flooding explosions caveins landslides and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery equipment or labor are just some of the many risks involved in mineral exploration programs and the subsequent development of gold deposits            the mining industry is capital intensive and we may be unable to raise necessary funding   we require additional external financing to pursue our exploration activities at the kibby flats and qr properties and for any further properties we may pursue similar activities we may be unable to secure additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all our inability to raise additional funds would prevent us from achieving our business objectives and would have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and the value of our securities if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities the ownership of existing stockholders may be diluted and the securities that we may issue in the future may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of the current holders of our common stock such securities may also be issued at a discount to the market price of our common stock resulting in possible further dilution to the book value per share of common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we could be subject to debt covenants that could place limitations on our operations and financial flexibility   we are a junior exploration company with no mining activities and we may never have any mining activities in the future   our primary business is exploring for gold and to a lesser extent other minerals if we discover commercially exploitable gold or other deposits we will not be able to make any money from mining activities unless the gold or other deposits are actually mined or we sell our interest accordingly we will need to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing find some other entity to mine our properties or operate our facilities on our behalf enter into joint venture or other arrangements with a third party or sell or lease the property or rights to mine to third parties mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible such projects could experience unexpected problems and delays during development construction and mine start up mining operations in the united states are subject to many different federal state and local laws and regulations including stringent environmental health and safety laws if and when we assume operational responsibility for mining on our properties it is possible that we will be unable to comply with current or future laws and regulations which can change at any time it is possible that changes to these laws will be adverse to any potential mining operations moreover compliance with such laws may cause substantial delays and require capital outlays in excess of those anticipated adversely affecting any potential mining operations our future mining operations if any may also be subject to liability for pollution or other environmental damage it is possible that we will choose to not be insured against this risk because of high insurance costs or other reasons   we have a short operating history have a history of losses and may never achieve any meaningful revenue   we acquired all of our property interests since may  and prior to may  we incurred minimal property exploration due diligence activities our operating history consists of our exploration activities we have no incomeproducing activities from mining or exploration and have a history of losses stemming from the acquisition of the rights to explore on our property and conducting our exploration activities exploring for gold and other minerals or resources is an inherently speculative activity and there is no assurance we will be able to develop an economically feasible operating plan for the kibby flats or qr properties there is a strong possibility that we will not find any other commercially exploitable gold or other deposits on our property because we are an exploration company we may never achieve any meaningful revenue   we are required to make annual blm payments and county filings or we will lose our rights to our property   we are required to make annual claim maintenance payments to the us bureau of land management “blm” and pay additional fees to the counties in which our mining claims are located in order to maintain our rights to explore and if warranted to develop our unpatented mining claims if we fail to meet these obligations we will lose the right to explore for gold and other minerals on our property   our business is subject to extensive environmental regulations that may make exploring mining or related activities prohibitively expensive and which may change at any time   all of our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that can substantially delay exploration and make exploration expensive or prohibit it altogether we may be subject to potential liabilities associated with the pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products that may occur as the result of exploring and other related activities we may have to pay to remedy environmental pollution which may reduce the amount of money that we have available to use for exploration or other activities and adversely affect our financial position if we are unable to fully remedy an environmental problem we might be required to suspend operations or to enter into interim compliance measures pending the completion of the required remedy if a decision is made to mine our properties and we retain any operational responsibility for doing so our potential exposure for remediation may be significant and this may have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial position we have not purchased insurance for potential environmental risks including potential liability for pollution or other hazards associated with the disposal of waste products from our exploration activities and such insurance may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at a reasonable price all of our exploration and if warranted development activities may be subject to regulation under one or more local state and federal environmental impact analyses and public review processes it is possible that future changes in applicable laws regulations and permits or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could have significant impact on some portion of our business which may require our business to be economically reevaluated from time to time these risks include but are not limited to the risk that regulatory authorities may increase bonding requirements beyond our financial capability inasmuch as posting of bonding in accordance with regulatory determinations is a condition to the right to operate under all material operating permits increases in bonding requirements could prevent operations even if we are in full compliance with all substantive environmental laws              the government licenses and permits we need to explore on our property may take too long to acquire or cost too much to enable us to proceed with exploration in the event that we conclude that the kibby flats and qr properties can be profitably mined or discover other commercially exploitable deposits we may face substantial delays and costs associated with securing the additional government licenses and permits that could preclude our ability to develop the mine   exploration activities usually require the granting of permits from various governmental agencies for example exploration drilling on unpatented mining claims requires a permit to be obtained from the blm which may take several months or longer to grant the requested permit depending on the size location and scope of the exploration program additional permits may also be required before exploration activities can be undertaken prehistoric or indian graves threatened or endangered species archeological sites or the possibility thereof difficult access excessive dust and important nearby water resources may all result in the need for additional permits before exploration activities can commence   as with all permitting processes there is substantial uncertainty about when and if the permits will be issued there is the risk that unexpected delays and excessive costs may be experienced in obtaining required permits the needed permits may not be granted or could be challenged by third parties which could result in protracted litigation that could cause substantial delays or may be granted in an unacceptable timeframe or cost too much additionally proposed mineral exploration and mining projects can become controversial and be opposed by nearby landowners and communities which can substantially delay and interfere with the permitting process delays in or inability to obtain necessary permits would result in unanticipated costs which may result in serious adverse effects upon our business   the value of our property and any other deposits we may seek or locate is subject to volatility in the price of gold   our ability to obtain additional and continuing funding and our profitability if and when we commence mining or sell our rights to mine will be significantly affected by changes in the market price of gold and other mineral deposits gold and other minerals prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors all of which are beyond our control the price of gold may be influenced by   · fluctuation in the supply of demand and market price for gold · mining activities of our competitors · sale or purchase of gold by central banks and for investment purposes by individuals and financial institutions · interest rates · currency exchange rates · inflation or deflation · fluctuation in the value of the united states dollar and other currencies · global and regional supply and demand including investment industrial and jewelry demand and · political and economic conditions of major gold or other mineralproducing countries   the price of gold and other minerals have fluctuated widely in recent years and a decline in the price of gold or other minerals could cause a significant decrease in the value of our property limit our ability to raise money and render continued exploration and development of our property impracticable if that happens then we could lose our rights to our property or be compelled to sell some or all of these rights additionally the future development of our mining properties beyond the exploration stage is heavily dependent upon gold prices remaining sufficiently high to make the development of our property economically viable   our mineral property claims may be challenged we are not insured against any challenges impairments or defects to our mining claims   our property is comprised primarily of unpatented lode mining claims located and maintained in accordance with the federal general mining law of  unpatented lode mining claims are unique us property interests and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented mining claims is often uncertain this uncertainty arises in part out of the complex federal and state laws and regulations with which the owner of an unpatented mining claim must comply in order to locate and maintain a valid claim moreover if we discover mineralization that is close to the claim boundaries it is possible that some or all of the mineralization may occur outside the boundaries on lands that we do not control in such a case we would not have the right to extract those minerals we do not have title reports or opinions covering all of our kibby flats and qr properties and other claims the uncertainty resulting from not having title opinions for all of our properties and claims or having detailed claim surveys on all of our properties leaves us exposed to potential title defects defending challenges to our property title would be costly and may divert funds that could otherwise be used for exploration activities and other purposes            in addition unpatented lode mining claims are always subject to possible challenges by third parties or contests by the federal government which if successful may prevent us from exploiting any discovery of commercially extractable gold challenges to our title may increase our costs of operation or limit our ability to explore on certain portions of our property we are not insured against challenges impairments or defects to our property title   possible amendments to the general mining law could make it more difficult or impossible for us to execute our business plan   in recent years the us congress has considered a number of proposed amendments to the general mining law as well as legislation that would make comprehensive changes to the law although no such legislation has been adopted to date there can be no assurance that such legislation will not be adopted in the future if adopted such legislation if it includes concepts that have been part of previous legislative proposals could among other things i adopt the limitation on the number of millsites that a claimant may use discussed below ii impose time limits on the effectiveness of plans of operation that may not coincide with mine life iii impose more stringent environmental compliance and reclamation requirements on activities on unpatented mining claims and millsites iv establish a mechanism that would allow states localities and native american tribes to petition for the withdrawal of identified tracts of federal land from the operation of the general mining law v allow for administrative determinations that mining would not be allowed in situations where undue degradation of the federal lands in question could not be prevented vi impose royalties on gold and other mineral production from unpatented mining claims or impose fees on production from patented mining claims and vii impose a fee on the amount of material displaced at a mine further it could have an adverse impact on earnings from our operations could reduce estimates of any reserves we may establish and could curtail our future exploration and development activity on our unpatented claims   in addition a consortium of environmental groups has filed a lawsuit in the united district court for the district of columbia against the department of the interior the department of agriculture the blm and the usfs asking the court to order the blm and usfs to adopt the fiveacre millsite limitation that lawsuit also asks the court to order the blm and the usfs to require mining claimants to pay fair market value for their use of the surface of federal lands where those claimants have not demonstrated the validity of their unpatented mining claims and millsites if the plaintiffs in that lawsuit were to prevail that could have an adverse impact on our ability to use our unpatented millsites for facilities ancillary to our exploration development and mining activities and could significantly increase the cost of using federal lands at our properties for such ancillary facilities   market forces or unforeseen developments may prevent us from obtaining the supplies and equipment necessary to explore for gold and other minerals   gold exploration and mineral exploration in general is a very competitive business competitive demands for contractors and unforeseen shortages of supplies andor equipment could result in the disruption of our planned exploration activities current demand for exploration drilling services equipment and supplies is robust and could result in suitable equipment and skilled manpower being unavailable at scheduled times for our exploration program fuel prices are extremely volatile as well we will attempt to locate suitable equipment materials manpower and fuel if sufficient funds are available if we cannot find the equipment and supplies needed for our various exploration programs we may have to suspend some or all of them until equipment supplies funds andor skilled manpower become available any such disruption in our activities may adversely affect our exploration activities and financial condition   our directors and executive officers lack significant experience or technical training in exploring for precious and base metal deposits and in developing mines   most of our directors and executive officers lack significant experience or technical training in exploring for precious and base metal deposits and in developing mines our management may not be fully aware of many of the other specific requirements related to working within this industry their decisions and choices may not take into account standard engineering or managerial approaches that mineral exploration companies commonly use consequently our operations and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to some of our management’s lack of experience in the mining industry              we may not be able to maintain the infrastructure necessary to conduct exploration activities   our exploration activities depend upon adequate infrastructure reliable roads bridges power sources and water supply are important factors that affect capital and operating costs unusual or infrequent weather phenomena sabotage government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure could adversely affect our exploration activities and financial condition   our exploration activities may be adversely affected by the local climate or seismic events which could prevent us from gaining access to our property yearround   earthquakes heavy rains snowstorms and floods could result in serious damage to or the destruction of facilities equipment or means of access to our properties or may otherwise prevent us from conducting exploration activities on our property there may be short periods of time when the unpaved portion of the access road is impassible in the event of extreme weather conditions or unusually muddy conditions during these periods it may be difficult or impossible for us to access our property make repairs or otherwise conduct exploration activities on them   risks related to our stockholders and shares of common stock   there is currently no trading market for our common stock and liquidity of shares of our common stock is limited   shares of our common stock are not registered under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction and accordingly there is no public trading market for the common stock further no public trading market is expected to develop until the company obtains effectiveness of a registration statement under the securities act of  as amended the “securities act” therefore outstanding shares of common stock cannot be offered sold pledged or otherwise transferred unless subsequently registered pursuant to or exempt from registration under the securities act and any other applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations compliance with the criteria for securing exemptions under federal securities laws and the securities laws of the various states is extremely complex especially in respect of those exemptions affording flexibility and the elimination of trading restrictions in respect of securities received in exempt transactions and subsequently disposed of without registration under the securities act or state securities laws   our stock is a penny stock trading of our stock may be restricted by the securities and exchange commission’s penny stock regulations which may limit an investor’s ability to buy and sell our stock   our stock is a penny stock the securities and exchange commission has adopted rule g which generally defines “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price as defined less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions our securities are covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” the term “accredited investor” refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with a net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the sec which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation   in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules consequently these penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to trade our securities we believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock   we are controlled by our management and affiliates   our management  board and affiliates beneficially own and vote approximately  shares of our common stock representing approximately  of the shares outstanding prior to the completion of this offering consequently management has the ability to influence control of the operations of the company and acting together will have the ability to influence or control substantially all matters submitted to stockholders for approval including   · election of our board of directors the “board of directors” · removal of directors · amendment to the company’s articles of incorporation or bylaws and · adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger takeover or other business combination              these stockholders have complete control over our affairs accordingly this concentration of ownership by itself may have the effect of impeding a merger consolidation takeover or other business consolidation or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for the common stock   if we are successful in selling all of the  shares contained in this offering to nonaffiliates our management board and affiliates would beneficially own and vote approximately  of the shares outstanding subsequent to completion   we have never paid dividends on our common stock   we have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not presently intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future we anticipate that any funds available for payment of dividends will be reinvested into the company to further its business strategy   we have not issued preferred stock   our articles of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock with designations rights and preferences determined from time to time by the board of directors in its sole discretion accordingly our board of directors is empowered without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with dividend liquidation conversion voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock in the event of issuance the preferred stock could be utilized under certain circumstances as a method of discouraging delaying or preventing a change in control of the company which is sometimes referred to in corporate parlance as a “poison pill” although we have no present intention to issue any shares of our authorized preferred stock there can be no assurance that the company will not do so in the future however no preferred stock has been issued   offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline   if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under rule  or upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an “overhang” in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could decline the existence of an overhang whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring also could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equityrelated securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate   the elimination of monetary liability against our directors officers and employees under our articles of incorporation and the existence of indemnification rights to our directors officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors officers and employees   our articles of incorporation contain provisions which eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to our company and stockholders our bylaws also require us to indemnify our officers and directors we may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our agreements with our directors officers and employees the foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors officers and employees that we may be unable to recoup these provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors officers and employees for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors officers and employees even though such actions if successful might otherwise benefit our company and stockholders   antitakeover provisions may impede the acquisition of our company   certain provisions of the nevada general corporation law have antitakeover effects and may inhibit a nonnegotiated merger or other business combination these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and to obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with such a transaction however certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of us including an acquisition in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares as a result stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so   market and other data   the industry and market data contained in this prospectus are based on independent industry

from this offering will be used to repay the founders of the company for their investments in the company we anticipate that we will require a minimum funding of approximately  for a minimum period of one year including costs associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the sec if adequate funds are not raised we expect that our founders will invest further or loan money to the company although there are no such contractual commitments   the effectiveness of the registration with respect to the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus that are being registered for the account of the selling stockholders named in this prospectus we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered through this prospectus by the selling stockholders we will pay all of the expenses incident to the registration of the shares pursuant to this prospectus except for sales commissions and other expenses of selling stockholders named herein   determination of offering price   the offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us the price does not bear any relationship to our assets book value earnings or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company in determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan accordingly the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities   dilution of the price you pay for your shares   dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders   investors who purchase our common stock will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per share of our common stock and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our total tangible assets less total liabilities by the number of outstanding shares of our common stock as of september   we had a net tangible book value of  or approximately  per share of common stock              dilution in net tangible book value per share represents the difference between the assumed offering price per share of common stock of  and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of common stock immediately after the sale of the  shares of common stock being registered for resale in accordance with this offering therefore after giving effect to our assumed receipt of  in estimated net proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock under this offering and registered in this offering assuming a purchase price of  per share  of the closing price of the common stock and assuming such sale was made on september   and after deducting estimated offering commissions and expenses payable by us our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of september   would have been  or  per share this would represent an immediate increase in the net tangible book value of  per share to existing shareholders attributable to this offering the following table illustrates this per share dilution to new investors   assumed offering price per share of common stock               net tangible book value per share as of september                 increase in as adjusted net tangible book value per share attributable to the sale of shares under the purchase agreement                pro forma net tangible book value per share after the sale of shares under the purchase agreement                dilution per share to new investors                 to the extent that we sell more or less than  worth of shares under this offering or to the extent that some or all sales are made at prices lower than or in excess of the assumed price per share of  then the dilution reflected in the table above will differ the above table is based on  shares of our common stock outstanding as of the date of this prospectus adjusted for the assumed sale of  shares of common stock for gross proceeds of  at the assumed purchase price described above and after deducting estimated offering commissions and expenses payable by us assuming no adjustments in the offering price per share of common stock of  new investors will be diluted by  per share  per share and  per share in the event   or  of the offering is sold respectively in the event we only sell  of our offering resulting in gross proceeds of  new shareholders will be diluted by  per share   to the extent that we issue additional shares of common stock in the future there may be further dilution to investors participating in this offering in addition we may choose to raise additional capital because of market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans if we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our shareholders              terms of the offering   we have  shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus of which  of the shares will be registered the company is registering an additional  shares of its common stock for sale at the price of  per share for direct placement by the company ie without the use of a brokerdealer or other thirdparty statutory underwriter there is no arrangement to address the possible effect of the offering on the price of the stock   in connection with the company’s selling efforts in the offering our chief executive officer will not register as a brokerdealer

of this offering although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange or quoted overthecounter we intend to seek to have our shares of common stock quoted on the otc bulletin board to be quoted on the otc bulletin boarda market maker must file an application on our behalf to make a market for our common stock as of the date of this registration statement we have not engaged a market maker to file such an application there is no guarantee that a market marker will file an application on our behalf and even if an application is filed there is no guarantee that we will be accepted for quotation our stock may become quoted rather than traded on the otc bulletin board   the company’s shares may be sold to purchasers directly by and subject to the discretion of the company further the company will not offer its shares for sale through underwriters dealers agents or anyone who may receive compensation in the form of underwriting discounts concessions or commissions from the company andor the purchasers of the shares for whom they may act as agents the shares of common stock sold by the company may be occasionally sold in one or more transactions all shares sold under this prospectus will be sold at a fixed price of  per share   the company’s management has a substantial network of individuals and financial institutions that has developed over the course of their many decades of participation in the mining and financial services industries many of these people are currently aware of the business operations of the company and will be made aware of the effectiveness of this registration statement in addition the public at large is and will become familiar with the company’s operational business activities in the mining industry through business relationships and operational press releases these relationships positive press and wordofmouth will be relied upon to attract interest in the offering accordingly the company expects to be solicited by prospective investors to participate in the offering   in order to comply with the applicable securities laws of certain states the securities will be offered or sold in those states only if they have been registered or qualified for sale or if an exemption from such registration or qualification requirement is available and with which the company has complied   in addition and without limiting the foregoing the company will be subject to applicable provisions rules and regulations under the exchange act with regard to security transactions during the period of time when this registration statement is effective   our shares of common stock are subject to the “penny stock” rules of the securities and exchange commission the sec has adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks” penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the sec which specifies information about penny stocks and the nature and significance of risks of the penny stock market a brokerdealer must also provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and sales person in the transaction and monthly account statements indicating the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for stock that becomes subject to those penny stock rules if a trading market for our common stock develops our common stock will probably become subject to the penny stock rules and shareholders may have difficulty in selling their shares              we will pay all expenses incidental to the registration of the shares which we expect to be approximately    offering period and expiration date   this offering

prospectus in addition to historical information this discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those set forth under “risk factors” “forwardlooking statements” and in other parts of this prospectus   overview   we were originally incorporated in the state of nevada in august  since our inception we have been engaged in the identification potential acquisition and ongoing exploration of precious and nonprecious mineral properties located in the western united states with an initial emphasis in nevada until may  we did not have patented or unpatented mineral claims and our activities only consisted of initial discussions and due diligence sample testing   in may  we issued  shares of unregistered and restricted shares of common stock to obtain a total of ten unpatented mining claims located in esmeralda county nevada commonly known as “kibby flats property” for mineral exploration   in november  we issued a total of  shares of unregistered and restricted shares of common stock for the acquisition of fifty  unpatented mining claims commonly referred to as the “qr property” located in humboldt county nevada along with certain exploration mining equipment   we expect to devote the majority of the fiscal year ended  to obtaining the various permits required to commence our exploration activities additionally we will continue to seek acquisitions of additional mineral properties and other mining assets                kibby flats property   the claims are located in the very northern part of esmeralda county nevada in section  tn re the closest town with full services is hawthorne which is south of reno on highway  the property can be reached by driving south from hawthorne on highway  for  miles to a turn off to the east just before the town of mina this improved dirt road is taken for  miles to bettles well and then another  miles to a junction at the summit the road south is taken for another  miles and then an unimproved road leads to the claims in  mile the blm permit identification information for the voluntary crf exploration form notice for kf  is nmc  and is a lode claim with acreage of  and is part of claims in sections     and  of township  north range  east mount diablo meridian in the county of esmerelda state of nevada as identified by the us bureau of land management claim names and serial numbers   the company owns  of the ten “” unpatented lode claims making up the kibby flats property the company acquired the kibby flats property under a fee simple title arrangement with no royalty or net smelter return obligation from production if any  the claims property information is included as exhibit    the kibby flats property does not have any physical infrastructure power or water sources the property is surrounded by a network of publicly accessibly roads that generally remain open on a yearround basis in the event we commence development activities we will need to determine the appropriate power water and other necessary infrastructure                      land status and physiography   the property will be a pit operation that consists of  unpatented lode claims   acres hectares within the jurisdiction of the bureau of land management   the area is characterized by low rolling foothills on the west slope of the cedar mountains outwash drainages have incised into the hills and created broad dry washes sand dunes cover a considerable amount of the surface of the low hills vegetation consists of scrub sage and minor grasses which is indicative of the low precipitation rate and lack of water despite the remote location the area has a fair network of roads and access is good during most of the year              previous work   there are  shallow shafts and several prospect pits aligned along the primary strike of the mineralization these appear to have been made in the early ’s when prospectors fanned out from tonopah looking for similar deposits the size and extent of the old workings suggest that these were exploratory and little or no production was realized claim location notices were found with dates of   and  further suggesting that there were episodes of exploration depending on metal prices and other economic conditions that would favor development of these claims   the mickspot mine located approximately  miles to the northeast was worked for antimony during wwii bulldozer scrapes and drill roads were created in the early ’s as another wave of precious metals exploration swept nevada looking for large low grade heap leach amenable deposits it does not appear that any significant exploration work was done in this area   the company believes samples were taken in  however we have not performed any additional procedures to verify the validity of the data or ascertain whether the samples were taken in accordance with appropriate quality assurance standards including preparation control chain of custody or the accuracy and precision of applicable assaying   geology   the property is within the structural framework of the walker lane transition zone between the sierra nevada batholith and the basin and range extensional terrain the oldest rocks on the property are chert and quartzites of the triassic excelsior formation they form the escarpment and steep hillsides of the cedar mountains on the eastern section of the property overlying the excelsior is an extensive ash flow and rhyolite sequence several hundred feet thick this is tertiary in age and has alternating beds of welded ash flows weathered buff and purplish in color there are scattered zones of intensely green colored rock within the ash flows due to high iron or chloritic content basalt flows of pliocene or pleistocene age outcrop as dark weathered hills in the western area of the claim block the basalt flows were in turn intruded by felsic dikes and quartz veins containing mineralization   there has been tertiary range front faulting and some related faulting within the ash flow units and the mineralization may be related to shearing or faulting at depth a significant quaternary fanglomerate has developed in some drainages as outwash from periodic floods have created extensive fans from the mountains the arid nature of the area and the prevailing winds has also allowed the creation of recent sand dunes covering the hillsides   mineralization   mineralization is concentrated in the northern portion of the claim block where prospect workings have exposed a vein system striking nw and dipping steeply at  degrees to the southeast the vein system can be described as an oxidized and altered zone of between  to  feet in width that is easily visible due to the deep redbrown color in contrast to the grayblack host rock it can be traced on the surface along strike for over  feet m there are thin  inches discontinuous quartz veinlets and lenses in a central zone characterized by abundant iron oxide and black manganese staining in the surrounding rock the quartz itself has a greenbrown coating on fracture surfaces which has high lead and antimony values xrf and is likely bindhemite intense argillic alteration radiates out from this central zone for  feet in both directions and is characterized by local bleaching and iron oxide staining   a small prospect  feet to the east of the main mineralized system exposes another mineralized zone that is similar in appearance and mineral content it strikes ne at a high angle and intersects the main zone near the lower shaft and continues for approximately  feet the mineralization is similar to the main zone being anomalous in antimony lead and arsenic with the xrf and on outcrop stibiconite can be detected with stibnite visible on fresh surfaces this vein may be an indication of an anastomising system of veins that may increase the possibility of increased volume of mineralized rock   however the kibby flats property is in the exploration phase as no reserves proven reserves or probable reserves have been computed for these claims   qr property   in november  the company acquired fifty  unpatented lode mining claims commonly referred to as the “qr property” located in humboldt county nevada the company acquired the qr property under a fee simple title arrangement with no royalty or net smelter return obligation from production if any the claims property information is included as exhibit    the qr property does not have any physical infrastructure power or water sources the property is surrounded by a network of publicly accessibly roads that generally remain open on a yearround basis in the event we commence development activities we will need to determine the appropriate power water and other necessary infrastructure            location   the claims are located about  miles east of winnemucca at the northwest end of the jackson mountains in humboldt county nevada the closest town with full services is winnemucca which is northeast of reno an estimated  miles on interstate  east the property can be reached by driving west from winnemucca on highway  for  miles to a turn off to the north on state  this improved dirt road is taken six miles to where the claims begin                    land status and physiography   the property will be a pit operation and consists of  unpatented lode claims  acres within the jurisdiction of the bureau of land management   the area is characterized by low rolling foothills on the northwest end of the jackson mountains outwash drainages have incised into the hills and created broad dry washes sand dunes cover a considerable amount of the surface of the lower areas vegetation consists of scrub sage and minor grasses which is indicative of the low precipitation rate and lack of water despite the remote location the area has a good network of roads and access is good during most of the year   previous work   there is one shallow shaft halfway up the northwest side of the jackson mountains that aligned along the primary strike of the mineralization near the fault zone this appears to have been made in the early ’s when prospectors fanned out from winnemucca looking for gold and silver deposits the size and extent of the old workings suggest that this was exploratory and little or no production was realized recent exploration was completed by signal mining  exploration by both trenching drilling and sonic testing the results are discussed in the geology and mineralization section below claim location notices were found suggesting that there were episodes of exploration depending on metal prices and other economic conditions that would favor development of these claims   geology   the property is within the structural framework of the humboldt area more specifically the jackson mountains the minerals identified on the claims was well mineralized with pyrite malachite azurite arsenopyrite electrum hematite in silica quartz stringers and narrow quartz veins the claims have multiple fracture density patterns ranging from thirty to eightyfive degrees and thrusting rectangular fault blocks which are rotated one hundred eighty degrees local regional and global plate tectonic patterns that appear to control the goldsilver deposits indicate a southsoutheasterly displacement along with a continuous extension of the same pattern of structural mineralized controls for at least a half mile on the claims   assay testing of the material occurred from  through  all trenching samples provided an average of  ozton based on  samples at the qr claims the samples were taken by mr bill jerome of signal exploration and mining located in redding ca and a member of our board of directors the samples were assayed by third party labs the validity of which will require further sampling and additional assaying additionally the company has obtained a sample location map identifying all the sample locations however we have not performed any additional procedures to verify the validity of the data or ascertain whether the samples were taken in accordance with appropriate quality assurance standards including preparation control chain of custody or the accuracy and precision of applicable assaying see exhibit  filed herewith for details concerning average computation for trenching samples   however the qr property is in the exploration phase as no reserves proven reserves or probable reserves have been computed for these claims   competition   we compete with other exploration companies for the acquisition of a limited number of exploration rights many other exploration companies possess greater financial and technical resources than we do the mineral exploration industry is highly fragmented and we are a very small participant in this sector many of our competitors explore for a variety of minerals and control many different properties around the world many of them have been in business longer than we have and have established more strategic partnerships and relationships we also compete with other exploration companies for the acquisition and retention of skilled technical personnel   our competitive position depends upon our ability to acquire and explore new and existing gold properties however there is significant competition for properties suitable for gold exploration failure to achieve and maintain a competitive position could adversely impact our ability to obtain the financing necessary for us to acquire gold properties as a result we may be unable to continue to acquire interests in attractive properties on terms that we consider acceptable we will be subject to competition and other unforeseen limited sources of supplies equipment and services in the industry if we are unsuccessful in securing the products equipment and services we need we may have to suspend our exploration plans until we are able to secure them              market for gold   in the event that gold is produced from our property we believe that wholesale purchasers for the gold would be readily available readily available wholesale purchasers of gold and other precious metals exist in the united states and throughout the world among the largest are handy  harman engelhard industries and johnson matthey ltd historically these markets are liquid and volatile wholesale purchase prices for precious metals can be affected by a number of factors all of which are beyond our control including but not limited to   · fluctuation in the supply of demand and market price for gold · mining activities of our competitors · sale or purchase of gold by central banks and for investment purposes by individuals and financial institutions · interest rates · currency exchange rates · inflation or deflation · fluctuation in the value of the united states dollar and other currencies and · political and economic conditions of major gold or other mineralproducing countries   gold ore is typically mined and leached to produce pregnant solutions which are processed through a series of steps to recover gold and produce doré gold doré is then sold to refiners and smelters for the value of the minerals that it contains less the cost of further refining and smelting refiners and smelters then sell the gold on the open market through brokers who work for wholesalers including the major wholesalers listed above   regulation   various levels of governmental controls and regulations address among other things the environmental impact of mineral mining and exploration operations and establish requirements for reclamation of mineral mining and exploration properties after exploration operations have ceased with respect to the regulation of mineral mining and exploration legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish performance standards air and water quality emission limits and other design or operational requirements for various aspects of the operations including health and safety standards legislation and regulations also establish requirements for reclamation and rehabilitation of mining properties following the cessation of operations and may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods of time after mining activities have ceased   our exploration activities are subject to various levels of federal and state laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment including requirements for closure and reclamation of mineral exploration properties some of the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the emergency planning and community righttoknow act the endangered species act the federal land policy and management act the national environmental policy act the resource conservation and recovery act and related state laws in nevada additionally much of our property is subject to the federal general mining law of  which regulates how mining claims on federal lands are located and maintained   the state of nevada where we intend to focus our mineral exploration efforts requires mining projects to obtain a nevada state reclamation permit pursuant to the mined land reclamation act the “nevada mlr act” which establishes reclamation and financial assurance requirements for all mining operations in the state new and expanding facilities are required to provide a reclamation plan and financial assurance to ensure that the reclamation plan is implemented upon completion of operations the nevada mlr act also requires reclamation plans and permits for exploration projects that will result in more than five acres of surface disturbance on private lands   we will need to secure new ndep permits in order to conduct expanded exploration activities we plan to apply for additional required permits to conduct our exploration programs as necessary these permits would be obtained from either the blm or the ndep obtaining such permits will require the posting of financial bonds for subsequent reclamation of disturbances caused by exploration delays in the granting of permits or permit amendments are not uncommon and any delays in the granting of permits may adversely affect our exploration activities   our current exploration permit costs are minimal although future exploration activities may require amendments to these permits we also anticipate that one or more notices of intent will be required from blm for exploration drilling in the future on our unpatented mining claims a notice of intent includes information regarding the company submitting the notice maps of the proposed disturbance equipment to be utilized the general schedule of operations a calculation of the total disturbance anticipated and a detailed reclamation plan and budget a bond in us currency is required to ensure reclamation and the amount is determined based on the estimated thirdparty costs to reclaim and revegetate the disturbed acreage blm approval of the notice is not required but the bond calculation is required to be approved in writing by the blm before work can proceed it is not necessary to file a notice of intent prior to work on private land the notice of intent must be filed with the blm for all activities involving the disturbance of five acres two hectares or less of the surface measurement of land disturbance is cumulative and once five acres total has been disturbed and remains unreclaimed in one project area a plan of operations must be filed and approved by the blm before additional work can take place and a reclamation permit must be obtained from the ndep both the plan of operations and the ndep reclamation permit require a cash bond and a reclamation plan recontouring and revegetation of disturbed surface areas would be completed pursuant to the applicable permits the cost of reclamation work varies according to the degree of physical disturbance it is difficult to estimate the future cost of compliance with environmental laws since the full nature and extent of our future activities cannot be determined at this time              results of operations   annual periods ended december   and    during  our former sole officer director and shareholder was actively engaged in other business pursuits not related to the company or directly related mining claim acquisition exploration or development in this regard we incurred total operating expenses associated with our annual state of nevada regulatory filings of    beginning in april  and in conjunction with the appointment of a new officer and director in early may we increased our overall business operations and developed our current business strategy to identify acquire explore and if warranted develop patented and unpatented mineral claims in the western united states in this regard we issued our new officer and director  founder’s shares and another business and legal consultant  founder’s shares at par for total recognized compensation of    during the year ended december   we incurred total operating expenses of  in expanding our operations we obtained an executive office for our sole officer located in incline village nevada as a result of this initial expansion we incurred office set up rent and related utilities and supplies expenses totaling  in attracting our new officer and business consultant we recognized  of additional administrative costs associated with issuing these individuals a total of  founder’s shares in addition we changed our name from andekael development corporation to high desert holding corp and incurred state regulatory filing fees totaling  additionally we incurred total costs of  for the engagement of our auditor to perform the necessary financial statements audits and reviews we incurred a total  in travel and related costs associated with the identification of our kibby flats and qr properties and performing other due diligence to identify potential future acquisitions we expect our general and administrative costs to increase for at least the next twelve months as we continue to pursue planned business growth and as funding permits   we incurred a total of  of mining claim and permit application fees with the bureau of land management and esmerelda county nevada to further explore our kibby flats property we expect these exploration costs to increase for at least the next twelve months as we expand our exploration activities at the kibby flats and qr properties   for the three and nine months ended september   and      we have not generated any revenues from business activities and currently do not expect to do so for at least the next twelve months   during the three months ended september   we incurred exploration and development costs of  associated with the renewal of our qr property lode claims in addition to the renewal costs during the nine months ended september   we engaged a mining exploration consultant via the issuance of  shares of restricted and unregistered shares of common stock for total consideration of  the increase compared to the prior periods in  was the result of not conducting material exploration activities on our mineral properties until    for the nine months ended september   our general and administrative fees increased from  during the nine months ended september   to  the similar increase in general and administrative costs for the three months ended september   to  from  for the three months ended september   was a result of increases in our business activities our increased business activities resulted in higher legal auditing and other regulatory fees associated with making required public company filings   as we pursue the exploration of our currently held mineral properties and consider the acquisition of additional similar properties we expect our operating costs to increase for at least the next twelve months we anticipate most of these costs and corresponding increases will be incurred for permitting exploration and environmental remediation and travel as well as applicable supporting administrative costs   liquidity and capital resources   as of september   the company had  in cash and total current liabilities of  primarily comprised of a shortterm loans and other advances from a significant shareholder totaling  accrued quarterly director fees of  and incurrence of professional and facilities fees the shareholder providing the loan and other operating advances has informally agreed to defer payment of the note until the company’s financial resources become sufficient to meet its ongoing business plans however the shareholder can still demand payment at any time in the future                the current available capital reserves of the company are not sufficient for the company to remain operational we require the funding from this offering to implement our business plan since inception we have sold  shares of restricted and unregistered shares of common stock in private placements for aggregate cash proceeds of    to achieve our business goals we are attempting to raise money from this offering we cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required if we are successful any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the use of proceeds section of this prospectus we will attempt to raise the necessary funds to proceed with all phases of our plan of operation   our auditors have issued a “going concern” opinion meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering and shortterm cash advances from our sole officer and other affiliates who have no obligations to do so we must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business if our estimated minimum of  of shares is sold for the gross proceeds of  it will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting company the company anticipates over the next  months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately  unless we acquire other operating assets we do not believe that we will generate enough revenue to cover costs associated with being a publicly reporting company in the first  months   we have achieved success in using shares of our restricted and unregistered shares of common stock in making capital asset acquisitions including mining equipment and mineral properties we expect to continue to issues shares for certain future capital acquisitions and to compensate certain officers directors and other consultants however there is no guarantee we will be able to do so at terms favorable to our operating plans or at all   plan of operations   in late  we began acquiring mining equipment for the use in the exploration and development of our mineral properties with this equipment we expect to able to conduct various exploration activities on our mineral properties subsequent to receiving all federal state and local government permits required to do so we expect to initially focus our efforts on the exploration of the qr property correspondingly and unless otherwise noted the following discussion relates solely to this property and kibby flats   in the second quarter of  we obtained a minor exploration permit with the bureau of land management “blm” in order to commence a drilling program on the qr property in humboldt county nevada upon receipt of adequate funding we will make the required bond payment to the nevada division of environmental protection “ndep” allowing us to begin preliminary drilling trenching and other ground disturbing activities if adequate funding is obtained we expect to post the bond prior to the year ended december   and begin preliminary exploration activities in the spring of  weather permitting   the drilling equipment owned by the company will be used to drill samples of different areas where our outsourced mining and geology consultants will determine the areas with the highest potential for the achievement of successful mining additionally trenching may be completed where up to  tons of ore can be removed for testing as part of the exploration permit   in the third quarter of  we plan to begin additional blm permitting activities through the engagement of a professional environmental consulting firm to provide guidance on environmental impact issues for endangered species and american indian historical concerns   during  and  the mining equipment we acquired will be assessed to determine the actual need for the equipment in the exploration and mining process outside contracting work for the mining equipment would be strongly considered that may allow for us to offset the cost of some of our exploration activities additional mining equipment may be acquired which would assist in future mining and exploration   offbalance sheet arrangements   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements   critical accounting estimates   the sec has requested that all registrants address their most critical accounting policies the sec has indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the representation of the registrant’s financial condition and results and requires management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we base our estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results will differ and may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions additionally changes in accounting estimates could occur in the future from period to period the following paragraphs identify our most critical accounting policies              stock based payments   we have on occasion issued equity instruments to employees and nonemployees in lieu of cash for the receipt of goods and services and in certain circumstances the settlement of shortterm loan arrangements the applicable gaap establishes that sharebased payment transactions with nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable   in these transactions the company issues unregistered and restricted equity instruments   in situations in which we issue unregistered restricted common shares in exchange for goods and services and the value of the goods and services are not the most reliably measurable we recognize the fair value of the unregistered restricted equity instruments based on the value of similar instruments issued in private placements in exchange for cash in the most recent transactions a level  input within the gaap hierarchy the company has determined this methodology reflects the risk adjusted fair value of our unregistered restricted equity instruments using a commercially reasonable valuation technique within the most active market   employees   as of the date of this report we have one fulltime employee consisting of our sole officer mr mark kersey  we believe mr kersey is sufficient to support our current level of activity we do not have a formal employment agreement with mr kersey who has informally agreed to defer the receipt of any cash compensation however he has no obligation remain employed under this arrangement as we expand our exploration and other potential business operations we will likely be required to increase our number of employees   description of properties   see kibby flats and the qr properties information above we currently lease our corporate office located at  tahoe boulevard

and business   high desert holding corp “company” was organized in the state of nevada in september  the company is a precious and nonprecious mineral exploration company the company is initially focused on identifying both public and privately held land that have historically demonstrated commercially viable resources primarily located in the western united states particularly nevada   the company has a mineral property located in nevada has not yet determined whether these properties contain a viable resource  future exploration and development of this and any other properties will be dependent upon the ability of the company to obtain necessary financing to satisfy the expenditure requirements under the property agreements to complete the development of the properties and upon the ability to raise additional capital   the accompanying interim unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to form q and article  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for complete financial statements in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included operating results for the three and nine month periods ended september   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending december   for further information refer to the financial statements and footnotes also included in this form s for the fiscal years ended december   and    the accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which contemplate continuation of the company as a going concern   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and financial instruments which mature within three months of the date of purchase as of september   and december   the company did not have any cash equivalents   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   stock based compensation   the company has on occasion issued equity and equity linked instruments to employees and nonemployees in lieu of cash to various vendors for the receipt of goods and services and in certain circumstances the settlement of shortterm loan arrangements   the applicable gaap  establishes that sharebased payment transactions with employees and nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable   in these transactions we issue unregistered and restricted shares of common stock   when unregistered common shares and equitylinked instruments convertible into unregistered common shares are issued for the settlement of shortterm financing arrangements that are not initially convertible the reacquisition price of the extinguished financing arrangement is determined by the value of the debt which is more clearly evident and no additional inducement expense is recognized         f        in situations in which we issue unregistered restricted common shares in exchange for goods and services and the value of the goods and services are not the most reliably measurable we recognize the fair value of the unregistered restricted equity instruments based on the value of similar instruments issued in private placements in exchange for cash in the most recent transactions a level  input within the gaap hierarchy   we have determined this methodology reflects the risk adjusted fair value of our unregistered restricted equity instruments using a commercially reasonable valuation technique   mineral property costs   we defer acquisition costs until we determine the viability of a mineral property since we do not have proven and probable reserves as defined by securities and exchange commission “sec” industry guide  exploration expenditures are expensed as incurred we expense care and maintenance costs as incurred   we review the carrying value of our mineral property for impairment whenever there are negative indicators of impairment our estimate of the gold price mineralized materials operating capital and reclamation costs are subject to risks and uncertainties affecting the recoverability of our investment in the mineral property although we have made our best most current estimate of these factors it is possible that near term changes could adversely affect our estimates and possibly require future asset impairment writedowns   when it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized such costs will be amortized using the unitsofproduction method over the estimated life of the probable reserve if mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired any capitalized costs will be charged to operations   recently issued accounting pronouncements   the company has reviewed recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not expect any to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows   note                       going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business  since inception the company has not identified any proven or probable reserve and correspondingly has not generated any revenue during its exploration stage  this raises substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern these financials do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty the company needs to raise additional funds to continue as a going concern   note                       mineral

based on our audit we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement the company is not required to have nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting accordingly we express no such opinion an audit also includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion in our opinion subject to the condition noted in the following paragraph the financial

flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the

shares outstanding during the period under the treasury stock method using the ifconverted method the company does not currently have any instruments issued and outstanding that are potentially dilutive   fair value of financial instruments   the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices  the fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability not on assumptions specific to the entity in addition the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of nonperformance risk including the party’s own credit risk   fair value measurements do not include transaction costs  a fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values  categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement  the fair value hierarchy is defined into the following three categories   level  quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  observable marketbased inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data level  unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data         f        income taxes   the company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets using the liability method under this method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statements carrying values and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse  in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns judgment and interpretation of statutes is required judgments and interpretation of statutes are inherent in this process future income tax assets are recorded in the financial statements if realization is considered more likely than not   for previously taken tax positions considered to be uncertain the company prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute  in the event certain tax positions do not meet the appropriate recognition threshold derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities and accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions is required   the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various states the company is subject to federal tax audits for all periods since inception in    stock based compensation   the company has on occasion issued equity and equity linked instruments to employees and nonemployees in lieu of cash to various vendors for the receipt of goods and services and in certain circumstances the settlement of shortterm loan arrangements   the applicable gaap  establishes that sharebased payment transactions with employees and nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable   in these transactions we issue unregistered and restricted shares of common stock   when unregistered common shares and equitylinked instruments convertible into unregistered common shares are issued for the settlement of shortterm financing arrangements that are not initially convertible the reacquisition price of the extinguished financing arrangement is determined by the value of the debt which is more clearly evident and no additional inducement expense is recognized   in situations in which we issue unregistered restricted common shares in exchange for goods and services and the value of the goods and services are not the most reliably measurable we recognize the fair value of the unregistered restricted equity instruments based on the value of similar instruments issued in private placements in exchange for cash in the most recent transactions a level  input within the gaap hierarchy   we have determined this methodology reflects the risk adjusted fair value of our unregistered restricted equity instruments using a commercially reasonable valuation technique   mining equipment   the company records its mining equipment at historical cost depreciation expense is recognized in operations over the estimated service lives or productive value of the equipment the company capitalizes expenditures for improvements that significantly extend the useful life of an asset expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations when incurred depreciation is computed using the straightline method over estimated useful lives as follows   drilling equipment  to  years vehicles and trailers  to  years field equipment  to  years   mineral property costs   we defer acquisition costs until we determine the viability of a mineral property since we do not have proven and probable reserves as defined by securities and exchange commission “sec” industry guide  exploration expenditures are expensed as incurred we expense care and maintenance costs as incurred   we review the carrying value of our mineral property for impairment whenever there are negative indicators of impairment our estimate of the gold price mineralized materials operating capital and reclamation costs are subject to risks and uncertainties affecting the recoverability of our investment in the mineral property although we have made our best most current estimate of these factors it is possible that near term changes could adversely affect our estimates and possibly require future asset impairment writedowns         f        when it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized such costs will be amortized using the unitsofproduction method over the estimated life of the probable reserve if mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired any capitalized costs will be charged to operations   environmental costs   environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are expensed liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated  enerally the timing of these accruals coincides with the earlier of completion of a feasibility study or the company’s commitments to plan of action based on the then known facts   reclamation liabilities and asset retirement obligations   minimum standards for site reclamation and closure have been established by various government agencies that affect certain of our operations the company calculates estimates of reclamation liabilities based on current laws and regulations and the expected undiscounted future cash flows to be incurred in reclaiming restoring and closing of operating mine sites us gaap requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred it further requires us to record a liability for the present value of our estimated environmental remediation costs and the related asset created with it when a recoverable asset longlived asset can be realized   recently issued accounting pronouncements   the company has reviewed recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not expect any to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows   note                       going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business  since inception the company has not identified any proven or probable reserve and correspondingly has not generated any revenue during its exploration stage  this raises substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern these financials do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty the company needs to raise additional funds to continue as a going concern   note                       mineral property   kibby flats   in may  the company acquired ten  unpatented mining

the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect currently         f        the company recognizes reductions in its deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the company’s opinion it is uncertain whether they will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the net deferred tax asset accordingly a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been recorded the company’s deferred tax assets by period are as follows       december      december                deferred tax asset             valuation allowance
