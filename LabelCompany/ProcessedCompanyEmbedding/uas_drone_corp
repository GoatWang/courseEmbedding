aviation’s approach to unmanned systems design manufacturing and flight operations combining engineering human factorsbased design software and safety systems to provide a reliable easy to deploy system drone aviation’s goal is to lead the uas industry from the unpredictable pioneering days of manned flight to the routine airline operations of modern times the drone aviation corp dac technology and uas solutions are based on manned aeronautical engineering and licensed pilot training and experience solutions drone aviation provides systems for welldefined missions and solutions for new and challenging requirements meeting the needs of commercial research law enforcement and military customers by providing costeffective reliable access to altitude from  feet for  hours to

the operator interface the ground control station drone aviation’s raptor flight control system comprises the georgia institute of technology’s gust autopilot and the dac developed gcs autopilot the raptor onboard autopilot gust executes on standard intel i i i single board computing architecture raptor is not performance constrained as are many flight control systems operating on proprietary difficult to upgrade hardware being able to rapidly increase computing power allows for mission expansion using capabilities such as gpsdenied vision navigation target recognition and neural network vehicle control commercially licensed exclusively to dac gust is an extensible software platform for full vehicle and environment simulation onboard dynamic vehicle flight control autopilot and sensorfusion navigation gust is mature technology with  years of research and operational experience and continues to be improved and expanded by georgia tech and drone aviation ground control station gcs the raptor gcs is unique in the industry developed by dac for use in tethered systems the gcs is uncluttered by removing confusing settings and options vehicle tuning and informational windows not required for tethered systems further the raptor gcs operating system is separate from the operator’s tablet pc phone or other display and input device this abstraction layer allows the vehicle to be monitored by a central site and operated with many different types of devices locally over a secure wifi or wired ethernetfiber optic link kevlar armored tether the dac tether system is an armored smart leash that provides uninterruptible power and unhackable communications to the watt uas and wasp aerostat while this concept appears simple dac’s proprietary tether technology is a key differentiator and enabler for longduration safe unmanned flight advantages tetherbased systems for aerial platforms deliver a number of advantages fly more reliably and safely than freeflying unmanned aircraft unlimited flight duration from groundbased power transmit power video and other data vehicle control securely through kevlar armored tether no signal to hack tension control winch system a critical part of the watt ground support equipment the tension control winch maintains consistent tether alignment with the watt aerial vehicle as the vehicle ascends or descends the winch system rapidly adjusts when in loiter or mobility modes the tension control monitoring and adjustment system measures tether line tension hundreds of times per second read more small adjustments are made to ensure the tether does not become slack or pull on the aerial vehicle the system is fully automatic compensating for both drone operation and environmental conditions managed tension avoids slack or whipping of the tether in winds or vehicle flight changes which can result in the tether wrapping around nearby obstructions further the vehicle is more stable when the tether tension is actively managed as the tether is not inconsistently pulling on the vehicle advantages more stable vehicle flight resulting in better video and higher accuracy stationkeeping safer operation especially in windy conditions or mobile operations winch is designed to allow safe recovery of aerial vehicle accessible mobile reliable about drone aviation was formed in april  from the acquisition of lighter than air systems corp ltas founded in  the development of tethered drones started with ltas in late  as a potential aerostat system replacement drone aviation corp dac is focused on global agencies and organizations in the commercial military research and law enforcement sectors customers include the us army us marines us navy us epa nrel kingdom of saudi arabia ecuadorian air force many us research universities and us law enforcement agencies taming altitude is drone aviation’s approach to unmanned systems design manufacturing and flight operations combining engineering human factorsbased design software and safety systems to provide a reliable easy to deploy system dac’s goal is to lead the uas industry from the equivalent of the pioneering days of manned flight to the daily airline operations of modern times drone aviation’s technology and uas solutions are based on manned system aeronautical engineering and licensed pilot training and experience further through our experience manufacturing and supporting systems in use by the dod drone aviation will help the industry mature for wider use in the national air space   why are we unique people processes technology and products people the dac team has a broad range of skill sets and experience from scientists to engineers to former military personnel they are our strength source of innovation and make drone aviation a worldclass uas company processes drone aviation is built on an organization ltas corp that has  years of experience engineering manufacturing and supporting aerostat systems in the field systems that are missioncritical to us army soldiers and us marines for communications and force protection dac has internal systems and processes such as change management engineering test and evaluation separation of development test and production software environments departmental structures specific to production rd engineering documentation and support drone aviation’s processes and procedures are what you need and expect in a technology partner that provides uas systems startups and new entrants to the industry may not have the maturity to support your mission technology drone aviation is leading the uas community in numerous unmanned technologies onboard power systems weighing less than  lbs yet delivering  amps of current automatic tether tension control system armored tether data over the same two wires carrying the power simplified ground control station highlystabilized allweather dual sensor isr payloads with human detection ranges of km all incorporated into a lowcost and highly reliable system products dac products range from aerostats to tethered uas systems with technical commonality across most subsystems this approach provides a logistically light
