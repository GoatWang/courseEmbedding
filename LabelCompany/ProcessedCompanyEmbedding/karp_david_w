himself to code and dropped out of high school now karp runs his company his wayand refuses to keep a schedule by liz welch liz welch is a national magazine awardwinning journalist who has written for the new york times real simple glamour and inc among other publications she is the coauthor with her siblings of the recent book the kids are all right a highly regarded memoir of her childhood lizmwelch coauthor the kids are all right lizmwelch  comments enjoying the ride david karp often commutes to the office on his vespa credit michael lewis michael lewis away from the computer tumblr lets users share their thoughts online but karp prefers to jot his ideas for the company on paper in  when others his age were studying for midterms and living on dorm food david karp was busy launching tumblr an easytouse blogging platform that now hosts  million blogs and receives about  billion page views per week the company has also attracted some  million in venture funding karp  is used to doing his own thing at  he taught himself how to write code at  he dropped out of high school a year later he got a job as cto of urbanbaby a new york city parenting site at tumblr karp likes to spend his time sketching ideas in notebooks lunching as a group with his  employees and of course perusing blogs on tumblr one thing he doesnt like is being pinned down that quickly becomes clear if you try to make an appointment with him or happen to spot him zipping around new york city on his vespa im very antischedule except for board meetings i dont really schedule things or keep a calendar i think appointments are caustic to creativity its so frustrating when youre in the middle of a great conversation or work groove and you realize oh ive got an appointment ive got to bolt i prefer the lets just call each other when we need something or want to hang out approach that way i never have to cancel on people which is always a bummer people tell me i need an assistant but i dont want one i live in manhattan about  minutes from my office in the morning i usually walk to work or take my vespa i got it in october and i love it ive always wanted a motorcycle and i thought a vespa was a good first step its a lot cheaper than cabs for getting around the city it costs  to fill it up and a tank of gas lasts all week i try hard not to check emails until i get to the office which is usually between  and  am reading emails at home never feels good or productive if something urgently needs my attention someone will call or text me i used to suck at email id let emails pile up get overwhelmed and miss important messagesor forget to reply so i set up filters on my email and thats been working pretty well now my inbox gets emails only from people in my company and from my girlfriend a folder called robots gets anything not written by a human like bank statements and google alerts most everything else goes into the unsorted folder when i get to the office i go through my inbox first and try to respond right away then i go through my unsorted folder but i respond to very few of those ive found that if youre not responsive to email it trains people to leave you alone as i go through my email i make a list of things that i need to do that day in my notebook i have a bad memory so ive become a thorough note taker i use action method notebooks from a company called behance they are really beautiful the pages have rows of dots instead of lines i ordered a bunch for our team i always write with a pilot precise v pen its inky but doesnt smudge in addition to todo lists i also use the notebooks to sketch out ideas for new features on tumblr the notebooks are big so it takes me four to six months to fill one up i keep all of the old ones in a drawer every monday morning we have an allteam meeting in our conference room a place i designed to be quiet and cozy there are no conference tablesjust a couch and a few comfortable chairs our customer support team a group of eight people in virginia attends via skype i started holding these meetings in january as a way for everyone to get up to speed on what everyone else is doing the first few meetings were pretty awkward i tend to get excited and ramble on so ive been trying to go around the room and have everyone else talk about the projects theyre working on i still probably talk too much our office is a big open loft space and im right in the middle the engineers who run the site are clustered on one side of me and the community outreach teamthe company evangelists who interact with our usersis on the other side people are really quiet and respectful of one another i use headphones if i listen to music we mostly use email to communicate i love email because it doesnt interrupt anyone the fewer distractions the better i have two screens on my desk the first is a inch mac monitor i always have tumblr open in the web browser the second is a vertical screen which i use only for writing code you can turn most dell or hewlettpackard monitors sideways a trick i learned from marco arment who used to be tumblrs lead developer i like using two screens because if you do everything on the same monitor you end up constantly flipping back and forth between programs which is distracting a lot of our engineers have the same setup now im on tumblr all day i dont follow a ton of people but i post and reblog stuff i really care about i love my blog i get most of my news from my tumblr dashboard i used to be a hour news consumer but so much of the reporting is bad these days i find tech reporting incredibly tedious and dull and ive kind of given up on reading anything that anyone writes about tumblr its often inaccurate i used to spend all day coding but that changed when we hired engineers who were a lot smarter than me i still jump in to help code as needed the engineers have scrums every day occasionally ill sit in on their meetings to get a sense of whats going on and see if i can help with anything im really good at asking questions about edge cases or unusual scenarios so when our engineers are describing a new way to build something ill ask what if its in a different language or will it get totally messed up if that button has to be a different dimension basically what part of this arent we thinking about we roll out changes to the site every day at  am we stagger out small changes so we can see what works and what doesnt we chose that time because we want engineers around if theres an issue plus its early enough that theres not much traffic basically everything that was finished the day before gets pushed the next morning it could be a bug fix or a new language filesay a feature that was translated into french or it could be a new feature thats dark launchedthe public cant see it but we have the ability to test it after we launch a new feature i keep a close eye on how many people are using it if its unpopular well discontinue it and try something else every feature has some maintenance cost and having fewer features lets us focus on the ones we care about and make sure they work very well for every new feature we add we take an old one out a lot of big sites dont do that and its a problem twitter started as a beautifully simple product but its now going the same route as facebook the drive to innovate can overencumber and destroy a product my goal is to keep tumblr very focused theres kind of a hive mentality at the office we all break for lunch between  and  usually one person gets up and the rest follow we all cram into the elevator once we hit the street we break off into two or three groups and go get food to bring back to the office then we all eat together i always carry my camera with me in january i bought my dream camera a leica m its the smallest digital camera they make with a full sensor i post lots of photos on my blog and i actually took most of the tumblr employee photos i dont do much of the hiring anymore each department is in charge of hiring its own members i like autonomous people i want people who can take a project and figure out how to do it themselves i dont really care about how things get done only that they get done lately ive been focused on our community outreach teamits responsible for figuring out how to connect with and promote the people who use tumblr i recently brought in my friend richard tong to be our fashion editor he started weardrobe a fashion website that is now owned by google about  percent of our blogs are fashion related and he focuses on reaching out to that demographic as a result tumblr had a huge presence at new yorks fashion week i meet with the community team at least once a week to brainstorm about ways we can connect with users like sponsoring a literary event or organizing meetups for tumblr users around the world i love that part of my job usually around  pm i need a pickmeup a handful of us will pop out for tea at a place around the corner i either order an iced tea or an armenian mint tea i used to drink coffee but it messes me upi have a very fast metabolism so i go from drowsy to unbearably hyper tea has just the right amount of caffeine in the afternoons i usually want to bury my head in some projecteither screwing around with design or coding something recently i took a stab at redesigning our photo sets feature which lets users post several photos together like a slide show i may spend a couple of hours scraping together my thoughts before sending an idea out to the product team to get their take on it one or two nights a week i usually work lateuntil  or  when i do i like to see who is still in the office and then take them out for dinner as a way to say thank you we are surrounded by great restaurants so we go somewhere nice i rarely work on weekends unless theres a serious database or infrastructure emergency the company is growing fast and weve had some problems scaling any time we add capacity it immediately fills up in december the site was down for an entire day it happened on a sundaythere was a whole lot of scrambling to figure out what broke everything about it sucked one of my favorite things to do on the weekend is take road trips i just joined the classic car club in manhattan you pay an annual fee which gives you access to all these cool cars my girlfriend and i took a  porsche  carrera s up to montreal one weekend it was amazing weve also taken trips to boston and maine other times well jump on the vespa and drive around the city we might have brunch at our favorite place in the east village then pop over to see friends in brooklyn before heading back up to union square to see a movie i spend a lot of time with people who work at tumblr but i make a very poor effort to hang out with other people in my life im trying to do a better job of that but honestly i love quiet nights at home my girlfriend is a spectacular chef she usually cooks dinner for us two or three nights out of the week and then we wind down by watching tv we use apple tv to watch television shows from itunes we both love futurama i recently got her into top gear a car show on the bbc sleep is precious to me im very disappointed if i dont go to bed before midnight we have a rule no laptops in the bedroom being on computers all the time makes me feel gross check out incs

macbook tumblrs plan to reach owner company yahoo ceos marissa mayers vision of becoming a business with  million in revenue by next year isnt to take on other internet giants like facebook and twitter for advertising money instead the blogging platform wants to steal ad money from tv broadcasters and newspaper and magazine publishers tumblr ceo david karp told the financial times tumblr is on a mission to prove to advertisers that it is the best platform for aspirational marketing campaigns which are typically placed on tv or in premium glossy magazines the financial times report suggests tumblr doesn’t just want to be speaking to the digital agencies it wants to be forming partnerships with the top creatives and marketers behind bigbrand super bowl ads karp told ft that while the rest of the industry was focused on direct response advertising — when consumers are likely to be on the lookout for one particular product and are served with a buy me now ad — and narrow targeting that uses data to show ads based on very strict sets of criteria tumblr offers advertisers a broader base of interests that is why he thinks tumblr is the best place for brand marketing campaigns online he said in the interview the whole industry is obsessed with harvesting intent when if you look at the biggest brands they want to create intent to get people to aspire to wear the clothes drive the car drink the soda right now there arent a lot of pleas in any of these digital networks which inspire people to become a customer … which they used to do with great tv and print campaigns the general message to big brands and agencies from silicon valley and all the digital networks is leave the creative people at home show up with the data scientists we want them to show up with the guys putting together the super bowl ads one of the advantages of tumblr over facebook or twitter karp says is that people come to tumblr with the intent to consume content rather than to communicate with their friends so in that way the sites sponsored posts radar posts and trending blogs ad formats are not a jarring surprise that take you away from your very personal place karp added yahoo acquired tumblr for  billion last year however many observers have criticized the move as the acquisition does not appear to be immediately paying off however in yahoos latest earnings call mayer said tumblr was likely to report its first profit before interest tax depreciation or amortization — otherwise known as ebitda by the end of  mayer on tuesday said in announcing yahoo’s  million acquisition of the video adtech platform brightroll that tumblr was on track to generate more than  million in revenue next year  business insider’s nicholas carson revealed last month that yahoo was planning to use brightroll to turn tumblr into a video site to rival the likes of youtube  youtube has also recently confirmed it is coming after tv’s money by putting more effort into mimicking
