was injected did not show any signs of inflammation nor foreign body inflammatory response based on these findings it is concluded that the included subjects did not show signs of hypersensitivity to the rpc purecollagen injections both the physicians and subjects noted a market improvement that was maintained throughout the study period no adverse events were reported during the study period the

httpmizzoumagmissourieduskinnovation five years ago sheila grant helped found a company it felt strange as a professor in the department of biological engineering a dual program between the college of agriculture food and natural resources cafnr and the college of engineering her job and aspirations had always been institutional perform well in teaching and research earn tenure and publish in important journals jumping into a startup was a sweatypalm moment but she wasn’t on her own she had promising lab research behind her a host of mizzou programs to support her and a team of collaborators to bring with her five years in her company has raised  million from investors and is about to launch a product that could revolutionize the multibilliondollar aesthetic medicine market beauty is skin deep tenstam lundvall’s biggest claim to fame is bringing hyaluronic acid to america — the beauty medicine equivalent of introducing the ipod the product is delivered by syringe into the face to give a quick boost of volume which smoothes deep lines and wrinkles and makes skin look younger the procedure takes a few minutes to perform and the effects last an average of six to  months americans are enamored they injected their faces with it  million times in  making hyaluronic acid the second most popular aesthetic medicine procedure to botox but it’s no substitute for collagen hyaluronic acid is naturally produced in the body and is found in the extracellular matrix that skin cells sit on but unlike collagen which makes up 7 to  percent of skin by dry weight it is not a structural component of the skin itself the loss of collagen as we age contributes to the condition dermal fillers are trying to correct skin that has lost elasticity volume and developed wrinkles hyaluronic acid inflates the skin with moisture but the skin soon deflates whereas collagen is a natural scaffold for the skin that actually helps rebuild it but collagen is difficult to work with simply injecting it into the skin is not enough in its natural state injected collagen would be quickly broken down by collagenase a natural enzyme found in the body so what companies have done — and this treatment is only available in europe — is to “crosslink” it collagen is composed of three peptide chains wrapped around one another in a triplehelix pattern linking multiple chains together extends collagen’s life but it also causes it to bunch up making it more likely that the body will treat it as a foreign object typical treatments last three to six months   contact information please
