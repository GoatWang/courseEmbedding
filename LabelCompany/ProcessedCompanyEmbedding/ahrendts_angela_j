tuesday may     pm · reply ahrendts hasnt done a thing to improve apple stores that a handful of preppy overprivileged kids wouldnt have figured out but then one would have to consider blue t shirts and clueless employees with zero technical skills to be an improvement over how apple stores used to be my last several experiences have been slow multiple handoff situations where nobody at apple was able to solve the issue their one solution to everything is to flatten and reload the os as if everyone wanted to trust their data to the effing icloud all the overblown bs about fashion and design from atendts and ive bores me granted i don’t live next to one of apples huge architertural statement stores but it has been a long time since i have found an apple store to be a comfortable place to hang out they are not warm welcoming places they are sterile cold flat and lifeless like ios  goeb wednesday may     pm · reply i agree and you certainly are a realist … goeb tuesday may     pm ·

tomintulsa tuesday may     pm · reply are you kidding she is clearly the heir apparent she’s the only one on the team that has been a ceo before she is a proven leader she has over seen the renewal and redesigns of many of the stores this sale was probably just taxes as mdn suggest or her financial planner suggested she diversify some of her holdings we will be seeing a lot more of her in the

fool lets go of enough money to buy crete and copperplate it and scott is no fool but rather a tactician like macarthur who waits for the moment and the resources to strike back effectively granted either man allowed autonomy might have risked war and induced casualties some would however argue that truman’s and cook’s bland and indifferent leadership were equally destructive in strategic or moral terms goeb wednesday may     pm · reply well said fingers crossed scott herself wednesday may     pm · reply i meant noncompete not nda scott is a brilliant software engineer and i am appalled

ever be stylish that is the question that former burberry boss angela ahrendts alongside apple’s burgeoning team of fashion and design talent has been brought in to answer as the company launched its first piece of wearable technology – the apple watch and despite ahrendts being absent from the stage at the flint center for the performing arts today the apple watch collection bears the unmistakable imprimatur of the company’s new head of retail “we set out to make the best watch in the world” said tim cook apple’s ceo before finally revealing the tech world’s worst kept secret the apple watch “we’ve been working incredibly hard for a long time on an entirely new product and we believe this product will redefine what people expect from its category” the launch of three distinct collections – apple watch sport and apple watch edition – mimicked the traditions of a fashion brand with each collection aimed at a different demographic with the latter clearly designed to capture the luxury fashion customer wilson rothman wjrothman three apple watch collections  standard sport and k gold apple watch edition liveblog httptcowomvqaxkob pictwittercomalscxwg september   jony ive apple’s vicepresident of design has overseen a range of watches that boast numerous digital functions including sensory touch interfacing and “a rotary dial that translate into data” a scroll button but the emphasis was also on a watch that “is as much about technology as it is style and taste” by creating a collection in stores spring  that features entry point watches at  £ alongside the sleekly designed – and almost certainly more expensive – apple watch edition devices which resemble highend luxury jewellery apple’s design team has succeeded in overseeing a product whose aesthetic meets the standards of its technology “apple is treating wearable technology the way that a fashion house treats an accessories line” said ben thompson editor of statcherycom “they have always created fashionable products but where they found the biggest success was personal devices “if you look at the way handbags have become statement items and your choice of handbag tells the world something about who you are i suspect that apple will be going this way with the wearables they’ll begin with two prototype products and later there will more options to follow and the hope is to create something that becomes as successful as the luxury handbag market” facebook twitter pinterest the new apple watch photograph monica daveyepa apple products have never been short on style but today’s event saw a heavy focus on fashion that began in the same week the company announced that acclaimed designer marc newson will be joining a team that already includes musa tariq formerly of nike and paul deneve previously chief executive of yves saint laurent for the apple watch launch launch anita borzyszkowska a fashion industry pr heavyweight was hired by apple to recruit a wide range of fashion journalists and alexandra shulman editor of british vogue was among the guests alexandra shulman ashulman cupertino the centre of attention for the applelive event in  hours im looking forward to a lifechanging watch britishvogue september   “ahrendts is a talented executive” says lauren indvik a former tech writer who currently edits fashionistacom “when she started at burberry her own executives weren’t even wearing burberry it was a ‘has been’ – a waning brand she left it positioned as a strong heritage brand that was also a digital pioneer and cool and covetable because of that she also transformed burberry from a wholesaler to a direct retail business and grew the business substantially in china – all of which align with apple’s own goals pretty neatly” facebook twitter

during her eight years at the helm of british fashion’s most established heritage brand ahrendts helped implement a digital strategy that revived burberry’s image as both youthful and international at

meeting after ahrendts took the helm she noticed that not one of them was wearing a burberry trench coat despite the damp gray weather it was a sign of the challenges the company faced even in a burgeoning global market burberry was growing at only  a year it had lost focus in the process of global expansion each of the  licensees around the world was doing something different ubiquity was robbing the brand of its luster ahrendts realized that if burberry was going to be a great pure global luxury brand it needed to have one design director—a “brand czar”—and it needed to capitalize on its historical core the trench coat the company decided to innovate at the core to attract the luxury customers of the future millennials photography getty images the idea before angela ahrendts became burberry’s ceo licensing threatened to destroy the brand’s unique strengths the answer centralize design and focus on innovating core heritage products when i became the ceo of burberry in july  luxury was one of the fastestgrowing sectors in the world with its rich history centered on trench coats that were recognized around the world the burberry brand should have had many advantages but as i watched my top managers arrive for our first strategic planning meeting something struck me right away they had flown in from around the world to classic british weather gray and damp but not one of these more than  people was wearing a burberry trench coat i doubt that many of them even owned one if our top people weren’t buying our products despite the great discount they could get how could we expect customers to pay full price for them it was a sign of the challenges we faced even in a burgeoning global market burberry was growing at only  a year the company had an excellent foundation but it had lost its focus in the process of global expansion we had  licensees around the world each doing something different we were selling products such as dog coverups and leashes one of our highestprofile stores on bond street in london had a whole section of kilts there’s nothing wrong with any of those products individually but together they added up to just a lot of stuff—something for everybody but not much of it exclusive or compelling in luxury ubiquity will kill you—it means you’re not really luxury anymore and we were becoming ubiquitous burberry needed to be more than a beloved old british company it had to develop into a great global luxury brand while competing against much larger rivals among luxury players louis vuitton moët hennessy lvmh had almost  times—and pinaultprintempsredoute ppr more than  times—burberry’s revenue we wanted a share of the disposable income of the world’s most elite buyers—and to win it we’d have to fight for prime real estate in the world’s most rapidly growing consumer markets in many ways it felt like a davidandgoliath battle one “brand czar” on the surface i might have seemed an unlikely ceo for a company that was considered quintessentially british i was raised in a small town in indiana and educated at ball state university i was a classic midwesterner—something the financial times had fun mocking when i first took the job but i’d been fortunate enough to work with and learn from some of the most inspirational leaders in the fashion industry from paul charron to donna karan and i had  years of experience on my side i also clearly had one attribute that made me a good fit i admire and respect great brands and helped to build some over the years from apple to starbucks i love the consistency—knowing that anywhere in the world you can depend on having the same experience in the store or being served a latte with the same taste and in the same cup that’s great branding unfortunately burberry didn’t have a lot of that an experience in any given burberry store in the world might be very different from the customer’s previous one as part of my transition i spent six months working closely with my predecessor hitting the road to get a sense of burberry worldwide in hong kong i was introduced to a design director and her team who proudly showed me the line they were creating for that market polo shirts and woven shirts and everything with the famous burberry check but not a single coat then we went to america where i was introduced to another design director and design team this team was creating outerwear but at half the price point of that in the uk furthermore the coats were being manufactured in new jersey so we were making classic burberry raincoats that said “made in the usa” i later learned that we had outerwear licensees in italy and germany making trench coats that were even cheaper than those in the united states great global brands don’t have people all over the world designing and producing all kinds of stuff it became quite clear that if burberry was going to be a great pure global luxury brand we had to have one global design director we had an incredible young designer named christopher bailey with whom i’d worked at donna karan and who i knew was a sensational talent so i introduced him early on as the “brand czar” i told the team “anything that the consumer sees—anywhere in the world—will go through his office no exceptions” within a year we had let the entire hong kong design team go and had brought some of the us outerwear team to the uk where we centralized all our design under christopher we closed the new jersey factory—along with one in wales that was making polo shirts—and began investing in our castleford facility in yorkshire which makes our heritage rainwear closing the welsh factory caused a political firestorm—i was even called to testify before parliament alongside burberry’s highly respected chairman—but we stood behind our decision as a company we always do what’s best for the brand because our job is to protect it and keep it powerful and relevant if we do that even if it involves closing a factory with  employees many more jobs will be created in time we’ve doubled the head count at castleford since then and almost tripled our global workforce to nearly  adding more than  jobs in the uk over the past two years alone sticking to the core burberry is  years old its coats were worn in the trenches of world war i by british soldiers and for decades thereafter they were so much a part of british culture that the company earned a royal warrant making it an official supplier to the royal family sir ernest shackleton wore a burberry during his antarctic expedition movie legends wore them on the silver screen for more than a century the burberry trench coat was cool but when i became ceo outerwear represented only about  of our global brand business fashion apparel and check accessories were leading our strategy the more we examined the situation the clearer it became that this wasn’t consistent with our luxury vision it’s not unusual for a luxury company to be born from a single product and then diversify louis vuitton began with luggage and gucci with leather goods but even as they diversified each continued to earn the majority of its revenue from its original core products surveying the industry we realized that burberry was the only iconic luxury company that wasn’t capitalizing on its historical core we weren’t proud of it we weren’t innovating around it furthermore we were almost ignoring some of our strongest assets our weaving facility in yorkshire produced the exclusive waterproof gabardine on which the company was founded thomas burberry had created this fabric and the trench coat design for those early military and exploration commissions the weaving facility was near the castleford trench coat factory in the north of england—fortunately we hadn’t resorted to outsourcing in faraway places what could be better than an authentic heritage brand with a great vertical supply chain but we weren’t investing in it we weren’t optimizing it after brainstorming and formalizing our instincts we commissioned a consulting firm to provide us with competitor benchmarking our instincts confirmed we clearly saw the way forward we would reinforce our heritage our britishness by emphasizing and growing our core luxury products innovating them and keeping them at the heart of everything we did i have to admit that some managers were cynical a lot of them had been at burberry for a really long time i’m sure they left saying “focusing on trench coats—that’s our strategy” but most of us were confident that it was the right plan the ethos of the trench the decision to focus on our heritage opened up a wealth of creativity christopher and the designers and marketers all started dreaming up ways to reinforce the idea that everything we did—from our runway shows to our stores—should start with the ethos of the trench at the same time we had to shift burberry’s historical corporate structure to reflect this new purer point of view we had great people but we were organized like a department store we had a person over each men’s category and a person over each women’s category they made decisions that worked for their departments but might not make sense for the whole business we needed to change to focus on the big picture the brand in addition to putting christopher in charge of all design we had to hire functional expertise—a head of corporate resources a head of planning and a chief supply chain officer it was all pretty basic but necessary if we were to reach our goals to strengthen our retail operation we decided to focus on markets where our competitors already had a presence signaling the right kind of consumers to support a luxury brand as our first blueprint for expansion we identified every market in the world where two of our peers had stores and we had none in the past six years we’ve opened  new stores and we’ve refocused our retailing staff on outerwear trench coats are among the most expensive items we sell many of them are priced over  but the staff was least equipped to sell them our salespeople had become accustomed to selling what was easy—relatively inexpensive items such as polo shirts on commission they’d be better off selling one trench coat than  polo shirts they understood the math but they needed tools to fully appreciate and communicate why the trench was the best investment for their customers we established strong sales and service programs to put product education front and center we created videos to demonstrate burberry craftsmanship all the collars are handrolled and handstitched we equipped our sales associates with ipads and our stores with audiovisual technology to show these videos to best effect we knew that beautiful compelling content would connect customers to the brand and our iconic trench we also began to shift our marketing efforts from targeting everyone everywhere to focusing on the luxury customers of the future millennials we believed that these customers were being ignored by our competitors this was our white space the decision was not without controversy we were choosing to aim squarely at a generation that had no current knowledge of burberry’s core product the effort had to be led by design—we needed to create outerwear that was innovative cool and so inviting that people would become repeat customers burberry used to have just a few basic styles of trench coats almost all were beige with the signature check lining and the differences between them were minor now we have more than  skus from capes and cropped jackets to the classic burberry trench in a range of vibrant colors and styles with everything from mink collars and alligator epaulets to studded leather sleeves we had to infuse the new lines with our heritage we also had to rethink our entire marketing approach for these customers—to make it digital when we began we had a few regional websites so we consolidated them and redesigned everything on one platform it showcases every facet of the brand it has become the hub of all our marketing and branding and a trench coat is always one of the first things you see when you go online the site is designed to speak to that millennial consumer through emotive brand content music movies heritage storytelling and we understand how critical it is more people visit our platform every week than walk into all our stores combined and the majority of our employees at corporate headquarters in london are under  they understand who we are trying to reach now every major new initiative has the trench coat front and center in  it was the inspiration for our first social media platform artofthetrenchcom celebrating the iconic trench and the people who wear it the site has had more than  million visitors to date last year when we took our first step into customization it was never in question that we would launch with the iconic trench burberry bespoke went live on burberrycom offering some  million possible styles and we are now introducing it in our physical stores in london and chicago and as we take direct control of our fragrance and beauty business next year we will fully leverage the trench—as we did so successfully in the launch of burberry body perfume rewards of the transformation in a way we’re right back to our roots i always remind employees that we didn’t found the company thomas burberry did—at the age of  he was young he was innovative we say that his spirit lives on and that it’s this generation’s job to keep his legacy going the company transformation paid off today  of our business is apparel and outerwear makes up more than half of that at the end of fiscal  burberry’s revenues and operating income had doubled over the previous five years to  billion and  million respectively that’s not to say it has all been smooth sailing getting burberry back on track took years of hard work and we’re still navigating tricky waters in a cyclical global luxury market in september  we took the unusual step of issuing a sales update ahead of our quarterly earnings report we were seeing a slowdown in traffic globally a few weeks later with better insight into the numbers we were able to report that although traffic was down the quality of our sales was actually improving we were realizing higher transaction values better conversion rates and greater demand for our more elevated prorsum and london lines so although the aspirational customers at entry price points are behaving more cautiously the brand is resonating ever more strongly with our core luxury audience we’ve always said we’re not immune to the ebb and flow of the macroeconomy but that doesn’t change our vision we have absolute clarity about—and commitment to—our proven strategies which gives us confidence for the long term that’s how we run our business and how a great global brand is created in  burberry was named the fourth fastestgrowing brand globally by both interbrand behind apple google and amazon and wppbrandz behind facebook baidu and wells fargo in  it was the fastestgrowing luxury brand on interbrand’s index that’s beyond what we imagined was possible back in that strategy meeting in  today it’s taken for granted inside the company that the trench coat must remain our most exciting most iconic product it guides all our decisions our sales associates understand it this product is who we are that is evident when i observe what our employees wear to work if you ask a burberry senior executive how many trench coats he or she owns the answer is likely to be eight or nine everyone has a packable version everyone has a white one everyone has an evening one we have all different lengths as for me i don’t have an exact count but i can safely confess to owning a dozen they’re not just raincoats anymore they are the foundation of a great brand and a great company a version of this article appeared

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a
