huntington national bank premier savings account comment follow share comment yesusefulno  by cassiekay i had been using a few other local banks for my savings accounts over the years but when problems continued to arise i knew it was time for a switch my family recommended huntington national bank for my checking and savings accounts because of their local regional base but with a more personalized customer service style i couldnt be happier this savings account has a low minimum balance low enough for someone young starting out like me but high enough to give me an incentive to keep saving with no withdrawal fees and an easy link to my checking account at a low balance like this the interest rates dont really matter so much but if i had a higher investment i would use huntingtons money market account the best part of being with huntington national bank is absolutely the customer service which is so friendly and the best and most personalized to fit my needs than any other local bank out there i would recommend this savings account to my friends out there who want a savings account with a realistic minimum balance to avoid the small but easily avoidable monthly account fee… read more march   · flag product the huntington national bank premier savings account comment follow share comment yesusefulno  by briancraig ive had checking and savings accounts with other banks most of them much bigger than huntington i opened my savings account the same day i opened my checking account and im happy i made that decision the savings account has about the same interest rate as other larger banks if not a little lower than average but its much nicer than putting cash which can be easily stolen in an envelope huntington also doesnt have any fees for their

credit union i was happy with the credit union because they didnt charge me fees to keep the account open or fees for being inactive but the disadvantage was that the credit union wasnt available to me everywhere it only had a few branches somewhat far away from where i lived i went to huntington and ive been so happy with it there is no minimum balance to have the savings account open which is wonderful there are huntington branches everywhere and they are so helpful when you approach the tellers with questions they even have it set up that my checking draws from my saving in the case of an overdraft i would highly recommend stopping in your local branch and checking it out its definitely a safe place to keep your money… read more april   · flag product the huntington national bank

comment follow share comment yesusefulno  by jentrivini i went to huntington bank to open a checking account but for reasons not entirely clear to me huntington requires you to open a joint savings account whenever you open a checking one since it didnt cost anything or have a minimum balance requirement i pretty much just put the savings account in the back of my mind intending to use the checking instead not long after signing up in person i received a pack of personalized deposit slips in the mail which were meant for use with the savings account i had not asked for these so i figured they were just something the account came with standardunfortunately i received an email the same week telling me my savings account was overdrawn  and had accrued a  nsf charge i immediately called huntington told them about the email and explained i had never used the savings account they looked it up and it was determined that i had somehow been charged for the slips but they promised to take off the charge for them and the nsf three weeks later it hadnt been taken care of and because the checking account i opened was connected to the savings account the bank decided to take money out of my checking to cover the charges in my savings i was totally flabbergasted by this and could not believe they could do that without asking they promised to remedy the issue but of course with banks that can take ages when i inquired about the legality of them taking from the checking to cover the savings they told me that it was a “perk” for customers to keep them from overdrafting and apparently it was in the fine print it took another  weeks for the whole debacle to be fixed and for me to recoup the money they took from my checking this alone was a huge red flag and whats worse the bank manager and one of the other tellers there were incredibly rude and unprofessional every time i called to try to have the issue fixed they promised to do it immediately but when i would call back bc they never did they would backpedal and say that they would never tell me that it would be done immediately bc its normally a  day thing  days to fix their mistakei cant speak for any other branches but the north ridgeville one is terrible they have one female teller who is incredibly nice but shes not always there so ultimately i opened a checking and savings with another bank and never looked back i definitely would not recommend them but if you do go with them make sure you stay on top of your accounts and i would strongly recommend not putting all your money in their accounts alone let something like this happen again… read more november   · flag product savings  cds comment follow share comment yesusefulno  by kights huntington was my first bank and is still my only bank i have both a checking and savings account with them the only problem that i have really run into thus far is that they only let me transfer to and from my savings account  times a month while this might not be a problem for a lot of you for me it was pretty much a deal breaker so they ended up forcefully converting my savings account into my checking account they refused to let me have a savings account that i could transfer into and that really got on my nerves so needless to say i now only have one checking account and it runs pretty smoothly i have weekly deposits and can withdraw
