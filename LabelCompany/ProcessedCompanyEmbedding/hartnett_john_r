products sign in or create an account search cart  menu cart  frequently asked questions do you have spare parts for the  ton  yes as we design and produce these machines we carry a full set of spare parts so if you need anything in the future just give us a call and we can post them to you  you can also call to our workshop with your machine and we can carry out servicing or any necessary repairs – please phone ahead to book in a time how much does delivery cost and how long does it take delivery nationwide is €  because of the weight of the machine it will arrive on a pallet  delivery normally takes  days is the  ton easy to use yes anyone can use the  ton log splitter  for safety it has a hand operating system so you push a button with one hand and push a handle with the other hand and the machine does the rest  this keeps your hands away from the axe and therefore out of danger can it break any log the  ton machine has its limits  it is fine for domestic use  it is perfect for splitting soft woods and can manage some clean hardwoods ie no knots  if your logs are very well seasoned and have been there for while then the  ton may struggle to break them  if you have a mix of varieties and have the budget then we would recommend going for one of our vertical machines  you are welcome to bring some sample logs to test out our full range of log splitters what is the difference between the horizontal and vertical machines apart from the fact that a vertical machine is more heavy duty due to its design it is easier to split logs with a vertical machine  this is mainly because you can place the log on the workplate and chop the log into sections just like cutting a cake and it stays in the one place  whereas when operating the horizontal machine the split log falls to the ground and you must bend down and pick it back up again if you want to split it again  having said that the  ton due to its economical pricing is very popular  in my opinion if you have a good supply of your own trees they will grow in many shapes types and forms and the wind decides which one is next for splitting then the vertical machine will cope with all types and shapes that you can present to it  the vertical machine offers much better precision cutting on knotty timber  what kind of oil does the  ton need it takes hydraulic  or hydraulic  oil  the log splitter already has oil in it when you buy it  an oil change is recommended after  hours work  you can buy this replacement oil on our website  does the  ton work with a regular domestic power plug and socket yes the  ton has a regular amp  pin plug that you use with any domestic appliance   do you offer a warranty with your  ton log splitter yes we offer a  month warranty with all of our products  and that is a genuine warranty  if in the unlikely event that you have a problem with your log splitter we will be able to get it sorted for you – that is our promise we’ve designed these machines and know how they work inside out  there are some stores selling log splitters that have no expertise at all when it comes to how the machines actually work  when you encounter a problem all they can do is offer you your money back – leaving you without what you need – a log splitter can i bring a log to your showroom and test out your log splitter yes you are welcome to bring sample logs and test out all of the log splitter models  we can then best advise you on what machine will suit you and your timber  vertical log splitters what’s the main difference between your  ton and  ton models besides the fact that there is a  ton difference in the splitting force the  ton is a taller machine  for a tall person the  ton is a more comfortable machine to use as the arms are  inches higher than the  ton arms  do you have spare parts for the vertical log splitters yes as we design and produce these machines we carry a full set of spare parts so if you need anything in the future just give us a call and we can post them to you  you can also call to our workshop with your machine and we can carry out servicing or any necessary repairs – please phone ahead to book in a time how much does delivery cost and how long does it take delivery nationwide is €  because of the weight of the machine it will arrive on a pallet  delivery normally takes  days are the vertical log splitters easy to use yes anyone can use the our vertical log splitters  for safety it has a hand operating system  this keeps your hands away from the axe and therefore out of danger can your log splitters break any log every log splitter has its limits  that is why there are     and  ton log splitters  it depends on the type of wood you have and the size of the logs  however our vertical models are very impressive  if you have mostly softwoods but and do a good bit of splitting then for comfort we would go for the  ton rather than the  ton  you’re upright when using and it will be a long term investment  so is worth the extra few bob  if your logs are mostly hardwoods then we would recommend moving up to the   and  ton models  you are welcome to bring some sample logs to test out our full range of log splitters what is the difference between the horizontal and vertical machines apart from the fact that a vertical machine is more heavy duty due to its design it is easier to split logs with a vertical machine  this is mainly because you can place the log on the workplate and chop the log into sections just like cutting a cake and it stays in the one place  whereas when operating the horizontal machine the split log falls to the ground and you must bend down and pick it back up again if you want to split it again  having said that the  ton due to its economical pricing is very popular  in my opinion if you have a good supply of your own trees then you will have many shapes species and densities of log and it is the wind that usually decides which one is next for splitting  in this case our vertical machines will cope with all types and odd shapes that you can present to it  the vertical machine offers much better precision cutting on knotty timber what kind of oil does vertical log splitter need it takes hydraulic  or hydraulic  oil  the log splitter already has oil in it when you buy it  an oil change is recommended after  hours work  you can buy this replacement oil on our website what kind of power supply does the vertical log splitter need the max axe  ton is a single phase machine v – hz  it comes with a circular blue amp plug male end which requires a female end socket can i change the plug to a regular amp  pin plug we do not recommend changing the plug as your machine will not be getting enough power flowing for the w motor and you may damage your motor as a result  if you do not already have a socket for a amp plug then they are readily available and your electrician will easily wire it up for you do you offer a warranty with your log splitters yes we offer a  month warranty with all of our products  and that is a genuine warranty  if in the unlikely event that you have a problem with your log splitter we will be able to get it sorted for you – that is our promise we’ve designed these machines and know how they work inside out  there are some stores selling log splitters that have no expertise at all when it comes to how the machines actually work  when you encounter a problem all they can do is offer you your money back – leaving you without what you need – a log splitter  down the road when you are out of warranty we can always offer you servicing or repair can i bring a log to your showroom and test out your log splitter yes you are welcome to bring sample logs and test out all of our max axe log splitter models  we can then best advise you on what machine will suit you and your timber is it easy to move the log splitter around there are two wheels at the back of the machine and a handle at the top so you can lean the log splitter back and wheel it into position similar to a wheelie bin i’ve seen a log splitter for sale with two axes one at each end  it’s advertised as a  ton log splitter it’s a lot cheaper and smaller than yours what is the difference between your max axe  ton model and that one the log splitter that you have seen advertised as a  ton is in fact a  ton machine  just because it has a second axe doesn’t magically turn it into a ton  that is like adding a second axe to my  ton and then calling it a ton – this is impossible  to get  tons of splitting force you firstly require a w motor single phase which our max axe  ton has  secondly for a machine to withstand  tons of splitting force it is essential that the machine has a heavy duty body and ram as seen with all our max axe vertical log splitters – our ton weighs in at a hefty kgs  as everyone knows putting a second exhaust pipe on a litre car does not turn it into a litre car – it is just a gimmick  directions – hartnett products hartnett products sign
