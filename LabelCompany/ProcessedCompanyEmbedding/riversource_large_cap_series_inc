financial markets perhaps just as important history shows that bull markets dont last forever though theyre often unpredictable declines  whether theyre brief or longlasting moderate or substantial  are always a possibility we saw evidence of that last october when financial turmoil in southeast asia sparked a sharp decline in worldwide stock markets including the us the potential for such volatility reinforces the need for an investor to review periodically their longterm goals and examine whether their investment program remains on track to achieving them your quarterly investment statements are one part of that monitoring process the other is a meeting with your american express financial advisor that becomes even more important if theres a major change in your financial

past six months was something of a rollercoaster ride for ids research opportunities fund at the conclusion of the period  august  through january   the funds class a shares lost  after setting a torrid pace earlier in  the stock market struggled for much of the past six months the market got off to a bad start in august as currency declines in southeast asia and rising longterm interest rates here at home took a toll on us stocks although the market rallied the following month by late october the socalled asian flu was in full force weakening stock markets throughout most of the world including the us the situation improved over the following three months though as good corporate profits and falling longterm interest rates eventually overcame investors fears regarding the turmoil in asia the funds performance basically tracked that of the broad market but its fluctuations were greater that was a result of two factors a smaller portfolio about  stocks versus the  in the standard  poors index and a greater concentration in technologyrelated stocks which usually display aboveaverage price volatility the second factor was readily apparent late in  as several of the funds technology holdings experienced severe price declines in the wake of the asian situation some of them rebounded in january but not enough to make up for the downturn in previous months consistent contributors much more consistent contributors were holdings among health care and financial services companies the other two areas of substantial exposure for the fund stocks in the consumer staple sector which include foodbeverage and other consumer product producers were also generally productive investments in keeping with the funds strategy i kept the portfolio essentially fully invested  that is the great majority of assets remained in stocks rather than cash reserves the only notable shifts in asset mix were an increased exposure to energyrelated stocks late in  and reduced exposure to the technology sector the latter resulting from generally lower stock prices at yearend as for the rest of the fiscal year i expect well see a tugofwar between those who believe the asian situation will be an ongoing major problem and those who expect it to be relatively minor and shortlived ultimately the strength of corporate earnings will resolve the issue and that matter probably wont be settled before midyear at the earliest guru baliga picture of guru baliga guru baliga portfolio manager pndth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th class a   month performance all
