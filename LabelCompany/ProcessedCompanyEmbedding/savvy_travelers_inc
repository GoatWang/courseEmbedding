us business travel is still on the risewith no end in sight according to research conducted by the global business travel association global business travel spending topped a recordbreaking  trillion in 0 and is projected to reach  trillion by  business travelers however are neither the most comfortabledue to the intense and short durations of many tripsnor the most able to truly immerse themselves in the local culture what can business travelers do to make the most of a potentially very bad situation  pick airlines with broad frequent flyer programs and better yet airlines with a large number of international partners that way you can rack up points as you jet across countries and seasall while saving up funds for when you get to take your own trip somewhere  get a really good carryon the kind of luggage you bring with you determines the kind of flight youll have bring a light functional streamlined carryon thats still large enough to carry everything you need that way youll never have to worry about lost luggage  drink bottled water when moving around constantly it can be tempting to save money by simply indulging in tap water unfortunately your stomach may be the loser after changing multiple environments in a limited number of days dont take the risk  get food somewhere cheap by cheap i dont mean mcdonalds or some other worldwide fastfood chain a holeinthewall local dive or joint is usually quite accessible placed just next to large industrial centers or pocketed in small corners of tourist places drop in to get that local flavorbut do take caution when it comes to the potential for food poisoning  enroll in a trustedtraveler program if youre a usbased business traveler then you really owe it to yourself to enroll in the trustedtraveler programs offered by us customs and border protection such as nexus sentri or global entry not only will you be whisked through customs when you arrive back home from a foreign destination but you will have access to the tsa pre lanes at the airport saving you tons of timeand headaches  try to stick with the same hotel chains hotel chains just like airlines offer their loyal customers points as well try to save those up when you canyou can trade them in for room upgrades free stays and more on a recent trip to new york city i did just thatusing  marriott reward points to book a couple of nights in a beautiful hotel with an amazing view right on central park for free  do one thing just for you even if youre there on business make sure to leave time to fully take in your surroundings and the fact that youre in a place thats not your home do something touristy or do something local or do both the way you feel yourself growing at ease with change may surprise you the opinions expressed here
