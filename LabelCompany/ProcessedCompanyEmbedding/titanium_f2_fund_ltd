special titanium nikon cameras and nasa cameras vol  special titanium nikon cameras and nasa cameras this will be the final installment of my review of the history of nikon cameras in this last edition i will concentrate on camera models that were born of nikons highestgrade cameras the discussion will focus on titaniumcoated cameras as well as cameras nikon made for nasa im certain that many readers will be seeing this information for the first time titanium and nikon when a focalplane shutter camera with direct optical viewfinder is pointed toward the sun the lens acts as a magnifying glass and the shutter curtain serves as black paper which was found during experiments performed with children caution  never look at the sun through a camera retina damage and blindness may result as a result the sun may burn a hole in a shutter curtain it is said that normal cloth shutter curtains may be damaged if a camera is pointed toward the sun without the lens cap and with a lens aperture set at brighter than f in  nippon kogaku kk started working on developing a thin burnresistant material for shutter curtains the laboratory determined that they should aim for pure titanium sheets used in industry titanium which is ultra light and has high flexibility was regarded as suitable for shutter curtains it was however also well known as a material that was difficult to treat with its improved treatment technology nippon kogaku somehow succeeded in contorting the sticky material into the shape of a shutter curtain however nippon kogaku had many problems along the way such as accuracy scratches damage and performance when exposed to low temperatures they gradually cleared these obstacles and were able to begin using titanium for shutter curtains in  immediately after the announcement of the nikon f the nikon f was an slr camera and the mirror prevented the sun from burning a hole in a shutter curtain however the nikon f had a mirror up mechanism with the mirror up the shutter curtain might be burnt by the sun the nikon f which was often used in the titanium curtain experiments was the first camera to actually incorporate titanium shutter curtains later the nikon sp which employed the same shutter unit as the nikon f also applied titanium shutter curtains this was the beginning of the relationship between nikon and titanium through mass production nippon kogaku refined titanium technology and made it a specialty of theirs back to top discovery of versatility of titanium the nikon f was introduced in  as the successor to the f with the f titanium was used not only for the shutter curtains but also for the reflex mirror frame nippon kogaku wanted to increase mirror speed without having to strengthen the driving spring by applying titanium for the mirror frame the fs mirror unit became lighter and provided a shorter shutter time lag than the f the titanium used for the mirror was  times thicker than that used for the shutter curtains for thicker titanium plates metal molds were easily blunted via the conventional steelplate treatment method new treatment methods for punching and pressing needed to be developed it was the technology for the reflex mirror frame — not for the more wellknown shutter curtains — that eventually led to the development of titaniumcoated cameras back to top nikon f titan for many years it was generally recognized that camera covers were made of brass copperzinc alloy as i have mentioned repeatedly in past articles nikon cameras have been used in some extremely trying conditions the bodies of virtually all nikon f and f cameras suffered dents after they had been used in the demanding professional photography environment as an experiment nippon kogaku made an f body covered by light durable titanium although they experienced many difficulties such as in presstreating the finder unit nippon kogaku gained the expertise necessary to produce a titanium cover that both looked good and was durable unlike todays titanium cameras the covers of titanium cameras of that day were unpainted and the titanium showed through following the experimental product a limited number of models were manufactured and a few models were actually marketed in  users commented that the titanium cover was not suited to professional use because the light color stood out too much and was too reflective in  several hundred of the nikon f titan black models with black matte leatherlook covers were manufactured and marketed on a limited basis later nippon kogaku introduced the f titanium body with titan engraved in the cover the f titanium body though manufactured and marketed in small quantities gradually gained acceptance i mr tateno heard that the number of bodies produced with titan letters engraved in them was considerably greater than the number of nonengraved bodies back to top nikon ft titan nikon ft the nikon f the successor to the f was released in  two years later in  came the nikon f high eyepoint which enabled users to see the entire viewfield of the finder the higheyepoint viewfinder de was extremely popular among general photographers as well as wearers of eyeglasses therefore nippon kogaku decided that the f higheyepoint should be used as the base body for the titanium version of the f the fs body was entirely black to add the variety of color to their fseries cameras nippon kogaku manufactured the titanium f body painted in the color of titanium that was the ft released in  in  the blackpainted ft models were released and continued to appear on the market longer than titanium color by the way the viewfinder cover of the f limited  was also made of titanium unlike the original f body the titanium cover of the f limited enabled an accessory speedlight to be mounted on the interchangeable finders titanium was employed for the cover in order to strengthen the accessory shoe we have talked about the titanium bodies of the f and f nikons pioneer titan cameras are superior to those of other manufacturers in body design and durability as well competitors who tried to copy nikon sometimes used negative techniques such as adding materials to improve presstreating nikon despite the trouble with presstreating continued to use pure titanium back to top cameras for a higher cause nikon photomic ftn used in apollo  after ww ii the usa had been involved in a race for space with the ussr to gain ultimate superpower status both countries continued their work and research and were able to execute a manned space flight by the s around this time they had started using cameras for recording at first nasa national aeronautics and space administration used primarily mmformat films they found however that they needed a more portable camera for more active shooting situations nikon whose cameras had a reputation for reliability in the us market was selected as a special manufacturer of mm cameras for nasa although the nikon us distributor accepted the order of the special cameras for nasa a special team at nippon kogakus ohi plant took charge of product development back to top space photography nikon photomic ftn used in apollo  a camera used in space would be subjected to a vacuum and zerogravity conditions as the spacecraft compartment is airtight it is crucial that harmful gas or fire never be generated the camera should be easy to operate for someone wearing gloves and reliability became a major issue the rays of the sun and their reflection on the camera body may be stronger than those on the earths surface and the weight of cargo aboard the craft should be limited as much as possible for launching so theres no room for a spare camera in case the main one malfunctions in order to meet these demanding conditions nippon kogakus special product development team used the nikon f as the base body and made numerous modifications for example the leatherlike body cover generally used for the nikon f had been changed to a metal plate painted in matte black adhesive used adhered to nasa specifications for plastic parts materials generally used for f cameras had to be changed to specified parts the battery chamber was designed to prevent accidental leakage from the camera body electrical parts were soldered in accordance with nasa standards the standard thickness of the plating was modified dimensions were also changed to accommodate thinner polyesterbased films modifications made to operating parts included an enlarged finger pad for the film advance lever a larger film rewinding knob and enlarged film counter figures and windows interchangeable lenses were also modified the addition of two horns on the focusing ring was the most significant change it made focusing simple as the user needed only to rotate the ring using the horn nasas standards for shutter accuracy were even more stringent than those of nikon back to top nikon — and users — benefitted from nasa experience nikon f used in skylab the technologies nikon used in developing cameras for nasa finally went into use in  the modified f camera and some modified interchangeable lenses were provided to nasa for the apollo  mission then in  a modified version of the f camera with a motor drive and modified lens were supplied for use aboard skylab nikon f used in skylab the cameras nikon developed for use in space exploration are still in use today and maintenance is still being provided these nasa cameras were of course very costly it is said that nippon kogaku took heavy losses however these losses were balanced out by the value of the experience in the space project nippon kogaku took what they had learned and used it to improve the reliability and operational performance of nikon products the development of the camera for nasa using the nikon f body as a base and the development of the nikon f occurred in parallel nasa did not require increasing numbers of the modified f cameras and in fact the camera was never actually manufactured back to top f and f cameras for nasa nikon f big camera after some time had passed nikon went to work on camera models for nasa that were based on the f body there were the small camera which was equipped with a motor drive and the big camera for long film that were delivered to nasa for use aboard the space shuttle in  while the nikon f was still being developed and many issues had yet to be decided nasa went ahead and formally declared the nikon f to be an official nasa camera the f models for nasa and those for mass consumption were developed sidebyside at the ohi plant another special team was assigned to the development of the f for nasa the big camera was equipped with an interchangeable film back and used a thinner special long film for bulk loading members of the special team needed to concentrate on developing a new technology that would accelerate film advancement after much effort and brainstorming they solved the problem and succeeded in delivering the cameras for the space shuttle the f for nasa had many of the same features as the f for mass consumption including internal parts compared to the modified f models for nasa the f for nasa was much more similar to the f models made for the public nikon f small camera in  nikon delivered the modified f to nasa there were only a few small differences between the modified f and massconsumption f models nikon positively applied the experiences obtained during development of nasa cameras to the development of cameras for the general public at the same time nasa learned about the specifications that were required for the cameras use in space these were the reasons why very few modifications were required for recent nasa cameras back to top nikon a product of its users in this final issue weve talked about nikons titanium cameras and the cameras they developed for nasa these cameras are tough enough to withstand the most unusual and severe conditions during the korean war in the s nikon cameras gained a reputation for high performance in extremely low temperatures since then nikon cameras have been put to the test in myriad situations around the globe the development of titanium cameras and special cameras for space use were two ways nikon was able to show its true strength and prowess these experiences also contributed to a rise in the performance of subsequent nikon products thus broadening the user base and increasing consumer confidence this shows how much effect users actually have on the development of nikon cameras and nikkor lenses — by relating their own experiences using nikon products as i look back over the first  issues of this column i see the same thing i firmly believe that nikon will continue to offer excellent products if it maintains and improves this connection with its users this is a heavy responsibility for nikon to bear but one that will serve them well in the years to come this ends my review of the history of nikon cameras id

home  features and news  titanium the metal of the gods titanium the metal of the gods march   tom vulcan in our latest installment of our strategic metals series we look at titanium metal the exceptional metal key to the aerospace industry how titanium lives up to its namesake why titanium metal was so hard hit in  investing in titanium’s ‘holy grail’   not many strategic metals have more than four industry associations devoted to it but titanium does french titanium association international titanium association japan titanium society interstate association titan titanium information group   but perhaps this isnt too surprising for the fourthmost abundant metallic element and ninthmost abundant element in the earths crust or for a metal with such a multiplicity of uses on the other hand it is a little curious since only  percent of all mined and synthetic titanium minerals are actually used to make titanium metal with the remaining  percent used to manufacture titanium dioxide tio in this article we will look only at titanium metal leaving the subject of titanium dioxide to a future piece so what is it with titanium that makes it so special   the metal of the gods it seems particularly appropriate that titanium before it was so named should originally have been discovered by a man of god—reverend william gregor—in cornwall england back in  it wasnt until five years later however that the metal was actually named titanium after the titans by the german chemist martin heinrich klaproth one hundred years later in  american chemist matthew a hunter succeeded in obtaining titanium metal from one of its ores consequently he had the first industrial process to extract the metal named after him that the metal should be named after the titans is particularly apt to a degree that would probably have astounded professor klaproth amongst other characteristics titanium can boast of its   lightness its low density means that it weighs only around  percent as much as steel     data source the engineering toolbox   strengthtoweight ratio titanium is the highest of any of todays structured metals     note ksi  kilopounds per square inch  ksi   psi source international titanium association ita   flexibility with its low modulus of elasticity  x  psi about half that of steel titanium is not only extraordinarily flexible but it also springs back very strongly after it has been stressed eg when acting as a spring   moduli of elasticity of various metals source the engineering toolbox   resistance to corrosion and erosion titanium is exceptionally resistant to both corrosion and erosion in the former instance its naturally forming oxide film protects it against a variety of agents alkaline media chlorine and other halides gases inorganic salt solutions organic acids and chemicals oxidizing mineral acids and water—in all its guises it also protects against microbiologically influenced corrosion in the case of erosion titaniums oxide film provides it with strong resistance to anything from abrasion to cavitation and erosion—particularly at highflow velocities high thermal conductivity titanium conducts heat extremely efficiently low coefficient of expansion titaniums low coefficient of expansion makes it much easier to use in combination with ceramics composites and glass than most other metals by any measure this is quite an exceptional combination of characteristics for one single metal but as an oxide too titanium possesses some very special characteristics hence the fact that some  percent of the titanium mined is turned into tio for starters titanium dioxide makes the brightest of the white pigments in addition tio has not only an extremely high refractive index but as a powder it is also a highly effective opacifier so it is used in everything from paints and paper to plastics pills inks and more   whence titanium titanium occurs naturally and most commonly in two forms as ilmenite or titanium iron oxide fe tio and as rutile or titanium oxide tio their primary sources are mineral sands see zirconium not just bling it is from these two minerals that titanium in whatever form its eventually used is nearly always extracted   mineral sand deposits around the world for a larger view of the above graphic please click on the image source pincock perspectives issue   may      ilmenite is found mainly in australia canada finland south africa and the us   primarily used to produce titaniferous slag source usgs   rutile too is commonly found in australia and south africa but also india sri lanka and sierra leone   us rutile production included in that for ilmenite above source usgs   ilmenite currently accounts for more than  percent of global titanium mineral supply in order to offer up the titanium it contains however ilmenite is nearly always upgraded to either synthetic rutile or titanium slag which are then used in tandem with naturally occurring rutile for the production of titanium   a mine site source department of minerals and energy western australia   from mineral to metal by way of sponge the most common first step in the production of titanium metal is to produce titanium sponge so called because its texture is like that of a natural sea sponge   titanium sponge source luoyang sunrui wanji titanium co ltd   this is most usually achieved by chlorinating rutile titanium tetrachloride ticl is produced by combining the rutile ore coke and chlorine then in whats called the kroll process this ticl is reduced in an inert atmosphere using magnesium producing magnesium chloride and titanium sponge historically the hunter process was used to produce titanium sponge but now nearly all commercially produced sponge is obtained using the kroll process the titanium sponge can then be melted and remelted a number of times and in various different ways either with or without alloying elements which include aluminum molybdenum tin vanadium and zirconium to make various titanium alloys or pure forms of the metals itself   titanium production process for a larger view of the above graphic please click on the image source ita   main uses of titanium metal particularly in the us one of the largest consumers of titanium metal is the aerospace industry both commercial and defense the us geological survey usgs estimates that in  some  percent of the metal was used in aerospace applications of the remaining  percent use was made of it in armor chemical processing marine medical power generation and sporting goods in fact it was only after  that titanium started to be used anywhere other than in the aerospace industry and over the past  years both the commercial aerospace and defense industries have increased their use of titanium dramatically   approximate us titanium mill products shipments source ita   a comparison of the amounts of titanium used in boeings commercial aircraft throws considerable light on how important titanium is just to this one manufacturer the picture is most likely very similar for airbus in europe   titanium usage on boeing aircraft source ita from boeing commercial aircraft group   in addition to those uses listed by the usgs other significant applications of titanium include   architecture and construction armaments automotive chloralkali processing consumer goods spectacle frames watches cameras jewelry desalination downhole oil  gas ferrotitanium flue gas desulphurization food and pharmaceutical high technology sputter targets electromagnets computers optical systems metal matrix composites metal recovery and finishing nuclear waste storage petroleum processing pulp and paper titanium aluminides   source ita   market drivers and the prospects for titanium metal since the aerospace industry is a prime consumer of titanium how it fares inevitably affects how the metal does understandably the last couple of years havent been easy for either as the usgs states it delays in aircraft construction and the global economic slowdown in  resulted in a significant drop in titanium sponge metal production lower prices and delayed capacity expansion even china the worlds largest titanium sponge producer felt the pain in  back at the end of  in its review of that year and the prospects for  asian metal could not have put it more bluntly it is predicted that there will be no great rebound in  in the chinese export market and of the domestic market asian metal wrote chinese titanium sponge production is far greater than demand and the domestic situation remains grim in  but it would be a mistake to think that demand from the aerospace industry is the only major driver of titanium metal prices there are other significant drivers on both the supply and demand sides not least industrial demand for the metal which is as significant a driver as demand from the commercial aerospace industry figures from a  report on titanium by the australian bureau of agricultural and resource economics gave the breakout of titanium mill product use in  as industry  percent of global consumption commercial aerospace  percent military  percent of which  percent was military aerospace consumer  percent and medical  percent some four years later demand for titanium from the steel and industrial equipment industries as well as demand for its use in military armor still remains extremely important the same report accounts for global consumption of such products in  north america  percent the european union  percent china  percent and japan  percent while these last figures are useful indications consumption in china has risen significantly in the last five years on the supply side capacity and capacity expansion has been and still is a major driver within the aerospace industry demand for titanium depends on at least three major factors commercial aircraft order levels the increase in the use of titanium in such aircraft—not only as a percentage of all materials used but also in terms of absolute weight used and finally its use in military aircraft thus the future for titanium metal is subject to at least the following three significant influences its continuing and increased use in aircraft both commercial and military the titanium supply situation and its continuing consumption in the steel and other industries—particularly in china   opportunities in titanium metal for those sanguine not only about the continuing and increased use of titanium in aircraft not least because of the marked improvements in fuel efficiency its use can help provide but also about chinas continuing consumption of titanium there are a number of ways of participating in the titanium metal market setting aside owning the physical metal itself these range from the production of titanium mineral concentrates all the way to production of the metal itself interestingly however unlike with a number of other strategicminor metals the universe of investment opportunities is surprisingly circumscribed—not because private titaniumrelated companies outnumber public ones but simply because so very few companies exist in this space   titanium mineral concentrates in the us the two main producers of titanium mineral concentrates are iluka resources inc a subsidiary of australias iluka resources limited asx ilu and e i du pont de nemours and company dupont nyse dd other major producers around the world in addition to iluka and dupont include   ticker company jnb exx exxaro resources limited nyse rtp rio tinto group nyse bhp bhp billiton private bemax resources limited private tiwest jv owned  between tronox western australia pty ltd and subsidiaries of exxaro australia sands pty ltd   there are also a number of other smaller producers operating in such places as mozambique for example kenmare resources plc lon kmr at its moma mine and vietnam indeed in december last year the fifth mining company to be listed on the hanoi stock exchange was sai gonquy nhon mining co with a titanium slag plant in the central province of binh dinh   titanium sponge producers while titanium mineral concentrates are to be found in a number of different regions around the globe currently there are only six countries that actually produce titanium sponge from those concentrates   note these figures exclude statistics for us sponge production source usgs   in these countries and the us among the main producers were   ticker company country private fushun jinming titanium industry co ltd china private luoyang sunrui wanji titanium co ltd china private zunyi titanium co ltd china tyo  osaka titanium technologies co ltd japan tyo  toho titanium co ltd japan kas utmkp ustkamenogorsk titanium and magnesium plant jsc kazakhstan mcx vsmo vsmpoavisma russia private zaporozhye titanium and magnesium combine ukraine nyse ati allegheny technologies incorporated ati usa nyse rti rti international metals inc usa nyse tie titanium metals corporation usa   titanium metal producers of the sponge producers russias vsmpoavisma vsmpo is also the worlds largest producer of highquality aerospace titanium in the us the main highquality aerospace titanium producer is timet titanium metals corporation in the industrial sector the market in addition to being served by timet is also served by the japanese ingot producers rti international metals inc and uniti  a joint venture between vsmpo and ati in the us there are three further very much smaller in terms of weight titanium ingot producers alcoa howmet a subsidiary of alcoa nyse aa alloyworks llc a private company out of salisbury nc and perryman company another private concern out of houston pa   the question of cost anybody looking at the figures for titanium sponge production can only be surprised at just how small they are for such an obviously important metal in a recent paper the rand corporation noted that the titanium market is very small  only one tenthousandth the size of the steel market why the answer cost titanium is very expensive to produce as rand puts it titanium is expensive to refine process and fabricate in terms of processing cost per cubic inch titanium is five times more expensive than aluminum to refine and more than ten times as expensive as aluminum to forge into ingots and to fabricate into finished products  fabrication is the most costly processing stage followed by sponge production apart from simple capital requirements another major factor involved is energy consumption it takes a great deal of energy to produce titanium not only in the initial processing from ore to sponge but thereafter from sponge to ingot for some aerospace applications the sponge may need to be melted and remelted three times before the correct purity is achieved   source the rand corporation   the situation remains as true today as it did back in september  when then president of timet j landis martin said in a presentation we must continue to chase the holy grail—that is a method of producing sponge that is less expensive than the kroll process which dates back to the s the search for a process cheaper than the kroll process is deemed so important particularly in relation to titaniums use in military aircraft armor etc that even the likes of darpa defense advanced research projects agency is offering funding to develop cheaper processes according to a  report from londonbased consultant roskill at that time there were at least  continuing rd projects looking at new titanium production processes such projects were spread across the globe and included work continuing in australia canada germany italy japan south africa the uk and the us since no one yet has announced that it has discovered the holy grail it is very difficult to know just how far along on the quest any particular project actually is but for the investor who may be seeking another angle and a different way of obtaining exposure to titanium keeping an eye on what is going on in this space may prove particularly interesting—especially if there were ever a way of getting a slice through perhaps participation in the associated intellectual property or the developing entities of any modernday substitutes for the kroll and hunter processes on the other hand if a cheaper way of producing titanium sponge is developed it is a pretty surefire thing that use of the metal will increase significantly   resources australian bureau of agricultural and resource economics abare international titanium association ita pincock allen  holt the boeing
