six and chasing the automatic promotion places by the halfway stage however a dreadful run of results in which there was just one win in seventeen games ended any hope of promotion their form was not

only two of the last fourteen games of the season horton played with two out and out wingers in – beagrie and summer signing nicky summerbee this led to rösler walsh and quinn scoring  goals between them but also to some heavy defeats such as the – loss to rivals manchester united city were sixth on  december and there was talk of a muchawaited return to european football as young talents such as garry flitcroft richard edghill and steve lomas came to the fore however they won only four of their remaining  league games finishing just four points clear of relegation and horton was sacked his sacking was predicted by many as francis lee had taken over as chairman after hortons appointment and wished to have his own man in the dugout at maine road city went on to suffer relegation in –

adams port valeedit in order to help the vale to avoid relegation in  horton brought in dave brammer tony butler carl griffiths alex smith and chris allen this spending spree set the club back £ and so horton first sold off peter beadle to notts county for £ in order to raise the cash needed for his new signings he also brought in two loanees alan lee from aston villa and craig russell from manchester city a fivegame unbeaten run in april allowed the vale to finish above relegated bury on goals scored in a bid to survive another season in the first division horton allowed ten players to

beat brentford at the millennium stadium vale also won the staffordshire senior cup however more club legends departed as tony naylor and allen tankard began to show their age more controversial was the sale of dave brammer to crewe alexandra for £ the club entered a financial crisis following the collapse of itv digital which cost the club £ in revenue this meant horton had to build his squad for – entirely on free transfers ashley dodd ian armstrong phil hardy rae ingram alex gibson chris killen simon osborn sean mcclare danny webber john durnin and mvondo atangana all would make little

over by bill bratts fanbased consortium building for the – campaign horton had to find a replacement for departing defender matt carragher he found his replacement in evertons reliable young george pilkington he also signed goalkeeper jonny brain and austrian defender andreas lipa by the start of the campaign horton had completed the rebuilding of his squad that was necessitated by the financial
