assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year

table of contents c               i               portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance principal investment strategies the funds adviser delegates execution of the funds investment strategy to the subadviser under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of its assets defined as net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in long or short positions in equity securities of us and nonus companies the fund defines equity securities as common and preferred stocks as well as equityrelated securities such as securities and financial instruments eg derivatives that derive their value from equity securities the equity and equityrelated securities in which the fund invests are may be listed or unlisted of issuers of any size and may include but are not limited to common stocks preferred stocks rights and warrants and swap contracts including equity and asset swaps equity swaps may be based on a single name equity or a basket of equities the subadviser will create short exposure for the fund through the use of swaps the subadviser will use short swap positions for both hedging purposes and for capital appreciation the fund establishes its long and short positions based on quantitative and fundamental analysis provided by the funds subadviser the subadviser employs proprietary quantitative models which seek to identify quality companies and statistical measures of risk to assure diversification by issuer and industry the subadviser uses volatility and correlation forecasting to manage the funds investment portfolio the subadviser utilizes quantitative risk models in furtherance of the funds investment objective which seek to control portfolio level risk the quantitative models used and fundamental factors considered by the subadviser may change over time when the subadviser deems it beneficial to the fund the subadviser expects that in most market environments the funds net equity exposure will be positive but below  the subadviser expects that the funds gross equity market exposure or the value of the funds long positions plus its short positions will generally be below  the subadviser also employs a fundamental bottomup approach to identify companies that are underperforming poorly managed strategically deficient or suboptimally capitalized the subadviser uses an active ownership approach seeking to assist portfolio companies to achieve better results and outperform market expectations in general the fund will take long positions in those securities that the subadviser believes to be undervalued and short positions in those securities that the subadviser believes to be overvalued the subadviser sells a long position when a price target is reached fundamentals have deteriorated or more attractive investments are available the subadviser covers buys back short positions when a price target is reached fundamentals have improved or more attractive short positions are available    table of contents as substitutes for securities and to manage risk the fund may also invest in swap contracts including equity and asset swaps and currencies including currency forward contracts principal investment risks as with all mutual funds there is the risk that you could lose money through your investment in the fund many factors affect the funds net asset value and performance the following risks apply to the funds investments in securities and derivatives        activism risk shareholder activism exposes the fund to various risks depending upon the circumstances the issuer may or may not be receptive to communications from the subadviser and indeed may overtly resist block or ignore any or all of the subadvisers suggestions and strategies such efforts may result in increased legal expenses incurred by the fund as well as the potential for involvement in litigation as either plaintiff defendant or both the subadvisers advocacy methodology and advocacyrelated security selection may produce incorrect judgments about the attractiveness value and potential appreciation of a particular security in which the fund invests and may not produce the desired results        derivatives risk derivatives are subject to tracking risk because they may not be perfect substitutes for the instruments they are intended to hedge or replace short positions are subject to potentially unlimited liability purchased options may expire worthless over the counter derivatives such as swaps are subject to counterparty default leverage inherent in derivatives will tend to magnify the funds losses        equity market risk common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change        foreign investment risk foreign investing involves risks not typically associated with us investments including adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values adverse political social and economic developments less liquidity greater volatility less developed or less efficient trading markets political instability and differing auditing and legal standards investing in emerging markets imposes risks different from or greater than risks of investing in foreign developed countries        issuerspecific risk the value of a specific security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and can perform differently from the value of the market as a whole the value of securities of smaller issuers can be more volatile than those of larger issuers the value of certain types of securities can be more volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse issuer political regulatory market or economic developments    table of contents      limited history of operations the fund is a new mutual fund has a limited history of operations and may not grow to or maintain an economically viable size        leverage risk using derivatives to increase the funds combined long and short exposure creates leverage which can magnify the funds potential for gain or loss and therefore amplify the effects of market volatility on the funds share price        management risk the subadvisers judgments about the attractiveness value and potential appreciation of particular asset classes securities and derivatives in which the fund invests may prove to be incorrect and may not produce the desired results additionally the advisers judgments about the potential performance of the subadviser may also prove incorrect and may not produce the desired results        market risk overall securities and derivatives market risks may affect the value of individual instruments in which the fund invests factors such as domestic and foreign economic growth and market conditions interest rate levels and political events affect the securities and derivatives markets when the value of the funds investments goes down your investment in the fund decreases in value and you could lose money        portfolio turnover risk portfolio turnover may result in higher brokerage commissions and other transaction costs the funds investment style will result in most capital gains within the portfolio being realized as shortterm capital gains        short position risk the fund will incur a loss as a result of a short position if the price of the short position instrument increases in value between the date of the short position sale and the date on which an offsetting position is purchased short positions may be considered speculative transactions and involve special risks including greater reliance on the subadvisers ability to accurately anticipate the future value of a security or instrument the funds losses are potentially significant in a short position

trustees upon  days written notice to shareholders principal investment strategies the funds adviser delegates execution of the funds investment strategy to the subadviser under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of its assets defined as net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in long or short positions in equity securities of us and nonus companies the fund defines equity securities as common and preferred stocks as well as equityrelated    table of contents securities such as securities and financial instruments eg derivatives that derive their value from equity securities the equity and equityrelated securities in which the fund invests are may be listed or unlisted of issuers of any size and may include but are not limited to common stocks preferred stocks rights and warrants and swap contracts including equity and asset swaps equity swaps may be based on a single name equity or a basket of equities the subadviser will create short exposure for the fund through the use of swaps the subadviser will use short swap positions for both hedging purposes and for capital appreciation the fund establishes its long and short positions based on quantitative and fundamental analysis provided by the funds subadviser the subadviser employs proprietary quantitative models which seek to identify quality companies and statistical measures of risk to assure diversification by issuer and industry the subadviser uses volatility and correlation forecasting to manage the funds investment portfolio the subadviser utilizes quantitative risk models in furtherance of the funds investment objective which seek to control portfolio level risk the quantitative models used and fundamental factors considered by the subadviser may change over time when the subadviser deems it beneficial to the fund the subadviser seeks to maintain the funds net equity exposure or the value of the funds long positions minus its short positions below  but seeks to maintain a positive net equity exposure in most market environments the subadviser expects that the funds gross equity market exposure or the value of the funds long positions plus its short positions will generally be below  the subadviser also employs a fundamental bottomup approach to identify companies that appear to be undervalued or overvalued on both an absolute and relative basis and thus to capitalize on market inefficiencies the subadviser uses an active ownership approach seeking to assist portfolio companies to achieve better results and outperform market expectations such a strategy may include but is not limited to i writing to the issuer as a fiduciary on behalf of the fund indicating the advisers perspective on the issuers management and direction ii making recommendations to the issuers management and its board of directors iii proposing matters for shareholders of the issuer to vote upon andor iv seeking a seat on the board of directors of the issuer in general the fund will take long positions in those securities that the subadviser believes to be undervalued and short positions in those securities that the subadviser believes to be overvalued the subadviser sells a long position when a price target is reached fundamentals have deteriorated or more attractive investments are available the subadviser covers buys back short positions when a price target is reached fundamentals have improved or more attractive short positions are available the fund takes short positions by engaging in short sales on individual securities or on an index or basket of securities as the seller of a short position the fund generally realizes a profit on the transaction if the price it receives on the short sale exceeds the cost of closing out the position by purchasing securities in the market but generally realizes a loss if the cost of closing out the short position exceeds the proceeds of the short sale    table of contents as substitutes for securities and to manage risk the fund may also invest in swap contracts including equity and asset swaps and currencies including currency forward contracts the fund is diversified for purposes of the investment company act of  as amended the  act principal investment risks the following risks apply to the funds investments in securities and derivatives      activism risk shareholder activism exposes the fund to various risks depending upon the circumstances the issuer may or may not be receptive to communications from the subadviser and indeed may overtly resist block or ignore any or all of the subadvisers suggestions and strategies such efforts may result in increased legal expenses incurred by the fund as well as the potential for involvement in litigation as either plaintiff defendant or both the subadvisers advocacy methodology and advocacyrelated security selection may produce incorrect judgments about the attractiveness value and potential appreciation of a particular security in which the fund invests and may not produce the desired results      derivatives risk the fund may use derivatives to enhance returns or hedge against market declines the funds use of derivative instruments involves risks different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments these risks include i the risk that the counterparty to an overthecounter derivative transaction may not fulfill its contractual obligations ii risk of mispricing or improper valuation and iii the risk that changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset rate or index derivative prices are highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially during a short period of time such prices are influenced by numerous factors that affect the markets including but not limited to changing supply and demand relationships government programs and policies national and international political and economic events changes in interest rates inflation and deflation and changes in supply and demand relationships trading derivative instruments involves risks different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities derivative contracts ordinarily have leverage inherent in their terms the low margin deposits normally required in trading derivatives including futures contracts permit a high degree of leverage accordingly a relatively small price movement may result in an immediate and substantial loss to the fund the use of leverage may also cause the fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its obligations or to meet collateral segregation requirements the use of leveraged derivatives can magnify the funds potential for gain or loss and therefore amplify the effects of market volatility on the funds share price because option premiums paid or received are small in relation to the market value of the    table of contents   investments underlying the options buying and selling put and call options can be more speculative than investing directly in securities      equity market risk the fund will invest in equity securities including common and preferred stock which are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change an equity security or stock represents a proportionate share of the ownership of a company its value is based on the success of the companys business any income paid to stockholders the value of its assets and general market conditions common stocks and preferred stocks are examples of equity securities while both represent proportional share ownership of a company preferred stocks often pay dividends at a specific rate and have a preference over common stocks in dividend payments and liquidation of assets the fund may invest a portion of its assets in warrants and rights which gives holders a right to purchase at any time during a specified period a predetermined number of shares of common stock at a fixed price unlike convertible debt securities or preferred stock warrants and rights do not pay a fixed coupon or dividend investments in warrants and rights involve certain risks including the possible lack of liquidity potential price fluctuations as a result of speculation or other factors and failure of the price of the underlying stock to reach or have reasonable prospects of reaching a level at which the warrant or right can be prudently exercised in which event the warrant or right may expire without being exercised resulting in a loss of the funds entire investment the fund may also invest in rule a securities which are restricted securities that may not be readily marketable in broad public markets and which carry the risk that the fund may not be able to sell a security when the portfolio manager considers it desirable to do so andor may have to sell the security at a lower price transaction costs may also be higher for rule a securities a restricted security that when purchased was liquid may subsequently become illiquid      foreign investment risk foreign investing involves risks not typically associated with us investments including adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values adverse political social and economic developments less liquidity greater volatility less developed or less efficient trading markets political instability and differing auditing and legal standards transactions in foreign markets may be subject to fewer regulations and investor protections than investments in the us investing in emerging markets imposes risks different from or greater than risks of investing in foreign developed countries      issuerspecific risk the value of a specific security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and can perform differently from the value of the market as a whole the value of securities of smaller issuers can be more volatile than those of larger issuers the value of certain types of securities can be more volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse issuer political regulatory market or economic developments      limited history of operations the fund is a new mutual fund has a limited history of operations and may not grow to or maintain an economically viable size mutual    table of contents   funds and their advisers are subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by the  act and the internal revenue code that do not apply to an advisers management of individual and institutional accounts the fund has no track record for investors to judge and it may not achieve its intended investment objective      leverage risk using derivatives to increase the funds combined long and short position exposure creates leverage which can amplify the effects of market volatility on the funds share price and make the funds returns more volatile the use of leverage may cause the fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its obligations the use of leverage may also cause the fund to have higher expenses than those of mutual funds that do not use such techniques      management risk the net asset value of the fund changes daily based on the performance of the securities and derivatives in which it invests the subadvisers judgments about the attractiveness value and potential appreciation of particular asset classes securities and derivatives in which the fund invests may prove to be incorrect and may not produce the desired results additionally the advisers judgments about the potential performance of the subadviser may also prove incorrect and may not produce the desired results there can be no assurance that either the securities or derivatives selected by the subadviser will produce positive returns      market risk the net asset value of the fund will fluctuate based on changes in the value of the securities and derivatives in which the fund invests the fund invests in securities and derivatives which may be more volatile and carry more risk than some other forms of investment the price of securities and derivatives may rise or fall because of economic or political changes security and derivative prices in general may decline over short or even extended periods of time market prices of securities and derivatives in broad market segments may be adversely affected by price trends in commodities interest rates exchange rates or other factors wholly unrelated to the value or condition of an issuer      portfolio turnover risk portfolio turnover may result in higher brokerage commissions and other transaction costs the funds investment style will result in most capital gains within the portfolio being realized as shortterm capital gains      short position risk the funds long positions could decline in value at the same time that the value of the short positions increase thereby increasing the funds overall potential for loss the funds short positions may result in a loss if the price of the short position instruments rise and it costs more to replace the short positions in contrast to the funds long positions for which the risk of loss is typically limited to the amount invested the potential loss on the funds short positions is unlimited market factors may prevent the fund from closing out a short position at the most desirable time or at a favorable price when the fund engages in short selling it will need to maintain cash or other liquid assets in a segregated account in an amount equal to the margin requirement the need to maintain cash or other liquid assets in a segregated account could limit the funds ability to pursue other investment opportunities    table of

nav plus any applicable sales charges of each class of shares is determined at  pm eastern time on each day the is open for business nav is computed by determining on a per class basis the aggregate market value of all assets of the fund less its liabilities divided by the total number of shares outstanding assetsliabilitiesnumber of shares  nav the nyse is closed on weekends and new years day martin luther king jr day washingtons birthday good friday memorial day independence day labor day thanksgiving day and christmas day the nav takes into account on a per class basis the expenses and fees of the fund including management administration and distribution fees if any which are accrued daily the determination of nav for a share class for a particular day is applicable to all applications for the purchase of shares as well as all requests for the redemption of shares received by the fund or an authorized broker or agent or its authorized designee before the close of trading on the nyse on that day generally the funds investments are valued each day at the last quoted sales price on each investments primary exchange investments traded or dealt in upon one or more exchanges whether domestic or foreign for which market quotations are readily available and not subject to restrictions against resale shall be valued at the last quoted sales price on the primary exchange or in the absence of a sale on the primary exchange at the last bid on the primary exchange investments primarily traded in the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system nasdaq national market system for which market quotations are readily available shall be    table of contents valued using the nasdaq official closing price if market quotations are not readily available investments will be valued at their fair market value as determined in good faith by the adviser in accordance with procedures approved by the board and evaluated by the board as to the reliability of the fair value method used in these cases the funds nav will reflect certain portfolio investments fair value rather than their market price fair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that the fair value determined for an investment may be materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of that investment the fair value prices can differ from market prices when they become available or when a price becomes available the fund may use independent pricing services to assist in calculating the value of the funds investments in addition market prices for foreign investments are not determined at the same time of day as the nav for the fund in computing the nav the fund values foreign investments held by the fund at the latest closing price on the exchange in which they are traded immediately prior to closing of the nyse prices of foreign investments quoted in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at current rates if events materially affecting the value of an investment in the funds portfolio particularly foreign investments occur after the close of trading on a foreign market but before the fund prices its shares the investment will be valued at fair value for example if trading in a portfolio investment is halted and does not resume before the fund calculates its nav the adviser may need to price the investment using the funds fair value pricing guidelines without a fair value price shortterm traders could take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity and dilute the nav of longterm investors fair valuation of the funds portfolio investments can serve to reduce arbitrage opportunities available to shortterm traders but there is no assurance that fair value pricing policies will prevent dilution of the funds nav by shortterm traders the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments as a result using fair value to price an investment may result in a price materially different from the prices used by other mutual funds to determine net asset value or from the price that may be realized upon the actual sale of the investment how to

harm all fund shareholders by disrupting the funds investment strategies increasing fund expenses decreasing tax efficiency and diluting the value of shares held by longterm shareholders the fund is designed for longterm investors and is not intended for market timing or other disruptive trading activities accordingly the funds board has approved policies that seek to curb these disruptive activities while recognizing that shareholders may have a legitimate need to adjust their fund investments as their financial needs or circumstances change the fund currently uses several methods to reduce the risk of market timing these methods include        committing staff to review on a continuing basis recent trading activity in order to identify trading activity that may be contrary to the funds market timing trading policy        rejecting or limiting specific purchase requests        rejecting purchase requests from certain investors and        assessing a redemption fee for shortterm trading though these methods involve judgments that are inherently subjective and involve some selectivity in their application the fund seeks to make judgments and applications that are consistent with the interests of the funds shareholders based on the frequency of redemptions in your account the adviser or transfer agent may in its sole discretion determine that your trading activity is detrimental to the fund as described in the funds market timing trading policy and elect to i reject or limit the amount number frequency or method for requesting future purchases into the fund andor ii reject or limit the amount number frequency or method for requesting future exchanges or redemptions out of the fund the fund reserves the right to reject or restrict purchase requests for any reason particularly when the shareholders trading activity suggests that the shareholder may be engaged in market timing or other disruptive trading activities neither the fund nor the adviser will be liable for any losses resulting from rejected purchase orders the adviser may also bar an investor who has violated these policies and the investors financial advisor from opening new accounts with the fund    table of contents although the fund attempts to limit disruptive trading activities some investors use a variety of strategies to hide their identities and their trading practices there can be no guarantee that the fund will be able to identify or limit these activities omnibus account arrangements are common forms of holding shares of the fund while the fund will encourage financial intermediaries to apply the funds market timing trading policy to their customers who invest indirectly in the fund the fund is limited in its ability to monitor the trading activity or enforce the funds market timing trading policy with respect to customers of financial intermediaries for example should it occur the fund may not be able to detect market timing that may be facilitated by financial intermediaries or made difficult to identify in the omnibus accounts used by those intermediaries for aggregated purchases exchanges and redemptions on behalf of all their customers more specifically unless the financial intermediaries have the ability to apply the funds market timing trading policy to their customers through such methods as implementing shortterm trading limitations or restrictions and monitoring trading activity for what might be market timing the fund may not be able to determine whether trading by customers of financial intermediaries is contrary to the funds market timing trading policy brokers maintaining omnibus accounts with the fund have agreed to provide shareholder transaction information to the extent known to the broker to the fund upon request if the fund or its transfer agent or shareholder servicing agent suspects there is market timing activity in the account the fund will seek full cooperation from the service provider maintaining the account to identify the underlying participant at the request of the adviser the service providers may take immediate action to stop any further shortterm trading by such participants tax status dividends and distributions any sale or exchange of the funds shares may generate tax liability unless you are a taxexempt investor or your investment is in a qualified

subadviser under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of its assets defined as net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in long or short positions in equity securities of us and nonus companies the fund defines equity securities as common and preferred stocks as well as equityrelated securities such as securities and financial instruments eg derivatives that derive their value from equity securities the equity and equityrelated securities in which the fund invests are may be listed or unlisted of issuers of any size and may include but are not limited to common stocks preferred stocks rights and warrants and swap contracts including equity and asset swaps equity swaps may be based on a single name equity or a basket of equities the subadviser will create short exposure for the fund through the use of swaps the subadviser will use short swap positions for both hedging purposes and for capital appreciation the fund establishes its long and short positions based on quantitative and fundamental analysis provided by the funds subadviser the subadviser employs proprietary quantitative models which seek to identify quality companies and statistical measures of risk to assure diversification by issuer and industry the subadviser uses volatility and correlation forecasting to manage the funds investment portfolio the subadviser utilizes quantitative risk models in furtherance of the funds investment objective which seek to control portfolio level risk the quantitative models used and fundamental factors considered by the subadviser may change over time when the subadviser deems it beneficial to the fund the subadviser expects that in most market environments the funds net equity exposure will be positive but below  the subadviser expects that the funds gross equity market exposure or the value of the funds long positions plus its short positions will generally be below  the subadviser also employs a fundamental bottomup approach to identify companies that are underperforming poorly managed strategically deficient or suboptimally capitalized the subadviser uses an active ownership approach seeking to assist portfolio companies to achieve better results and outperform market expectations in general the fund will take long positions in those securities that the subadviser believes to be undervalued and short positions in those securities that the subadviser believes to be overvalued the subadviser sells a long position when a price target is reached fundamentals have deteriorated or more attractive investments are available the subadviser covers buys back short positions when a price target is reached fundamentals have improved or more attractive short positions are available as substitutes for securities and to manage risk the fund may also invest in swap contracts including equity and asset swaps and currencies including currency forward contracts    table of contents principal investment risks as with all mutual funds there is the risk that you could lose money through your investment in the fund many factors affect the funds net asset value and performance the following risks apply to the funds investments in securities and derivatives        activism risk shareholder activism exposes the fund to various risks depending upon the circumstances the issuer may or may not be receptive to communications from the subadviser and indeed may overtly resist block or ignore any or all of the subadvisers suggestions and strategies such efforts may result in increased legal expenses incurred by the fund as well as the potential for involvement in litigation as either plaintiff defendant or both the subadvisers advocacy methodology and advocacyrelated security selection may produce incorrect judgments about the attractiveness value and potential appreciation of a particular security in which the fund invests and may not produce the desired results        derivatives risk derivatives are subject to tracking risk because they may not be perfect substitutes for the instruments they are intended to hedge or replace short positions are subject to potentially unlimited liability purchased options may expire worthless over the counter derivatives such as swaps are subject to counterparty default leverage inherent in derivatives will tend to magnify the funds losses        equity market risk common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change        foreign investment risk foreign investing involves risks not typically associated with us investments including adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values adverse political social and economic developments less liquidity greater volatility less developed or less efficient trading markets political instability and differing auditing and legal standards investing in emerging markets imposes risks different from or greater than risks of investing in foreign developed countries        issuerspecific risk the value of a specific security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and can perform differently from the value of the market as a whole the value of securities of smaller issuers can be more volatile than those of larger issuers the value of certain types of securities can be more volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse issuer political regulatory market or economic developments        limited history of operations the fund is a new mutual fund has a limited history of operations and may not grow to or maintain an economically viable size        leverage risk using derivatives to increase the funds combined long and short exposure creates leverage which can magnify the funds potential for gain    table of contents   or loss and therefore amplify the effects of market volatility on the funds share price        management risk the subadvisers judgments about the attractiveness value and potential appreciation of particular asset classes securities and derivatives in which the fund invests may prove to be incorrect and may not produce the desired results additionally the advisers judgments about the potential performance of the subadviser may also prove incorrect and may not produce the desired results        market risk overall securities and derivatives market risks may affect the value of individual instruments in which the fund invests factors such as domestic and foreign economic growth and market conditions interest rate levels and political events affect the securities and derivatives markets when the value of the funds investments goes down your investment in the fund decreases in value and you could lose money        portfolio turnover risk portfolio turnover may result in higher brokerage commissions and other transaction costs the funds investment style will result in most capital gains within the portfolio being realized as shortterm capital gains        short position risk the fund will incur a loss as a result of a short position if the price of the short position instrument increases in value between the date of the short position sale and the date on which an offsetting position is purchased short positions may be considered speculative transactions and involve special risks including greater reliance on the subadvisers ability to accurately anticipate the future value of a security or instrument the funds losses are potentially significant in a short position transaction        small and medium capitalization company risk small and midsized companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and they may be dependent on a limited management group therefore the common stocks of small and midsized companies may pose greater risks than the risks generally associated with the common stocks of larger more established companies performance because the fund has less than a full calendar year of investment operations no performance information is presented for the fund at this time in the future performance information will be presented in this section of this prospectus also shareholder reports containing financial and performance information will be

undervalued or overvalued on both an absolute and relative basis and thus to capitalize on market inefficiencies the subadviser uses an active ownership approach seeking to assist portfolio companies to achieve better results and outperform market expectations such a strategy may include but is not limited to i writing to the issuer as a fiduciary on behalf of the fund indicating the advisers perspective on the issuers management and direction ii making recommendations to the issuers management and its board of directors iii proposing matters for shareholders of the issuer to vote upon andor iv seeking a seat on the board of directors of the issuer in general the fund will take long positions in those securities that the subadviser believes to be undervalued and short positions in those securities that the subadviser believes to be overvalued the subadviser sells a long position when a price target is reached fundamentals have deteriorated or more attractive investments are available the subadviser covers buys back short positions when a price target is reached fundamentals have improved or more attractive short positions are available the fund takes short positions by engaging in short sales on individual securities or on an index or basket of securities as the seller of a short position the fund generally realizes a profit on the transaction if the price it receives on the short sale exceeds the cost of closing out the position by purchasing securities in the market but generally realizes a loss if the cost of closing out the short position exceeds the proceeds of the short sale as substitutes for securities and to manage risk the fund may also invest in swap contracts including equity and asset swaps and currencies including currency forward contracts the fund is diversified for purposes of the investment company act of  as amended the  act    table of contents principal investment risks the following risks apply to the funds investments in securities and derivatives      activism risk shareholder activism exposes the fund to various risks depending upon the circumstances the issuer may or may not be receptive to communications from the subadviser and indeed may overtly resist block or ignore any or all of the subadvisers suggestions and strategies such efforts may result in increased legal expenses incurred by the fund as well as the potential for involvement in litigation as either plaintiff defendant or both the subadvisers advocacy methodology and advocacyrelated security selection may produce incorrect judgments about the attractiveness value and potential appreciation of a particular security in which the fund invests and may not produce the desired results      derivatives risk the fund may use derivatives to enhance returns or hedge against market declines the funds use of derivative instruments involves risks different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments these risks include i the risk that the counterparty to an overthecounter derivative transaction may not fulfill its contractual obligations ii risk of mispricing or improper valuation and iii the risk that changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset rate or index derivative prices are highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially during a short period of time such prices are influenced by numerous factors that affect the markets including but not limited to changing supply and demand relationships government programs and policies national and international political and economic events changes in interest rates inflation and deflation and changes in supply and demand relationships trading derivative instruments involves risks different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities derivative contracts ordinarily have leverage inherent in their terms the low margin deposits normally required in trading derivatives including futures contracts permit a high degree of leverage accordingly a relatively small price movement may result in an immediate and substantial loss to the fund the use of leverage may also cause the fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its obligations or to meet collateral segregation requirements the use of leveraged derivatives can magnify the funds potential for gain or loss and therefore amplify the effects of market volatility on the funds share price because option premiums paid or received are small in relation to the market value of the investments underlying the options buying and selling put and call options can be more speculative than investing directly in securities      equity market risk the fund will invest in equity securities including common and preferred stock which are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change an equity security or stock represents a proportionate share of the ownership of a company its value is based on the success of the    table of contents   companys business any income paid to stockholders the value of its assets and general market conditions common stocks and preferred stocks are examples of equity securities while both represent proportional share ownership of a company preferred stocks often pay dividends at a specific rate and have a preference over common stocks in dividend payments and liquidation of assets the fund may invest a portion of its assets in warrants and rights which gives holders a right to purchase at any time during a specified period a predetermined number of shares of common stock at a fixed price unlike convertible debt securities or preferred stock warrants and rights do not pay a fixed coupon or dividend investments in warrants and rights involve certain risks including the possible lack of liquidity potential price fluctuations as a result of speculation or other factors and failure of the price of the underlying stock to reach or have reasonable prospects of reaching a level at which the warrant or right can be prudently exercised in which event the warrant or right may expire without being exercised resulting in a loss of the funds entire investment the fund may also invest in rule a securities which are restricted securities that may not be readily marketable in broad public markets and which carry the risk that the fund may not be able to sell a security when the portfolio manager considers it desirable to do so andor may have to sell the security at a lower price transaction costs may also be higher for rule a securities a restricted security that when purchased was liquid may subsequently become illiquid      foreign investment risk foreign investing involves risks not typically associated with us investments including adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values adverse political social and economic developments less liquidity greater volatility less developed or less efficient trading markets political instability and differing auditing and legal standards transactions in foreign markets may be subject to fewer regulations and investor protections than investments in the us investing in emerging markets imposes risks different from or greater than risks of investing in foreign developed countries      issuerspecific risk the value of a specific security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and can perform differently from the value of the market as a whole the value of securities of smaller issuers can be more volatile than those of larger issuers the value of certain types of securities can be more volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse issuer political regulatory market or economic developments      limited history of operations the fund is a new mutual fund has a limited history of operations and may not grow to or maintain an economically viable size mutual funds and their advisers are subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by the  act and the internal revenue code that do not apply to an advisers management of individual and institutional accounts the fund has no track record for investors to judge and it may not achieve its intended investment objective      leverage risk using derivatives to increase the funds combined long and short position exposure creates leverage which can amplify the effects of market volatility on the funds share price and make the funds returns more volatile the use of    table of contents   leverage may cause the fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its obligations the use of leverage may also cause the fund to have higher expenses than those of mutual funds that do not use such techniques      management risk the net asset value of the fund changes daily based on the performance of the securities and derivatives in which it invests the subadvisers judgments about the attractiveness value and potential appreciation of particular asset classes securities and derivatives in which the fund invests may prove to be incorrect and may not produce the desired results additionally the advisers judgments about the potential performance of the subadviser may also prove incorrect and may not produce the desired results there can be no assurance that either the securities or derivatives selected by the subadviser will produce positive returns      market risk the net asset value of the fund will fluctuate based on changes in the value of the securities and derivatives in which the fund invests the fund invests in securities and derivatives which may be more volatile and carry more risk than some other forms of investment the price of securities and derivatives may rise or fall because of economic or political changes security and derivative prices in general may decline over short or even extended periods of time market prices of securities and derivatives in broad market segments may be adversely affected by price trends in commodities interest rates exchange rates or other factors wholly unrelated to the value or condition of an issuer      portfolio turnover risk portfolio turnover may result in higher brokerage commissions and other transaction costs the funds investment style will result in most capital gains within the portfolio being realized as shortterm capital gains      short position risk the funds long positions could decline in value at the same time that the value of the short positions increase thereby increasing the funds overall potential for loss the funds short positions may result in a loss if the price of the short position instruments rise and it costs more to replace the short positions in contrast to the funds long positions for which the risk of loss is typically limited to the amount invested the potential loss on the funds short positions is unlimited market factors may prevent the fund from closing out a short position at the most desirable time or at a favorable price when the fund engages in short selling it will need to maintain cash or other liquid assets in a segregated account in an amount equal to the margin requirement the need to maintain cash or other liquid assets in a segregated account could limit the funds ability to pursue other investment opportunities      small and medium capitalization company risk small and midsized companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and they may be dependent on a limited management group therefore the common stocks of small and midsized companies may pose greater risks than the risks generally associated with the common stocks of larger more established companies    table of contents the fund may borrow money as a temporary measure for extraordinary or emergency purposes including the payment of redemptions and the settlement of securities transactions which otherwise might require untimely dispositions of fund investments the fund may also engage in securities lending temporary investments to respond to adverse market economic political or other conditions the fund may invest  of its total assets without limitation in highquality shortterm debt securities and money market instruments these shortterm debt securities and money market instruments include shares of money market mutual funds commercial paper certificates of deposit bankers acceptances us government securities and repurchase agreements while the fund is in a defensive position the opportunity to achieve its investment objective will be limited furthermore to the extent that the fund invests in money market mutual funds for cash positions there will be some duplication of expenses because the fund pays its prorata portion of such money market funds advisory fees and operational fees the fund may also invest a substantial portion of its assets in such instruments at any time to maintain liquidity or pending selection of investments in accordance with its policies portfolio holdings disclosure a description of the funds policies regarding the

applicable sales charges of class s shares is determined at  pm eastern time on each day the is open for business nav is computed by determining on a per class basis the aggregate market value of all

purchase of shares as well as all requests for the redemption of shares received by the fund or an authorized broker or agent or its authorized designee before the close of trading on the nyse on that day generally the funds investments are valued each day at the last quoted sales price on each investments primary exchange investments traded or dealt in upon one or more exchanges whether domestic or foreign for which market quotations are readily available and not subject to restrictions against resale shall be valued at the last quoted sales price on the primary exchange or in the absence of a sale on the primary exchange at the last bid on the primary exchange investments primarily traded in the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system nasdaq national market system for which market quotations are readily available shall be valued using the nasdaq official closing price if market quotations are not readily available investments will be valued at their fair market value as determined in good faith by the adviser in accordance with procedures approved by the board and evaluated by the board as to the reliability of the fair value method used in these cases the funds nav will reflect certain portfolio investments fair value rather than their market price fair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that the fair value determined for an investment may be materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of that investment the fair value prices can    table of contents differ from market prices when they become available or when a price becomes available the fund may use independent pricing services to assist in calculating the value of the funds investments in addition market prices for foreign investments are not determined at the same time of day as the nav for the fund in computing the nav the fund values foreign investments held by the fund at the latest closing price on the exchange in which they are traded immediately prior to closing of the nyse prices of foreign investments quoted in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at current rates if events materially affecting the value of an investment in the funds portfolio particularly foreign investments occur after the close of trading on a foreign market but before the fund prices its shares the investment will be valued at fair value for example if trading in a portfolio investment is halted and does not resume before the fund calculates its nav the adviser may need to price the investment using the funds fair value pricing guidelines without a fair value price shortterm traders could take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity and dilute the nav of longterm investors fair valuation of the funds portfolio investments can serve to reduce arbitrage opportunities available to shortterm traders but there is no assurance that fair value pricing policies will prevent dilution of the funds nav by shortterm traders the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments as a result using fair value to price an investment may result in a price materially different from the prices used by other mutual funds to determine net asset value or from the price that may be realized upon the actual sale of the investment how to purchase shares this prospectus describes the class

value of shares held by longterm shareholders the fund is designed for longterm investors and is not intended for market timing or other disruptive trading activities accordingly the funds board has approved policies that seek to curb these disruptive activities while recognizing that shareholders may have a legitimate need to adjust their fund investments as their financial needs or circumstances change the fund currently uses several methods to reduce the risk of market timing these methods include        committing staff to review on a continuing basis recent trading activity in order to identify trading activity that may be contrary to the funds market timing trading policy        rejecting or limiting specific purchase requests        rejecting purchase requests from certain investors and        assessing a redemption fee for shortterm trading though these methods involve judgments that are inherently subjective and involve some selectivity in their application the fund seeks to make judgments and applications that are consistent with the interests of the funds shareholders based on the frequency of redemptions in your account the adviser or transfer agent may in its sole discretion determine that your trading activity is detrimental to the fund as described in the funds market timing trading policy and elect to i reject or limit the amount number frequency or method for requesting future purchases into the fund andor ii reject or limit the amount number frequency or method for requesting future exchanges or redemptions out of the fund the fund reserves the right to reject or restrict purchase requests for any reason particularly when the shareholders trading activity suggests that the shareholder may be engaged in market timing or other disruptive trading activities neither the fund nor the adviser will be liable for any losses resulting from rejected purchase orders the adviser may also bar an investor who has violated these policies and the investors financial advisor from opening new accounts with the fund although the fund attempts to limit disruptive trading activities some investors use a variety of strategies to hide their identities and their trading practices there can be no guarantee that the fund will be able to identify or limit these activities omnibus account arrangements are common forms of holding shares of the fund while the fund will encourage financial intermediaries to apply the funds market timing trading policy to their customers who invest indirectly in the fund the fund is limited in its ability to monitor the trading activity or enforce the funds market timing trading policy with respect to customers of financial intermediaries for example should it occur the fund may not be able to detect market timing that may be facilitated by    table of contents financial intermediaries or made difficult to identify in the omnibus accounts used by those intermediaries for aggregated purchases exchanges and redemptions on behalf of all their customers more specifically unless the financial intermediaries have the ability to apply the funds market timing trading policy to their customers through such methods as implementing shortterm trading limitations or restrictions and monitoring trading activity for what might be market timing the fund may not be able to determine whether trading by customers of financial intermediaries is contrary to the funds market timing trading policy brokers maintaining omnibus accounts with the fund have agreed to provide shareholder transaction information to the extent known to the broker to the fund upon request if the fund or its transfer agent or shareholder servicing agent suspects there is market timing activity

shareholders can remove a trustee to the extent provided by the investment company act of  as amended the  act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder vacancies may be filled by a majority of the remaining trustees except insofar as the  act may require the election by    table of contents shareholders as a result normally no annual or regular meetings of shareholders will be held unless matters arise requiring a vote of shareholders under the agreement and declaration of trust or the  act types of investments   the investment objective of the fund and the descriptions of the funds principal investment strategies are set forth under investment objective and principal investment strategies and related risks in the prospectus the funds investment objective is not fundamental and may be changed without the approval of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the trust the following pages contain more detailed information about the types of instruments in which the fund may invest strategies wakefield advisors llc the adviser  and clinton group inc the subadviser or clinton group may employ in pursuit of the funds investment objective and a summary of related risks equity securities equity securities in which the fund invests include common stocks preferred stocks and securities convertible into common stocks such as convertible bonds warrants rights and options the value of equity securities varies in response to many factors including the activities and financial condition of individual companies the business market in which individual companies compete and general market and economic conditions equity securities fluctuate in value often based on factors unrelated to the value of the issuer of the securities and such fluctuations can be significant common stock common stock represents an equity ownership interest in a company and usually possesses voting rights and earns dividends dividends on common stock are not fixed but are declared at the discretion of the issuer common stock generally represents the riskiest investment in a company in addition common stock generally has the greatest appreciation and depreciation potential because increases and decreases in earnings are usually reflected in a companys stock price preferred stock the fund may invest in preferred stock with no minimum credit rating preferred stock is a class of stock having a preference over common stock as to the payment of dividends and the recovery of investment should a company be liquidated although preferred stock is usually junior to the debt securities of the issuer preferred stock typically does not possess voting rights and its market value may change based on changes in interest rates    table of contents the fundamental risk of investing in common and preferred stock is the risk that the value of the stock might decrease stock values fluctuate in response to the activities of an individual company or in response to general market andor economic conditions historically common stocks have provided greater longterm returns and have entailed greater shortterm risks than preferred stocks fixedincome securities and money market investments the market value of all securities including common and preferred stocks is based upon the markets perception of value and not necessarily the book value of an issuer or other objective measures of a companys worth convertible securities the fund may invest in convertible securities with no minimum credit rating convertible securities include fixed income securities that may be exchanged or converted into a predetermined number of shares of the issuers underlying common stock at the option of the holder during a specified period convertible securities may take the form of convertible preferred stock convertible bonds or debentures units consisting of usable bonds and warrants or a combination of the features of several of these securities convertible securities are senior to common stocks in an issuers capital structure but are usually subordinated to similar nonconvertible securities while providing a fixedincome stream generally higher in yield than the income derivable from common stock but lower than that afforded by a similar nonconvertible security a convertible security also gives an investor the opportunity through its conversion feature to participate in the capital appreciation of the issuing company depending upon a market price advance in the convertible securitys underlying common stock warrants the fund may invest in warrants warrants are options to purchase common stock at a specific price usually at a premium above the market value of the optioned common stock at issuance valid for a specific period of time warrants may have a life ranging from less than one year to twenty years or they may be perpetual however most warrants have expiration dates after which they are worthless in addition a warrant is worthless if the market price of the common stock does not exceed the warrants exercise price during the life of the warrant warrants have no voting rights pay no dividends and have no rights with respect to the assets of the corporation issuing them the percentage increase or decrease in the market price of the warrant may tend to be greater than the percentage increase or decrease in the market price of the optioned common stock depositary receipts the fund may invest in sponsored and unsponsored american depositary receipts adrs which are receipts issued by an american bank or trust company evidencing ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign issuer adrs in registered form are designed for use in us securities markets unsponsored adrs    table of contents may be created without the participation of the foreign issuer holders of these adrs generally bear all the costs of the adr facility whereas foreign issuers typically bear certain costs in a sponsored adr the bank or trust company depositary of an unsponsored adr may be under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications received from the foreign issuer or to pass through voting rights many of the risks described below regarding foreign securities apply to investments in adrs emerging markets securities the fund may purchase emerging market securities including etfs and other closed end funds that invest in emerging market securities investing in emerging market securities imposes risks different from or greater than risks of investing in foreign developed countries these risks include smaller market capitalization of securities markets which may suffer periods of relative illiquidity significant price volatility restrictions on foreign investment possible repatriation of investment income and capital in addition foreign investors may be required to register the proceeds of sales future economic or political crises could lead to price controls forced mergers expropriation or confiscatory taxation seizure nationalization or creation of government monopolies the currencies of emerging market countries may experience significant declines against the us dollar and devaluation may occur subsequent to investments in these currencies by the fund inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had and may continue to have negative effects on the economies and securities markets of certain emerging market countries additional risks of emerging markets securities may include greater social economic and political uncertainty and instability more substantial governmental involvement in the economy less governmental supervision and regulation unavailability of currency hedging techniques companies that are newly organized and small differences in auditing and financial reporting standards which may result in unavailability of material information about issuers and less developed legal systems in addition emerging securities markets may have different clearance and settlement procedures which may be unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions or otherwise make it difficult to engage in such transactions settlement problems may cause the fund to miss attractive investment opportunities hold a portion of its assets in cash pending investment or be delayed in disposing of a portfolio security such a delay could result in possible liability to a purchaser of the security securities of other investment companies the funds investments in exchangetraded funds mutual funds and closedend funds involve certain additional expenses and certain tax results which would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying fund due to legal limitations the fund will be prevented from  purchasing more than  of an investment companys including etfs outstanding shares  investing more than  of the funds assets in any single such investment company and  investing more than  of the funds assets in investment companies overall unless i the underlying investment company    table of contents andor the fund has received an order for exemptive relief from such limitations from the securities and exchange commission sec and ii the underlying investment company and the fund take appropriate steps to comply with any conditions in such order in the alternative the fund may rely on rule d which allows unaffiliated mutual funds to exceed the  limitation and the  limitation provided the aggregate sales loads any investor pays ie the combined distribution expenses of both the acquiring fund and the acquired fund does not exceed the limits on sales loads established by the financial regulatory authority inc finra for funds of funds in addition to etfs the fund may invest in other investment companies such as openend mutual funds or exchangetraded closedend funds within the limitations described above closedend investment companies the fund may invest its assets in closedend investment companies or closedend funds subject to the investment restrictions set forth above shares of closedend funds are typically offered to the public in a onetime initial public offering by a group of underwriters who retain a spread or underwriting commission of between  or  of the initial public offering price such securities are then listed for trading on the new york stock exchange the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system commonly known as nasdaq and in some cases may be traded in other overthecounter markets because the shares of closedend funds cannot be redeemed upon demand to the issuer like the shares of an openend investment company such as the fund investors seek to buy and sell shares of closedend funds in the secondary market the fund generally will purchase shares of closedend funds only in the secondary market the fund will incur normal brokerage costs on such purchases similar to the expenses the fund would incur for the purchase of securities of any other type of issuer in the secondary market the fund may however also purchase securities of a closedend fund in an initial public offering when in the opinion of the subadviser based on a consideration of the nature of the closedend funds proposed investments the prevailing market conditions and the level of demand for such securities they represent an attractive opportunity for growth of capital the initial offering price typically will include a dealer spread which may be higher than the applicable brokerage cost if the fund purchased such securities in the secondary market the shares of many closedend funds after their initial public offering frequently trade at a price per share which is less than the net asset value per share the difference representing the market discount of such shares this market discount may be due in part to the investment objective of longterm appreciation which is sought by many closedend funds as well as to the fact that the shares of closedend funds are not redeemable by the holder upon demand to the issuer at the next determined net asset value but rather are subject to the principles of supply and demand in the    table of contents secondary market a relative lack of secondary market purchasers of closedend fund shares also may contribute to such shares trading at a discount to their net asset value the fund may invest in shares of closedend funds that are trading at a discount to net asset value or at a premium to net asset value there can be no assurance that the market discount on shares of any closedend fund purchased by the fund will ever decrease in fact it is possible that this market discount may increase and the fund may suffer realized or unrealized capital losses due to further decline in the market price of the securities of such closedend funds thereby adversely affecting the net asset value of the funds shares similarly there can be no assurance that any shares of a closedend fund purchased by the fund at a premium will continue to trade at a premium or that the premium will not decrease subsequent to a purchase of such shares by the fund closedend funds may issue senior securities including preferred stock and debt obligations for the purpose of leveraging the closedend funds common shares in an attempt to enhance the current return to such closedend funds common shareholders the funds investment in the common shares of closedend funds that are financially leveraged may create an opportunity for greater total return on its investment but at the same time may be expected to exhibit more volatility in market price and net asset value than an investment in shares of investment companies without a leveraged capital structure openend investment companies the fund and any affiliated persons as defined by the  act may purchase in the aggregate only up to  of the total outstanding securities of any underlying fund accordingly when affiliated persons hold shares of any of the underlying fund the funds ability to invest fully in shares of those funds is restricted and the adviser or subadviser must then in some instances select alternative investments that would not have been its first preference the  act also provides that an underlying fund whose shares are purchased by the fund will be obligated to redeem shares held by the fund only in an amount up to  of the underlying funds outstanding securities during any period of less than  days shares held by the fund in excess of  of an underlying funds outstanding securities therefore will be considered not readily marketable securities which together with other such securities may not exceed  of the funds total assets under certain circumstances an underlying fund may determine to make payment of a redemption by the fund wholly or partly by a distribution in kind of securities from its portfolio in lieu of cash in conformity with the rules of the securities and exchange commission in such cases the fund may hold securities distributed by an underlying fund until the subadviser determines that it is appropriate to dispose of such securities    table of contents investment decisions by the investment advisers of the underlying funds are made independently of the fund and its subadviser therefore the investment adviser of one underlying fund may be purchasing shares of the same issuer whose shares are being sold by the investment adviser of another such fund the result would be an indirect expense to the fund without accomplishing any investment purpose exchange traded funds etfs are generally passive funds that track their related index and have the flexibility of trading like a security they are managed by professionals and provide the investor with diversification cost and tax efficiency liquidity marginability are useful for hedging have the ability to go long and short and some provide quarterly dividends additionally some etfs are unit investment trusts uits etfs typically have two markets the primary market is where institutions swap creation units in blockmultiples of for example  shares for inkind securities and cash in the form of dividends the secondary market is where individual investors can trade as little as a single share during trading hours on the exchange this is different from openended mutual funds that are traded after hours once the net asset value nav is calculated etfs share many similar risks with openend and closedend funds high yield securities high yield high risk bonds are securities that are generally rated below investment grade by the primary rating agencies bb or lower by sp and ba or lower by moodys other terms used to describe such securities include lower rated bonds noninvestment grade bonds below investment grade bonds and junk bonds these securities are considered to be highrisk investments the risks include the following greater risk of loss these securities are regarded as predominately speculative there is a greater risk that issuers of lower rated securities will default than issuers of higher rated securities issuers of lower rated securities generally are less creditworthy and may be highly indebted financially distressed or bankrupt these issuers are more vulnerable to real or perceived economic changes political changes or adverse industry developments in addition high yield securities are frequently subordinated to the prior payment of senior indebtedness if an issuer fails to pay principal or interest the fund would experience a decrease in income and a decline in the market value of its investments sensitivity to interest rate and economic changes the income and market value of lowerrated securities may fluctuate more than higher rated securities although noninvestment grade securities tend to be less sensitive to interest rate changes than investment grade securities noninvestment grade securities are more sensitive to shortterm corporate economic and market developments during periods of economic uncertainty and change the market price of the investments in lowerrated securities    table of contents may be volatile the default rate for high yield bonds tends to be cyclical with defaults rising in periods of economic downturn valuation difficulties it is often more difficult to value lower rated securities than higher rated securities if an issuers financial condition deteriorates accurate financial and business information may be limited or unavailable in addition the lower rated investments may be thinly traded and there may be no established secondary market because of the lack of market pricing and current information for investments in lower rated securities valuation of such investments is much more dependent on judgment than is the case with higher rated securities liquidity there may be no established secondary or public market for investments in lower rated securities such securities are frequently traded in markets that may be relatively less liquid than the market for higher rated securities in addition relatively few institutional purchasers may hold a major portion of an issue of lowerrated securities at times as a result the fund may be required to sell investments at substantial losses or retain them indefinitely when an issuers financial condition is deteriorating credit quality credit quality of noninvestment grade securities can change suddenly and unexpectedly and even recentlyissued credit ratings may not fully reflect the actual risks posed by a particular highyield security new legislation future legislation may have a possible negative impact on the market for high yield high risk bonds as an example in the late s legislation required federallyinsured savings and loan associations to divest their investments in high yield high risk bonds new legislation if enacted could have a material negative effect on the funds investments in lower rated securities high yield high risk investments may include the following straight fixedincome debt securities these include bonds and other debt obligations that bear a fixed or variable rate of interest payable at regular intervals and have a fixed or resettable maturity date the particular terms of such securities vary and may include features such as call provisions and sinking funds zerocoupon debt securities these do not pay periodic interest but are issued at a discount from their value at maturity when held to maturity their entire return equals the difference between their issue price and their maturity value zerofixedcoupon debt securities these are zerocoupon debt securities that convert on a specified date to periodic interestpaying debt securities payinkind bonds these are bonds which allow the issuer at its option to make current interest payments on the bonds either in cash or in additional bonds these are bonds are typically sold without registration under the securities act of  as amended  act  usually to a relatively small number of institutional investors    table of contents convertible securities these are bonds or preferred stock that may be converted to common stock preferred stock these are stocks that generally pay a dividend at a specified rate and have preference over common stock in the payment of dividends and in liquidation loan participations and assignments these are participations in or assignments of all or a portion of loans to corporations or to governments including governments of less developed countries ldcs securities issued in connection with reorganizations and corporate restructurings in connection with reorganizing or restructuring of an issuer an issuer may issue common stock or other securities to holders of its debt securities the fund may hold such common stock and other securities even if it does not invest in such securities municipal government obligations in general municipal obligations are debt obligations issued by or on behalf of states territories and possessions of the united states including the district of columbia and their political subdivisions agencies and instrumentalities municipal obligations generally include debt obligations issued to obtain funds for various public purposes certain types of municipal obligations are issued in whole or in part to obtain funding for privately operated facilities or projects municipal obligations include general obligation bonds revenue bonds industrial development bonds notes and municipal lease obligations municipal obligations also include additional obligations the interest on which is exempt from federal income tax that may become available in the future as long as the board of the fund determines that an investment in any such type of obligation is consistent with a funds investment objectives municipal obligations may be fully or partially backed by local government the credit of a private issuer current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific assets or domestic or foreign entities providing credit support such as letters of credit guarantees or insurance bonds and notes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its full faith credit and taxing power for the payment of interest and principal revenue bonds are payable only from the revenues derived from a project or facility or from the proceeds of a specified revenue source industrial development bonds are generally revenue bonds secured by payments from and the credit of private users municipal notes are issued to meet the shortterm funding requirements of state regional and local governments municipal notes include tax anticipation notes bond anticipation notes revenue anticipation notes tax and revenue anticipation notes construction loan notes shortterm discount notes taxexempt commercial paper demand notes and similar instruments municipal lease obligations municipal lease obligations may take the form of a lease an installment purchase or a conditional sales contract they are issued by state    table of contents and local governments and authorities to acquire land equipment and facilities such as vehicles telecommunications and computer equipment and other capital assets the fund may invest in funds that purchase these lease obligations directly or it may purchase participation interests in such lease obligations states have different requirements for issuing municipal debt and issuing municipal leases municipal leases are generally subject to greater risks than general obligation or revenue bonds because they usually contain a nonappropriation clause which provides that the issuer is not obligated to make payments on the obligation in future years unless funds have been appropriated for this purpose each year such nonappropriation clauses are required to avoid the municipal lease obligations from being treated as debt for state debt restriction purposes accordingly such obligations are subject to nonappropriation risk municipal leases may be secured by the underlying capital asset and it may be difficult to dispose of any such asset in the event of nonappropriation or other default lending portfolio securities for the purpose of achieving income the fund may lend its portfolio securities provided  the loan is secured continuously by collateral consisting of us government securities or cash or cash equivalents cash us government securities negotiable certificates of deposit bankers acceptances or letters of credit maintained on a daily marktomarket basis in an amount at least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned  the fund may at any time call the loan and obtain the return of securities loaned  the fund will receive any interest or dividends received on the loaned securities and  the aggregate value of the securities loaned will not at any time exceed onethird of the total assets of the fund the fund will recall securities to vote on material shareholder issues short sales the fund may sell securities short involving the use of derivative instruments and to offset potential declines in long positions in similar securities a short sale is a transaction in which the fund sell a security it does not own or have the right to acquire or that it owns but does not wish to deliver in anticipation that the market price of that security will decline when the fund makes a short sale the brokerdealer through which the short sale is made must borrow the security sold short and deliver it to the party purchasing the security the fund is required to make a margin deposit in connection with such short sales the fund may have to pay a fee to borrow particular securities and will often be obligated to pay over any dividends and accrued interest on borrowed securities if the price of the security sold short increases between the time of the short sale and the time the fund covers its short position the fund will incur a loss conversely if the price declines the fund will realize a capital gain any gain will be decreased and any loss increased by the transaction costs described above the successful use of short selling may be adversely affected by imperfect correlation between movements in the    table of contents price of the security sold short and the securities being hedged to the extent the fund sells securities short it will provide collateral to the brokerdealer and except in the case of short sales against the box will maintain additional asset coverage in the form of cash us government securities or other liquid securities with its custodian in a segregated account in an amount at least equal to the difference between the current market value of the securities sold short and any amounts required to be deposited as collateral with the selling broker not including the proceeds of the short sale swap agreements the fund may enter into interest rate index equity credit default and currency exchange rate swap agreements in an attempt to obtain a particular desired return at a lower cost to the fund than if it had invested directly in an instrument that yielded that desired return swap agreements are twoparty contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than one year in a standard swap transaction two parties agree to exchange the returns or differentials in rates of returns earned or realized on particular predetermined investments or instruments the gross returns to be exchanged or swapped between the parties are calculated with respect to a notional amount ie the return on or increase in value of a particular dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate in a particular foreign currency or in a basket of securities representing a particular index the notional amount of the swap agreement is only a fictive basis on which to calculate the obligations the parties to a swap agreement have agreed to exchange the funds obligations or rights under a swap agreement will generally be equal only to the amount to be paid or received under the agreement based on the relative values of the positions held by each party to the agreement the net amount the funds obligations under a swap agreement will be accrued daily offset against any amounts owing to the fund and any accrued but unpaid net amounts owed to a swap counterparty will be covered by the maintenance of a segregated account consisting of cash us government securities or other liquid securities to avoid leveraging of the funds portfolio whether the funds use of swap agreements enhance the funds total return will depend on the subadvisers ability correctly to predict whether certain types of investments are likely to produce greater returns than other investments because they are twoparty contracts and may have terms of greater than seven days swap agreements may be considered to be illiquid moreover the fund bear the risk of loss of the amount expected to be received under a swap agreement in the event of the default or bankruptcy of a swap agreement counterparty the subadviser will cause the fund to enter into swap agreements only with counterparties that would be eligible for consideration as repurchase agreement counterparties under the portfolios repurchase agreement guidelines the swap market is a relatively new market and is largely unregulated it is possible that developments in the swaps market including potential government regulation could adversely affect the funds ability to terminate    table of contents existing swap agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements certain swap agreements are exempt from most provisions of the commodity exchange act cea and therefore are not regulated as futures or commodity option transactions under the cea pursuant to regulations of the cftc to qualify for this exemption a swap agreement must be entered into by eligible participants which include the following provided the participants total assets exceed established levels a bank or trust company savings association or credit union insurance company investment company subject to regulation under the  act commodity pool corporation partnership proprietorship organization trust or other entity employee benefit plan governmental entity brokerdealer futures commission merchant natural person or regulated foreign person to be eligible natural persons and most other entities must have total assets exceeding  million commodity pools and employees benefit plans must have assets exceeding  million in addition an eligible swap transaction must meet three conditions first the swap agreement may not be part of a fungible class of agreements that are standardized as to their material economic terms second the creditworthiness of parties with actual or potential obligations under the swap agreement must be a material consideration in entering into or determining the terms of the swap agreement including pricing cost or credit enhancement terms third swap agreements may not be entered into and traded on or through a multilateral transaction execution facility the fund may enter into credit default swaps in a credit default swap one party makes a stream of payments to another party in exchange for the right to receive a specified return in the event of a default by a third party typically an emerging country on its obligation the fund may use credit default swaps to provide a measure of protection against defaults of sovereign issuers ie to reduce risk where the fund owns or has exposure to the sovereign issuer and may use credit default swaps to take an active long or short position with respect to the likelihood of a particular issuers default in connection with these agreements cash or liquid securities may be set aside as collateral by the funds custodian in accordance with the terms of the swap agreement the fund earns interest on cash set aside as collateral swaps are marked to market daily based upon quotations from market makers and the change in value if any is recorded as unrealized gain or loss these financial instruments are not actively traded on financial markets the values assigned to these instruments are based upon the best available information and because of the uncertainty of the valuation these values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market for these instruments existed and the differences could be material payments received or made at the end of the measurement period are recorded as realized gain or loss entering into these agreements involves to varying degrees elements of credit market and documentation risk such risks involve the possibility that there will be no liquid market for these agreements that the counterparty to the agreements may default on its obligation to perform or disagree as to the meaning of contractual terms in the agreements and that there may be unfavorable changes in interest rates    table of contents additional information about principal investments foreign securities general the fund may invest in foreign securities including exchange traded funds etfs and other investment companies that hold a portfolio of foreign securities investing in securities of foreign companies and countries involves certain considerations and risks that are not typically associated with investing in us government securities and securities of domestic companies there may be less publicly available information about a foreign issuer than a domestic one and foreign companies are not generally subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial standards and requirements comparable to those applicable to us companies there may also be less government supervision and regulation of foreign securities exchanges brokers and listed companies than exists in the united states interest and dividends paid by foreign issuers may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes which may decrease the net return on such investments as compared to dividends and interest paid to the fund by domestic companies or the us government there may be the possibility of expropriations seizure or nationalization of foreign deposits confiscatory taxation political economic or social instability or diplomatic developments that could affect assets of the fund held in foreign countries finally the establishment of exchange controls or other foreign governmental laws or restrictions could adversely affect the payment of obligations to the extent the funds currency exchange transactions do not fully protect the fund against adverse changes in currency exchange rates decreases in the value of currencies of the foreign countries in which the fund will invest relative to the us dollar will result in a corresponding decrease in the us dollar value of the funds assets denominated in those currencies and possibly a corresponding increase in the amount of securities required to be liquidated to meet distribution requirements conversely increases in the value of currencies of the foreign countries in which the fund invests relative to the us dollar will result in a corresponding increase in the us dollar value of the funds assets and possibly a corresponding decrease in the amount of securities to be liquidated certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances the fund may invest in certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances which are considered to be shortterm money market instruments certificates of deposit are receipts issued by a depository institution in exchange for the deposit of funds the issuer agrees to pay the amount deposited plus interest to the bearer of the receipt on the date specified on the certificate the certificate usually can be traded in the secondary market prior to maturity bankers acceptances typically arise from shortterm credit arrangements designed to enable businesses to obtain    table of contents funds to finance commercial transactions generally an acceptance is a time draft drawn on a bank by an exporter or an importer to obtain a stated amount of funds to pay for specific merchandise the draft is then accepted by a bank that in effect unconditionally guarantees to pay the face value of the instrument on its maturity date the acceptance may then be held by the accepting bank as an earning asset or it may be sold in the secondary market at the going rate of discount for a specific maturity although maturities for acceptances can be as long as  days most acceptances have maturities of six months or less commercial paper the fund may purchase commercial paper commercial paper consists of shortterm usually from  to  days unsecured promissory notes issued by corporations in order to finance their current operations it may be secured by letters of credit a surety bond or other forms of collateral commercial paper is usually repaid at maturity by the issuer from the proceeds of the issuance of new commercial paper as a result investment in commercial paper is subject to the risk the issuer cannot issue enough new commercial paper to satisfy its outstanding commercial paper also known as rollover risk commercial paper may become illiquid or may suffer from reduced liquidity in certain circumstances like all fixed income securities commercial paper prices are susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if interest rates rise commercial paper prices will decline the shortterm nature of a commercial paper investment makes it less susceptible to interest rate risk than many other fixed income securities because interest rate risk typically increases as maturity lengths increase commercial paper tends to yield smaller returns than longerterm corporate debt because securities with shorter maturities typically have lower effective yields than those with longer maturities as with all fixed income securities there is a chance that the issuer will default on its commercial paper obligation information on time deposits and variable rate notes the fund may invest in fixed time deposits whether or not subject to withdrawal penalties the commercial paper obligations which the fund may buy are unsecured and may include variable rate notes the nature and terms of a variable rate note ie a master note permit the fund to invest fluctuating amounts at varying rates of interest pursuant to a direct arrangement between the fund as lender and the issuer as borrower it permits daily changes in the amounts borrowed the fund has the right at any time to increase up to the full amount stated in the note agreement or to decrease the amount outstanding under the note the issuer may prepay at any time and without penalty any part of or the full amount of the note the note may or may not be backed by one or more bank letters of credit because these notes are direct lending arrangements between the fund and the issuer it is not generally contemplated that they will be traded moreover there is currently no secondary market for them except as specifically provided in the prospectus there is no limitation on the type of issuer    table of contents from whom these notes may be purchased however in connection with such purchase and on an ongoing basis the funds subadviser will consider the earning power cash flow and other liquidity ratios of the issuer and its ability to pay principal and interest on demand including a situation in which all holders of such notes made demand simultaneously variable rate notes are subject to the funds investment restriction on illiquid securities unless such notes can be put back to the issuer on demand within seven days insured bank obligations the fund may invest in insured bank obligations the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insures the deposits of federally insured banks and savings and loan associations collectively referred to as banks up to  the fund may purchase bank obligations which are fully insured as to principal by the fdic to remain fully insured as to principal these investments must be limited to  per bank if the principal amount and accrued interest together exceed  the excess principal and accrued interest will not be insured insured bank obligations may have limited marketability united states government obligations these consist of various types of marketable securities issued by the united states treasury ie bills notes and bonds such securities are direct obligations of the united states government and differ mainly in the length of their maturity treasury bills the most frequently issued marketable government security have a maturity of up to one year and are issued on a discount basis the fund may also invest in treasury inflationprotected securities tips tips are special types of treasury bonds that were created in order to offer bond investors protection from inflation the values of the tips are automatically adjusted to the inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index cpi if the cpi goes up by half a percent the value of the bond the tips would also go up by half a percent if the cpi falls the value of the bond does not fall because the government guarantees that the original investment will stay the same tips decline in value when real interest rates rise however in certain interest rate environments such as when real interest rates are rising faster than nominal interest rates tips may experience greater losses than other fixed income securities with similar duration united states government agencies these consist of debt securities issued by agencies and instrumentalities of the united states government including the various types of instruments currently outstanding or which may be offered in the future agencies include among others the federal housing administration government national mortgage association ginnie mae farmers home administration exportimport bank of the united states maritime administration and general services administration instrumentalities include    table of contents for example each of the federal home loan banks the national bank for cooperatives the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac the farm credit banks the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the united states postal service these securities

had been placed into conservatorship a statutory process designed to stabilize a troubled institution with the objective of returning the entity to normal business operations the us treasury department and the fhfa at the same time established a secured lending facility and a secured stock purchase agreement with both fannie mae and freddie mac to ensure that each entity had the ability to fulfill its financial obligations the fhfa announced that it does not anticipate any disruption in pattern of payments or ongoing business operations of fannie mae and freddie mac governmentrelated

ultimate collection of principal but pcs are not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government commercial banks savings and loan institutions private mortgage insurance companies mortgage bankers and other secondary market issuers also create passthrough pools of conventional residential mortgage loans such issuers may in addition be the originators andor servicers of the underlying mortgage loans as well as the guarantors of the mortgagerelated securities pools created by such nongovernmental issuers generally offer a higher rate of interest than government and governmentrelated pools because there are no direct or indirect government or agency guarantees of payments in the former pools however timely payment of interest and principal of these pools may be supported by various forms of insurance or guarantees including individual loan title pool and hazard insurance and letters of credit the    table of contents insurance and guarantees are issued by

and credit unions and mortgage bankers passthrough securities issued by fannie mae are guaranteed as to timely payment of principal and interest by fannie mae but are not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government mortgage passthrough securities interests in pools of mortgage passthrough securities differ from other forms of debt securities which normally provide periodic payments of interest in fixed amounts and the payment of principal in a lump sum at maturity or on specified call dates instead mortgage passthrough securities provide monthly payments consisting of both interest and principal payments in effect these payments are a passthrough of the monthly payments made by the individual borrowers on the underlying residential mortgage loans net of any fees paid to the issuer or guarantor of such securities unscheduled payments of principal may be made if the underlying mortgage loans are repaid or refinanced or the underlying properties are foreclosed thereby shortening the securities weighted average life some mortgage passthrough securities such as securities guaranteed by ginnie mae are described as modified passthrough securities  these securities entitle the holder to receive all interest and principal payments owed on the mortgage pool net of certain fees on the scheduled payment dates regardless of whether the mortgagor actually makes the payment the principal governmental guarantor of mortgage passthrough securities is ginnie mae ginnie mae is authorized to guarantee with the full faith and credit of the us treasury the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by lending institutions approved by ginnie mae such as savings and loan institutions commercial banks and mortgage bankers and backed by pools of mortgage loans these mortgage loans are either insured by the federal housing administration or guaranteed by the veterans administration a pool or group of such mortgage loans is assembled and after being approved by ginnie mae is offered to investors through securities dealers governmentrelated guarantors of mortgage passthrough securities ie not backed by the full faith and credit of

but are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us treasury commercial banks savings and loan institutions private mortgage insurance companies mortgage bankers and other secondary market issuers also create passthrough pools of conventional residential mortgage loans such issuers may in addition be the originators andor servicers of the underlying mortgage loans as well as the guarantors of the mortgage passthrough securities resets the interest rates paid on the adjustable rate mortgage securities arms in which the fund may invest generally are readjusted or reset at intervals of one year or less to an increment over some predetermined interest rate index there are two main categories of indices those based on us treasury securities and those derived from a calculated measure such as a cost of funds index or a moving average of mortgage rates commonly utilized indices include the oneyear and fiveyear constant maturity treasury note rates the threemonth treasury bill rate the day treasury bill rate rates on longerterm treasury securities the national median cost of funds the onemonth or threemonth london interbank offered rate libor the prime rate of a specific bank or commercial paper rates some indices such as the oneyear constant maturity treasury note rate closely mirror changes in market interest rate levels others tend to lag changes in market rate levels and tend to be somewhat less volatile caps and floors the underlying mortgages which collateralize the arms in which the fund may invest will frequently have caps and floors which limit the maximum amount by which the loan rate to the residential borrower may change up or down  per reset or adjustment interval and  over the life of the loan some residential mortgage loans restrict periodic adjustments by limiting changes in the borrowers monthly principal and interest payments rather than limiting interest rate changes these payment caps may result in negative amortization the value of mortgage securities in which the fund invests may be affected if market interest rates rise or fall faster and farther than the allowable caps or floors on the underlying residential mortgage loans additionally even though the interest rates on the underlying residential mortgages are adjustable amortization and prepayments may occur thereby causing the effective maturities of the mortgage securities in which the fund invests to be shorter than the maturities stated in the underlying mortgages private mortgage passthrough securities private mortgage passthrough securities are structured similarly to the ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac mortgage passthrough securities and are issued by united states and foreign private issuers such as originators of and investors in mortgage loans including savings and loan associations mortgage banks commercial banks investment banks and special purpose subsidiaries of the foregoing these securities usually are backed by a pool of    table of contents conventional fixed rate or adjustable rate mortgage loans since private mortgage passthrough securities typically are not guaranteed by an entity having the credit status of ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac such securities generally are structured with one or more types of credit enhancement mortgage assets often consist a pool of assets representing the obligations of a number of different parties there are usually fewer properties in a pool of assets backing commercial mortgagebacked securities than in a pool of assets backing residential mortgagebacked securities hence they may be more sensitive to the performance of fewer mortgage assets to lessen the effect of failures by obligors on underlying assets to make payments those securities may contain elements of credit support which fall into two categories i liquidity protection and ii protection against losses resulting from ultimate default by an obligor on the underlying assets liquidity protection refers to the provision of advances generally by the entity administering the pool of assets to ensure that the receipt of payments on the underlying pool occurs in a timely fashion protection against losses resulting from default ensures ultimate payment of the obligations on at least a portion of the assets in the pool this protection may be provided through guarantees insurance policies or letters of credit obtained by the issuer or sponsor from third parties through various means of structuring the transaction or through a combination of such approaches the degree of credit support provided for each issue is generally based on historical information respecting the level of credit risk associated with the underlying assets delinquencies or losses in excess of those anticipated could adversely affect the return on an investment in a security the fund will not pay any fees for credit support although the existence of credit support may increase the price of a security stripped mortgage securities stripped mortgage securities may be issued by federal agencies or by private originators of or investors in mortgage loans including savings and loan associations mortgage banks commercial banks investment banks and special purpose subsidiaries of the foregoing the fund limits investments in stripped mortgage securities to  of net assets stripped mortgage securities usually are structured with two classes that receive different proportions of the interest and principal distribution of a pool of mortgage assets a common type of stripped mortgage security will have one class receiving some of the interest and most of the principal from the mortgage assets while the other class will receive most of the interest and the remainder of the principal in the most extreme case one class will receive all of the interest the interestonly or io class while the other class will receive all of the principal the principalonly or po  class po classes generate income through the accretion of the deep discount at which such securities are purchased and while po classes do not receive periodic payments of interest they receive monthly payments associated with scheduled amortization and principal prepayment from the mortgage assets underlying the po class the yield to maturity on a po or an io class security is extremely sensitive to the rate of principal payments including prepayments on the related underlying mortgage assets a slower than expected rate of principal payments may have an adverse effect on a po class    table of contents securitys yield to maturity if the underlying mortgage assets experience slower than anticipated principal repayment the fund may fail to fully recoup its initial investment in these securities conversely a rapid rate of principal payments may have a material adverse effect on an io class securitys yield to maturity if the underlying mortgage assets experience greater than anticipated prepayments or principal the fund may fail to fully recoup its initial investment in these securities the fund may purchase stripped mortgage securities for income or for hedging purposes to protect the funds portfolio against interest rate fluctuations for example since an io class will tend to increase in value as interest rates rise it may be utilized to hedge against a decrease in value of other fixedincome securities in a rising interest rate environment inverse floaters inverse floaters constitute a class of mbs with a coupon rate that moves inversely to a designated index such as libor london interbank offered rate or th district cost of funds index cofi inverse floaters have coupon rates that typically change at a multiple of the changes of the relevant index rate any rise in the index rate as a consequence of an increase in interest rates causes a drop in the coupon rate on an inverse floater while any drop in the index rate causes an increase in the coupon rate of an inverse floater in some circumstances the coupon on an inverse floater could decrease to zero in addition like most other fixedincome securities the value of inverse floaters will decrease as interest rates increase and their average lives will extend inverse floaters exhibit greater price volatility than the majority of mortgagebacked securities in addition some inverse floaters display extreme sensitivity to changes in prepayments as a result the yield to maturity of an inverse floater is sensitive not only to changes in interest rates but also to changes in prepayment rates on the related underlying mortgage assets as described above inverse floaters may be used alone or in tandem with interestonly stripped mortgage instruments mortgage dollar rolls the fund may enter into mortgage dollar rolls with a bank or a brokerdealer a mortgage dollar roll is a transaction in which a fund sells mortgagerelated securities for immediate settlement and simultaneously purchases the same type of securities for forward settlement at a discount while a fund begins accruing interest on the newly purchased securities from the purchase or trade date it is able to invest the proceeds from the sale of its previously owned securities which will be used to pay for the new securities in money market investments until future settlement date the use of mortgage dollar rolls is a speculative technique involving leverage and is considered to be a form of borrowing by the fund securities options the fund may purchase and write ie sell put and call options such options may relate to particular securities or stock indices and may or may not be listed on a domestic or foreign securities exchange and may or may not be issued by the options clearing corporation options trading is a highly specialized activity that entails greater than ordinary investment risk options may be more volatile than the underlying instruments and therefore on a percentage basis an investment in options may be    table of contents subject to greater fluctuation than an investment in the underlying instruments themselves a call option for a particular security gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and the writer seller the obligation to sell the underlying security at the stated exercise price at any time prior to the expiration of the option regardless of the market price of the security the premium paid to the writer is in consideration for undertaking the obligation under the option contract a put option for a particular security gives the purchaser the right to sell the security at the stated exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option regardless of the market price of the security stock index options are put options and call options on various stock indices in most respects they are identical to listed options on common stocks the primary difference between stock options and index options occurs when index options are exercised in the case of stock options the underlying security common stock is delivered however upon the exercise of an index option settlement does not occur by delivery of the securities comprising the index the option holder who exercises the index option receives an amount of cash if the closing level of the stock index upon which the option is based is greater than in the case of a call or less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option this amount of cash is equal to the difference between the closing price of the stock index and the exercise price of the option expressed in dollars times a specified multiple a stock index fluctuates with changes in the market value of the stocks included in the index for example some stock index options are based on a broad market index such as the standard  poors ® index or the value line composite index or a narrower market index such as the standard  poors ® indices may also be based on an industry or market segment such as the amex oil and gas index or the computer and business equipment index options on stock indices are currently traded on the chicago board options exchange the new york stock exchange and the philadelphia stock exchange the funds obligation to sell an instrument subject to a call option written by it or to purchase an instrument subject to a put option written by it may be terminated prior to the expiration date of the option by the funds execution of a closing purchase transaction which is effected by purchasing on an exchange an option of the same series ie same underlying instrument exercise price and expiration date as the option previously written a closing purchase transaction will ordinarily be effected to realize a profit on an outstanding option to prevent an underlying instrument from being called to permit the sale of the underlying instrument or to permit the writing of a new option containing different terms on such underlying instrument the cost of such a liquidation purchase plus transactions costs may be greater than the premium received upon the original option in which event the fund will have paid a loss in the transaction there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for any particular option an option writer unable to effect a closing purchase transaction will not be able to sell the underlying instrument or liquidate the assets held in a segregated account as described below until the option expires or the optioned instrument is delivered upon exercise in such circumstances the writer will be subject to the risk of market decline or appreciation in the instrument during such period    table of contents if an option purchased by the fund expires unexercised the fund realizes a loss equal to the premium paid if the fund enters into a closing sale transaction on an option purchased by it the fund will realize a gain if the premium received by the fund on the closing transaction is more than the premium paid to purchase the option or a loss if it is less if an option written by the fund expires on the stipulated expiration date or if the fund enters into a closing purchase transaction it will realize a gain or loss if the cost of a closing purchase transaction exceeds the net premium received when the option is sold if an option written by the fund is exercised the proceeds of the sale will be increased by the net premium originally received and the fund will realize a gain or loss certain risks regarding options there are several risks associated with transactions in options for example there are significant differences between the securities and options markets that could result in an imperfect correlation between these markets causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives in addition a liquid secondary market for particular options whether traded overthecounter or on an exchange may be absent for reasons which include the following there may be insufficient trading interest in certain options restrictions may be imposed by an exchange on opening transactions or closing transactions or both trading halts suspensions or other restrictions may be imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities or currencies unusual or unforeseen circumstances may interrupt normal operations on an exchange the facilities of an exchange or the options clearing corporation may not at all times be adequate to handle current trading value or one or more exchanges could for economic or other reasons decide or be compelled at some future date to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the secondary market on that exchange or in that class or series of options would cease to exist although outstanding options that had been issued by the options clearing corporation as a result of trades on that exchange would continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms successful use by the fund of options on stock indices will be subject to the ability of the adviser or subadviser to correctly predict movements in the directions of the stock market this requires different skills and techniques than predicting changes in the prices of individual securities in addition a funds ability to effectively hedge all or a portion of the securities in its portfolio in anticipation of or during a market decline through transactions in put options on stock indices depends on the degree to which price movements in the underlying index correlate with the price movements of the securities held by the fund inasmuch as the funds securities will not duplicate the components of an index the correlation will not be perfect consequently the fund bears the risk that the prices of its securities being hedged will not move in the same amount as the prices of its put options on the stock indices it is also possible that there may be a negative correlation between the index and the funds securities that would result in a loss on both such securities and the options on stock indices acquired by the fund    table of contents the hours of trading for options may not conform to the hours during which the underlying securities are traded to the extent that the options markets close before the markets for the underlying securities significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the options markets the purchase of options is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions the purchase of stock index options involves the risk that the premium and transaction costs paid by the fund in purchasing an option will be lost as a result of unanticipated movements in prices of the securities comprising the stock index on which the option is based there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an options exchange will exist for any particular option or at any particular time and for some options no secondary market on an exchange or elsewhere may exist if the fund is unable to close out a call option on securities that it has written before the option is exercised the fund may be required to purchase the optioned securities in order to satisfy its obligation under the option to deliver such securities if the fund is unable to effect a closing sale transaction with respect to options on securities that it has purchased it would have to exercise the option in order to realize any profit and would incur transaction costs upon the purchase and sale of the underlying securities cover for options positions transactions using options other than options that the fund has purchased expose the fund to an obligation to another party the fund will not enter into any such transactions unless it owns either i an offsetting  covered  position in securities or other options or ii cash or liquid securities with a value sufficient at all times to cover its potential obligations not covered as provided in i above the fund will comply with sec guidelines regarding cover for these instruments and if the guidelines so require set aside cash or liquid securities in a segregated account with the funds custodian in the prescribed amount under current sec guidelines the fund will segregate assets to cover transactions in which the fund writes or sells options assets used as cover or held in a segregated account cannot be sold while the position in the corresponding option is open unless they are replaced with similar assets as a result the commitment of a large portion of the funds assets to cover or segregated accounts could impede portfolio management or the funds ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations options on futures contracts the fund may purchase and sell options on the same types of futures in which it may invest options on futures are similar to options on underlying instruments except that options on futures give the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract a long position if the option is a call and a short position if the option is a put rather than to purchase or sell the futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time during the period of the option upon exercise of the option the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the    table of contents option will be accompanied by the delivery of the accumulated balance in the writers futures margin account which represents the amount by which the market price of the futures contract at exercise exceeds in the case of a call or is less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option on the futures contract purchasers of options who fail to exercise their options prior to the exercise date suffer a loss of the premium paid dealer options the fund may engage in transactions involving dealer options as well as exchangetraded options certain additional risks are specific to dealer options while the fund might look to a clearing corporation to exercise exchangetraded options if the fund were to purchase a dealer option it would need to rely on the dealer from which it purchased the option to perform if the option were exercised failure by the dealer to do so would result in the loss of the premium paid by the fund as well as loss of the expected benefit of the transaction exchangetraded options generally have a continuous liquid market while dealer options may not consequently the fund may generally be able to realize the value of a dealer option it has purchased only by exercising or reselling the option to the dealer who issued it similarly when the fund writes a dealer option it may generally be able to close out the option prior to its expiration only by entering into a closing purchase transaction with the dealer to whom the fund originally wrote the option while the fund will seek to enter into dealer options only with dealers who will agree to and which are expected to be capable of entering into closing transactions with the fund there can be no assurance that the fund will at any time be able to liquidate a dealer option at a favorable price at any time prior to expiration unless the fund as a covered dealer call option writer is able to effect a closing purchase transaction it will not be able to liquidate securities or other assets used as cover until the option expires or is exercised in the event of insolvency of the other party the fund may be unable to liquidate a dealer option with respect to options written by the fund the inability to enter into a closing transaction may result in material losses to the fund for example because the fund must maintain a secured position with respect to any call option on a security it writes the fund may not sell the assets which it has segregated to secure the position while it is obligated under the option this requirement may impair the funds ability to sell portfolio securities at a time when such sale might be advantageous the staff of the sec has taken the position that purchased dealer options are illiquid securities the fund may treat the cover used for written dealer options as liquid if the dealer agrees that the fund may repurchase the dealer option it has written for a maximum price to be calculated by a predetermined formula in such cases the dealer option would be considered illiquid only to the extent the maximum purchase price under the formula exceeds the intrinsic value of the option accordingly the fund will treat dealer options as subject to the funds limitation on illiquid securities if the sec    table of contents changes its position on the liquidity of dealer options the fund will change its treatment of such instruments accordingly spread transactions the fund may purchase covered spread options from securities dealers these covered spread options are not presently exchangelisted or exchangetraded the purchase of a spread option gives the fund the right to put securities that it owns at a fixed dollar spread or fixed yield spread in relationship to another security that the fund does not own but which is used as a benchmark the risk to the fund in addition to the risks of dealer options described above is the cost of the premium paid as well as any transaction costs the purchase of spread options will be used to protect the fund against adverse changes in prevailing credit quality spreads ie the yield spread between high quality and lower quality securities this protection is provided only during the life of the spread options additional risks risk of potential government regulation of derivatives it is possible that government regulation of various types of derivative instruments including futures and swap agreements may limit or prevent the fund from using such instruments as part of its investment strategy and could ultimately prevent the fund from being able to achieve its investment goals for example some legislative and regulatory proposals such as those in the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act  which was passed into law in july  would upon implementation impose limits on the maximum position that could be held by a single trader in certain contracts and would subject some derivatives transactions to new forms of regulation that could create barriers to some types of investment activity other provisions would require many swaps to be cleared and traded on an exchange expand entity registration requirements impose business conduct requirements on dealers that enter into swaps with a pension plan endowment retirement plan or government entity and require banks to move some derivatives trading units to a nonguaranteed affiliate separate from the deposittaking bank or divest them altogether while many provisions of the doddfrank act must be implemented through future rulemaking and any regulatory or legislative activity may not necessarily have a direct immediate effect upon the fund it is possible that upon implementation of these measures or any future measures they could potentially limit or completely restrict the ability of the fund to use these instruments as a part of its investment strategy increase the costs of using these instruments or make them less effective commodity pool operator regulation the adviser on behalf of the fund has filed with the national futures association a notice claiming exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the commodity exchange act as amended and the rules of the    table of contents commodity futures trading association promulgated thereunder with respect to the funds operation accordingly the fund is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool nor is the adviser subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator with respect to the fund repurchase agreements the fund may enter into repurchase agreements which are a form of lending by the fund in a repurchase agreement an investor such as the fund purchases a security known as the underlying security from a securities dealer or bank any such dealer or bank must be deemed creditworthy by the adviser or subadviser at that time the bank or securities dealer agrees to repurchase the underlying security at a mutually agreed upon price on a designated future date the repurchase price may be higher than the purchase price the difference being income to the fund or the purchase and repurchase prices may be the same with interest at an agreed upon rate due to the fund on repurchase in either case the income to the fund generally will be unrelated to the interest rate on the underlying securities repurchase agreements must be fully collateralized in that the market value of the underlying securities including accrued interest must at all times be equal to or greater than the repurchase price therefore a repurchase agreement can be considered a loan collateralized by the underlying securities repurchase agreements are generally for a short period of time often less than a week and will generally be used by the fund to invest excess cash or as part of a temporary defensive strategy repurchase agreements that do not provide for payment within seven days will be treated as illiquid securities in the event of a bankruptcy or other default by the seller of a repurchase agreement the fund could experience both delays in liquidating the underlying security and losses these losses could result from a possible decline in the value of the underlying security while the fund is seeking to enforce its rights under the repurchase agreement b possible reduced levels of income or lack of access to income during this period and c expenses of enforcing its rights trading in futures contracts a futures contract provides for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific financial instrument eg units of a stock index for a specified price date time and place designated at the time the contract is made brokerage fees are paid when a futures contract is bought or sold and margin deposits must be maintained entering into a contract to buy is commonly referred to as buying or purchasing a contract or holding a long position entering into a contract to sell is commonly referred to as selling a contract or holding a short position unlike when the fund purchases or sells a security no price would be paid or received by the fund upon the purchase or sale of a futures contract upon entering into a futures contract and to maintain the funds open positions in futures contracts    table of contents the fund would be required to deposit with its custodian or futures broker in a segregated account in the name of the futures broker an amount of cash us government securities suitable money market instruments or other liquid securities known as initial margin the margin required for a particular futures contract is set by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be significantly modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract futures contracts are customarily purchased and sold on margins that may range upward from less than  of the value of the contract being traded if the price of an open futures contract changes by increase in underlying instrument or index in the case of a sale or by decrease in the case of a purchase so that the loss on the futures contract reaches a point at which the margin on deposit does not satisfy margin requirements the broker will require an increase in the margin however if the value of a position increases because of favorable price changes in the futures contract so that the margin deposit exceeds the required margin the broker will pay the excess to the fund these subsequent payments called variation margin to and from the futures broker are made on a daily basis as the price of the underlying assets fluctuate making the long and short positions in the futures contract more or less valuable a process known as marking to the market the fund expects to earn interest income on its margin deposits although certain futures contracts by their terms require actual future delivery of and payment for the underlying instruments in practice most futures contracts are usually closed out before the delivery date closing out an open futures contract purchase or sale is effected by entering into an offsetting futures contract sale or purchase respectively for the same aggregate amount of the identical underlying instrument or index and the same delivery date if the offsetting purchase price is less than the original sale price the fund realizes a gain if it is more the fund realizes a loss conversely if the offsetting sale price is more than the original purchase price the fund realizes a gain if it is less the fund realizes a loss the transaction costs must also be included in these calculations there can be no assurance however that the fund will be able to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to a particular futures contract at a particular time if the fund is not able to enter into an offsetting transaction the fund will continue to be required to maintain the margin deposits on the futures contract for example one contract in the financial times stock exchange  index future is a contract to buy  pounds sterling multiplied by the level of the uk financial times  share index on a given future date settlement of a stock index futures contract may or may not be in the underlying instrument or index if not in the underlying instrument or index then settlement will be made on a whenissued forward commitment or delayed settlement basis in this event the custodian as defined under the section entitled custodian will segregate liquid assets equal to the amount of the commitment in a separate account normally the custodian will set aside portfolio    table of contents securities to satisfy a purchase commitment in such a case the fund may be required subsequently to segregate additional assets in order to assure that the value of the account remains equal to the amount of the funds commitment it may be expected that the funds net assets will fluctuate to a greater degree when it sets aside portfolio securities to cover such purchase commitments than when it sets aside cash the fund does not intend to engage in these transactions for speculative purposes but only in furtherance of its investment objective because the fund will segregate liquid assets to satisfy its purchase commitments in the manner described the funds liquidity and the ability of the subadviser to manage them may be affected in the event the funds forward commitments commitments to purchase whenissued securities and delayed settlements ever exceeded  of the value of its net assets the fund will purchase securities on a whenissued forward commitment or delayed settlement basis only with the intention of completing the transaction if deemed advisable as a matter of investment strategy however the fund may dispose of or renegotiate a commitment after it is entered into and may sell securities it has committed to purchase before those securities are delivered to the fund on the settlement date in these cases the fund may realize a taxable capital gain or loss when the fund engages in whenissued forward commitment and delayed settlement transactions it relies on the other party to consummate the trade failure of such party to do so may result in the fund incurring a loss or missing an opportunity to obtain a price credited to be advantageous the market value of the securities underlying a whenissued purchase forward commitment to purchase securities or a delayed settlement and any subsequent fluctuations in their market value is taken into account when determining the market value of the fund starting on the day the fund agrees to purchase the securities the fund does not earn interest on the securities it has committed to purchase until it has paid for and delivered on the settlement date illiquid and restricted securities the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in illiquid securities illiquid securities include securities subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale eg because they have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended the securities act and securities that are otherwise not readily marketable eg because trading in the security is suspended or because market makers do not exist or will not entertain bids or offers securities that have not been registered under the securities act are referred to as private placements or restricted securities and are purchased directly from the issuer or in the secondary market foreign securities that are freely tradable in their principal markets are not considered to be illiquid restricted and other illiquid securities may be subject to the potential for delays on resale and uncertainty in valuation the fund might be unable to dispose of illiquid securities promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty in satisfying redemption requests from shareholders the fund might have to register    table of contents restricted securities in order to dispose of them resulting in additional expense and delay adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of securities a large institutional market exists for certain securities that are not registered under the securities act including foreign securities the fact that there are contractual or legal restrictions on resale to the general public or to certain institutions may not be indicative of the liquidity of such investments rule a under the securities act allows such a broader institutional trading market for securities otherwise subject to restrictions on resale to the

intended to enhance the liquidity and transparency of a equity securities by creating a source for indicative quotes trade reporting and issuer information for a equity securities under guidelines adopted by the trusts board the funds adviser or subadviser may determine that particular rule a securities and commercial paper issued in reliance on the private placement exemption from registration afforded by section a of the securities act are liquid even though they are not registered a determination of whether such a security is liquid or not is a question of fact in making this determination the adviser or subadviser will consider as it deems appropriate under the circumstances and among other factors  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security  the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security  the number of other potential purchasers of the security  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security  the nature of the security eg debt or equity date of maturity terms of dividend or interest payments and other material terms and the nature of the marketplace trades eg the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of transfer and  the rating of the security and the financial condition and prospects of the issuer in the case of commercial paper the adviser or subadviser will also determine that the paper  is not traded flat or in default as to principal and interest and  is rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least two national statistical rating organizations nrsros or if only one nrsro rates the security by that nrsro or if the security is unrated the adviser or subadviser determines that it is of equivalent quality rule a securities and section a commercial paper that have been deemed liquid as described above will continue to be monitored by the adviser or subadviser to determine if the security is no longer liquid as the result of changed conditions investing in rule a securities or section a commercial paper could have the effect of increasing the amount of the funds assets invested in illiquid securities if institutional buyers are unwilling to purchase such securities investment restrictions      table of contents as a diversified fund the fund will invest in the securities of any issuer only if immediately after

ramifications all shareholders should consult a qualified tax adviser regarding their investment in the fund the fund intends to qualify as regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code which requires compliance with certain requirements concerning the sources of its income diversification of its assets and the amount and timing of its distributions to shareholders such qualification does not involve supervision of management or investment practices or policies by any government agency or bureau by so qualifying the fund should not be subject to federal income or excise tax on its net investment income or net capital gain which are distributed to shareholders in accordance with the applicable timing requirements net investment income and net capital gain of the fund will be computed in accordance with section  of the code net investment income is made up of dividends and interest less expenses net capital gain for a fiscal year is computed by taking into account any capital loss carryforward of the fund capital losses incurred in tax years beginning after december   may now be carried forward indefinitely and retain the character of the original loss under preenacted laws capital losses could be carried forward to offset any capital gains for eight years and carried forward as shortterm capital irrespective of the character of the original loss capital loss carry forwards are available to offset future realized capital gains to the extent that these carry forwards are used to offset future capital gains it is probable that the amount offset will not be distributed to shareholders the fund intends to distribute all of its net investment income any excess of net shortterm capital gains over net longterm capital losses and any excess of net longterm capital gains over net shortterm capital losses in accordance with the timing requirements imposed by the code and therefore should not be required to pay any federal income or excise taxes distributions of net investment income and net capital gain will be made after the end of each fiscal year and no later than december  of each year both types of distributions will be in shares of the fund unless a shareholder elects to receive cash    table of contents to be treated as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the code the fund

securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies any one issuer two or more issuers which the fund controls and which are determined to be engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or the securities of certain publicly traded partnerships if the fund fails to qualify as a regulated investment company under subchapter m in any fiscal year it will be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as such the fund would be required to pay income taxes on its net investment income and net realized capital gains if any at the rates generally applicable to corporations shareholders of the fund generally would not be liable for income tax on the funds net investment income or net realized capital gains in their individual capacities distributions to shareholders whether from the funds net investment income or net realized capital gains would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of current or accumulated earnings and profits of the fund the fund is subject to a  nondeductible excise tax on certain undistributed amounts of ordinary income and capital gain under a prescribed formula contained in section  of the code the formula requires payment to shareholders during a calendar year of distributions representing at least  of the funds ordinary income for the calendar year and at least  of its capital gain net income ie the excess of its capital gains over capital losses realized during the oneyear period ending october  during such year plus  of any income that was neither distributed nor taxed to the fund during the preceding calendar year under ordinary circumstances the fund expects to time its distributions so as to avoid liability for this tax the following discussion of tax consequences is for the general information of shareholders that are subject to tax shareholders that are iras or other qualified retirement plans are exempt from income taxation under the code distributions of taxable net investment income and the excess of net shortterm capital gain over net longterm capital loss are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income    table of contents distributions of net capital gain capital gain dividends generally are taxable to shareholders as longterm capital gain regardless of the length of time the shares of the fund have been held by such shareholders a redemption of fund shares by a shareholder will result in the recognition of taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholders tax basis in his or her fund shares such gain or loss is treated as a capital gain or loss if the shares are held as capital assets however any loss realized upon the redemption of shares within six months from the date of their purchase will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of any amounts treated as capital gain dividends during such sixmonth period all or a portion of any loss realized upon the redemption of shares may be disallowed to the extent shares are purchased including shares acquired by means of reinvested dividends within  days before or after such redemption distributions of taxable net investment income and net capital gain will be taxable as described above whether received in additional cash or shares shareholders electing to receive distributions in the form of additional shares will have a cost basis for federal income tax purposes in each share so received equal to the net asset value of a share on the reinvestment date all distributions of taxable net investment income and net capital gain whether received in shares or in cash must be reported by each taxable shareholder on his or her federal income tax return dividends or distributions declared in october november or december as of a record date in such a month if any will be deemed to have been received by shareholders on december  if paid during january of the following year redemptions of shares may result in tax consequences gain or loss to the shareholder and are also subject to these reporting requirements under the code the fund will be required to report to the internal revenue service all distributions of taxable income and capital gains as well as gross proceeds from the redemption or exchange of fund shares except in the case of certain exempt shareholders under the backup withholding provisions of section  of the code distributions of taxable net investment income and net capital gain and proceeds from the redemption or exchange of the shares of a regulated investment company may be subject to withholding of federal income tax in the case of nonexempt shareholders who fail to furnish the investment company with their taxpayer identification numbers and with required certifications regarding their status under the federal income tax law or if the fund is notified by the irs or a broker that withholding is required due to an incorrect tin or a previous failure to report taxable interest or dividends if the withholding provisions are applicable any such distributions and proceeds whether taken in cash or reinvested in additional shares will be reduced by the amounts required to be withheld for taxable years beginning after december   an additional  medicare tax will be imposed on certain net investment income including ordinary dividends

the funds transactions in options futures contracts hedging transactions forward contracts straddles and foreign currencies will be subject to special tax rules including marktomarket constructive sale straddle wash sale and short sale rules the effect of which may be to accelerate income to the fund defer losses to the fund cause adjustments in the holding periods of the funds securities convert longterm capital gains into shortterm capital gains and convert shortterm capital losses into longterm capital losses these rules could therefore affect the amount timing and character of distributions to shareholders to the extent such investments are permissible certain of the funds hedging activities including its transactions if any in foreign currencies or foreign currencydenominated instruments are likely to produce a difference between its book income and its taxable income if the funds book income exceeds its taxable income the distribution if any of such excess book income will be treated as i a dividend to the extent of the funds remaining earnings and profits including earnings and profits arising from taxexempt income ii thereafter as a return of capital to the extent of the recipients basis in the shares and iii thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset if the funds book income is less than taxable income the fund could be required to make distributions exceeding book income to qualify as a regular investment company that is accorded special tax treatment    table of contents passive foreign investment companies investment by the fund in certain passive foreign investment companies pfics  could subject the fund to a us federal income tax including interest charges on distributions received from the company or on proceeds received from the disposition of shares in the company which tax cannot be eliminated by making distributions to fund shareholders however the fund may elect to treat a pfic as a qualified electing fund   qef election  in which case the fund will be required to include its share of the companys income and net capital gains annually regardless of whether they receives any distribution from the company the fund also may make an election to mark the gains and to a limited extent losses in such holdings to the market as though it had sold and repurchased its holdings in those pfics on the last day of the funds taxable year such gains and losses are treated as ordinary income and loss the qef and marktomarket elections may accelerate the recognition of income without the receipt of cash and increase the amount required to be distributed for the fund to avoid taxation making either of these elections therefore may require the fund to liquidate other investments including when it is not advantageous to do so to meet its distribution requirement which also may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the funds total return foreign currency transactions the funds transactions in foreign currencies foreign currencydenominated debt securities and certain foreign currency options futures contracts and forward contracts and similar instruments may give rise to ordinary income or loss to the extent such income or loss results from fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency concerned foreign taxation income received by the fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by such countries tax treaties and conventions between certain countries and the us may reduce or eliminate such taxes if more than  of the value of the funds total assets at the close of its taxable year consists of securities of foreign corporations the fund may be able to elect to pass through to the funds shareholders the amount of eligible foreign income and similar taxes paid by the fund if this election is made a shareholder generally subject to tax will be required to include in gross income in addition to taxable dividends actually received his or her pro rata share of the foreign taxes paid by the fund and may be entitled either to deduct as an itemized deduction his or her pro rata share of foreign taxes in computing his or her taxable income or to use it as a foreign tax credit against his or her us federal income tax liability subject to certain limitations in particular a shareholder must hold his or her shares without protection from risk of loss on the exdividend date and for at least  more days during the day period surrounding the exdividend date to be eligible to claim a foreign tax credit with respect to a gain dividend no deduction for foreign taxes may be claimed by a shareholder who    table of contents does not itemize deductions each shareholder will be notified within  days after the close of the funds taxable year whether the foreign taxes paid by the fund will pass through for that year generally a credit for foreign taxes is subject to the limitation that it may not exceed the shareholders us tax attributable to his or her total foreign source taxable income for this purpose if the passthrough election is made the source of the funds income will flow through to shareholders of the fund with respect to the fund gains from the sale of securities will be treated as derived from us sources and certain currency fluctuation gains including fluctuation gains from foreign currencydenominated debt securities receivables and payables will be treated as ordinary income derived from us sources the limitation on the

sets forth the current policies and procedures of the firm with regard to the voting of proxies over which the firm has investment responsibility these policies and procedures are available to the firms clients upon request the firm acts in a fiduciary capacity with respect to each of its clients including private funds and therefore the firm must act to maximize the value the accounts it manages each proxy proposal is reviewed on a casebycase basis by an appropriate member of the firms portfolio management team see procedures  the proxy is then marked for vote by an authorized senior investment professional consistent with the firms professional investment judgment as to what will best benefit the financial and economic interest of the advisory client the firm will likely vote against any management proposals that the firm believes could prevent companies from realizing their maximum market value or would insulate companies andor management from accountability to shareholders or prudent regulatory compliance for example the firm will generally vote against any proposal that attempts to limit shareholder democracy such as increased indemnification protections for directors or officers or unequal voting rights in a way that could restrict the ability of the shareholders to realize the value of their investment the firm will generally support proposals aimed at effectuating standard and necessary aspects of business operations which will not typically have a significant effect on the value of the investment such as name changes elections of directors and employee stock purchase or ownership plans a record of all proxy decisions and the rationale for voting will be retained and available for inspection by the advisory client at any time in accordance with the procedures listed below conflicts of interest the firm must act as a fiduciary when voting proxies on behalf of its advisory clients in that regard the firm will seek to avoid possible conflict of interest in connection with proxy voting as follows where the firm identifies a potential conflict of interest the firm will initially determine whether such potential conflict is material where the firm determines there is a potential for a material conflict of interest regarding a proxy the firm will take one or some of the following steps i inform the advisory client of the material conflict and the firms voting decision ii discuss the proxy vote with the advisory client iii fully disclose the material facts regarding the conflict and seek the advisory clients consent to vote the proxy as intended andor iv seek the recommendations of an independent third party the firm will document the steps it took to ensure the proxy vote or abstention was in the best interest of the advisory client and not the product of any material conflict such documentation will be maintained in accordance with required recordkeeping procedures    table of contents disclosure of policies and procedures the firm will provide a summary of these policies and procedures in its form adv part ii to be furnished to advisory clients the firm will further provide a copy of these policies and procedures to any advisory client upon request in addition the firm will inform its advisory clients how they can obtain further proxy voting information about their own proxies disclosure of voting record upon a request from an advisory client the firm will furnish to an advisory client its proxy voting record with respect to such advisory clients securities procedures receipt of proxy materials the firm receives proxy materials from broadridge which provides the firm with proxy processing services the firm provides broadridge security positions on a daily basis and broadridge through proxyedge assists the firm with managing meeting notifications voting tracking and reporting and management of institutional proxies in certain cases a company may send hard copy proxy statements through the mail in such cases the firm will check through proxyedge as to whether a similar electronic filing was processed by broadridge and the vote will be processed electronically as opposed to manually otherwise the vote will be manual and submitted to the firm via email or certified mail voting decisions the portfolio managers has responsibility for reviewing and deciding how to vote on each issue or initiative for the securities he or she trades however portfolio managers can give authority to the firms operations group to vote on such proxy statements in this case the firms chief compliance officer has to be informed of the guidelines and reasons for such delegation currently security positions in the statistical arbitrage group are voted by the operations group it is firm policy to abstain from voting on certain proxies traded by the statistical arbitrage group because of i the uncertain impact that such proposals may have on the valuation of the companys stock ii the high cost associated with obtaining more information and iii our current belief that it is highly unlikely that we will retain such positions for any extended period for security positions held by the statistical arbitrage group the firm may also follow the general guidelines put forward by iss in all cases blocking ballots will not be voted recusal from voting any portfolio manager who has a direct or indirect personal pecuniary interest in any issue presented for voting or in any relationship with an issuer must so inform the chief compliance officer the chief compliance officer may ask the portfolio manager to recuse him or herself from decisions on how proxies with respect to that issuer are voted if heshe believes that the vote may not be in the interest of the clients record of votes cast broadridge keeps voting records for  years such records are available through proxyedge    table of contents client requests for votes if a client requests that their proxies be voted in a specific way on a specific issue the portfolio manager or a member of the portfolio management team will advise the client that it may not be able to accommodate the request client requests for voting record clients may request information concerning how their proxies were voted the portfolio manager or a member of the portfolio management team will respond to all such requests based on information in client account holdings reports and on proxyedge showing how client shares were voted on particular issues and will notify the chief compliance officer of such request    table of contents part c other information item  financial statements and exhibits a articles of incorporation     i registrants agreement and declaration of trust which was filed as an
