single pail says john bates ceo of toledobased heidtman steel products—performance accountability integrity and loyalty by tim triplett editorinchief fifty years ago john bates took a summer job in a tiny shop in toledo ohio helping to man a single shear today he is the chief executive of north america’s th ranked service center organization with  employees and  revenues of nearly  million along the way he has achieved many successes and admits to notable failures but his commitment to the steel industry and to excellence has never wavered an early pioneer in marketing highstrength steels and a major investor in one of the nation’s leading minimills bates’ entrepreneurship has had a major influence not just on his own company but on the steel industry as a whole heidtman steel products claims several notable pioneering innovations as a service center and toll processor it was the first to market highstrength lowalloy steels in the s it was the first to build a hotdipped galvanizing line in  it was the first to implement a milladjacent strategy in  and it was the first to sell minimill products to automotive oems for these reasons and for his long and distinguished leadership of an organization that represents a model for the rest of the industry metal center news has named john c bates chief executive officer of heidtman steel products as the  service center executive of the year bates age  originally went to michigan state on a math scholarship and dreamt of becoming a veterinarian at the recommendation of his father chuck a salesman at detroit steel john took a summer job at a company owned by bill heidtman who ran a small shear operation out of a squarefoot space on toledo’s laskey road “he had one foot cincinnati shear all he did was cut up pieces of dry lube steel” bates recalls “everything was sheet back then no one had coils except the mills because they didn’t want anyone else in the slitting business it was supposed to be just a summer job but bill heidtman and i became really good friends” the following february bates got married and would soon have a family to support at bill’s invitation he agreed to work full time and study business at night closer to home the tiny twoman operation flourished “back then the labor force at steel mills seemed to go on strike every few years all of a sudden the steel we had would be worth a lot more than the day before the strike so that presented opportunity for us” bates says on palm sunday in  four major tornadoes came through toledo killing  people and wiping out hundreds of homes and businesses—one of them the fledgling heidtman steel the shear and  worth of inventory was lost but insured when the insurance money arrived bill heidtman had a decision to make get a conventional job somewhere else or restart his own operation from scratch he gave his buddy bates the chance to buy a  percent stake in the company and they started looking for a new location “i borrowed  from my dad and took the leap” bates says in the interim a friendly competitor named bob smith allowed the two to use his shear at night when his operation was closed and helped them get back on their feet smith later became a valued employee of heidtman steel in  the company opened its first major plant on toledo’s enterprise boulevard where it grew primarily into a slitting operation by the early s when the energy crisis hit automakers began looking for ways to design lighter more fuelefficient vehicles they needed processors that could handle the new highstrength lowalloy steels being developed by the mills spotting an opportunity heidtman invested in the proper equipment and soon began to specialize in highstrength material “one customer made bumpers for the ford pickup truck we figured out a way to slit the diamond plate used on the top of each bumper it sounded like a machine gun going off every time the knives hit a diamond but we did it” bates said that was the first of many diverse applications the company still services today “ford motor co is now our largest customer they are the number one car company in the us today we feel very good about that” he adds bates recollects how timid he was in his early days as a salesman a sharp contrast from the talkative and confident individual he is today hoping to find a mill that would sell to them directly bill heidtman instructed bates to call on mclouth steel “i was really shy at that time i just didn’t feel comfortable talking to people i drove up to mclouth never got out of the car then drove back and told bill ‘they wouldn’t see me’” a couple weeks later heidtman told him to go try again knowing his fib would not hold up indefinitely he sucked up the courage and approached the mill sales manager who turned him away emptyhanded “the third time i called on him he threw a list of excess prime material at me i said ‘we’ll take it’” the material on the list was mostly high strength not the mild steel the company had been handling “what the hell are we going to do with this stuff” heidtman asked so the partners set out on a quest to find customers for this new kind of steel “that was our start by the end of the ’s if you wanted highstrength steel you either called a mill or you called heidtman” bates says in  john’s brother allan joined heidtman a quality control manager for ford motor co he brought a lot of technical expertise to the company and ultimately ended up as its chief operating officer allan passed away in  from brain cancer today the allan w bates automotive and technical center in gibraltar mich fondly bears his name by the late s the company had grown to about  employees and  million in sales out of the enterprise boulevard location seizing an opportunity to vertically integrate and improve customer service heidtman installed its own continuous hydrochloric pickling line in  the pickler in erie mich just north of toledo is one of six the company operates today in  when bill heidtman decided to retire bates bought out his interest and took control of the company about the same time bates formed a joint venture with national material corp and its founder cyrus tang their venture national galvanizing inc was the first heavygauge continuous galvanizing line owned by a service center “everyone else at that time had to dip parts to galvanize them we were selling hotroll to chrysler and they wanted to make parts from hotrollbased galvanized coils so we engineered and built that galv line in a year” bates says the partnership with tang remains strong today in the intervening decades tang industries has grown into a multibillion dollar global industrial empire “we started it with a handshake and we’ve never had a problem we like partnerships if you have the right partner if you need an attorney for your partnership you’ve got the wrong partner” bates says heidtman also claims to be the first service center to adopt a milladjacent strategy opening up processing centers next door to nucor’s crawfordsville minimill in  and steel dynamics’ butler ind minimill in  today it also has facilities adjacent to arcelormittal’s mill in cleveland us steel’s mill in granite city ill and north star blue scope’s mill in delta ohio slated to begin operations in second quarter  is a new location in east chicago ind near electric coating technologies a major electrogalvanizer “the advantage is logistics and moving metal a shorter distance it costs almost nothing to get the product from the mill it’s all about shipping net weight” says tim berra heidtman’s president a significant amount of heidtman’s volume comes from toll processing the majority of it for mills that sell directly to the auto industry berra explains “we develop an interdependent relationship with them we are not seen as just a customer they rely on us for worldclass pickling and slitting and we count on them for highquality steel delivered on time it’s a mutually beneficial partnership” influencing steel’s dynamics what bates characterizes as “the most important thing that ever happened to heidtman steel” began with a chance encounter at a ford event bates found himself seated next to leonard rifkin of omnisource corp a scrap processor and the two had a spirited discussion about opportunities in steelmaking a couple months later out of the blue rifkin invites bates to a meeting in indianapolis “in walks keith busse mark millett and dick teets who were the original partners in steel dynamics the rest is history” says bates who was invited to join the partnership “sdi is one of the most profitable mills in the us every year i am still on the board a major shareholder and keith mark and dick are still dear friends” their concept was simple following a minimill model much like that pioneered at nucor omnisource would provide raw material busse millett and teets the steelmaking expertise and bates the initial distribution heidtman committed to purchasing  tons per month from the new mill “it would have been difficult for them to get financing without the guaranteed offtake agreement from heidtman” bates says “they felt that we owned the highstrength market and brought a good reputation to sdi” bain capital and ge credit provided financing heidtman’s strong cash position and its equity in steel dynamics helped it weather the great recession in  and  like most companies heidtman saw its orders plummet in late  when the bubble burst “two of our biggest customers chrysler and gm were not building cars for awhile a lot of tier  suppliers went into bankruptcy it was very difficult” bates says during the recession heidtman’s sales plunged from a peak of  tons in fiscal  to a trough of  tons in  a decline of  percent by fiscal  ended march  its sales had rebounded to about  tons the company forecasts annual growth of  percent for the next two years—still short of prerecession levels not counting intracompany sales “as a private company we had to manage the financial side it wasn’t easy” says mark ridenour heidtman’s chief financial officer “we had layoffs for the first time in the history of the company we lost millions in bad debt to customers that went bankrupt our shares in sdi were our piggybank we made it through thanks to our good relationships with our suppliers our bankers our customers and our employees i don’t ever want to go through it again” heidtman is a different company than it was prior to the downturn berra says it’s somewhat smaller now heidtman sold its crawfordsville ind facility to nucor in summer  and also divested its metallurgical coal mining venture in  it is now tightening its focus on its core business carbon flatroll and striving to maximize efficiencies in all aspects of the operation recovery is not all about generating tons but profitable tons he adds “we’ve regained the type of business we wanted to regain” meanwhile the “rightsizing” of the service center industry is an ongoing process bates and his management team say the fallout from the recession still lingers as customers and competitors alike continue to struggle “the only part of the steel business that is really going strong right now is the flatroll business largely because of automotive” bates notes which is right in heidtman’s wheelhouse heidtman is now moving into advanced and ultrahighstrength steels as the mills develop new products “that’s one reason we are expanding into the east chicago area” he adds “to be located right next to ect which coats advanced highstrength steels we are really excited about operating in chicago” such partnerships are good for heidtman and the industry at large berra says “we have an overcapacitized industry we don’t need to keep building and adding capacity so we are forming joint ventures or geographical alliances with other processors” the management team emphasizes that heidtman’s dedicated employees deserve a lot of credit for the company’s success nearly  percent have been with the company for over  years all total heidtman’s workforce brings nearly  total years of seasoning to the job “we have a lot of experience here people don’t leave our turnover is very low” says ridenour “there is a real cando atmosphere here we are great at the impossible” says mike kruse vice president of marketing “when you talk about our culture you have to mention the words pride and passion we have a very passionate group of employees who feel they are a part of the bates family” berra adds bates says heidtman will remain a familyowned firm until he retires or dies—two events he claims will happen simultaneously succession plans are in place to honor that family legacy currently three of his children are actively employed daughter darlene dotson son john bates jr and daughter lindsay bates heidtman employees also own a significant portion of the company though heidtman is part of a consolidating industry bates says he has no interest in ever merging with another service center organization or taking the company public its independence makes the company nimble and allows it to take risks without having to answer to outside shareholders despite the profound change heidtman has experienced from its founding as a small shop  years ago to a market leader today the basics of the service center business are basically the same bates says “you have to have the best product the best delivery the best relationships and the lowest costs that has not changed a lot” berra who oversees most of heidtman’s daytoday operations today as company president admires the insight and fortitude his boss has displayed throughout his career “it’s not just that john was in the right place at the right time the innovative side of him can spot a need and recognize an opportunity in order to be successful you have to have the insight to recognize the opportunity first but then you have to have the guts to do something about it”   what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger not every deal was a complete success for heidtman steel admits a candid john bates for instance there was heidtman’s brief attempt to get into the mill business in the mid s automotive customers were pushing for stricter quality standards yet the steel they were getting from the mills often was subpar in regard to thickness tolerances gauge control was very inconsistent bates and his team at heidtman thought they could provide a better product so they decided to build a new hotstrip mill in toledo the concept was to purchase slabs from a mill and roll them to precise tolerances for automotive customers one domestic mill committed to selling heidtman steel slabs putting the processor in the coil business “this was not going to be a minimill like nucor crawfordsville a few years later but a lowcost rolling mill using slabs” bates recalls “we had put  million into engineering and equipment and leased property on the waterfront in toledo when all of a sudden the mill tells us the slab deal is off their representative supposedly was not authorized to sell us slabs” heidtman still has a lease on the property which is used for corporate offices another memorable miss was the paint line the company operated for about three years in the late s primarily to serve metal building customers “it was a new technology instead of dipping the coil we put a spray coating on it and dried it with an infrared drier it made a beautiful product but it cost three times more to produce than the way other people did it” bates says for heidtman these misses are part of the process that has made the company what it is today viewed more as evolution than failure “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” says heidtman president tim berra “john bates tried to start a finishing mill of his own and ends up owning part of steel dynamics the concept of a better mill was already going through his mind” “if you have a team of people that believe in what you are trying to do it’s worth the risk” bates says “if you don’t take that first step you can never take the second” if you have a team of people that believe in what you are trying to do its worth the risk if you dont take that first step you can never take the second heidtman ceo john bates   june  thanks for making me feel like family more
