good clients having to wonder whether you’ll have enough money to pay this month’s bills is hard especially when you live in a crazy expensive city like vancouver i have recently been looking into premium freelancing sites such as toptal and codeable these sites offer companies looking to hire access to a prequalified group of toptier talent codeable claims only the top  of applicants are accepted while toptal claims the top  however what can they offer a freelancer like myself wanting to use their service to find work from codeable a steady income with a guaranteed minimum hourly rate 0hr working with great loyal clients being a part of our reputable expert community toptal offers little in the way of information for freelancers it is primarily geared towards companies looking to hire talent they both have a vigorous application process including interviews testing code reviews etc so it looks like they both do their due diligence in terms of screening i attended a session at wordcamp vancouver by nathan ello called figure freelancing in which he went into detail about how he was able to bring his freelance income to the magic figure level he mentioned during the talk that he works primarily with codeable and had high praise for the platform a referral like this by a prominent wordpress developer is definitely one plus for their service a quick google search led me to some blog posts by other developers who have worked with toptal my experience with toptal drakuwa on wordpresscom my experience with toptal doug sparling from these and a few others the freelancers who took the time to write about their experience seemed satisfied i’ll be submitting my application to both of these services and we’ll see how things go if you have any experience with these or other premium freelance services please leave a comment wordcamp vancouver wrapup this past saturday marked a couple of firsts i attended my first wordcamp and i also gave my first talk at a tech
